      <br/>
      Method and apparatus for monitoring the present location of a person ("confinee") who is to be confined to a designated site, which site can have a diameter as small as a few meters or as large as several kilometers.
      <br/>
      The present location of the confinee is checked at selected time intervals with time periods ranging from one second to thousands of seconds, as desired.
      <br/>
      The confinee wears a location-determining ("LD") unit that receives electromagnetic signals that contain information allowing determination of the present location of the LD unit, and thus of the confinee, from three or more non-collinear outdoor LD signal sources and from three or more non-collinear indoor LD signal sources.
      <br/>
      The indoor LD signal sources may be radiowave transmitters.
      <br/>
      The outdoor LD signal sources may be transmitters for a Loran, Omega, Decca, Tacan, JTIDS Relnav or PLRS or similar ground-based system, or transmitters for a satellite positioning system, such as OPS or GLONASS.
      <br/>
      The relative phases or transmission times for the signals from each indoor LD signal source are determined and provided for the LD unit.
      <br/>
      The present location or change location of the LD unit is determined and compared with the permitted site location coordinates at a sequence of selected times to determine if the confinee is present at the site at such times.
      <br/>
      The LD unit issues an alarm signal if the confinee is not on the site and has not arranged beforehand to leave the permitted site for a selected time interval, The permitted site can be redefined, for a selected time interval, to include the first permitted site, a second permitted site and a corridor extending between the first and second permitted sites for a selected time interval, after which the permitted site can be changed again to include only the first or the second permitted site or a portion thereof.
      <br/>
      This allows the confinee to temporarily leave the original permitted site to seek medical attention or to attend to other needs, or to be moved permanently to the second site.
      <br/>
      The permitted site can be redefined at any time and for any subsequent time interval.
      <br/>
      One or more exclusion sites can be designated where the confinee is not permitted to go at any time.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This application is a continuation in part of an earlier-filed patent application entitled "Flexible Site Arrestee Monitoring," U.S. application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/171,228, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,568,119. This invention relates to monitoring the location and movement of site arrestees or confinees in an arbitrarily defined area, using radiowave communications.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The annual growth of the population of prisoners within the state and federal prisons in the United States has averaged several percent per year for the last ten years.
      <br/>
      The total number of such prisoners exceeds 2 million.
      <br/>
      All felons convicted and sentenced for a crime are placed in one or another of these prisons, with little regard for the severity of the crime, whether the crime involved actual or threatened violence, or whether the crime was primarily directed against property.
      <br/>
      This approach has several disagreeable consequences.
      <br/>
      First, the federal and state governments cannot build prisons fast enough to accommodate the growing prison population, and some courts are treating prison overcrowding as a violation of the prisoners' constitutional rights.
      <br/>
      Second, the amount of fully-burdened money spent on new prisons, estimated to be $80,000-100,000 per cell, is now a substantial part of the annual budget of state and federal governments.
      <br/>
      The State of California now spends more on incarceration of prisoners than on education of University of California students.
      <br/>
      Third, prisons must be built in relatively large sizes to obtain economies of scale so that siting of such prisons is often a problem.
      <br/>
      Fourth, the average cost of providing room, board, recreation and security for a prisoner is now estimated to be about $24,000 per year, and this cost increases with inflation.
      <br/>
      Fifth, prisoners convicted of non-violent crimes are usually thrown together with, and are often preyed upon by, prisoners convicted of violent crimes.
      <br/>
      Sixth, prisoners who might still work and make a positive contribution to society are discouraged or prevented from doing so because of a lack of facilities needed for such activities.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Some workers have conceived other ways of handling some of these problems by providing portable jail or prison cells or by providing monitoring tags that must be worn by the prisoners.
      <br/>
      One early device, disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,478,344, issued to Schwitzgebel et al, provides an omni-directional transceiver carried on the waist and an encoded oscillator, uniquely identifying the wearer, that communicates with the transceiver.
      <br/>
      An inmate or other supervised person in a mental institution or a prison wears this apparatus, which receives signals transmitted from a nearby central station that interrogates the wearer's unit concerning the location of the unit.
      <br/>
      The unit responds automatically.
      <br/>
      The method used for determination of location of the wearer's unit might be triangulation, which would require provision of at least three additional stations.
      <br/>
      Miller, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,495,496, discloses a-similar approach for locating miners working a in different shafts in a mine.
      <br/>
      Engira, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,153,584, discloses a similar approach for monitoring the location and status of ambulatory electrocardiogram patients in a medical facility.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Schlatter et al, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,722,152, disclose a portable jail cell that can be transported as a disassembled unit and then assembled and used within a jail or other designated security area.
      <br/>
      The cell walls and floor are made of metal and concrete, and two or more such portable cells can be placed side-by-side to conserve space.
      <br/>
      A portable cell must be placed within a jail or other secured facility to provide overall security.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In U.S. Pat. No. 4,571,904, Kessler et al disclose a patient enclosure, to be placed within and form part of a hospital room, that operates similarly to the portable cell of Schlatter et al.
      <br/>
      The patient enclosure is a separate room-within-a-room that is cleared of all furniture except the patient's bed, may include padding on the walls, and is intended to be used for patients with brain damage who must be protected from further injury by their own actions.
    </p>
    <p num="7">A location determination (LD) unit for a vehicle, relying on radiowave triangulation signals provided by an Automatic Direction Finder system, is disclosed by Wanka in U.S. Pat. No. 4,596,988. The on-board unit transmits its present location when the LD unit is interrogated by receipt of a signal broadcast by a central station, which can track the locations of several vehicles simultaneously.</p>
    <p num="8">
      Gray et al disclose a vehicle security and tracking system in U.S. Pat. No. 4,651,157. An LD unit, installed in a vehicle to be tracked, receives Loran-C signals and transmits the information in these signals, unprocessed, to a central station for determination of the vehicle's present location by triangulation.
      <br/>
      The system also monitors the values of selected parameters associated with vehicle operation and transmits an advisory signal to the central station if the value of one or more of these parameters lies outside its permitted range.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A personnel monitoring system that uses the telephone for communication between the person whose location is monitored and a central station is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,747,120, issued to Foley.
      <br/>
      The monitored person wears a bracelet and is occasionally required to take some action, such as insertion of the bracelet into a decoder that transmits a coded verification signal to the central station over a dedicated phone line that is enabled only when used.
      <br/>
      The system is provided with some means that does not allow transmission of false signals to the central station.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Watson, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,777,477, discloses a location surveillance system for a designated person, such as a parolee, that detects departure of that person from a designated site, such as an enclosed building.
      <br/>
      The person wears a sensor-transmitter, a wrist band and a current-carrying loop wrapped around the body.
      <br/>

      U.S. Pat. No. 4,918,425, issued to Greenberg et al, discloses a monitoring system for a selected object, such as a vehicle, a person, an animal or an inanimate object.
      <br/>
      The selected object carries a transponder, with a unique identification code, that receives an interrogation signal at regular intervals, specifying its ID code, from a base station, which may be portable.
      <br/>
      The transponder then transmits a coded signal that is received by the base station, indicating that the transponder is close enough to have received and understood the interrogation signal.
      <br/>
      If the base station fails to receive the coded signal responding to its own interrogation signal within a specified time interval, the base station can cause a search to be initiated for the object, which may be a child.
      <br/>
      A similar system, which relies upon a network of stations to receive and forward the response signal to a designated base station, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,051,741, issued to Wesby.

      A house arrest monitoring system, using an identification tag that is worn near the flesh of the prisoner under house arrest, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,918,432, issued to Pauley et al.
      <br/>
      A tag worn by a prisoner transmits a signal having a unique code portion that identifies that prisoner so that several prisoners can be sequestered at one site.
      <br/>
      A field monitoring device (FMD), connected to a telephone line, receives and analyzes these transmitted signals and determines if (1) the prisoner is present at the site and (2) the tag is being continuously worn near the flesh of the wearer.
      <br/>
      If one or the other of these conditions is not true, the FMD communicates this information to a central processing unit (CPU), using the telephone line, and personnel at this CPU respond accordingly.
      <br/>
      The intensity of the signal transmitted by the tag may be improved using a signal repeater to communicate with the FMD.
      <br/>
      One CPU is used to monitor the locations of prisoners at one or several house arrest sites.
      <br/>
      The presence of a prisoner at the site is determined primarily by receipt of a tag signal having that prisoner's code included.
      <br/>
      A prisoner, wearing a tag, could move away from the site a considerable distance before the FMD would sense this, because the location of a tag cannot be determined with much accuracy.

      In response to receipt of a radiowave request, the transponder transmits a signal to a field monitoring device (FMD), identifying the wearer and including information sensed by the body sensor, such as heart rate, skin perspiration, muscle movement, etc.
      <br/>
      The FMD is located near where the monitored person should be and periodically transmits to a central station body information on, and the location of, the monitored person.

      The tests are intended to determine the identity of a prisoner, whether a given person is present or absent at the site, and certain characteristics of the conduct of a prisoner at the site (e.g., a prisoner's sobriety).

      A personnel monitoring tag with tamper detection for a person under house arrest is disclosed by Bower et al in U.S. Pat. No. 5,075,670. The tag contains a small radio transmitter that intermittently broadcasts a relatively weak signal that is received by a receiver located on the assigned site.
      <br/>
      If the arrestee leaves the site, the broadcast signal will become weaker and eventually will not be received by the receiver, in which event an alarm can be given.

    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="41">
      These needs are met by the invention, which provides a system and associated apparatus that allows a monitored person (MP) to be confined to a designated site outside a conventional confinement facility for at least a portion of the MP's confinement time.
      <br/>
      The MP wears a location-determining and motion-sensing (LMD) unit that preferably cannot be removed, except by specially trained persons, and that provides information on the MP's present location coordinates and/or present velocity coordinates at each of a sequence of time intervals that may vary in length from a fraction of a second to hundreds or thousands of seconds, as desired.
      <br/>
      This LMD unit receives radiowave or similar signals that provide information used to determine the present location and/or sense motion of the LMD unit, and the wearer thereof.
      <br/>
      The inaccuracy of this present location information is preferably no greater than 1-5 meters and may be as small as a few centimeters.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      In one embodiment, the appliance processes this information, determines this present location and/or present motion, and transmits this information to a central station that monitors the present location and/or present motion of one or many MPs, each of whom may be located at a single site or at separate sites.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the LMD unit does not process this information, or partly processes this information, and transmits this information to the central station for further processing to determine the present location of the MP.
      <br/>
      The central station compares the present location and/or motion of the MP with the designated site and its boundary to determine if the MP is staying on this site, or if the MP has crossed the site boundary into another region.
      <br/>
      If the MP has moved off the site without prearranged permission, or if no intelligible LMD response signal is received at the proper times, the central station promptly notifies the appropriate authorities.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the central station can activate some portion of the appliance worn by the MP and temporarily disable the MP until the authorities arrive.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      If the MP moves inside and remains within a building or other structure that interferes with receipt of LMD signals by the LMD unit, the MP may be permitted to move within an approximate sphere of a selected radius dsep without requiring further location or velocity monitoring by the LMD unit.
      <br/>
      The LMD unit then enters a sleep mode.
      <br/>
      The sphere radius dsep may be chosen large enough to include a portion of or all of the structure.
      <br/>
      When the MP moves beyond this sphere or moves outside the structure, the MP is required to "check in" or to otherwise re-activate or re-initiate receipt and analysis of LMD signals by the LMD unit.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Optionally, the LMD unit contains a tamper detection circuit that transmits a distinguishable alarm if tampering is detected.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the appliance transmits the present location information in an encrypted form that cannot be read or interfered with by the MP, except by making the transmitted signal unintelligible and thus triggering an alarm at the central station.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The MP is permitted, by arrangement beforehand, to travel to a specified secondary site that is beyond the boundary of the primary site of confinement, using a well-defined corridor that connects the primary and secondary sites, when the MP attends to personal needs, such as visits to a physician, a dentist, a food store or the like.
      <br/>
      In this instance, the MP is given a selected time interval tdepart &lt;= t &lt;= treturn in which to travel within the corridor to the secondary site, transact appropriate business at the secondary site, and return to the primary site using the corridor.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The LMD unit carried on the MP's body or garments may receive FM subcarrier signals from a plurality of three or more subcarrier transmitters with known locations and determinable phase relationships.
      <br/>
      The phase differences of the sub-carrier signals provide information to determine the present location of the LMD unit.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The LMD unit may alternatively, or also, receive radiowave signals from an "outdoor LMD system", including a plurality of three or more ground-based location determination signal sources, such as Loran, Omega, Decca, Tacan, JTIDS Relnav, Personal Location Reporting System (PLRS), or including a plurality of satellite-based location determination signal sources (SATPS), such as GPS or GLONASS, with known locations and determinable phase relationships, using phase analyses similar to analyses used for the FM subcarrier signals.
      <br/>
      Other sets of three or more radiowave signals with known source locations and selected signal parameters may also be used.
      <br/>
      The FM subcarrier unit or the outdoor LMD unit may be used by itself, or these two units may be integrated in an LMD unit that receives FM subcarrier signals and outdoor LMD signals.
      <br/>
      The central station or another station can serve as a reference station and the appliance can serve as a mobile station in a differential positioning mode using the outdoor LMD system.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF BEST MODE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="49">
      FIG. 1 illustrates practice of one embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      A monitored person (MP) 11 lives and works at or is confined to a designated site or region R having a boundary  DELTA R. The MP 11 wears a portable location determination and motion sensing (LMD) unit 13.
      <br/>
      The LMD unit 13 may receives FM signals from three or more FM signal sources 15, 17, 19, and 21 (optional) that have locations with known location coordinates (xm, ym, zm) for FM signal source no. m (m=15, 17, 19, 21).
      <br/>
      The FM subcarrier signal of interest may have an associated frequency of about fc +- 19 kHz, where fc is the FM carrier frequency that lies in the range 88-108 MHz.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a higher order displacement from the carrier frequency (e.g., fc +- 38 kHz or fc +- 57 kHz) may be used.
      <br/>
      The sources of these FM subcarrier signals may be a plurality of FM broadcasting stations located in or near the site R. In this event, the subcarrier signals are obtained by filtering the total FM signals (carrier signal plus message signal plus subcarrier signal) to remove all but a subcarrier signal of a chosen frequency.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      FIG. 2 illustrates the full FM signal spectrum and the useful portion of the signal that remains (e.g., fc +- 19 kHz) after frequency filtering.
      <br/>
      FM subcarrier signals can be used for all monitoring of the present location of the MP 11, inside and outside buildings and other structures.
      <br/>
      This approach has the advantage of simplicity: only one set of radiowaves is used for location determination.
      <br/>
      FM signals are less subject to noise and other interference than are other signals, such as AM signals.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, an FM subcarrier signal can be replaced by an AM subcarrier signal, which is obtained by filtering an AM signal at a frequency displaced from the AM carrier frequency by a relatively small amount.
      <br/>
      More generally, determination of the present location and/or present velocity of the MP 11 can be made using a portable LMD unit that receives and analyzes LMD radiowave signals transmitted from three or more LMD signal sources.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      An LMD unit 13, shown in FIG. 3, that is carried by or attached to the MP 11 includes a location determination (LD) antenna 31, an LD signal receiver 33, a motion sensor 34 that issues motion sensing signals when the sensor is motionless (or when the sensor is in motion), an LMD signal receiver/processor 35 that receives and analyzes the LD signals and the motion sensor signals, a signal transceiver 36 connected to the processor, and power supply 37, for receiving certain LD radiowave signals from one or more LD signal source 38A, 38B, 38C and/or 38D.
      <br/>
      Information from these LD signals and from the motion sensor signals may be transmitted, unprocessed, by the transceiver 36 to a central processing station 39, located at or near the site R, to allow determination of the present location coordinates and/or the present velocity coordinates of the MP 11 periodically (e.g., second-by-second, or more or less often, if desired).
      <br/>
      In a first mode of operation of the LMD unit 13, all signal processing occurs at the central station, and the LMD signal processor 35 may be deleted.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the LD signals received by, and the motion sensing signals generated by, the LMD unit 31 may be partly or fully processed by the LMD signal processor 35 to partly or fully determine the present location and possible motion of the LMD unit.
      <br/>
      This processed information may be transmitted to the central station 39 for final determination of the present location and/or motion of the MP 11.
      <br/>
      The motion sensor 34 is optionally detachable from the remainder of the LMD unit 31.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      If the MP 11 is outdoors or is within any building or other structure that is not electromagnetically isolated, the LMD signals may have any frequency, and GPS, GLONASS, Loran, Omega, Decca, Tacan, JTIDS Relnav, PLRS, FM subcarrier signals, or other radiowave signals may be used.
      <br/>
      If the MP 11 is within an electromagnetically isolating structure, FM subcarrier signals may often still be received within the structure without disabling signal attenuation or signal distortion.
      <br/>
      However, the invention does not require that LD signals be receivable within or near an electromagnetically isolating structure; outdoor LD signals can also be used with the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the invention uses FM subcarrier signals emitted by three or more spaced apart FM signal sources 15, 17 and 19, positioned at known locations in the community, together with an FM signal monitor (and, optionally, source) 21 that is also located at a known position.
      <br/>
      If the FM signal monitor 21 also serves as a source, this source is preferably separated by a large distance from a plane P(15,17,19) passing through the locations of the other three FM station antennas.
      <br/>
      In this instance, the source 21 may be located on a very tall tower, for example, relative to the heights of the transmitting antennas of the other FM sources 15, 17 and 19.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The FM signal monitor 21: (1) receives the FM subcarrier signals transmitted by the other FM stations 15, 17 and 19; (2) determines the relative phases of these subcarrier signals at their respective sources, using the known distances of the antennas of each of the other FM stations 15, 17 and 19 from the FM monitor 21; (3) transmits a signal on another selected frequency that advises any FM subcarrier signal receiver of these relative phases; and (4) optionally transmits its own FM subcarrier signal, with a phase determined by an optional selected linear combination of the phases of the other three FM subcarrier signals, or determined independently of the other three phases.
      <br/>
      The MP 11 wears the portable LMD unit 13 and is assigned an identifying indicium that is included in any transmission by that LMD unit to the central station 39.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the central station 39 can continually or periodically advise a communications, command and control (C3) center of the location and/or velocity of the MP 11, or of the locations and/or velocities of several such persons.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The LMD unit 13 serves as a mobile station that receives the FM subcarrier signals and optionally transmits phase information for each of these subcarrier signals to the central station 39 for (further) processing and analysis.
      <br/>
      The central station 39 has a known location relative to each of the FM signal sources 15, 17, 19 and FM signal monitor 21 and can determine the phase of each these FM signals relative to a selected phase reference or can determine the FM signal source phases relative to each other at a selected time.
      <br/>
      One advantage of use of relatively low frequency FM signals, such as fc +- 19 kHz, is that such signals are attenuated and/or distorted less, in passing through walls, floors and ceilings of normal buildings, than are higher frequency radiowave signals, such as AM signals.
      <br/>
      In normal circumstances, the relative phases of the FM signal sources 15, 17, 19 and FM monitor 21 would not change, or would change at most a few times in any 24-hour period.

      If the phases  PHI m are known, the distances dm can be determined from Eq. (2).
      <br/>
      From any three physically realistic three distances, such as d15, d17 and d19, two candidate location coordinate triples (x,y,z) can be found that, in principle, satisfy Eqs. (3) for measured distances dm (or phases  PHI m).
      <br/>
      Adding the distance dm of a fourth FM subcarrier signal source, such as 21, will, in principle, allow elimination of one of these two candidate triples so that only one location coordinate triple (x, y, z) remains for the present location of the LMD unit 13.
      <br/>
      In practice, this scheme will not work well if the four FM signal sources lie approximately in a plane or in a line and the present location of the LMD device 13 also lies close to or in that plane or that line.
      <br/>
      Preferably, one of the four FM signal sources, optional FM source 21, should be spaced far apart from the plane passing through the locations of any three other FM signal sources 15, 17 and 19.
      <br/>
      This separation distance is preferably at least ten percent of the maximum distance from the FM source 21 to the other FM sources 15, 17 and 19.
      <br/>
      This formalism can be used for FM signals and for AM signals.
      <br/>
      This formalism can also be used for electromagnetic signals of any frequency emitted by a ground-based distance measuring system, such as Loran, Omega, Decca,. Tacan, JTIDS Relnav or PLRS, or a Satellite Positioning System (SATPS), such as GPS or GLONASS, collectively referred to herein as an "outdoor LMD system."

    <p num="65">
      In one cycle of an FM subcarrier signal of frequency fm =fc,m +- 19 kHz (m=15, 17, 19, and optionally 21), an electromagnetic wave will move a distance equal to one wavelength  LAMBDA =c'/ OMEGA m, or about 15.8 kilometers (km) in a vacuum.
      <br/>
      Thus, the distance of the LMD device 13 from each FM signal source is known modulo 15.8 km. This distance ambiguity can be removed by initialization techniques.
      <br/>
      For example, if the designated site R has a diameter that is &lt;&lt;15.8, the present location of the MP 11 can be determined at one location on the site R, with one set of FM signal source phases, and can be used for all locations on or adjacent to the site R by determining phase changes for each signal relative to this initial location.
      <br/>
      That is, the phase  PHI m is initially determined at a time t=t0 for each FM or other location signal transmitter, using Eq. (2) or another suitable relation to determine the absolute or relative phases of the signals arriving from the signal source m at a known location, the initial location of the MP 11 on the site R.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Assume that FM signal source number m (m=15, 17, 19, and optionally 21 ) has known coordinates (xm, ym, zm).
      <br/>
      From the determinable phase differences of the signals arriving from each FM source at a selected location with as-yet-undetermined coordinates (x,y,z) (such as the present location of the MP 11), source number m is determined to lie at a distance dm from the selected location.
      <br/>
      FM subcarrier signals, emitted from FM sources 15, 17, 19 and 21 (optional) with synchronized phases, would arrive at the selected location with time differences  DELTA tij or source-to-source phase difference  DELTA  PHI ij (i not equal to j; i, j=15, 17, 19, 21) that are determined by
      <br/>
      DELTA  PHI ij =2 PI (di -dj)f/c'=f DELTA tij /c',  (4)

      <br/>
      The three phase differences  DELTA  PHI ij (i not equal to j; i,j=15, 17, 19) define three intersecting hyperboloids or similar quadratic surfaces, each having two sheets.
      <br/>
      In general, the common intersections of each of these three groups of sheets should define a point or segment of a curve, where the two points (or curve segments) I1 and I2 shown in FIG. 3 are mirror images of each other with respect to the plane P(15,17,19) defined by the coordinates (xi,yi,zi) of the ith transmitter of the FM subcarrier signals.
      <br/>
      A fourth FM subcarrier signal source 21 (optional), because it is displaced from and does not lie on the plane P(15,17,19), transmits FM subcarrier signals that have two distinct phase differences at the intersection points I1 and I2.
      <br/>
      This fourth FM subcarrier signal can thus distinguish between I1 and I2 and allow determination of the correct location coordinates (x,y,z) for the selected location.
      <br/>
      This assumes that the phases of the four FM subcarrier signals are synchronized, with zero phase differences or known phase differences between any two of these signals.
      <br/>
      In practice, each of the four FM subcarrier signal sources will have a phase that may drift with time or change abruptly at particular times.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Where the four FM subcarrier signals have different phases, these source phase differences  DELTA  PHI ij must be determined and removed before Eq. (4) can be used to determine the location coordinates (x,y,z) of the selected location.
      <br/>
      The phase differences  DELTA  PHI ij can be determined by providing an FM subcarrier signal monitor station 21 that receives the other three FM subcarrier signals (i=1, 2, 3 in this example) and determines the phase differences  DELTA  PHI i,21.
      <br/>
      The FM monitor 21 uses its knowledge of the separation distances between itself and the (other) FM subcarrier signal sources and of the measured signal phase differences at the monitor from the other three FM subcarrier signals.
      <br/>
      As noted above, the phase differences  DELTA  PHI i,21 may vary with time, through drift, abrupt change, or both.
      <br/>
      The FM signal monitor station then broadcasts the phase differences  DELTA  PHI i,21, preferably with a different carrier frequency than any FM subcarrier frequency, and these phase differences are received and stored and/or processed by a receiver at the LMD unit 13.
      <br/>
      This LMD unit 13 also receives the FM subcarrier signals and determines the "raw" or uncompensated phase differences  DELTA  PHI ij at its location (i, j=15, 17, 19).
      <br/>
      A signal processor associated with this receiver then forms the "true" or compensated phase differences

    <p num="69">
      This compensates for non-synchronization and possible drifting of the FM subcarrier signals transmitted by the four FM subcarrier signal sources.

      Use of an FM signal monitor, which does not otherwise participate in determination of the selected location coordinates (x, y, z), to determine the phase differences  DELTA  PHI ij (ij=15,17,19), is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,173,710 issued to Kelley et al, which is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      The FM source phase differences  DELTA  PHI ij can be measured using a digital phase-locked-loop at the additional FM receiver/transmitter, as disclosed in FIGS. 4-11 and the accompanying text in the Kelley et al patent.
      <br/>
      In the subject invention, the FM signal monitor 21 used for monitoring the source-to-source phase differences optionally provides a fourth FM subcarrier signal (j=21), and the phase differences of the other three FM subcarrier signals are determined relative to the phase of the FM subcarrier signal transmitted by the FM signal monitor 21.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      The FM signal monitor 21 can also serve as a reference station with accurately known location for differential position computations for determining the present location of the outdoor LMD signal antenna.
      <br/>
      Differential position techniques use the known location of the reference station to remove some of the errors contained in signals received by a mobile station, such as the MP 11, that is located within a few tens of kilometers from the reference station.
      <br/>
      GPS and differential GPS techniques are discussed in Tom Logsdon, The NAVSTAR Global Positioning System, Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1992, pp. 1-90, and differential Loran and differential Decca techniques are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,045,861, issued to Duffet-Smith.
      <br/>
      The information from these references is incorporated by reference herein.

      Thus, the FM signal monitor station 21 can include an outdoor LMD signal antenna and associated outdoor LMD signal receiver/processor, to receive the outdoor LMD signals and to determine any location error values contained in these signals by comparison of the calculated location with the known location of the reference station.
      <br/>
      The FM signal monitor 21 can also include a transmitter to transmit these error values to a receiver/processor at the outdoor LMD signal unit so that the calculated present location of the outdoor LMD signal antenna can be adjusted by removal of outdoor LMD signal errors that have been determined from the signals received at the FM signal monitor station 21 (which also serves as an outdoor LMD signal reference station).

      Compensation for outdoor LMD signal errors can be provided at the reference station 21 or at the outdoor LMD unit.

      The FM signals indicated in FIGS. 1 or 3 may be used outside as well as inside a building or other structure to allow determination of the present location of the MP 11.

      Alternatively, FM signals may be used for inside-the-building location reporting and may be supplemented for outside-the-building location reporting by supplemental (outdoor) LMD signal sources.
      <br/>
      One suitable outdoor LMD signal source, illustrated in FIG. 4, is a Global Positioning System (GPS) or Global Navigation Orbiting System (GLONASS) or similar satellite-based location determination system (collectively referred to as GPS herein).
      <br/>
      A GPS includes a plurality of three or more visible, Earth-orbiting, non-geosynchronous satellites 41, 43, 45, 47 that each transmit a continuous, distinguishable electromagnetic signal that is received by a GPS antenna 49 and associated GPS signal receiver/processor 50 on or near the Earth's surface.
      <br/>
      The GPS receiver/processor 50 determines the present location of the GPS antenna by suitable processing of three or more GPS signals received from the GPS satellites 41, 43, 45, 47.
      <br/>
      A GPS and a GLONASS are discussed in more detail below.
      <br/>
      Global Positioning System signals are available throughout the world, whereas FM signal reception is often limited to line-of-sight reception, with a representative maximum reception distance of about 50 kilometers.

      A Global Positioning System is discussed in detail in Tom Logsdon, op cit.

      Because the GPS signals use a high frequency carrier (above 1 GHz), these signals may be severely attenuated and/or distorted if such signals are received inside a building or other structure that is partly or fully electromagnetically isolating.
      <br/>
      For this reason, GPS or GLONASS signals would ordinarily be unsuitable for determination of the present location of an LD antenna that is positioned within such a building or similar structure.
      <br/>
      The invention avoids this difficulty by using signals issued by a motion sensor and signals issued by another signal generator when the MP is within or near an electromagnetically isolating structure.

      A Loran-C system relies upon a plurality of ground-based signal towers 51, 53, 55 and 57, preferably spaced apart 100-300 km, that transmit distinguishable electromagnetic signals that are received and processed by a Loran signal antenna 58 and Loran signal receiver/processor 59.

      A representative Loran-C system is discussed in Loran-C User Handbook, Department of Transportation, U.S. Coast Guard, Commandant Publication P16562.5, November 1992, which is incorporated by reference herein.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Loran-C signals use carrier frequencies of the order of 100 kHz and have maximum reception distances of the order of hundreds of kilometers.
      <br/>
      Loran-C signals (alone) can be used as the LD signals in the invention.
      <br/>
      The combined use of FM signals for location determination inside a building or similar structure plus Loran-C signals for location determination outside a building or similar structure can also provide a satisfactory LMD system in most urban and suburban communities.

    <p num="77">
      Other ground-based radiowave signal systems that are suitable for use as part of an LMD system include Omega, Decca, Tacan, JTIDS Relnav (U.S. Air Force Joint Tactical Information Distribution System), PLRS (U.S. Army Position Locaton and Reporting System) and ORBCOM.
      <br/>
      Most of these systems are summarized in Logsdon, op. cit., pp. 6-7 and 35-40.

    <p num="78">
      Other radiowave signals, such as emergency band signals in the frequency ranges 12.23-13.2 MHz, with suitable signal timing and a signal indicium included therein, can be used as a source of LMD signals for outdoors locations.
      <br/>
      For convenient reference, a satellite-based or ground-based location determination system, not including a system that uses FM subcarrier signals, that can be used to determine the location of an MP 11 over relatively long distances outside a building or other structure over the region R will sometimes be referred to as an "outdoor LMD system".
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      FIG. 6 is a flow chart of a procedure that can be used to determine the present location of the MP 11, if an FM subcarrier system is used for all location determinations inside and outside buildings and other structures in a region R. In step 60, the LMD system is activated and made ready to determine the present location and/or present motion of an MP 11.
      <br/>
      A central station or other interrogator transmits an interrogation signal (e.g., "Where are you?") in step 61, with an identifying label, tag or indicium attached that specifies the identified MP 11, or specifies the LMD unit 13 carried by that person.
      <br/>
      In step 62, each LMD unit determines if it is the LMD unit specified by the central station's interrogation signal.
      <br/>
      If a given LMD unit is not the specified unit, that LMD unit ignores this interrogation signal and recycles until receipt of the next interrogation signal.
      <br/>
      If the LMD unit carried by the identified MP 11 is the specified unit, this unit optionally determines if the FM subcarrier signals received are adequate to determine the present location of the LMD unit, in step 63.
      <br/>
      If the FM subcarrier signals are inadequate, the LMD unit optionally advises the central station of this circumstance, in step 64.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      Assuming that the FM subcarrier signals are adequate to determine the present location of the LMD unit or that steps 63 and 64 are absent in the flow chart of FIG. 6, the LMD unit responds, in step 65, by transmitting to the central station the last location fix computed by that LMD unit and any other relevant and available information on the identified arrestee's condition or circumstance.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the specified LMD unit responds by transmitting the requested information to the central station in a time slot (of length 10-200 msec) allocated for this response.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the responding LMD unit also includes a label, tag or other indicium identifying the responding LMD unit.
      <br/>
      The central station receives the response signal from the LMD unit and verifies that this signal carries the correct LMD unit indicium, in step 66.
      <br/>
      In step 67, the LMD unit processes, stores and/or visually or audibly displays information on the specified LMD unit present location and/or present velocity.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      The procedure shown in FIG. 6 would be followed irrespective of whether the LMD unit 13 is presently inside or outside a building or other structure, because only one LMD system is providing the LMD information.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the LMD unit can partly process the LD and motion sensor signals and can transmit this partly processed information to the central station 39 for further signal processing and determination of the LMD unit's present location.
      <br/>
      As a second alternative, the LMD unit can automatically retransmit, unprocessed, suitable information (timing, relative phases, etc.) that the LMD unit is receiving from each of the FM subcarrier signal sources and allow the central station to do all LMD signal processing.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      FIG. 7 is a flow chart of a procedure that can be used to determine the present location of each MP 11, where a combination of FM subcarrier signals and signals provided by an outdoor LMD system are used for location determination.
      <br/>
      The LMD system is activated in step 80.
      <br/>
      The central station interrogates a specified LMD unit by transmitting an interrogation signal with a label, tag or other indicium that identifies that LMD unit, in step 81.
      <br/>
      Each LMD unit receives this interrogation signal and determines if the interrogation signal is directed to that LMD unit, in step 82.
      <br/>
      If a given LMD unit is not the one specified by the interrogation signal, that LMD unit ignores the interrogation signal and recycles until the LMD unit receives another interrogation signal.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      If a given LMD unit is specified in the interrogation signal, that LMD unit automatically determines, in step 83 of FIG. 7, whether the LMD information should be provided by the outdoor LMD unit, by the FM subcarrier unit, or by neither, based upon the present location of that LMD unit and/or an indicium for each FM subcarrier signal and for each outdoor LMD signal that indicates which of the two signals is likely to provide the most accurate location under the circumstances.
      <br/>
      The indicium for each signal preferably is a measure of the signal robustness, such as signal strength, or the signal quality, such as signal-to-noise ratio.
      <br/>
      Use of such indicia is discussed in the co-pending patent applications entitled "Hybrid Location Determination System," U.S. application Ser.

      <br/>
      In some circumstances, neither the FM subcarrier signals nor the outdoor LMD signals may provide acceptable signals for location determination, and the LMD unit optionally advises the central station of occurrence of this circumstance, in step 87.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      If the LMD unit is located outside of and away from all buildings and structures, the LMD unit can use the outdoor LMD unit to provide LMD information on its present location and/or present velocity, as in step 84, or can use the FM subcarrier unit for this purpose.
      <br/>
      If the LMD unit is located inside a building or other structure or in another location that is inaccessible to outdoor LMD system signals, the FM subcarrier unit provides present location and/or present velocity information for the LMD unit, in step 85.
      <br/>
      If neither the FM subcarrier signals nor the outdoor LMD signals are adequate for location determination, the LMD system advises the central station of this, in step 86.
      <br/>
      In step 87, the LMD unit transmits to the central station its LMD information, unprocessed, partly processed or fully processed, to the central station, preferably including a first label, tag or other indicium that identifies the responding LMD unit and a second label, tag or other indicium indicating which, if any, of the two LMD systems has provided the LMD information.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the LMD unit can transmit the requested information to the central station in an allocated time slot (of length 10-200 msec) for this response.
      <br/>
      In step 88, the central station receives the information transmitted by the LMD unit, verifies the identity of the responding LMD unit, and determines which signal processing route to use, based in part on which LMD system has provided the LMD information.
      <br/>
      The central station processes, stores and/or visually or audibly displays the present location of the specified LMD unit, in step 89.

      FIG. 8 is a schematic view of a portable location determination unit 101 that may be used to practice the invention, where a combination of FM subcarrier signal system and an outdoor LMD system are used to determine location of an LMD unit in the region R. The LMD unit 101 includes an FM subcarrier LMD module 105, including an FM signal antenna 103 and receiver/processor 104, and an outdoor LMD module 109, including an outdoor LMD signal antenna 107 and receiver/processor 109.
      <br/>
      Each of the receiver/processors 104 and 108 is connected to an LMD unit interface and LMD unit controller 111.
      <br/>
      The controller 111 receives location signals or other indicator signals from each of the receiver/processors 104 and 108 and determines whether the FM subcarrier signal system or the outdoor LMD system, if any, will be selected to respond to receipt of an interrogation signal requesting location and/or velocity information from the LMD unit 101 or to determine the present location and/or present velocity of the LMD unit.
      <br/>
      This selection can be based upon the present location and/or present velocity of the LMD unit 101, or upon one or more signal conditions associated with the signals received and/or processed by each of the receiver/processors 104 and 108.
      <br/>
      The output signal (the selected location and/or velocity information signal) of the controller 111 is received by an LMD signal transmitter and antenna 113 and 115 and is transmitted to the central station that issued the interrogation signal.
      <br/>
      The LMD signal antenna and transmitter 113 and 115 can also serve as the antenna and receiver, respectively, that receive the interrogation signal transmitted by the central station.
      <br/>
      A power supply 117 supplies electrical power for at least one of the other components in the LMD unit 101.
      <br/>
      If the LMD unit 101 is not required to process any of the LMD signals received by either of the antennas 103 and 107, the two receiver/processors 104 and 108 can be deleted or simplified in the LMD unit.
      <br/>
      If only the FM subcarrier signals, or only the outdoor LMD signals, are used to determine the location of the LMD unit 101, the unused LMD antenna (103 or 107) and LMD receiver/processor (104 or 108) and part or all of the controller 111 can be deleted in the LMD unit 101.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      The location coordinates (x, y, z) of the LMD unit 101 carried by the MP 11 in FIG. 1 are now known.
      <br/>
      The location coordinates (x, y, z) of the LMD unit 101 are compared with the range of location coordinates of the region R and its boundary 6R, or with the range of location coordinates for any other region and its boundary in which the MP 11 is presently permitted to be.
      <br/>
      If the location coordinates (x, y, z) of the LMD unit 101 are within the site R bounded by the boundary  DELTA R, the receiver/processor 104 or 108 need take no action.
      <br/>
      If the location coordinates (x,y,z) lie elsewhere, the receiver/processor 104 or 108 transmits a silent radiowave alarm to the central station, indicating that the MP 11 has moved beyond the permitted region or site R and indicating the present location coordinates of the MP 11.
      <br/>
      The MP's movement within and outside the arrestee site R can thus be tracked by the central station.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      Alternatively, the present location information for the MP 11 can be transmitted, unprocessed or partly processed or fully processed, to the central station.
      <br/>
      The central station then completes any signal processing needed and determines whether the MP location coordinates (x,y,z) lie within the permitted site R or beyond the boundary  DELTA R. If these location coordinates lie beyond the permitted site boundary, or if the central station does not receive K consecutive LMD response signals from the LM unit 13 worn by the MP 11 (K a selected positive integer), the central station can transmit an alarm or otherwise alert the proper authorities to apprehend the MP.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      From time to time, the MP 11 may need to leave the site R for legitimate personal needs, such as a visit to his/her physician or dentist, a visit to a hospital for emergency or elective medical treatment, or to purchase food or other necessary personal items.
      <br/>
      In such instance, the site R can be expanded, temporarily, by prearrangement with the central station 39 to include a corridor C connecting the region R to the physician's office or other legitimate destination D for the MP, as indicated in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      When the MP 11 returns to the original site R after the prearranged visit, the corridor C and destination D are deleted and the permitted site again becomes the original site R. Alternatively,. the MP 11 can be moved from the first permitted site R to a destination site D, and the first-permitted site R and the corridor C can be deleted after the MP arrives at the new permitted site D. The width W of the corridor C may be as little as 30-40 feet, which is the width of an average residential street.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the width W may be much greater to allow for use of any of two or more alternative paths connecting the original site R to the destination D within the corridor C. The width W may vary along the corridor C. The movements of the MP 11 in the corridor C may be timed, and the MP may be required to move according to a selected time schedule, with time tolerances optionally included to compensate for reasonable but unexpected time delays in movement between the permitted site R and the destination site D.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The MP 11 may be under court order or other constraint to avoid certain exclusion regions R*, such as the homes and/or offices of persons also involved in crimes or other activities or the residences and work places of persons whom the MP might harass or injure.
      <br/>
      This could also include the home and/or office of an estranged spouse, victim or witness to commission of a crime in which the MP 11 was involved.
      <br/>
      In this instance, the permitted region R would be supplemented at the central station 39 by an exclusion region R*, surrounding and including each home, office and/or other facility that the MP must avoid at all times, as illustrated in FIG. 10. If the MP 11 leaves the site R and crosses a designated boundary  DELTA R* of the exclusion region R*, the receiver/processor 104 or 108 in the LMD unit 101 (FIG. 8) attached to the MP notifies the central station 39 of this development by another silent radiowave alarm, and police can be dispatched to intercept the arrestee.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the receiver/processor 104 or 108 in the LMD unit 101 could cause the MP to become disabled, for example by rendering the MP unconscious, using trans-dermal application across the MP's skin of a strong sedative or depressant.
      <br/>
      Trans-dermal application devices are available from Alza Corp., Palo Alto, Calif., and from other manufacturers in this field.

    <p num="90">
      FIG. 11 illustrates a low-power-consumption embodiment of the invention, in which an MP 131 carries an LMD unit 133, which includes an FM subcarrier signal module or an outdoor LD module 134, in combination a timer 135, an optionally detachable motion sensor 137, an optionally detachable localization signal generator 139 and an optionally detachable signal attribute sensor 141.
      <br/>
      When the MP 131 moves to within a building or other structure 143, the MP has a time interval of selected length  DELTA tmot to move to some location within the structure and to settle down or position the motion sensor, using elapsed time as measured by the timer 135.
      <br/>
      The timer need not be very accurate.
      <br/>
      The time interval length  DELTA tmot may be chosen in the range 5-120 sec, preferably in the range 30-60 sec.
      <br/>
      When the MP 131 "settles down," the MP positions the motion sensor 137 adjacent to the location where the MP has settled down, and this motion sensor quickly determines that it is not moving.
      <br/>
      After this motion sensor senses absence of motion within the time interval of length  DELTA tmot, the motion sensor 137 causes the LMD unit 133 to notify a central station 145 that the MP's motion has (temporarily) ceased.
      <br/>
      The LMD unit (except the motion sensor 137) then optionally enters a sleep mode, in which many but not all of its operations are temporarily curtailed and the power consumption is correspondingly reduced.
      <br/>
      At this time, the local signal generator 139 begins to continuously transmit a distinguishable localization signal having a selected frequency or combination of frequencies floc, and the signal sensor 141 begins to receive this localization signal and to measure a localization signal attribute A. The localization signal attribute value A is an approximate measure of the distance between the localization signal generator 139 and the signal sensor 141.
      <br/>
      The frequency or frequencies floc are chosen to be low enough that the localization signal suffers only modest attenuation in passing through or around the walls and other obstructions within the structure 143.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      The localization signal attribute A varies approximately inversely with the distance from the localization signal generator 139 to the signal sensor 141.
      <br/>
      Either the localization signal generator 139 or the signal sensor 141, but not both, is carried by the MP; the other of these two devices remains at a selected (preferably fixed) central location within or near the structure 143.
      <br/>
      When the signal sensor 141 senses that the localization signal intensity I, as received by this sensor 141, has dropped below a selected threshold Athr (or has increased above this threshold), corresponding to a selected approximate distance of separation dsep between the localization signal generator 139 and the signal sensor 141, the MP receives a second advisory signal and has a time interval of a selected length  DELTA tret to move to a location (preferably outside or away from the structure 143) where the MP's location can again be determined by the LMD unit 131.
      <br/>
      This embodiment allows the MP 131 to move around within the structure 143 after settling down, within an approximate sphere of radius approximately dsep centered at the present location of the motion sensor 137, without requiring the MP to "check in" with the monitoring authorities or to re-locate himself or herself using the LMD unit 133.
      <br/>
      If the MP fails to properly respond to the second advisory signal within the time interval of length  DELTA tret, the LMD unit 133 advises the central station 145 of this breach, and the central station responds accordingly.

    <p num="92">
      The localization signal sensor 139 and signal sensor 141 (only one is present here) and the timer 135 are shown, together with other LMD unit apparatus components that are necessary for practice of this embodiment, in FIG. 12. Most other components shown in FIG. 12 perform as in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      The controller 111 may be used to coordinate the procedures carried out by the timer 135, motion/velocity sensor 137, localization signal generator 139 and signal sensor 141.

      In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 11, no LD signals, such as FM subcarrier signals, that can be received inside an electromagnetically isolating structure need be transmitted, received or analyzed.

    <p num="94">
      The LMD (or LD) signals in this situation may consist solely of outdoor LMD signals transmitted by satellite-based signal sources, such as GPS, GLONASS, GOES, Iridium and Orbcom, or by ground-based signal sources, such as Loran, Omega, Decca, Tacan, JTIDS Relnav and the Personal Location Reporting System (PLRS), or may consist solely of FM subcarrier signals.
      <br/>
      Location and motion by the MP is accurately monitored outside any building or structure 143 that might interfere with receipt of outdoor LD signals.
      <br/>
      Within a building or structure 143 that would interfere with receipt of outdoor LD signals, the MP has a motion sensor 137 that senses motion but that is not required to determine the MP's location.
      <br/>
      The MP is assigned an approximate sphere of radius dsep within the structure 143, within which the MP can move without accounting for the MP's movements or activities.
      <br/>
      The LMD unit 133 (except the motion sensor 137) optionally enters a sleep mode, with substantially reduced electrical power. requirements, while the MP moves within this sphere.
      <br/>
      When the MP moves beyond this sphere, or outside or beyond the building or structure 143, the MP must take specified actions, within a selected time interval, such as 10-30 sec: (1) the MP must "check in" or re-activate or re-initiate the LMD unit 131 and facilitate continued monitoring of the MP's location and/or motion; and/or (2) the MP must move to a location such that the localization signal attribute A, as sensed by the signal attribute sensor 141, is again at least equal to the threshold attribute value Athr.
    </p>
    <p num="95">If the outdoor LD or LMD signals can be recognizably received within the structure 143 and analyzed, these outdoor LMD signals are optionally used to monitor the present location and/or motion of the MP within that structure or outside that structure.</p>
    <p num="96">
      FIG. 12 is a flow chart showing a suitable procedure for practice of the invention illustrated in FIG. 11. In step 151, the MP obtains one or more location fixes from an outdoor LD or LMD unit, from a location that is outside, or at least not shielded by, a building or other structure.
      <br/>
      In step 153, the LD unit determines whether its own location is outside the permitted site.
      <br/>
      If the answer in step 153 is "yes," the LD unit causes an alarm signal number 1 to be transmitted, in step 155, and proceeds to step 157.
      <br/>
      If the answer in step 153 is "no," the LD unit proceeds to step 157, where the LD unit determines whether it has lost LD signals.
      <br/>
      The LD unit can lose LD signals because the LD unit is inside or shielded by an electromagnetically isolating structure, such as a building, a large sign, a large tree or group of trees, or other similar obstacles to receipt of LD signals.
      <br/>
      If the answer in step 157 is "no," the system returns to step 151.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      The LMD unit includes a (preferably detachable) motion sensor that senses whether or not the LMD unit is substantially motionless.
      <br/>
      When the motion sensor senses that the LMD unit is substantially motionless for at least a selected initial time interval  DELTA tmot (usually a few tens or hundreds of milliseconds), the motion sensor begins issuing a stationarity signal, which signal continues only as long as the motion sensor remains substantially motionless.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      If the answer in step 157 is "yes," the system sets a motion counter value (m) for the motion sensor equal to an initial value, such as in =1,m in step 159.
      <br/>
      In step 161, the LD unit is activated (upon loss of receipt of the LD signals in step 157), a first time counter is activated and begins to accumulate a first time  DELTA t1, and the LD unit issues a first advisory signal, indicating that the MP has a selected (fixed) maximum accumulated time  DELTA t1,max (preferably=5-30 sec) in which to set down the motion sensor so that the motion sensor begins to issue its stationarity signal.
      <br/>
      In step 163, the LD unit determines if it has acquired (or reacquired) the LD signals so that the LD unit can again provide location fixes for itself.
      <br/>
      It the answer in step 163 is "yes," the system returns to step 151.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      If the answer in step 163 is "no," the system determines whether the motion sensor has begun to issue the stationarity signal, in step 165.

      If the answer in step 165 is "no," the system determines whether the first countdown time interval has expired, equivalent to  DELTA t1 &gt;=  DELTA t1,max, in step 167.
      <br/>
      If the answer in step 167 is "no," the system returns to step 163.
      <br/>
      If the answer in step 167 is "yes," the system transmits an alarm signal number 2, in step 169, and returns to step 161.

    <p num="100">
      If the answer in step 165 is "yes," the system proceeds to step 171, where the LD unit is deactivated, the first counter is reset to  DELTA t1 =0 and deactivated, and a localization signal generator is activated and begins to transmit a distinguishable signal.
      <br/>
      This distinguishable signal may be a very low frequency signal (&lt;10 kHz) so that this signal can readily pass through building walls and most similar structures.
      <br/>
      This distinguishable signal is received by a localization signal sensor, and a signal attribute having a signal attribute value A is determined by the sensor from the received distinguishable signal.
      <br/>
      The signal attribute value A may be measured signal intensity or some other value that is an approximate measure of the distance between the signal generator and the signal sensor.
      <br/>
      The signal generator or the signal sensor, but not both, is attached to the MP's body.
      <br/>
      Whichever of the signal generator and the signal sensor that is not attached to the MP's body is located at a selected location, preferably close to or within the structure that has caused loss of the LD signals in step 157.
      <br/>
      Thus, one of the signal generator and the signal sensor is mobile and moves with the MP within or near the structure.
      <br/>
      The LD sensor compares the signal attribute value A with a selected threshold value Athr.
      <br/>

      A Satellite Positioning System (SATPS) is a system of satellite signal transmitters, with receivers located on the Earth's surface or adjacent to the Earth's surface, that transmits information from which an observer's present location and/or the time of observation can be determined.
      <br/>
      Two operational systems, each of which qualifies as an SATPS, are the Global Positioning System and the Global Orbiting Navigational System.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      An SATPS antenna receives SATPS signals from a plurality (preferably four or more) of SATPS satellites and passes these signals to an SATPS signal receiver/processor, which (1) identifies the SATPS satellite source for each SATPS signal, (2) determines the time at which each identified SATPS signal arrives at the antenna, and (3) determines the present location of the SATPS antenna from this information and from information on the ephemeris for each identified SATPS satellite.
      <br/>
      The SATPS signal antenna and signal receiver/processor are part of the user segment of a particular SATPS, the Global Positioning System, as discussed in Logsdon, op. cit.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      The Global Positioning System (GPS) is part of a satellite-based navigation system developed by the United States Defense Department under its NAVSTAR satellite program.
      <br/>
      A fully operational GPS includes up to 24 satellites approximately uniformly dispersed around six circular orbits with four satellites each, the orbits being inclined at an angle of 55 (degree)  relative to the equator and being separated from each other by multiples of 60 (degree)  longitude.
      <br/>
      The orbits have radii of 26,560 kilometers and are approximately circular.
      <br/>
      The orbits are non-geosynchronous, with 0.5 sidereal day (11.967 hours) orbital time intervals, so that the satellites move with time relative to the Earth below.
      <br/>
      Theoretically, three or more GPS satellites will be visible from most points on the Earth's surface, and visual access to two or more such satellites can be used to determine an observer's position anywhere on the Earth's surface, 24 hours per day.
      <br/>
      Each satellite carries a cesium or rubidium atomic clock to provide timing information for the signals transmitted by the satellites.
      <br/>
      Internal clock correction is provided for each satellite clock.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      Each GPS satellite transmits two spread spectrum, L-band carrier signals: an L1 signal having a frequency f1=1575.42 MHz and an L2 signal having a frequency f2=1227.6 MHz. These two frequencies are integral multiples f1=154 f0 and f2=120 f0 of a base frequency f0=10.23 MHz. The L1 signal from each satellite is binary phase shift key (BPSK) modulated by two pseudo-random noise (PRN) codes in phase quadrature, designated as the C/A-code and P-code.
      <br/>
      The L2 signal from each satellite is BPSK modulated by only the P-code.
      <br/>
      The nature of these PRN codes is described below.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      One motivation for use of two carrier signals L1 and L2 is to allow partial compensation for propagation delay of such a signal through the ionosphere, which delay varies approximately as the inverse square of signal frequency f (delay  varies as f-2).
      <br/>
      This phenomenon is discussed by MacDoran in U.S. Pat. No. 4,463,357, which discussion is incorporated by reference herein.
      <br/>
      When transit time delay through the ionosphere is determined, a phase delay associated with a given carrier signal can be determined.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      Use of the PRN codes allows use of a plurality of GPS satellite signals for determining an observer's position and for providing navigation information.
      <br/>
      A signal transmitted by a particular GPS signal is selected by generating and matching, or correlating, the PRN code for that particular satellite.
      <br/>
      All PRN codes are known and are generated or stored in GPS satellite signal receivers carried by ground observers.
      <br/>
      A first PRN code for each GPS satellite, sometimes referred to as a precision code or P-code, is a relatively long, fine-grained code having an associated clock or chip rate of f0=10.23 MHz.A second PRN code for each GPS satellite, sometimes referred to as a clear/acquisition code or C/A-code, is intended to facilitate rapid satellite signal acquisition and hand-over to the P-code and is a relatively short, coarser-grained code having a clock or chip rate of 0.1 f0=1.023 MHz. The C/A-code for any GPS satellite has a length of 1023 chips or time increments before this code repeats.
      <br/>
      The full P-code has a length of 259 days, with each satellite transmitting a unique portion of the full P-code.
      <br/>
      The portion of P-code used for a given GPS satellite has a length of precisely one week (7.000 days) before this code portion repeats.
      <br/>
      Accepted methods for generating the C/A-code and P-code are set forth in the document GPS Interface Control Document ICD-GPS-200, published for the U.S. Government by Rockwell International Corporation, Satellite Systems Division, Revision B, Jul. 3, 1991, which is incorporated by reference herein.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      The GPS satellite bit stream includes navigational information on the ephemeris of the transmitting GPS satellite and an almanac for all GPS satellites, with parameters providing corrections for ionospheric signal propagation delays suitable for single frequency receivers and for an offset time between satellite clock time and true GPS time.
      <br/>
      The navigational information is transmitted at a rate of 50 Baud.
      <br/>
      A useful discussion of the GPS and techniques for obtaining position information from the satellite signals is found in Tom Logsdon, op. cit.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      A second configuration for global positioning is the Global Orbiting Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS), placed in orbit by the former Soviet Union and now maintained by the Russian Republic.
      <br/>
      GLONASS also uses 24 satellites, distributed approximately uniformly in three orbital planes of eight satellites each.
      <br/>
      Each orbital plane has a nominal inclination of 64.8 (degree)  relative to the equator, and the three orbital planes are separated from each other by multiples of 120 (degree)  longitude.
      <br/>
      The GLONASS circular orbits have smaller radii, about 25,510 kilometers, and a satellite period of revolution of 8/17 of a sidereal day (11.26 hours).
      <br/>
      A GLONASS satellite and a GPS satellite will thus complete 17 and 16 revolutions, respectively, around the Earth every 8 days.
      <br/>
      The GLONASS system uses two carrier signals L1 and L2 with frequencies of f1=(1.602+9k/16) GHz and f2=(1.246+7k/16) GHz, where k (=0, 1, 2, . . . , 23) is the channel or satellite number.
      <br/>
      These frequencies lie in two bands at 1.597-1.617 GHz (L1') and 1,240-1,260 GHz (L2').
      <br/>
      The L1' code is modulated by a C/A-code (chip rate=0.511 MHz) and by a P-code (chip rate=5.11 MHz).
      <br/>
      The L2' code is presently modulated only by the P-code.
      <br/>
      The GLONASS satellites also transmit navigational data at at rate of 50 Baud.
      <br/>
      Because the channel frequencies are distinguishable from each other, the P-code is the same, and the C/A-code is the same, for each satellite.
      <br/>
      The methods for receiving and analyzing the GLONASS signals are similar to the methods used for the GPS signals.
    </p>
    <p num="120">Reference to a Satellite Positioning System or SATPS herein refers to a Global Positioning System, to a Global Orbiting Navigation System, and to any other compatible satellite-based system that provides information by which an observer's position and the time of observation can be determined, all of which meet the requirements of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="121">
      A Satellite Positioning System (SATPS), such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), the Global Orbiting Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) or ORBCOM, uses transmission of coded radio signals, with the structure described above, from a plurality of Earth-orbiting satellites.
      <br/>
      A single passive receiver of such signals is capable of determining receiver absolute position in an Earth-centered, Earth-fixed coordinate reference system utilized by the SATPS.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      A configuration of two or more receivers can be used to accurately determine the relative positions between the receivers or stations.
      <br/>
      This method, known as differential positioning, is far more accurate than absolute positioning, provided that the distances between these stations are substantially less than the distances from these stations to the satellites, which is the usual case.
      <br/>
      Differential positioning can be used for survey or construction work in the field, providing location coordinates and distances that are accurate to within a few centimeters.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      In differential position determination, many of the errors in the SATPS that compromise the accuracy of absolute position determination are similar in magnitude for stations that are physically close.
      <br/>
      The effect of these errors on the accuracy of differential position determination is therefore substantially reduced by a process of partial error cancellation.
