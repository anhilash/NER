    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The present invention is generally directed to ink compositions, and processes thereof, and more specifically, the present invention is directed to processes for the preparation of colored aqueous ink compositions particularly suitable for use in ink jet printing processes, and especially thermal ink jet processes, and other similar processes, and wherein there is permitted minimal or no koagation, inks with suitable particle sizes, minimal intercolor bleed for the images developed, and wherein paper curl is minimized and image smearing is minimal, or avoided.
      <br/>
      The inks in embodiments of the present invention are comprised of an ink vehicle, colorant, and additives, and wherein the inks can be prepared by blending and optionally heating an epoxy monomer latex and preferably a copolymer of unsaturated epoxide monomers and ethylenically unsaturated monomers, wherein the ethylenically unsaturated monomers are ethylenically unsaturated esters, styrene functional monomers or olefinic acids, and a colorant dispersion, and wherein the latex can be prepared by emulsion polymerization using two surfactants of for example an anionic surfactant and a nonionic surfactant.

    <heading>PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="10">
      Ink jet printing can be considered a non-impact method that produces droplets of ink that are deposited on a substrate, such as paper or transparent film, in response to an electronic digital signal.
      <br/>
      Thermal or bubble jet drop-on-demand ink jet printers are useful as outputs for personal computers in the office and in the home.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In existing thermal ink jet printing, the print head typically comprises one or more ink jet ejectors, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,463,359, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, each ejector including a channel communicating with an ink supply chamber, or manifold, at one end and having an opening at the opposite end, referred to as a nozzle.
      <br/>
      A thermal energy generator, usually a resistor, is located in each of the channels a predetermined distance from the nozzles.
      <br/>
      The resistors are individually addressed with a current pulse to momentarily vaporize the ink and form a bubble which expels an ink droplet.
      <br/>
      As the bubble grows, the ink rapidly bulges from the nozzle and is momentarily contained by the surface tension of the ink as a meniscus.
      <br/>
      As the bubble begins to collapse, the ink remaining in the channel between the nozzle and bubble starts to move toward the collapsing bubble, causing a volumetric contraction of the ink at the nozzle and resulting in the separation from the nozzle of the bulging ink as a droplet.
      <br/>
      The feed of additional ink provides the momentum and velocity for propelling the droplet towards a print sheet, such as a piece of paper.
      <br/>
      Since the droplet of ink is emitted only when the resistor is actuated, this type of thermal ink jet printing is known as "drop-on-demand" printing.
      <br/>
      Other types of ink jet printing, such as continuous-stream or acoustic, are also known.

    <p num="12">Ink jet inks, and processes thereof are illustrated, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,840,674; 5,021,802; 5,041,161; 4,853,036; 5,124,718; 5,065,167 and 5,043,084, the disclosures of which are totally incorporated herein by reference.</p>

      In a single-color ink jet printing apparatus, the printhead typically comprises a linear array of ejectors, and the printhead is moved relative to the surface of the print sheet, either by moving the print sheet relative to a stationary printhead, or vice-versa, or both.
      <br/>
      In some systems, a relatively small printhead moves across a print sheet numerous times in swathes, much like a typewriter.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a printhead, which consists of an array of ejectors and extends the full width of the print sheet, may be passed once down the print sheet to give full-page images in what is known as a "full-width array" (FWA) printer.
      <br/>
      When the printhead and the print sheet are moved relative to each other, imagewise digital data is used to selectively activate the thermal energy generators in the printhead to permit the desired image to be created on the print sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      With the demand for higher resolution printers, the nozzles in ink jet printers are decreasing in size.
      <br/>
      Nozzle openings are typically about 50 to about 80 micrometers in width or diameter for 300 spi printers.
      <br/>
      With the advent of 600 spi printers, these nozzle openings are typically about 10 to about 40 micrometers in width or diameter.
      <br/>
      These small dimensions normally require inks that do not plug the small openings.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      An important requirement for ink jet ink is the ability of the ink to remain stable with minimal or no settling, the ability of the ink to remain in a fluid condition in a printhead opening on exposure to air, and moreover wherein when the inks are selected for ink jet printing there is minimized paper curl, or wherein paper curl can be controlled.
      <br/>
      Also of importance is the latency or decap time, which is the length of time over which an ink remains fluid in a printhead opening or nozzle when exposed to air and, therefore, is capable of firing a drop of ink at its intended target.
      <br/>
      Latency is considered, for example, the maximum idling times allowed for ink to be jetted by a printer with a speed equal to or greater than about 5 m/s (equivalent to an ink traveling a distance of 0.5 millimeters in less than 100  MU s) without a failure.
      <br/>
      This measurement can be accomplished with the printhead or nozzles uncovered or decapped and generally at a relative humidity of about 15 percent.
      <br/>
      The time interval is the longest length of time that the printhead, uncovered, will still fire or eject a specified drop without drop displacement or loss of density.
      <br/>
      The longer the latency time rating, the more desirable the ink.
      <br/>
      The inks of the present invention possess many of these characteristics in embodiments thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Moreover, an important requirement for ink jet inks, especially for pigment, such as carbon black, based inks, is for the pigment dispersion to remain stable throughout the life of the ink jet cartridge.
      <br/>
      Dye-based ink jet inks suffer from deficiencies in waterfastness and lightfastness after being printed on various substrates.
      <br/>
      Pigments provide an image on a wide variety of substrates, having high optical density with high waterfastness and lightfastness.
      <br/>
      Therefore, pigments are a preferred alternative to dyes, provided the pigment dispersions can be made stable to prevent flocculation and/or aggregation and settling.
      <br/>
      Some cosolvents that can be selected as clogging inhibitors cause destabilization of pigment dispersions and, therefore, are not usually effective in pigmented inks.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      There is thus a need for aqueous ink compositions and processes thereof that can be utilized in high resolution ink jet printers.
      <br/>
      Additionally, there is a need for colored, especially pigmented inks that provide high latency and also remain stable throughout the life of the ink jet cartridge.
      <br/>
      There is also a need for pigmented inks that provide high optical density in a single pass.
      <br/>
      Moreover, there is a need for ink jet inks wherein paper curl, and/or image smearing can be eliminated or minimized when such inks are selected for ink jet printing processes, and wherein the images possess minimal, or acceptable intercolor bleed, that is for example, wherein color overlap, or diffusing of one color into another is minimal, or avoided; and wherein excellent waterfastness and lightfastness images can be generated.
      <br/>
      These and other needs can be achievable with the present invention in embodiments thereof.
      <br/>
      An important need achieved with the inks and processes of the present invention is the provisions of epoxy latexes that enable inks with smear resistance, especially for inks containing surface treated carbon black colorants, and optical density enhancements.

      The ink compositions of the present invention possess in embodiments surface tensions of, for example, greater than about 25 dynes/cm2, preferably greater than about 30 dynes/cm2 and more preferably greater than about 40, such as from about 40 to about 100 a viscosity of, for example, less than about 10 cps, preferably less than about 8 cps, and more preferably less than about 5 cps, such as from about 1 to about 5 cps.
      <br/>
      The surface tension can be measured with a Kruss Model K10 tensiometer, and the viscosity can be determined at about 25 (degree)  C. by a Brookfield Fluid Rheometer.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The inks of the present invention possess, it is believed, superior ink stability, for example they maintain a substantially constant viscosity as measured by a Brookfield Fluid Rheometer, a suitable pH as measured by a pH electrode and meter, and an effective surface tension as measured by a fluid tensiometer.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the inks do not exhibit or possess minimal visible pigment or emulsion particle settling behavior for extended time periods, for example over six months, and more specifically, from about six months to about two years.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      In embodiments, the substantially constant viscosity, pH, surface tension, and lack of particulate settling is maintained despite stressing the ink by, for example, permitting the ink to remain in a bottle at room temperature, for example about 25 (degree)  C., then subjecting the ink to heating at about 60 (degree)  C. (degrees Centigrade) for 24 hours or 50 (degree)  C. for 30 days; or subjecting the ink to freezing at -30 (degree)  C. followed by thawing at room temperature.
      <br/>
      Under these stress conditions, the viscosity of the ink does not substantially increase or decrease more than about 0.5 cPs (centipoise).
      <br/>
      A substantial viscosity change, for example from 3 centipoise (cPs) to about 4 centipoise, may cause the ink to be nonjettable, and/or may render the ink incapable of passing through the jetting device filter.
      <br/>
      An adverse change in ink viscosity may result in the lack of refilling ink being provided to the jetting device, and thus subsequent loss of jetting channel refill and drops not being fired from the jetting device.
      <br/>
      Subjecting the inks to temperatures below about 0 degrees Celsius, such as -40 (degree)  C., and thereafter thawing the inks, an extreme condition which may occur during transportation of the ink in winter, or cold climates, evidenced no visible ink settling or precipitate of the ink, such as the pigment, the resin emulsion particles, and pigment with other ink components.
      <br/>
      Visible settling or precipitates, after the ink has remained at 25 (degree)  C., would cause ink jet nozzle clogging, and therefore, effect the line edge raggedness, optical density, or mottle of the images.
      <br/>
      Also, the settling of the ink would permit a nonhomogeneous mixture which may also cause storage problems such as in an ink tank containing a wicking device.
      <br/>
      Further, the inks of the present invention can be free of additional special additives, such as the prior art saccharine/polyols, which are selected for long shelf stability or excellent jetting performance.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The inks of the present invention in embodiments possess excellent latency.
      <br/>
      Generally, the inks possess a functional latency of at least 10 seconds, more generally on the order of 20 seconds to greater than 1,000 seconds, with a minimum latency of at least about 30 seconds being preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Moreover, the inks of the present invention in embodiments possess excellent dry and wet smear resistance, that is for example a dry smear optical density of at least less than about 0.10, and more specifically, a dry smear optical density of from about 0 to about 0.07. A toner smear optical density results in less transfer of ink on the developed image onto other media, or users.
      <br/>
      The OD smear is a measure of the amount of ink or image removed as compared to a print image of the same ink without the epoxy polymer latex.
      <br/>
      Generally, the image of the inks comprised of an epoxy latex possess a wet smear optical density of at least less than 0.20, more generally a wet smear optical density of less than 0.10, preferably from about 0 to about 0.10 as compared with a print image of ink without epoxy polymer latex which possesses a wet smear optical density of greater than, typically from about 0.20 to about 0.30.

      The images were printed on several media such as Xerox Courtland 4024DP and Image Series LX paper.
      <br/>
      An inhouse micro wet smear test fixture was used to smear the image with the use of water wetted chisel tips (similar to highlighter felt tips).
