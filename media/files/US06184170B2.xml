    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates generally to metallocene catalyst systems and to methods for their production and use.
      <br/>
      Specifically, this invention relates to a method for preparing metallocene catalyst systems using olefin additives which promote catalyst activity.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Metallocene catalyst systems are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      While the prior art discloses the use of olefins to prepare prepolymer and the use of polyolefins as supports, the prior art does not disclose the use of olefins as a reactant with the metallocene active site to promote catalyst system activity.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,346,925 describes supporting catalyst components on porous polymer supports such as polystyrenes.
      <br/>
      Canadian Patent Application No. 2,093,056 also describes using polymeric supports such as polystyrenes.
      <br/>
      WO 96/34020 describes a catalyst system prepared with an inert hydrocarbon and WO 95/25129 describes a method for preparing catalyst systems using a spray drying technique which can include polystyrene microparticles.
      <br/>
      EP 748823 A1 describes the use of styrene and styrenic compounds combined with certain transition metal compounds and modified alumoxanes to prepare catalyst systems.
    </p>
    <p num="4">The present inventor has discovered that the activity of metallocene catalyst systems is substantially increased when certain olefin promoters are used to prepare the catalyst systems.</p>

      An optically active polymer can be prepared with these pure stereoisomeric forms.

      Preferably the meso form of the metallocene is removed to ensure the center (i.e., the metal atom) provides stereoregular polymerization.

      For special products it is also possible to use rac/meso mixtures.

    <p num="34">
      Ionizing activators may also be used to activate metallocenes.
      <br/>
      These activators are neutral or ionic, or are compounds such as tri(n-butyl)ammonium tetrakis(pentaflurophenyl)boron, which ionize the neutral metallocene compound.
      <br/>
      Such ionizing compounds may contain an active proton, or some other cation associated with but not coordinated or only loosely coordinated to the remaining ion of the ionizing compound.
      <br/>
      Combinations of activators may also be used, for example, alumoxane and ionizing activators in combinations, see for example, WO 94/07928.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Descriptions of ionic catalysts for coordination polymerization comprised of metallocene cations activated by non-coordinating anions appear in the early work in EP-A-0 277 003, EP-A-0 277 004 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,198,401 and WO-A-92/00333 (incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      These teach a preferred method of preparation wherein metallocenes (bisCp and monoCp) are protonated by an anion precursor such that an alkyl/hydride group is abstracted from a transition metal to make it both cationic and charge-balanced by the non-coordinating anion.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The term "noncoordinating anion" means an anion which either does not coordinate to said cation or which is only weakly coordinated to said cation thereby remaining sufficiently labile to be displaced by a neutral Lewis base. "Compatible" noncoordinating anions are those which are not degraded to neutrality when the initially formed complex decomposes.
      <br/>
      Further, the anion will not transfer an anionic substituent or fragment to the cation so as to cause it to form a neutral four coordinate metallocene compound and a neutral by-product from the anion.
      <br/>
      Noncoordinating anions useful in accordance with this invention are those which are compatible, stabilize the metallocene cation in the sense of balancing its ionic charge in a +1 state, yet retain sufficient lability to permit displacement by an ethylenically or acetylenically unsaturated monomer during polymerization.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The use of ionizing ionic compounds not containing an active proton but capable of producing both the active metallocene cation and a noncoordinating anion is also known.
      <br/>
      See, EP-A-0 426 637 and EP-A-0 573 403 (incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      An additional method of making the ionic catalysts uses ionizing anion precursors which are initially neutral Lewis acids but form the cation and anion upon ionizing reaction with the metallocene compounds, for example the use of tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron.
      <br/>
      See EP-A-0 520 732 (incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      Ionic catalysts for addition polymerization can also be prepared by oxidation of the metal centers of transition metal compounds by anion precursors containing metallic oxidizing groups along with the anion groups, see EP-A-0 495 375 (incorporated herein by reference).
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Where the metal ligands include halogen moieties (for example, bis-cyclopentadienyl zirconium dichloride) which are not capable of ionizing abstraction under standard conditions, they can be converted via known alkylation reactions with organometallic compounds such as lithium or aluminum hydrides or alkyls, alkylalumoxanes, Grignard reagents, etc.

      In the preferred embodiment, this invention is directed toward the bulk liquid polymerization and copolymerization of propylene or ethylene, particularly propylene, in a slurry or gas phase polymerization process, particularly a slurry polymerization process.

      Another embodiment involves copolymerization reactions of propylene or ethylene, particularly propylene, with one or more of the alpha-olefin monomers having from 4 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 4-12 carbon atoms, for example alpha-olefin comonomers of ethylene, butene-1, pentene-1, 4-methylpentene-1, hexene-1, octene-1, decene-1, and cyclic olefins such as styrene, cyclopentene or norbornene.

      Typically in a gas phase polymerization process a continuous cycle is employed where in one part of the cycle of a reactor, a cycling gas stream, otherwise known as a recycle stream or fluidizing medium, is heated in the reactor by the heat of polymerization.
      <br/>
      The recycle stream usually contains one or more monomers continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions.
      <br/>
      This heat is removed in another part of the cycle by a cooling system external to the reactor.
      <br/>
      The recycle stream is withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor.
      <br/>
      Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and new or fresh monomer is added to replace the polymerized monomer. (See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,543,399; 4,588,790; 5,028,670; 5,352,749; 5,405,922, and 5,436,304 all of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.)

      A slurry polymerization process generally uses pressures in the range of about 1 to about 500 atmospheres or even greater and temperatures in the range of -60 (degree)  C. to about 280 (degree)  C. In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization medium to which ethylene and comonomers and often hydrogen along with catalyst are added.
      <br/>
      The liquid employed in the polymerization medium can be, for example, an alkane or a cycloalkane.
      <br/>
      The medium employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert.

      Alter two hours of stirring the mixture was filtered and washed with 100 ml of toluene.
      <br/>
      It was then reslurried in 40 ml of toluene. 0.36 g (0.61 mmol) of dimethyl silanediylbis (2-methyl-4-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride was added as a solid.
      <br/>
      After one minute of stirring, 0.5 ml (4.36 mmol) of styrene was added.
      <br/>
      The mixture was stirred for forty five minutes.
      <br/>
      It was then filtered, washed with 200 ml of toluene, and vacuum dried. 5.69 g of dried catalyst was obtained.

    <p num="149">
      0.25 mmol of triethylaluminum was added to a 2 L stainless steel reactor. 1 L of liquid propylene was then introduced.
      <br/>
      The reactor temperature was raised to 70 (degree)  C. with stirring. 40.2 mg of the dried catalyst prepared above was added with 250 ml of liquid propylene to initiate the polymerization.
      <br/>
      After one hour of polymerization, the reactor was vented and the polymer was removed.
      <br/>
      Polymer yield: 552 g. Polymerization activity: 13700 gPP/gcat
