      A golf ball carrier and dispenser in the form of a tube in which balls are stacked and biased to one end by spring action where an end opening smaller than the balls restrains the endmost ball from release.
      <br/>
      A side dispensing opening for release of ball is located adjacent the end of the tube so that when pressure is applied through the end opening, the endmost ball of the stack can be pushed downwardly and toward the exit opening for release of the endmost ball over the next underlying ball in the stack.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      A golfer, during a golf game frequently requires a replacement ball for the ball being played for reasons such as club impact damage to the ball being played, or that the ball is lost, or the ball because of use loses it resiliency.
      <br/>
      In such instances, a replacement ball is usually drawn from the ball pocket of the golf bag or might be carried as an extra ball in the golfer's pocket.
      <br/>
      Regardless of the reason the replacement ball is usually not as conveniently and comfortably available as it can be with the present invention.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      According to the present invention, a convenient golf ball carrier and dispenser is provided in the form of a tube in which a series of golf balls can be stacked on top of each other.
      <br/>
      The carrier can be clipped or otherwise conveniently attached to the side of a golf club bag or might be attached to a golf cart where a replacement ball can be conveniently reached.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The balls are biased upwardly by a spring within the tube which pushes the stack of balls upwardly toward the top.
      <br/>
      The carrier has a ball ejection opening at the side of the tube near its top from which a ball can be manually ejected.
      <br/>
      The carrier tube has a restricted top opening of size to block the release of the topmost ball of a stack of balls pushed upwardly in the tube.
      <br/>
      When desired, a golfer can cause a ball to be ejected from the side ejection opening by application of thumb or finger pressure exerted downwardly and laterally on the top ball and laterally toward the ejection opening.
      <br/>
      The ball is thereby released with a rolling action over the next underlying ball and can be readily received in the cupped hand of the golfer with which thumb pressure is applied for ejection of the ball.
    </p>
    <p num="5">An object of the invention is to provide a convenient easily carried container for golf balls.</p>
    <p num="6">Another object is to provide a compact and economical ball carrier adaptable to placement in any number of locations where a ball might be needed.</p>
    <p num="7">Another object of the invention is to provide a ball carrier from which a ball can be manually ejected easily as needed but which will hold in the remaining balls in the carrier securely during carriage.</p>
    <p num="8">A feature of the invention is the ease with which a ball can be removed from the carrier and the quick action release of the ball by simple finger manipulation on the top ball of the stack in the carrier.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Other objects and features which are believed to be characteristic of the invention are set forth in particularity in the appended claims.
      <br/>
      My invention, however, both in organization and manner of construction, together with further objects and features thereof maybe best understood by reference to the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="10">
      FIG. 1 is a side elevation partially see through illustration showing the ball carrier of this invention and the interior mechanism for holding the balls in stacked relation;
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a front elevation view of the ball carrier of FIG. 1 partially in cross section illustrating the compression mechanism for holding the balls in stacked relation;
      <br/>

      FIG. 1 illustrates the ball carrier 10 of this invention in which a tube 11 of length adequate to retain a desired number of balls is provided.
      <br/>
      The tube can be made of metal such as steel or aluminum or of plastic material.
      <br/>
      The diameter of the tube is slightly larger than the diameter of the balls to be contained therein to permit their free up and down movement within the tube.
      <br/>
      The balls 12 are pushed upwardly by an inverted cup-like piston 14 having lateral dimensions such that it can also be moved freely up and down within the tube interior.
      <br/>
      A helical spring 15 which pushes upwardly from the bottom 16 of the tube fits into the underside of the piston 14 to bias the series of balls contained in the carrier upwardly toward the top 17 of the carrier.
      <br/>
      The tube has at the top 17 an opening 18 of dimension smaller than that of a ball such that it restrains release of the top ball 12 in the contained stack.
      <br/>
      The dimension of the top opening 18 is defined by the marginal edges of the top which are in a sense flared or turned over toward the center of the tube to provide curved interior surfaces matching the radius of the balls thereby conformably holding the topmost ball in the stacked series free to be moved when desired.
      <br/>
      The ball ejection opening 19 from which a ball can be released from the tube is provided in the side of the tube just below the top 17.
      <br/>
      The opening 19 as can be seen in the frontal view shown in FIG. 2 is slightly elliptical with a slightly larger vertical to lateral dimensions and is adequate in such dimensions to allow a ball to pass freely therethrough upon being pushed from the tube end 18 toward the opening 19.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A narrow slot 20 extending lengthwise of the tube from a region near the top to a region near the bottom serves two functions.
      <br/>
      A push lever 21 fastened to the piston 14 is arranged to extend through the slot to permit the piston 14 to be moved downwardly against the pressure of the spring 15 by application of downward finger pressure on the lever 21.
      <br/>
      The lever 21 extends from a disk fixedly secured to the top of the piston 14.
      <br/>
      The disk can be provided a slight central depression to facilitate centering of a ball placed thereon.
      <br/>
      The piston 14 is made to have a depth such that it does not expose the spring 15 when it is in its uppermost position as determined by the upper limit of movement of the lever 21 in the slot 20.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      To load the tube with a stack of balls, the piston is moved downwardly by application of pressure to the push lever 21 whereupon the balls can be fed into the opening 19.
      <br/>
      As many balls can be inserted as the tube is designed for.
      <br/>
      In most cases it is found that a stack of five balls in the tube is sufficient to permit playing of a full game of golf without requiring a recharge.
      <br/>
      As the piston 14 is held downwardly by pressure applied to the lever 21, as many balls as desired can be inserted one by one in the opening.
      <br/>
      Thereupon the lever 21 can be released to push the balls upwardly to a position where the topmost ball is partially visible in the opening 18.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The ball outlet opening 19, as can be seen in FIG. 1, is positioned to extend from a region near the middle of the second upper ball in the stack to a position just about half way up from the bottom of the uppermost ball.
      <br/>
      Thus when the balls are retained in the tube, the chance of an accidental release of a ball from the tube is unlikely.
    </p>
    <p num="15">A holding clip 23 fastened to the side of the tube 11 opposite the opening 19 is designed to extend downwardly for a distance to allow the carrier to be held conveniently in any number of locations such as at the marginal edge of a golf bag or on the framework of a golf cart.</p>
    <p num="16">
      As may be seen in FIG. 2, a series of small openings or apertures 22 allow viewing of the balls stacked in the tube to indicate the number of balls available.
      <br/>
      Similarly the slot 20 in a right angular position relative to the apertures 22 also permits viewing of the number of balls in the stack available for use.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      FIG. 3 illustrates the unique feature of applicant's invention whereby a topmost ball in the stack of balls within the carrier 10 can be pressed downwardly and laterally toward the exist opening 19 but in doing so the ball being pushed is rolled over the underlying ball 12 in the stack.
      <br/>
      The top ball thus in a sense is flipped out of the opening 19.
      <br/>
      That is the uppermost ball in being pushed laterally even a slight amount is positioned off center over the curved surface of the underlying ball leading toward the ejection opening.
      <br/>
      The upward force of the underlying spring biased ball thereby assists in pushing or squeezing the ball outwardly from the opening 19.
      <br/>
      That is the pushing action of the underlying second ball helps in ejection of the topmost ball.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Thus besides holding the stack of balls stably in the carrier against accidental release by pushing the balls upwardly to the opening 18, the invention allows easy removal of the topmost ball by mere application of finger pressure.
      <br/>
      In other words pushing the topmost ball downward and laterally toward the opening 19 causes it to roll over the curve of the underlying ball leading it to the exit opening 19 whereby the ball is assisted in its release.
      <br/>
      If thumb pressure is used the golfer's hand can be cupped under the opening 19 for ready receipt of the ball being ejected.
      <br/>
      After ejection of the desired uppermost ball, the next underlying ball 12 is pushed upwardly into the opening 18 by the lower balls in the stack.
      <br/>
      The new topmost ball thus becomes exposed at the opening 18 in similar fashion and is made ready as the next ball for manual release through the ejection opening 19.
    </p>
    <p num="19">As a variation of the invention a smaller carrier for conveniently holding two or three balls can be provided which can be made readily adaptable to being carried on a golfer directly, such as by being hung on a pants belt.</p>
    <p num="20">
      As another variation, if desired, the top surface of the piston 14 can be made with an inclination toward the side of the tube 11 in which the opening 19 is located.
      <br/>
      By so doing the last ball in the tube will be assisted out of the opening 19 without presence of an underlying ball over which it might otherwise roll over.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Although the invention is herein described in relation to containment of golf balls, it will be readily recognized by those skilled in the art that other balls as well can be contained and carried in similar fashion.
      <br/>
      For example, the system lends itself admirably for use in containing and carrying tennis balls.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In view of the foregoing it will be understood that many variations of the arrangement of the invention can be provided within the broad scope of the principles embodied therein.
      <br/>
      Thus, while a particular preferred embodiment of the invention has been shown and described herein, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such modifications which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.
