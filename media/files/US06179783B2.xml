      An apparatus, operation and method for measurement of systemic and/or pulmonic blood pressure.
      <br/>
      The present invention offers a passive non-invasive method and system that can be used where measurement of systemic pressure with a traditional blood pressure cuff is contraindicated.
      <br/>
      The present invention also affords a means for early diagnosis and opportunity for intervention in patients with no symptoms or signs of elevated pulmonary blood pressure that can be performed as part of a routine physical exam.
      <br/>
      The present invention accomplishes this non-invasive measurement through detection, identification and characterization of the second heart sound acoustic signature associated with heart valve closure.
      <br/>
      An apparatus for measuring systemic and/or pulmonic blood pressure in accordance with the present invention includes a sensor assembly comprising a housing, an electronic module, a shock dampener, a mounting means, a transducer, an acoustic coupling and a back cover.
      <br/>
      The sensor assembly is connected to a data acquisition module which in turn is connected to a signal processing means, a remote connection means and a monitor.
      <br/>
      An improved acoustic coupling is disclosed that provides low-loss acoustic transmission coupling between the skin of the patient and the detector.

      No. 08/769,156 filed Dec. 18, 1996 by Sailor Mohler.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates generally to an apparatus, operation and method for measurement of blood pressure.
      <br/>
      In particular, this invention relates to an apparatus, operation and method for the detection, identification and characterization of sounds relating to either systemic or pulmonary blood pressure through the use of sonospectrography.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Blood pressure is the force exerted by the blood against the inner walls of blood vessels.
      <br/>
      Blood pressure determination is an important diagnostic tool.
      <br/>
      The blood vessels that comprise the vascular system can be grouped into two main divisions, a systemic circuit and a pulmonary circuit.
      <br/>
      In the systemic circuit, high blood pressure may indicate the presence of arteriosclerosis or other vascular disease, while low blood pressure may indicate shock or blood loss.
      <br/>
      Detection and measurement of elevated pulmonary blood pressure is a key diagnostic indicator for a number of pulmonary diseases, such as: cystic fibrosis, pleuresy, lung pulmonary diseases, and pulmonary impedance.
      <br/>
      Early diagnosis of these diseases greatly assists in symptom mitigation and improved patient quality of life.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The systemic circuit includes the aorta and its branches that deliver oxygenated blood to all body tissues, as well as the companion system of veins returning blood to the right atrium.
      <br/>
      Freshly oxygenated blood received by the left atrium is forced into the systemic circuit by the contraction of the left ventricle.
      <br/>
      When the left ventricle contracts, the mitral valve closes, and the only exit is through the aortic valve into the aorta.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The peripheral nature of certain systemic circuit arteries in the body extremities allows for the traditional indirect measurement of the systolic and diastolic pressures with a sphygmomanometer blood pressure cuff.
      <br/>
      While this method is effective for many patients, use of the traditional blood pressure cuff on an extremity may be contraindicated for patients suffering from any number of problems including severe extremity trauma, or burns.
      <br/>
      In patients where use of the traditional blood pressure cuff is contraindicated, there is no reliable alternative method of monitoring blood pressure.
      <br/>
      This is extremely important in trauma patients where prompt detection of blood pressure changes are needed to counteract the effects of shock or large blood loss.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The pulmonic circuit provides for blood circulation from the right ventricle through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary artery.
      <br/>
      The pulmonary artery extends upward and posteriorly from the heart, dividing into right and left branches which serve the right and left lungs, respectively.
      <br/>
      Within the lungs the right and left branches of the pulmonary artery divide repeatedly giving rise to arterioles that continue into the capillary networks associated with the walls of the alveoli.
      <br/>
      Gas exchange occurs as the blood moves through these capillaries, so that when the blood enters the venules of the pulmonary circuit, it is well oxygenated and poor in carbon dioxide.
      <br/>
      The pulmonary venules merge forming small veins, which in turn converge forming larger veins.
      <br/>
      Four pulmonary veins return oxygenated blood to the left atrium, thereby completing the pulmonic circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="7">None of the arteries of the pulmonic system are located in extremities and therefore measurement of pulmonic system pressure with a blood pressure cuff is not possible.</p>
    <p num="8">
      At present, the only reliable method for measuring pulmonic system blood pressure is through use of an invasive blood pressure catheter that is inserted directly into the pulmonary artery.
      <br/>
      This diagnostic procedure has a substantial degree of risk and is expensive, its use is thus generally seen as an unjustified procedure in patients without other symptoms.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The physician may attempt to detect and differentiate the abnormal sounds that occur with elevated blood pressure using traditional auscultation.
      <br/>
      Closure of the aortic and pulmonary semilunar heart valves generate a sound component that is in the audio frequency range.
      <br/>
      As the systemic or pulmonic blood pressure increases, the frequency components of the related heart valve also increase.
      <br/>
      This increased frequency audio component is not present in a healthy patient.
      <br/>
      However, aural detection of this frequency increase is extremely difficult because the physician must determine the absolute frequency of the audio component of the heart valve of interest.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the sounds are very weak and heavily contaminated with noise from other patient heart sounds, other normal patient body sounds and external ambient noise in the room.
      <br/>
      Further, the audio component of the aortic and pulmonary semilunar heart valves are heavily attenuated as they pass through the patient's chest and chest wall.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      A need exists for a non-invasive, low cost and reliable means for determining systemic blood pressure in those situations where traditional means are contraindicated.
      <br/>
      A need also exists for a non-invasive, low cost and reliable means for determining pulmonary blood pressure.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="11">
      As mentioned, the sounds related to systemic and pulmonary heart pressure are difficult to discern. U.S. Pat. No. 4,528,690 to Sedgwick; U.S. Pat. No. 3,790,712 to Andries; and U.S. Pat. No. 3,160,708 to Andries et al. disclose relatively simple electronic stethoscopes as methods for amplification of the sounds in an attempt to raise the sub-audible components into the audible range.
      <br/>
      However, simple amplification of the entire frequency spectrum, as disclosed, does not help in determining the absolute frequency of the heart valve sounds, or in detecting the subtle changes of this frequency that occur with changes in blood pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      To this end, U.S. Pat. No. 4,594,731 to Lewkowicz and U.S. Pat. No. 5,347,583 to Dieken et al. disclose various forms of selective filtering or signal processing on the audio signal in the electronic stethoscope.
      <br/>
      Lewkowicz discloses a means for shifting the entire detected spectrum of sounds upward while expanding the bandwidth so that they are more easily perceived by the listener.
      <br/>
      Dieken et al. discloses an electronic stethoscope having a greater volume of acoustic space and thereby improving low frequency response.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The electronic stethoscope provides a moderate improvement over conventional methods of auscultation.
      <br/>
      However, information remains in audio form only and is transient; the physician is unable to visualize the data and either freeze the display or focus on a particular element of the signal retrieved.
      <br/>
      To accommodate that deficiency, the technique of phonocardiography, which is the mechanical or electronic registration of heart sounds with graphic display, is used. U.S. Pat.

    <p num="14">
      The process of phonocardiography as commonly known in the art, acquires acoustic data through an air conduction microphone strapped to a patients chest, and provides the physician with a strip chart recording of this acoustic data.
      <br/>
      The strip chart is generally created at a rate of 100 mm/second.
      <br/>
      As this method is generally used, with the exception of the created strip chart, data is not stored.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is not possible to manipulate and/or process the data post acquisition.
      <br/>
      In addition, phonocardiography does not provide the sensitivity needed to monitor softer physiological sounds such as the closure of the semilunar valves and blood flow through the circulatory system.
    </p>
    <p num="15">As previously noted, one problem in traditional auscultation is ambient noise from the room in which the examination is occurring, which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio of the sounds of interest. U.S. Pat. No. 4,672,977 to Kroll discloses a method for automatic lung sound cancellation and provides visual and audio output. U.S. Pat. No. 5,309,922 to Schecter et al. discloses a method for cancellation of ambient noise to enhance respiratory sounds and provides visual and audio output. U.S. Pat.

      U.S. Pat. No. 5,036,857 to Semmlow et al. discloses a method of phonocardiography with piezoelectric transducer.
      <br/>
      Semmlow specifically recommends against Fast Fourier Transformation analysis of the phonocardiography data and relies on processing by other means. U.S. Pat. No. 5,109,863 to Semmlow et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,035,247 issued to Heimann also disclose piezoelectric transducers.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,002,060 to Nedivi, discloses both heart and respiratory sensors, with Fast Fourier Transformation analysis.
      <br/>
      In the technique disclosed by Nedivi the sensors are not physically attached to the patient.
      <br/>
      Thus the sensors are not capable of detecting the low intensity sound of the aortic and pulmonary semilunar heart valves.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Devices currently known in the art do not provide either a means of determining systemic blood pressure where use of a blood pressure cuff is contraindicated, or a low risk, non-invasive means of determining pulmonic blood pressure.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the related art does not provide the level of aural sensitivity needed to reliably detect the sounds of the aortic and pulmonary semilunar heart valves and determine the precise frequency of these sounds.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      What is needed is a safe, sensitive and noninvasive means of measuring systemic and/or pulmonic blood pressure.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished through the present invention.
      <br/>
      Through the use of sonospectrography, a procedure based on integral spectral analysis techniques, systemic pressure can be monitored in conditions where traditional auscultation is contraindicated.
      <br/>
      Additionally, sonospectrography can be used to monitor pulmonic pressure in an inexpensive, noninvasive and low risk manner, allowing for the early detection of conditions such as cystic fibrosis, pleuresy, lung pulmonary diseases and pulmonary impedance.
      <br/>
      Sonospectrography is defined as the separation and arrangement of the frequency components of acoustic signals in terms of energy or time.

    <p num="20">
      Further embodiments of the present invention provide a means of detecting physiological sounds, such as sounds emitted by the heart and other body organs as well as sounds related to the flow of blood through the circulatory system.
      <br/>
      Analysis of these sounds can be used to determine systemic and pulmonary blood pressure, monitor anesthesiology, determine cardiac output, monitor the circulation of diabetic individuals, and monitor fetal heartbeat as well as detect conditions such as aneurysms, arterial occlusions, arthritic decrepitation, phlebitis, venous thrombosis, intravascular blood clotting and carotid artery disease.

      <br/>
      Patient physiologic signals, such as acoustic vibrations or electrical impulses, are detected by sensor assembly 102.
      <br/>
      In an alternative embodiment a plurality of sensor assemblies can be used to either simultaneously obtain signals from various locations of the body or to simultaneously obtain signals from both the patient and the environment.

      <br/>
      Audio amplifier 116 drives one or more sets of high-fidelity earphones 120.

      FIG. 11 depicts the operation of the apparatus of the present invention with associated hardware and software.
      <br/>
      At step 1202, start-up procedures are performed such as initialization, calibration, sensor selection, patient parameter input, and buffer clearing, among others.
      <br/>
      Upon completion of these start-up procedures steps 1204 and 1206 are initiated.
      <br/>
      At step 1204, sensor 102 provides patient physiologic signals for signal processing.
      <br/>
      In an alternative embodiment, sensor 102 can include electrocardiogram sensors and acoustic sensors.
      <br/>
      At step 1206 acoustic sensors are used to detect background or ambient noise.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Next, at step 1208, the detected signals are passed to individual data acquisition modules which contain means for signal filtering, impedance matching, amplification, and buffering.
      <br/>
      These functions are performed by the components of the circuitry illustrated in FIGS. 4-6.
    </p>
    <p num="94">At step 1210, the signals from the ambient noise acoustic sensor acquired in step 1206, are processed and subtracted from the signals from the desired sensor of step 1204 in a noise cancellation process to reduce the effect of ambient noise from the patient's environment.</p>
    <p num="95">
      At step 1212, the signal undergoes additional signal conditioning and processing.
      <br/>
      The purpose of this conditioning step is to convert the analog signal to digital, provide adjustable decimation with a sampling rate suitable to avoid biasing, provide adjustable smoothing, averaging and peak holding.
      <br/>
      In an alternative embodiment the signal conditioning and processing of step 1212 is performed by a sound card which typically has the following capabilities: (1) a sample rate selectable from about 4 K to 44 K; (2) a sample size of about 16 bits; (3) capable of analog to digital conversion; (4) capable of digital to analog conversion; and (5) possesses IBM computer bus compatibility such as ISA, EISA, PCI, etc.
      <br/>
      In yet another alternative embodiment the sound card used comprises a "Tahiti" multiple channel Sound Card manufactured by Turtle Beach.
      <br/>
      Step 1230 allows for the intermediate output and display of the desired signal following the signal conditioning and processing of step 1212.
      <br/>
      The display is accomplished by selection of a desired display mode and subsequent display on the monitor 112.

      In a similar fashion, in step 1218, the frequency domain components of the data passes through a frequency domain correlator and feature extractor.
      <br/>
      In step 1220, the outputs from the time domain correlator and feature extraction process of step 1216 and the frequency domain correlator and feature extractor of step 1218 are compared to a reference pattern and feature library, to determine whether the features contained within the signal of interest match known disease modalities as recorded and maintained within the reference pattern and feature library.

    <p num="98">
      At step 1222, the outputs from the time domain correlator and feature extraction process of step 1216, the frequency domain correlator and feature extractor process of step 1218 and the results from the reference pattern and feature library comparison of step 1220 are subjected to a recognition logic decision, where a determination is made as to whether a disease or adverse condition is indicated.
      <br/>

      Elevated blood pressure has a number of causes.
      <br/>
      Regardless of the cause, however, recent testing at the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences shows that there is a change in the frequency spectrum of both the aortic and pulmonary semilunar valve sounds that is directly correlated to change in blood pressure of the associated systemic or pulmonary circulatory system.
      <br/>
      This correlation was shown to be both measurable and repeatable in testing on animals having systemic and pulmonary circulatory systems comparable to the human system.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      Elevated blood pressure increases back pressure at associated heart valves.
      <br/>
      This increased back pressure results in more rapid closure of the heart valves and a resultant audible "snap" of the valve leaflets.
      <br/>
      The acoustic signature that is associated with those heart valve sounds has elevated frequency components as compared to the signature associated with heart valves operating under normal blood pressures.
      <br/>
      As the blood pressure increases, this frequency component also increases.
      <br/>
      It has been determined that this change in the frequency component is transitory and returns to normal when the blood pressure returns to normal.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      Thus, where the sound emitted by the aortic semilunar valve is of an increased frequency, this is indicative of higher systemic blood pressure.
      <br/>
      Similarly, where the sound emitted by the pulmonary semilunar valve is of an increased frequency, this is indicative of higher pulmonic blood pressure.
      <br/>
      Through the use of the apparatus of the present invention, it is possible to detect and record sounds originating from the aortic and pulmonary semilunar valves.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      In practice, a sensor assembly is placed in contact with the patient.
      <br/>
      One side of the sensor assembly contains an acoustic coupler that is placed in contact with the patient's skin at the traditional auscultation point for the valve of interest, while a second acoustic coupler on the opposite side faces away from the patient.
      <br/>
      This second acoustic coupler is designed to acquire background sounds in synchronism with the acoustic coupler in contact with the patient's skin to reject common mode signals reaching both couplers.
      <br/>
      While breathing normally the sounds of the aortic and/or pulmonary semilunar valves are acquired, preamplified and sent to a plurality of locations.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      One analog signal is sent directly to an audio amplifier and high fidelity earphones.
      <br/>
      A second analog signal is sent through a gain control potentiometer to an analog to digital converter.
      <br/>
      The data is digitized and displayed in real time on a monitor.
      <br/>
      Visual feedback from the monitor allows a precise setting of the gain control by the physician for the optimum acquisition of data.
      <br/>
      In an alternative embodiment, an electronic strip chart is used in the precise setting of the gain control.
      <br/>
      The physician adjusts gain control to maximize the dynamic range of the captured signal.

      In one embodiment, sounds are filtered normally.
      <br/>
      In an alternative embodiment, sounds are filtered to de-emphasize interfering responses prior to being sent to the earphones or the analog to digital converter.

      Data can be stored digitally, recalled for future analysis or transmitted to another location.

      Referring to FIG. 11, data from recent in-vivo testing on animal subjects at the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences is shown.
      <br/>
      The subject had a pressure catheter emplaced to provide actual pressure readings, and the present invention detected, and processed the acoustic signature data from the second heart sounds.
      <br/>
      FIG. 11 plots the relationship between second heart sound A21302, and blood pressure 1304.
      <br/>
      As shown, where there is a rise in the frequency of second heart sound 1302, there is a corresponding rise in systolic pressure 1306, mean pressure 1308 and diastolic pressure 1310.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      The subject whose pressure/frequency relationship is depicted in FIG. 11, had a resting systolic pressure of about 120 mm Hg, a resting diastolic pressure of about 77 mm Hg, and a predominant second heart sound frequency of 28.5 Hz. The mean blood pressure was thus about 90 mm Hg at 28.5 Hz. As the subject's blood pressure was artificially increased, the associated frequency components of the second heart sound correspondingly increased.
      <br/>
      Systolic pressure 1306 of the subject reached about 165 mm Hg, diastolic pressure 1310 reached about 85 mm Hg, and frequency of second heart sound 1302 reached 36.
      <br/>
      Mean pressure 1308 reached about 115 mm Hg.
      <br/>
      The slope of this mean pressure/frequency curve is approximately 2 mm Hg per Hz.
      <br/>
      This pressure/frequency correlation was demonstrated in each animal subject tested.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      Across a population, measurement of the sound frequency associated with the closure of the aortic and pulmonary semilunar valves will allow an estimate of the mean systemic and pulmonary blood pressure.
      <br/>
      Specifically, using a range of pressure/frequency curves collected from population samples, the present invention will allow an estimate of the mean systemic and pulmonary pressure with a passive and non-invasive acoustic measurement of the acoustic signature of the semilunar valve closure.
      <br/>
      As an example, if the mean pressure data curve 1307 in FIG. 11 presented an accumulated average from the population, then measurement of a pulmonary semilunar valve closure sound frequency of 36 Hz 1309 would provide an estimate that the mean pulmonic pressure was 115 mm Hg 1311.
      <br/>
      In an otherwise asymptomatic patient, this might provide sufficient clinical justification for use of an invasive blood pressure catheter, with the attendant risk and cost, to confirm the pulmonic pressure.
