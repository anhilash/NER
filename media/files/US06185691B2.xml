      <br/>
      A clock divider receives a main clock and generates divided clocks (even or odd division) each having generally a half duty cycle.
      <br/>
      The clock divider includes flip flops connected to form a master-slave counter in which the master components are clocked off a first clock and the slave components are clocked off a second clock that is inverted from the first clock.
      <br/>
      The master-slave counter is a ring counter, and outputs from the master-slave counter are routed to decoding circuitry to generate divided clocks.

    <p num="1">The invention relates to generating clocks for use in electronic systems.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Clocks are used throughout an electronic system, such as a computer system, to synchronize events communicated among chips in a system as well as among devices inside a chip.
      <br/>
      At the system level, a master clock generator provides a master clock which is typically of a very high frequency.
      <br/>
      This master clock is divided down and provided to components throughout the system.
      <br/>
      At the chip level, a phase locked loop (PLL) circuit generates internal clocks for use by circuitry in the chip.
      <br/>
      The clocks generated by the PLL circuit are synchronized to an external clock.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Both at the system level and at the chip level, different frequency clocks are typically required for different parts of the system or chip.
      <br/>
      Clock dividers are used to divide a clock to a desired lower frequency clock.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, a main clock can be divided by 2, 3, 5, 6, and so forth.
      <br/>
      If the main clock has generally a 50% or half duty cycle (i.e., the clock pulse high width is the same as the clock pulse low width), division by an even number (e.g., 2, 4) will result in a divided clock also having generally a 50% duty cycle.
      <br/>
      However, using typical clock dividers, division by an odd number may result in clocks having duty cycle that is not at 50%.
      <br/>
      For example, a divide by three clock may have a high pulse width to low pulse width ratio of 1:2, that is, the clock's high pulse width is half its low pulse width.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="4">The invention is directed to generating a divided clock from a main clock, with the divided clock generally having a half duty cycle.</p>
    <p num="5">
      In general, in one aspect, the invention features a clocking circuit for generating an output clock.
      <br/>
      The clocking circuit includes a master counting device coupled to receive a first clock and a slave counting device coupled to receive a second clock.
      <br/>
      The second clock is an inverted version of the first clock.
      <br/>
      A decoder receives outputs of the master and slave counting devices to generate an output clock that is a divided version of the first clock.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      Referring to FIG. 1, a clock divider 100 for use in a microelectronic device or in a computing system is shown.
      <br/>
      The clock divider 100 can provide divided clocks based on a main clock (CLKIN) which can run at, for example, about 198 MHz.
      <br/>
      CLKIN can be generated by a PLL in a microelectronic device or by a main clock generator in a system.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the clock divider includes a master-slave ring counter 22 which cycles through predetermined legal states.
      <br/>
      Outputs Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q5 of the ring counter 22 are decoded by a decoder 24 to generate divided clocks CLKDIV2, CLKDIV3, and CLKDIV5.
      <br/>
      If the ring counter 22 reaches an illegal state, the ring counter 22 includes a self-initialization circuit to re-initialize the ring counter to a legal state.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In the clock divider 100, a clock generator 20 creates a true version (CLK) and an inverted version (CLKBAR) of CLKIN.
      <br/>
      CLK and CLKBAR are provided to clock inputs of the ring counter 22.
      <br/>
      CLK controls the master portion 22A of the counter 22, which provides the Q1, Q3 and Q5 outputs.
      <br/>
      CLKBAR controls the slave portion 22B of the counter, which provides the Q2, Q4, and Q6 outputs.
      <br/>
      By selectively decoding different combinations of the ring counter outputs, different divided versions of CLKIN can be created.
      <br/>
      By using both CLK and CLKBAR to control outputs of the ring counter 22, 50% duty cycle clocks can be generated, even for clocks divided by an odd number.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Referring to FIGS. 2A and 2B, the clock generator 20 includes two multiplexers 102 and 104.
      <br/>
      The multiplexer 102 generates the true clock CLK and the multiplexer 104 generates the inverted clock CLKBAR.
      <br/>
      CLKIN is connected to the select input of each of the multiplexers 102 and 104.
      <br/>
      The "1" inputs of the multiplexers 102 and 104 receive opposite states.
      <br/>
      For example, the "1" input of the multiplexer 102 is connected to a high state (VCC), while the "1" input of the multiplexer 104 is connected to a low state (GND).
      <br/>
      Similarly, the "0" inputs of the multiplexers 102 and 104 are connected to opposite states, with the "0" input of the multiplexer 102 connected to GND and the "0" input of the multiplexer 104 connected to VCC.
      <br/>
      Thus, as CLKIN toggles, each of the multiplexers 102 and 104 alternately selects its "0" or "1" input to toggle CLK or CLKBAR.
      <br/>
      Generated using the circuitry shown, CLK and CLKBAR are balanced with respect to one another since the clock drive circuits (multiplexers 102 and 104) are the same, resulting in the same rise and fall times and propagation delays.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Alternatively, a balanced true version and inverted version of a clock can be provided to the clock divider 100.</p>
    <p num="13">
      To reduce the RC delay of the interconnecting lines 103 and 105 connecting the outputs of the multiplexers 102 and 104, respectively, to the remaining circuitry of the clock divider 100, wider electrically conductive lines can be used to route CLK and CLKBAR.
      <br/>
      In addition, to reduce the effects of noise, each of the CLK and CLKBAR interconnecting lines is shielded on both sides.
      <br/>
      Common methods of shielding include routing ground lines on both sides of the shielded line.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The clock divider 100 includes a predetermined number of D-type flip flops providing outputs that are decoded to generate the desired divided clocks.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, six flip flops 106A-F form a ring counter whose outputs are decoded to provide divide-by-two, divide-by-three, and divide-by-six clocks divided from CLKIN.
      <br/>
      The clock inputs of the flip flops 106A-F, which are connected in a serial chain with the last data output (Q) fed back to the first data input (D) to form a loop, are alternately connected to receive CLK and CLKBAR.
      <br/>
      Thus, the clock inputs of the flip flops 106A, 106C and 106E receive CLK, while the clock inputs of the flip flops 106B, 106D, and 106F receive CLKBAR.
      <br/>
      By using a counter that is clocked off both the CLK and CLKBAR edges, the generated divided clocks (including both odd and even divided clocks) can be balanced to have generally 50% duty cycles.
      <br/>
      This is described further below.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The output (Q1) of the first flip flop 106A is connected to the D input of the next flip flop 106B in the chain, and the output (Q2) of the flip flop 106B is connected to the D input of the flip flop 106C.
      <br/>
      The output (Q3) of the flip flop 106C is connected to one input of an AND gate 108, whose other input is connected to receive the output (Q1) of an OR gate 110.
      <br/>
      The two inputs of the OR gate 110 are connected to the output (Q1) of the flip flop 106A and the output (Q5) of the flip flop 106E.
      <br/>
      The output of the AND gate 108 is connected to the D input of the flip flop 106D, whose output (Q4) is in turn connected to the D input of the flip flop 106E.
      <br/>
      The output (Q5) of the flip flop 106E is connected to the D input of the flip flop 106F.
      <br/>
      Finally, the output (Q6) of the last flip flop 106F is inverted by an inverter 112 and routed back to the D input of the flip flop 106A.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Connected in this configuration, a 3-bit master-slave Johnson ring counter is provided.
      <br/>
      Flip flops 106A, 106C, and 106E form the master portion 22A of the counter whereas flip flops 106B, 106D, and 106F form the slave portion 22B.
      <br/>
      The outputs Q1, Q3, and Q5 of flip flops 106A, 106C, and 106E (the master portion) provide the following binary count sequence: 000, 100, 110, 111, 011, 001.
      <br/>
      The entire 6-bit ring counter sequence is illustrated in FIG. 4, where the states of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, and Q6 are shown on the rising edge of CLK or CLKBAR.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The illegal states of the ring counter illustrated in the embodiment of FIG. 2A and 2B are binary values 101 and 010 on outputs Q1, Q3, and Q5.
      <br/>
      Self-initialization of the ring counter is performed upon detection of an illegal state.
      <br/>
      One way in which the counter can enter an illegal state is during power up reset.
      <br/>
      Using Johnson counter sequence theory, detection of only one illegal state is sufficient to cover all illegal states, because after certain clock cycles the other illegal states will rotate to the one illegal state.
      <br/>
      Thus, the detected illegal state is binary value 010 on Q1, Q3 and Q5.
      <br/>
      This state is detected by the detector formed by the AND gate 108 and the OR gate 110.
      <br/>
      Occurrence of 010 will cause the AND gate 108 to output a low state, which will cause the flip flop 106D to receive a low state rather than a high state at its D input.
      <br/>
      On the next rising edge of CLK, the low state is loaded into the input of flip flop 106E, thereby clearing the illegal condition by resetting the ring counter to the 000 state.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      To balance the load seen by the outputs of flip flops 106A-C, load circuitry (including P-channel MOSFETs 114A-C and N-channel MOSFETs 116A-C) is connected to the outputs of the flip flops 106A-C.
      <br/>
      The P-channel MOSFET 114 has its source and drain connected to VCC and the N-channel MOSFET 116 has its source and drain connected to GND.
      <br/>
      The gates of both transistors 114 and 116 are connected to the corresponding output of a flip flop 106.
      <br/>
      The widths and lengths of the transistors 114 and 116 are selected so that the capacitive loads seen by output nodes Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q5 are the same.
      <br/>
      This is important because Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q5 are connected to decoding circuitry that generates the divided clocks CLKDIV2, CLKDIV3, and CLKDIV6.
      <br/>
      The RC timings of the nodes Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q5 are maintained at about the same value so that the outputted divided clocks are not skewed with respect to one another.
      <br/>
      Because the output of the flip flop 106C is connected only to the input of an AND gate 108, an additional load in the form of a dummy D-type flip flop 118 is connected to the output of the flip flop 106C.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      To generate the divided clocks CLKDIV2, CLKDIV3, and CLKDIV6, the outputs of the flip flops 106A-E are provided to the decoder 24, which includes a set of exclusive OR and exclusive NOR gates.
      <br/>
      An exclusive OR gate 122 receives Q1 and Q3.
      <br/>
      The exclusive OR gate 124 receives Q5 and a low state.
      <br/>
      The outputs of the exclusive OR gates 122 and 124 are routed to the inputs of an exclusive NOR gate 130, which is connected to drive the divide-by-two clock CLKDIV2.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 4, the signal CLKDIV2 will be high in counter states 3, 4; 7, 8; 11, 0; and low in states 1, 2; 5, 6; 9, 10.
      <br/>
      The divide-by-two clock is illustrated in FIG. 3D.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The exclusive OR gate 126 receives Q2 and Q5.
      <br/>
      The output of the exclusive OR gate 126 is connected to one input of an exclusive NOR gate 132, whose other input receives a low state.
      <br/>
      The output of the exclusive NOR gate 132 is connected to the divide-by-three clock CLKDIV3.
      <br/>
      The gates 124 and 132 effectively perform an exclusive NOR of Q2 and Q5.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 4, the signal CLKDIV3 is high in counter states 5, 6, 7, 11, 0, 1; and low in counter states 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The exclusive OR gate 128 receives Q5 and a low state.
      <br/>
      The output of the exclusive OR gate 128 is connected to one input of an exclusive NOR gate 134, whose other input receives a low state.
      <br/>
      The output of the exclusive NOR gate 134 is connected to the divide-by-six CLKDIV6.
      <br/>
      Effectively, the gates 128 and 134 provide an inverter for input Q5.
      <br/>
      The signal CLKDIV6 is high in counter states 5-10; and low in counter states 11 and 0-4.
      <br/>
      CLKDIV6 is illustrated in FIG. 3B.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In the timing diagrams of the main clock CLKIN and the divided clocks in FIGS. 3A-D, the main clock CLKIN runs at about 198 MHz, the divide-by-six clock CLKDIV6 runs at about 33 MHz, the divide-by-three clock CLKDIV3 runs at about 66 MHz, and the divide-by-two clock CLKDIV2 runs at about 99 MHz.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in each of FIGS. 3B, 3C and 3D, the duty cycle of each of the clocks CLKDIV6, CLKDIV3, and CLKDIV2 is generally about 50%.
    </p>

      The PLL 300 receives a computer system clock as well as an output of the clock divider 300 to generate the main clock for the integrated circuit device 350.

      Referring to FIG. 6, the clock divider 100 can also be used to generate system clocks for the computer system 10.
