      A Brief Description of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The instant invention is a portable four-sided cooler box for temporarily storing food and beverages at cool temperatures within which there is to be found an internally positioned illuminating system.
      <br/>
      The system is locatable within the inner walling of the box or within the inner walling of a lid hingeably attached to such a cooler box.
      <br/>
      The system consists of an incandescent light bulb held in seating means within one compartment within such inner walling over the front of which, a translucent plate is removably affixable.
      <br/>
      It further consists of a portable, oversized battery unit held in seating means within a second compartment within such inner walling over the front of which, a second plate is removably affixable.
      <br/>
      It further consists of a manually operable switch and a spring loaded automatic switch.
      <br/>
      The battery unit, bulb holding seating means, and switches are connected by wiring to form a current conducing circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="9">2. Object of the Invention</p>
    <p num="10">
      It is oftentimes necessary for persons on an outdoor camping or picnic trip to open a cooler box containing food and beverages at nighttime.
      <br/>
      The instant invention enables them to readily locate and identify items of food and beverages within the box in order to then extract some of the same from the box without any need to resort to the use of an extraneous light source.
      <br/>
      The instant device in this regard is unquestionably useful under circumstances where an extraneous light source is either not readily available or indeed not available at all.

    <heading>G A DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="12">
      FIGS. 1 and 2 are perspective views of the two embodiments of the instant invention.
      <br/>
      The two embodiments differ only that one embodiment shown in FIG. 1 is characterized by the presence of a hingeably affixed lid 2 affixed to an insulated hollowed out, four sided cooler box 1 while the embodiment shown in FIG. 2 is characterized by the presence of a completely removable lid 2.
      <br/>
      The illuminating system of the invention is found within inner walling of lid 2 in the first embodiment and is found within inner walling of box 1 in the second embodiment.
      <br/>
      The illuminating systems of each embodiment are one and the same differing only with respect to the location thereof within the invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 is an exploded view of the illuminating system.
      <br/>
      A manually operable first switching mechanism 3 is affixed to the inner walling of lid 2 (first embodiment) or box 1 (second embodiment) near to a first compartment 4 located within such inner walling.
      <br/>
      A hollowed out second compartment 5 is also located within such inner walling.
      <br/>
      First seating means 6 for holding an incandescent light bulb 7 is located within and affixed to back walling of first compartment 5.
      <br/>
      Second seating means 8 for holding each of a pair of battery terminals 9 and 9A of an energized, portable battery unit is located within and affixed to lateral walling of second compartment 5.
      <br/>
      Second seating means 5 with terminals 9 and 9A inserted therein are shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      An automatic spring loaded second switching mechanism 11 is also affixed within such inner walling.
      <br/>
      Switching mechanism 11 is always in the "off" position when lid 2 is down and covering box 1 in either embodiment, and; whereas mechanism 11 is spring loaded, it's always up and in the "on" position when lid 2 is up as respects box 1 in the first embodiment or as respects the second embodiment, when lid 2 is actually off from box 1.
      <br/>
      Switching mechanism 3 is off during daylight hours so as to prevent bulb 7 from coming on when lid 2 is up or off box 1 in either embodiment.
      <br/>
      In either embodiment, a first pair of closed holes 12 and a second pair of closed holes 13 are respectively drilled into such inner walling into anterolateral sides of compartments 4 and 5 respectively.
      <br/>
      A translucent plate 14 seen in FIGS. 3 and 5 is affixable to such inner walling over the exterior or frontal aspect of compartment 4.
      <br/>
      A second plate 15 as seen in FIGS. 3 and 5 is affixable to such inner walling over the exterior or frontal aspect of compartment 5.
      <br/>
      A first pair of screws s18 are inserted through a first pair of through holes 16 in plate 14 and in turn are screwed into holes 12 as seen in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      A second pair of screws 19 are inserted through a second pair of through holes 17 in plate 15 and in turn are screwed into holes 13.
      <br/>
      In this way, the illuminating system is held intact within either embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The just previously described components of the illuminating system are connected to one another as can be appreciated with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7.
      <br/>
      As per FIG. 6, a first current conducting wire 20 is affixed to first seating means 6 and is connected to a first contact point 21 in switch 3.
      <br/>
      A second current conducting wire 22 is connected to and leads from a second contact point 23 in switch 3 and is in turn connected to a first contact point 24 in switching mechanism 11.
      <br/>
      A third current conducting wire 25 is connected to and leads from a second contact point 26 in second switch 11 and is connected to second seating means 5 holding terminal 9 of battery 10.
      <br/>
      A fourth current conducting wire 27 connected to and leading from second seating means 5 also holding terminal 9A of battery 10 is, in turn affixed to first seating means 6 adjacent affixation thereof of first wire 20.
    </p>
    <p num="14">In the nighttime, when switch 3 is in the "on" position, when one removes lid 2 from top edging of box 1 in either embodiment thereof causing previously depressed spring loaded switch 11 to assume an "on" position as depicted schematically in FIG. 7, the illuminating system of the invention provides the light needed to enable a person to visualize and then extract certain desired food A or beverages B stored in box 1 without any need for relying on any exterior light source to do so.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Plates 14 and 15 are readily removable and reattachable for purposes of enabling one to easily replace bulb 7 or battery 10.
      <br/>
      The instant invention is hence quite convenient to use.
    </p>
    <p num="16">In conclusion for the reasons cited above, it is respectfully submitted that the instant invention is indeed not only new and unique but also unquestionably useful.</p>
