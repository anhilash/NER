      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a monolithic varistor, more particularly, to a monolithic varistor which comprises ZnO as a primary component and has a varistor voltage of 100 V or more.
      <br/>
      The present invention also relates to a ceramic for producing the varistor and to a method for producing the varistor.
      <br/>
      Throughout the specification, "varistor voltage" refers to voltage across the varistor measured at a current of 1 mA.

    <p num="3">2. Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In recent years, development of a chip-type element and employment of higher frequencies have progressed along with the trend of miniaturization of electronic devices and higher-speed circuit operation.
      <br/>
      In addition, such an element is required to have a reduced size, especially in terms of height, in order to increase the packaging density of a circuit.
      <br/>
      A non-linear resistor, i.e., varistor serving as a noise-absorbing element, is not an exception; a chip-type varistor which is formed of a ceramic predominantly comprising zinc oxide or strontium titanate has brought on the market.
      <br/>
      In contrast, a single-layer varistor having lead terminals or a varistor in which a single varistor layer is "molded-in" a resin or glass has been used as a varistor having a high varistor voltage such as a varistor for alternating current.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      However, the conventionally employed single-layer varistor has a drawback that when the maximum peak current is desired to be increased, the electrode area must also be enlarged, thus failing to attain miniaturization of the varistor; whereas miniaturization of the varistor is possible only at the cost of maximum peak current.
      <br/>
      Thus, miniaturization of a varistor having a varistor voltage of 100 V or more has seen no progress.
      <br/>
      To cope with the dilemma, a monolithic ceramic varistor comprising a layered ceramic body in which a plurality of internal electrodes are formed is desirable.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, the varistor voltage per unit thickness thereof must be increased.
      <br/>
      To this end, the grain size of the ceramic must be reduced without lowering the maximum peak current per unit area.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="20">Effects provided by the additive components and the criteria for determining limitations on the amounts thereof will next be described.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Al2 O3 lowers the clamping voltage and slightly elevates the varistor voltage.
      <br/>
      When Al2 O3 content is about 100 ppm or more, the clamping voltage decreases, and as the amount of added Al2 O3 increases, the clamping voltage is gradually stabilized.
      <br/>
      However, when Al2 O3 content exceeds about 250 ppm,  ALPHA  begins to decrease.
      <br/>
      As described hereinlater, the value of  ALPHA  is determined from  ALPHA =1/log(V10mA/V1mA) with the output voltage (V10mA) being measured when a current of 10 mA is applied between the Ag electrodes provided at opposite ends of the test piece.
      <br/>
      When  ALPHA  is 30 or more, the leakage current provides substantially no effect on a circuit.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the upper limit is determined as about 350 ppm where a becomes less than 30.
      <br/>
      The maximum peak current is more preferable when the Al2 O3 content is about 200-300 ppm.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      B2 O3 serves to exhibit a varistor characteristic and enhances sinterability.
      <br/>
      When the B2 O3 content is less than about 1.0 mol %, varistor voltage and a increase but sinterability is poor and maximum peak current decreases; whereas when it is in excess of about 3.0 mol %, maximum peak current decreases due to anomalous grain growth to lower homogeneity of the grains.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Co2 O3 serves to increase the value of  ALPHA .
      <br/>
      When the content is in excess of about 0.1 mol %,  ALPHA  is 30 or more.
      <br/>
      However, when it is in excess of about 1.5 mol %, Co2 O3 is deposited in grain boundaries to thereby prevent grain growth and disadvantageously elevate varistor voltage and clamping voltage.
      <br/>
      In the case of Co2 O3 and other additives, when clamping voltage ratio is in excess of 1.7, the maximum peak current decreases drastically.
      <br/>
      This phenomenon relates to the sinterability and heat generation of an element.
      <br/>
      Briefly, when sinterability is poor and both clamping voltage and varistor voltage are high, maximum peak current decreases.
      <br/>
      When varistor voltage per unit thickness is in excess of 2500 V/mm, the sinterability becomes poor and heat generation of the element increases to thereby reduce maximum peak current.
      <br/>
      When the content of Co2 O3 is about 0.3-1 mol %,  ALPHA  and maximum peak current are more preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      MnO has the effect of increasing  ALPHA  as in the case of Co2 O3.
      <br/>
      However, when the MnO content is about 0.1 mol % or less, the effect is insignificant, whereas when it is in excess of about 1.0 mol %, maximum peak current decreases and clamping voltage increases as in the case of Co2 O3.
      <br/>
      When the MnO content is about 0.3-1 mol %, more preferable values are obtained for  ALPHA  and maximum peak current.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Sb2 O3 and SnO have the effect of increasing varistor voltage and  ALPHA .
      <br/>
      When the Sb2 O3 and/or SnO content is about 0.1 mol %,  ALPHA  is 30 or more and varistor voltage increases; whereas when it is in excess of about 2.0 mol %, maximum peak current decreases.
      <br/>
      The Sb component and the Sn component may be used singly or in combination.
      <br/>
      When the Sb2 O3 and/or SnO content is about 1-2 mol %, varistor voltage and  ALPHA  exhibit more preferable values.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Y2 O3 increases a when added in a relatively small amount and varistor voltage when added in a relatively large amount.
      <br/>
      The addition of Y2 O3 prevents variation of clamping voltage ratio and is effective for regulating varistor voltage.
      <br/>
      However, when the Y2 O3 content is about 3.0 mol % or more, sintering is inhibited and maximum peak current decreases.
      <br/>
      When the Y2 O3 content is about 1-3 mol %, varistor voltage exhibits more preferable values.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      SiO2 and B2 O3 may be added singly or in the form of glass together with the Bi component or the Zn component.
      <br/>
      When SiO2 and B2 O3 are added in the form of glass, they lower sintering temperature due to formation of the liquid phase.
      <br/>
      When SiO2 and/or B2 O3 are added by way of SiO2 alone or B2 O3 alone, they lower sintering temperature and serve as sintering aids.
      <br/>
      Thus, SiO2 and B2 O3 individually have the effect of increasing  ALPHA .
      <br/>
      However, when they are added in large amounts, anomalous grain growth occurs and crystals of zinc silicate or zinc borate are deposited to thereby cause drastic decrease and variation of varistor voltage.
      <br/>
      Therefore, SiO2 content is limited to about 0.1-1 mol % and B2 O3 content is limited to about 0.1-2.0 mol %. When SiO2 content is about 0.1-0.3 mol % or B2 O3 content is about 0.2-0.7 mol %, more preferable values are attained with respect to varistor voltage, maximum peak current and  ALPHA .
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The layered ceramic body described above is sintered at a firing temperature of 850-900 (degree)  C. During sintering, grain growth is suppressed to thereby enhance varistor voltage per unit thickness.
      <br/>
      The average grain size of the characteristic portion of the layered ceramic body relates to clamping voltage.
      <br/>
      When average grain size is less than about 0.9  MU m, clamping voltage disadvantageously increases due to, for example, poor sintering, whereas when it is about 3.0  MU m or more, clamping voltage disadvantageously increases due to increase of grain boundary deposits formed from excessive additives or through over-proceeded reaction.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the average grain size of the characteristic portion of the layered ceramic body is preferably about 0.9-3.0  MU m . As used herein, the characteristic portion refers to a portion which provides the varistor characteristic and is sandwiched by internal electrodes having a different polarity in the layered ceramic body.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In addition, varistor voltage per unit thickness is a factor which is important in designing an element and determines maximum peak current.
      <br/>
      When varistor voltage per unit thickness is excessively high, the element is adversely affected.
      <br/>
      Thus, varistor voltage has an upper limit.
      <br/>
      For example, when varistor voltage per unit thickness is in excess of 2500 V/mm, maximum peak current decreases due to, for example, poor sintering.
      <br/>
      When it is less than 1000 V/mm, there can be obtained varistor characteristics similar to those of a conventional product; because  ALPHA  is low and when varistor voltage is designed to be 100 V or more, a desired characteristic area cannot be obtained due to an increase in the thickness of a characteristic layer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, varistor voltage per unit thickness is preferably about 1000-2500 V/mm.
    </p>

      The resultant powder was calcined at 750 (degree)  C. for two hours.
      <br/>
      The obtained calcined material was roughly pounded, followed by additional mixing and pulverization by use of a ball mill.

      The resultant slurry was dehydrated and dried to thereby obtain a powder.

    <p num="31">
      To the powder were added a solvent, a binder and a dispersant, and the mixture was formed into a sheet having a thickness of 50  MU m. The sheet was punched to a predetermined size to thereby obtain a plurality of ceramic green sheets 10.
      <br/>
      Pt paste 12 was applied, through screen printing, onto a portion of each green sheet 10 in a pattern, for example, as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The patterns of the Pt paste 12 would later be fired to become internal electrodes 16 of a monolithic varistor.

      Further, the green sheets 10 were layered in predetermined arrangements and in a predetermined sequence to thereby obtain a laminate.

      <br/>
      Ag paste for forming external electrodes was applied to the portions of the internal electrodes 16 exposed at both side surfaces of the layered ceramic body 14.

      <br/>
      Maximum peak current (Ip(A)) is defined as the value of a wavefront of the current applied immediately before the final application of current that caused breakdown of the test piece.

      The grains contained in the characteristic portion 18 of the layered ceramic body 14 were observed under a SEM (scanning electron microscope) so as to measured the average grain size ( MU m).
      <br/>
      FIG. 21 shows the relationship between average grain size and clamping voltage ratio.
    </p>
    <p num="45">As is apparent from FIG. 21, if the average grain size in the characteristic portion 18 of the layered ceramic body 14 is less than about 0.9  MU m, clamping voltage ratio increases due to insufficient sintering and like causes, whereas if the average grain size is about 3  MU m or more, the clamping voltage ratio increases due to increase of grain boundary deposits formed from excessive additives or through over-proceeded reaction.</p>
    <p num="46">
      As described above, the present invention provides a monolithic varistor which is small, inexpensive and has high performance in suppressing surge voltage.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the present invention provides, for example, a monolithic varistor chip having a varistor voltage of 100-500 V in an element of 4.5 * 3.2 * 2.0-2.5 (mm).
      <br/>
      The monolithic varistor chip has a performance equivalent to that of a conventional single-layered varistor having a chip size of 8.0 * 5.6 * 2.0 (mm).
      <br/>
      Further, the monolithic varistor chip exhibits improved performance in suppressing surge voltage, exhibiting a clamping voltage ratio of about 1/5that of a conventional single-layered varistor.
