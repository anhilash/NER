    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      This invention relates to methods, compositions and kits for determining an analyte in a sample.
      <br/>
      In particular, this invention relates to compositions that exhibit a high quantum yield chemiluminescence when activated by singlet oxygen, decay rapidly and emit at long wavelengths.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The clinical diagnostic field has seen a broad expansion in recent years, both as to the variety of materials (analytes) that may be readily and accurately determined, as well as the methods for the determination.
      <br/>
      Convenient, reliable and non-hazardous means for detecting the presence of low concentrations of materials in liquids is desired.
      <br/>
      In clinical chemistry these materials may be present in body fluids in concentrations below 10-12 molar.
      <br/>
      The difficulty of detecting low concentrations of these materials is enhanced by the relatively small sample sizes that can be utilized.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In developing an assay there are many considerations.
      <br/>
      One consideration is the signal response to changes in the concentration of analyte.
      <br/>
      A second consideration is the ease with which the protocol for the assay may be carried out.
      <br/>
      A third consideration is the variation in interference from sample to sample.
      <br/>
      Ease of preparation and purification of the reagents, availability of equipment, ease of automation and interaction with material of interest are some of the additional considerations in developing a useful assay.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One broad category of techniques involves the use of a receptor which can specifically bind to a particular spacial and polar organization of a labeled ligand as a function of the presence of an analyte.
      <br/>
      The observed effect of binding by the receptor will depend upon the label.
      <br/>
      In some instances the binding of the receptor merely provides for a differentiation in molecular weight between bound and unbound labeled ligand.
      <br/>
      In other instances the binding of the receptor will facilitate separation of bound labeled ligand from free labeled ligand or it may affect the nature of the signal obtained from the label so that the signal varies with the amount of receptor bound to labeled ligand.
      <br/>
      A further variation is that the receptor is labeled and the ligand unlabeled.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, both the receptor and ligand are labeled or different receptors are labeled with two different labels, whereupon the labels interact when in close proximity and the amount of ligand present affects the degree to which the labels of the receptor may interact.
    </p>
    <p num="7">There is a continuing need for new and accurate techniques that can be adapted for a wide spectrum of different ligands or be used in specific cases where other methods may not be readily adaptable.</p>
    <p num="8">
      Homogeneous immunoassays have previously been described for small molecules.
      <br/>
      These assays include SYVA's FRAT.RTM. assay, EMIT.RTM. assay, enzyme channeling immunoassay, and fluorescence energy transfer immunoassay (FETI); enzyme inhibitor immunoassays (Hoffman LaRoche and Abbott Laboratories): fluorescence polarization immunoassay (Dandlicker), among others.
      <br/>
      All of these methods have limited sensitivity, and only a few including FETI and enzyme channeling, are suitable for large multiepitopic analytes.
      <br/>
      Luminescent compounds, such as fluorescent compounds and chemiluminescent compounds, find wide application in the assay field because of their ability to emit light.
      <br/>
      For this reason, luminescers have been utilized as labels in assays such as nucleic acid assays and immunoassays.
      <br/>
      For example, a member of a specific binding pair is conjugated to a luminescer and various protocols are employed.
      <br/>
      The luminescer conjugate can be partitioned between a solid phase and a liquid phase in relation to the amount of analyte in a sample suspected of containing the analyte.
      <br/>
      By measuring the luminescence of either of the phases, one can relate the level of luminescence observed to a concentration of the analyte in the sample.

    <p num="9">
      Particles, such as liposomes and erythrocyte ghosts, have been utilized as carriers of encapsulated water soluble materials.
      <br/>
      For example, liposomes have been employed to encapsulate biologically active material for a variety of uses, such as drug delivery systems wherein a medicament is entrapped during liposome preparation and then administered to the patient-to be treated.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Particles, such as latex beads and liposomes, have also been utilized in assays.
      <br/>
      For example, in homogeneous assays an enzyme may be entrapped in the aqueous phase of a liposome labelled with an antibody or antigen.
      <br/>
      The liposomes are caused to release the enzyme in the presence of a sample and complement.
      <br/>
      Antibody- or antigen-labelled liposomes, having water soluble fluorescent or non-fluorescent dyes encapsulated within an aqueous phase or lipid soluble dyes dissolved in the lipid bilayer of the lipid vesicle or in latex beads, have also been utilized to assay for analytes capable of entering into an immunochemical reaction with the surface bound antibody or antigen.
      <br/>
      Detergents have been used to release the dyes from the aqueous phase of the liposomes.

      <br/>

      The photosensitizer is capable in its excited state of activating oxygen to its singlet state.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="28">
      The present invention is directed to chemiluminescent compositions that upon activation by singlet oxygen exhibit chemiluminescent emission that rapidly decays, generally having a half life of 0.5 seconds to 30 minutes, preferably 0.5 to 30 seconds, usually less than twenty seconds.
      <br/>
      In addition, the present chemiluminescent compositions can exhibit high chemiluminescent quantum yield upon activation by singlet oxygen, generally 0.1 to 0.9, usually 0.1 to 0.6, preferably 0.2 to 0.4. The chemiluminescent light emitted by the metal chelate after activation in the present compositions generally has a wave length of about 550 to 700 nm, usually greater than 600 nm.
      <br/>
      The chemiluminescent compositions of the present invention are particularly useful in luminescent assays.
      <br/>
      For example, the long wavelength emission avoids interference from serum absorption in assays on blood or serum samples.
      <br/>
      The high quantum yield improves detectibility and the short lifetime further improves detectibility by causing all the light that is emitted to be delivered in a short pulse rather than over an extended period of time.
      <br/>
      This can provide higher light intensity at lower quantum yields.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The quantum yield of chemiluminescence of the present chemiluminescent compositions, when activated by singlet oxygen, is generally about 10 to 100 fold greater, preferably, 10 to 50 fold greater, than that observed upon irradiation of the components of the composition separately.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the rate of decay of chemiluminescence is significantly enhanced with some of the present compositions.
      <br/>
      These properties render the present compositions extremely useful in assays for the determination of analytes.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Before proceeding further with a description of the specific embodiments of the present invention, a number of terms will be defined and described in detail.</p>
    <p num="31">
      Metal ligand--a compound in which two or more atoms of the same molecule can coordinate with a metal to form a metal chelate.
      <br/>
      The metal chelates that form part of the compositions of the present invention comprise a metal selected from the group consisting of europium, terbium, dysprosium, samarium, osmium and ruthenium.
      <br/>
      One of the above metals is coordinated with one or more metal ligands, which may be, for example, 3-(2-thienoly)-1,1,1-trifluoroacetone (TTA), 3-benzoyl-1,1,1-trifluoroacetone (BFTA), 3-naphthoyl-1,1,1-trifluoroacetone (NPPTA), 2,2-dimethyl-4-perfluorobutyoyl-3-butanone (fod), 2,2'-dipyridyl (bpy), phenanthroline(phen), salicylic acid, phenanthroline carboxylic acid, bipyridyl carboxylic acid, aza crown ethers trioctylphosphine oxide, aza cryptands, and so forth.
      <br/>
      Usually, the metal in the metal chelate is at least hexacoordinated, but may be octacoordinated or more highly coordinated depending on the metal ligands.
      <br/>
      The metal chelate will be uncharged, thus the number of acidic groups provided by its ligands will equal the oxidation state of the metal.
      <br/>
      Usually, the metal ligands will be relatively hydrophobic so as to impart solubility of the metal chelate in non-polar solvents.
      <br/>
      Rare earth metals will usually have an oxidation state of three, ruthenium will have an oxidation state of two and osmium will have an oxidation state of two.
      <br/>
      Examplary of such metal chelates, by way of illustration and not limitation, is as follows:  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="32">One TTA in 3(a) or 3(b) can be placed by one of the following:  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="33">wherein DPP (Diphenylphenanthroline) in 3(b) can be replaced by one of the following:  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="34">Two TTA's in 3(a) and 3(b) can be independently replaced by compounds selected from the following:  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="35">Three TTA's can be independently replaced by compounds selected from the following:  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="36">
      Many of these metal ligands and metal chelates are known in the art and many are commercially available.
      <br/>
      In general, metal chelates can be prepared from metal ligands by combining the metal chloride with the desired ratio of metal ligand molecules in an organic solvent such as, e.g., acetonitrile and sufficient base, e.g., pyridine, to take up the released hydrochloric acid.
      <br/>
      For example, metal chelates can be prepared by a procedure such as that described by Shinha, A. P., "Fluorescences and laser action in rare earth chelates," Spectroscopy Inorganic Chemistry, Vol 2, (1971), 255-288.

      <br/>
      The analyte can be a part of a cell such as bacteria or a cell bearing a blood group antigen such as A, B, D, etc., or an HLA antigen or a microorganism, e.g., bacterium, fungus, protozoan, or virus.

      Photosensitizer--a sensitizer for generation of singlet oxygen usually by excitation with light.
      <br/>
      The photosensitizer can be photoactivatable (e.g., dyes and aromatic compounds) or chemiactivated (e.g., enzymes and metal salts).
      <br/>
      When excited by light the photosensitizer is usually a compound comprised of covalently bonded atoms, usually with multiple conjugated double or triple bonds.
      <br/>
      The compound should absorb light in the wavelength range of 200-1100 nm, usually 300-1000 nm, preferably 450-950 nm, with an extinction coefficient at its absorbance maximum greater than 500 M-1 cm-1, preferably at least 5000 M1 cm-1, more preferably at least 50,000 M-1 cm-1 at the excitation wavelength.
      <br/>
      The lifetime of an excited state produced following absorption of light in the absence of oxygen will usually be at least 100 nsec, preferably at least 1 msec.
      <br/>
      In general, the lifetime must be sufficiently long to permit energy transfer to oxygen, which will normally be present at concentrations in the range of 105 to 10-1 M depending on the medium.
      <br/>
      The sensitizer excited state will usually have a different spin quantum number (S) than its ground state and will usually be a triplet (S=1) when, as is usually the case, the ground state is a singlet (S=0).
      <br/>
      Preferably, the sensitizer will have a high intersystem crossing yield.
      <br/>
      That is, photoexcitation of a sensitizer will produce the long lived state (usually triplet) with an efficiency of at least 10%, desirably at least 40%, preferably greater than 80%.
      <br/>
      The photosensitizer will usually be at most weakly fluorescent under the assay conditions (quantum yield usually less that 0.5, preferably less that 0.1).
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Photosensitizers that are to be excited by light will be relatively photostable and will not react efficiently with singlet oxygen.
      <br/>
      Several structural features are present in most useful sensitizers.
      <br/>
      Most sensitizers have at least one and frequently three or more conjugated double or triple bonds held in a rigid, frequently aromatic structure.
      <br/>
      They will frequently contain at least one group that accelerates intersystem crossing such as a carbonyl or imine group or a heavy atom selected from rows 3-6 of the periodic table, especially iodine or bromine, or they may have extended aromatic structures.
      <br/>
      Typical sensitizers include acetone, benzophenone, 9-thioxanthone, eosin, 9,10-dibromoanthracene, methylene blue, metalloporphyrins, such as hematoporphyrin, phthalocyanines, chlorophylls, rose bengal, buckminsterfullerene, etc., and derivatives of these compounds having substituents of 1 to 50 atoms for rendering such compounds more lipophilic or more hydrophilic and/or as attaching groups for attachment, for example, to an sbp member.
      <br/>
      Examples of other photosensitizers that may be utilized in the present invention are those that have the above properties and are enumerated in N. J. Turro, "Molecular Photochemistry", page 132, W. A. Benjamin Inc., N.Y. 1965.
    </p>
    <p num="71">The photosensitizers are preferably relatively non-polar to assure dissolution into a lipophilic member when the photosensitizer is incorporated in an oil droplet, liposome, latex particle, etc.</p>
    <p num="72">
      The photosensitizers useful in this invention are also intended to include other substances and compositions that can produce singlet oxygen with or, less preferably, without activation by an external light source.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, molybdate (MoO4=) salts and chloroperoxidase and myeloperoxidase plus bromide or chloride ion (Kanofsky, J. Biol. Chem. (1983) 259 5596) have been shown to catalyze the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to singlet oxygen and water.
      <br/>
      Either of these compositions can, for example, be included in particles to which is bound an sbp member and used in the assay method wherein hydrogen peroxide is included as an ancillary reagent, chloroperoxidase is bound to a surface and molybdate is incorporated in the aqueous phase of a liposome.
      <br/>
      Also included within the scope of the invention as photosensitizers are compounds that are not true sensitizers but which on excitation by heat, light, or chemical activation will release a molecule of singlet oxygen.
      <br/>
      The best known members of this class of compounds includes the endoperoxides such as 1,4-biscarboxyethyl-1,4-naphthalene endoperoxide, 9,10-diphenylanthracene-9,10-endoperoxide and 5,6,11,12-tetraphenyl naphthalene 5,12-endoperoxide.
      <br/>
      Heating or direct absorption of light by these compounds releases singlet oxygen.

      The surface can be hydrophilic or capable of being rendered hydrophilic and includes inorganic powders such as silica, magnesium sulfate, and alumina; natural polymeric materials, particularly cellulosic materials and materials derived from cellulose, such as fiber containing papers, e.g., filter paper, chromatographic paper, etc.; synthetic or modified naturally occurring polymers, such as nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, poly (vinyl chloride), polyacrylamide, cross linked dextran, agarose, polyacrylate, polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(4-methylbutene), polystyrene, polymethacrylate, poly(ethylene terephthalate), nylon, polyvinyl butyrate), etc.; either used by themselves or in conjunction with other materials; glass available as Bioglass, ceramics, metals, and the like.

      Particles--particles of at least about 20 nm and not more than about 20 microns, usually at least about 40 nm and less than about 10 microns, preferably from about 0.10 to 2.0 microns diameter, normally having a volume of less than 1 picoliter.
      <br/>
      The particle may be organic or inorganic, swellable or non-swellable, porous or non-porous, having any density, but preferably of a density approximating water, generally from about 0.7 to about 1.5 g/ml, preferably suspendible in water, and composed of material that can be transparent, partially transparent, or opaque.
      <br/>
      The particles may or may not have a charge, and when they are charged, they are preferably negative.

      The particles may be solid (e.g., polymer, metal, glass, organic and inorganic such as minerals, salts and diatoms), oil droplets (e.g., hydrocarbon, fluorocarbon, silicon fluid), or vesicles (e.g., synthetic such as phospholipid or natural such as cells and organelles).
      <br/>

    <p num="76">
      The organic particles will normally be polymers, either addition or condensation polymers, which are readily dispersible in the assay medium.

      The organic particles will also be adsorptive or functionalizable so as to bind at their surface, either directly or indirectly, an sbp member and to bind at their surface or incorporate within their volume a photosensitizer or a chemiluminescent compound.

      Inorganic polymers include silicones, glasses, available as Bioglas, and the like.

      Particles may also be dispersed water insoluble dyes such as porphyrins, phthalocyanines, etc., which may also act as photosensitizers.
      <br/>
      Particles may also include diatoms, cells, viral particles, magnetosomes, cell nuclei and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="78">Where the particles are commercially available, the particle size may be varied by breaking larger particles into smaller particles by mechanical means, such as grinding, sonication, agitation, etc.</p>
    <p num="79">
      The particles will usually be polyfunctional or be capable of being polyfunctionalized or be capable of being bound to an sbp member, photosensitizer, or chemiluminescent compound through specific or non-specific covalent or non-covalent interactions.
      <br/>
      A wide variety of functional groups are available or can be incorporated.
      <br/>
      Exemplary functional groups include carboxylic acids, aldehydes, amino groups, cyano groups, ethylene groups, hydroxyl groups, mercapto groups and the like.
      <br/>
      When covalent attachment of a sbp member, chemiluminescent compound or photosensitizer to the particle is employed, the manner of linking is well known and is amply illustrated in the literature.
      <br/>
      See for example Cautrecasas, J Biol.
      <br/>
      Chem., 245:3059 (1970).
      <br/>
      The length of a linking group may vary widely, depending upon the nature of the compound being linked, the nature of the particle, the effect of the distance between the compound being linked and the particle on the binding of sbp members and the analyte and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      The photosensitizer can be chosen to dissolve in or noncovalently bind to the surface of the particles.
      <br/>
      In this case these compounds will preferably be hydrophobic to reduce their ability to dissociate from the particle and thereby cause both compounds to associate with the same particle.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      The number of photosensitizer or chemiluminescent molecules associated with each particle will on the average usually be at least one and may be sufficiently high that the particle consists entirely of photosensitizer or chemiluminescer molecules.
      <br/>
      The preferred number of molecules will be selected empirically to provide the highest signal to background in the assay.
      <br/>
      In some cases this will be best achieved by associating a multiplicity of different photosensitizer molecules to particles.
      <br/>
      Usually, the photosensitizer or chemiluminescent compound to sbp member ratio in the particles should be at least 1, preferably at least 100 to 1, and most preferably over 1,000 to 1.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Latex particles--"Latex" signifies a particulate water suspendible water insoluble polymeric material usually having particle dimensions of 20 nm to 20 mm, more preferably 100 to 1000 nm in diameter.
      <br/>
      The latex is frequently a substituted polyethylene such as: polystyrene-butadiene, polyacrylamide polystyrene, polystyrene with amino groups, poly-acrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, acrylonitrile-butadiene, styrene copolymers, polyvinyl acetate-acrylate, polyvinyl pyrridine, vinyl-chloride acrylate copolymers, and the like.
      <br/>
      Non-crosslinked polymers of styrene and carboxylated styrene or styrene functionalized with other active groups such as amino, hydroxyl, halo and the like are preferred.
      <br/>
      Frequently, copolymers of substituted styrenes with dienes such as butadiene will be used.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      The association of the photosensitizer or chemiluminescent compound with latex particles utilized in the present invention may involve incorporation during formation of the particles by polymerization but will usually involve incorporation into preformed particles, usually by noncovalent dissolution into the particles.
      <br/>
      Usually a solution of the chemiluminescent compound or sensitizer will be employed.
      <br/>
      Solvents that may be utilized include alcohols, including ethanol, ethylene glycol and benzyl alcohol; amides such as dimethyl formamide, formamide, acetamide and tetramethyl urea and the like; sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide and sulfolane; and ethers such as carbitol, ethyl carbitol, dimethoxy ethane and the like, and water.
      <br/>
      The use of solvents having high boiling points in which the particles are insoluble permits the use of elevated temperatures to facilitate dissolution of the compounds into the particles and are particularly suitable.
      <br/>
      The solvents may be used singly or in combination.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred solvents for incorporating photosensitizer are those that will not quench the triplet excited state of the photosensitizer either because of their intrinsic properties or because they can subsequently be removed from the particles by virtue of their ability to be dissolved in a solvent such as water that is insoluble in the particles.
      <br/>
      Aromatic solvents are preferred, and generally solvents that are soluble in the particle.
      <br/>
      For incorporating chemiluminescent compounds in particles a solvent should be selected that does not interfere with the luminescence because of their intrinsic properties or ability to be removed from the particles.
      <br/>
      Frequently, aromatic solvents will also be preferred.
      <br/>
      Typical aromatic solvents include dibutylphthalate, benzonitrile, naphthonitrile, dioctylterephthalate, dichlorobenzene, diphenylether, dimethoxybenzene, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      Except when the photosensitizer or chemiluminescent compound is to be covalently bound to the particles, it will usually be preferable to use electronically neutral photosensitizers or chemiluminescent compounds.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that the liquid medium selected does not soften the polymer beads to the point of stickiness.
      <br/>
      A preferred technique comprises suspending the selected latex particles in a liquid medium in which the photosensitizer or chemiluminescent compound has at least limited solubility.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the concentrations of the photosensitizer and chemiluminescent compound in the liquid media will be selected to provide particles that have the highest efficiency of singlet oxygen formation and highest quantum yield of emission from the chemiluminescent compound in the media but less concentrated solutions will sometimes be preferred.
      <br/>
      Distortion or dissolution of the particles in the solvent can be prevented by adding a miscible cosolvent in which the particles are insoluble.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      Generally, the temperature employed during the procedure will be chosen to maximize the singlet oxygen formation ability of the photosensitizer labeled particles and the quantum yield of the chemiluminescent compound particles with the proviso that the particles should not melt or become aggregated at the selected temperature.
      <br/>
      Elevated temperatures are normally employed.
      <br/>
      The temperatures for the procedure will generally range from 20 (degree)  C. to 200 (degree)  C., more usually from 50 (degree)  C. to 170 (degree)  C. It has been observed that some compounds that are nearly insoluble at room temperature, are soluble in, for example, low molecular weight alcohols, such as ethanol and ethylene glycol and the like, at elevated temperatures.
      <br/>
      Carboxylated modified latex particles have been shown to tolerate low molecular weight alcohols at such temperatures.

    <p num="86">
      An sbp member may be physically adsorbed on the surface of the latex particle or may be covalently bonded to the particle.
      <br/>
      In cases wherein the sbp member is only weakly bound to the surface of the latex particle, the binding may in certain cases be unable to endure particle-to-particle shear forces encountered during incubation and washings.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it may be preferable to covalently bond sbp members to the latex particles under conditions that will minimize adsorption.
      <br/>
      This may be accomplished by chemically activating the surface of the latex.
      <br/>
      For example, the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of surface carboxyl groups can be formed and the activated particles to reduce nonspecific binding of assay components to the particle surface, are then contacted with a linker having amino groups that will react with the ester groups or directly with an sbp member that has an amino group.
      <br/>
      The linker will usually be selected to reduce nonspecific binding of assay components to the particle surface and will preferably provide suitable functionality for both attachment to the latex particle and attachment of the sbp member.
      <br/>
      Suitable materials include maleimidated aminodextran (MAD), polylysine, aminosaccharides, and the like.
      <br/>
      MAD can be prepared as described by Hubert, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 75(7), 3143, 1978.

    <p num="87">
      In one method, MAD is first attached to carboxyl-containing latex particles using a water soluble carbodiimide, for example, 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyl carbodiimide.
      <br/>
      The coated particles are then equilibrated in reagents to prevent nonspecific binding.
      <br/>
      Such reagents include proteins such as bovine gamma globulin (BGG), and detergent, such as Tween 20, TRITON X-100 and the like.
      <br/>
      A sbp member having a sulfhydryl group, or suitably modified to introduce a sulfhydryl group, is then added to a suspension of the particles, whereupon a covalent bond is formed between the sbp member and the MAD on the particles.
      <br/>
      Any excess unreacted sbp member can then be removed by washing.

      The chemiluminescent compounds undergo a chemical reaction with singlet oxygen to form a metastable intermediate that can decompose with the simultaneous or subsequent emission of light within the wavelength range of 250 to 1200 nm.

      <br/>
      The fluorescence of serum drops off rapidly above 500 nm and becomes relatively unimportant above 550 nm.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the analyte is in serum, chemiluminescent compounds that emit light above 550 nm, preferably above 600 nm are of particular interest.
      <br/>
      In order to avoid autosensitization of the chemiluminescent compound, it is preferable that the chemiluminescent compounds do not absorb light used to excite the photosensitizer.
      <br/>
      Since it will generally be preferable to excite the sensitizer with light wavelengths longer than 500 nm, it will therefore be desirable that light absorption by the chemiluminescent compound be very low above 500 nm.

      The chemiluminescent compounds of the present invention can be prepared in a number of different ways.
      <br/>
      In one approach a 2-thioethanol derivative is condensed with an appropriate diaryl substituted alpha-hydroxy ketone (substituted benzoin) where one aryl is substituted on the ketone carbon and the other is substituted on the carbon containing the alpha-hydroxy group.
      <br/>
      The condensation reaction yields the appropriate enol ether directly.
      <br/>
      The above condensation can be carried out in an inert solvent such as toluene.
      <br/>
      Usually, the temperature of the reaction is about 90-130 (degree)  and the reaction is allowed to proceed for a period of 5-50 hours.
      <br/>
      Generally, the reaction is carried out at the reflux temperature of the combined reagents.
      <br/>
      The condensation is carried out in the presence of a Lewis acid, for example, an acyl chloride, silyl chloride, stannous chloride, etc.

      Another embodiment of the present invention is a method for determining an analyte.

      The method comprises (a) providing in combination (1) a medium suspected of containing an analyte, (2) a photosensitizer capable in its excited state of activating oxygen to a singlet state, the photosensitizer associated with a specific binding pair (sbp) member, and (3) a suspendible latex particulate material comprising Compound 2.
      <br/>
      The particulate material has bound thereto an sbp member.
      <br/>
      The combination is treated with light, usually by irradiation, to excite the photosensitizer, and is then examined for the amount of luminescence emitted.
      <br/>
      The amount of such luminescence is related to the amount of analyte in the medium.
      <br/>
      The photosensitizer may be incorporated in a second suspendible particulate material.

      Particularly useful compositions for determining an analyte in accordance with the present invention are those containing Compound 1.

    <p num="113">
      In the assay protocol the components are provided in combination and the light produced as a function of activation of oxygen by the sensitizer will be a function of analyte concentration.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, the methods of the present invention can be carried out without heating the medium to produce light.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the assay of the present invention can be conducted at a constant temperature.

    <p num="114">
      The chemiluminescent compound may be bound to a sbp member that is capable of binding directly or indirectly to the analyte or to an assay component whose concentration is affected by the presence of the analyte.
      <br/>
      The term "capable of binding directly or indirectly" means that the designated entity can bind specifically to the entity (directly) or can bind specifically to a specific binding pair member or to a complex of two or more sbp members which is capable of binding the other entity (indirectly).
      <br/>
      Preferably, assays conducted in accordance with the present invention utilize one of the above compositions in a latex particle.
      <br/>
      This latex particle has an sbp member generally capable of binding directly or indirectly to the analyte or a receptor for the analyte.
      <br/>
      When the sbp members associated with the photosensitizer and the chemiluminescent compound are both capable of binding to the analyte, a sandwich assay protocol results.
      <br/>
      When one of the sbp members associated with the photosensitizer or chemiluminescent compound can bind both the analyte and an analyte analog, a competitive assay protocol can result.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      The photosensitizer is usually caused to activate the chemiluminescent compound by irradiating the medium containing the above reactants.
      <br/>
      The medium must be irradiated with light having a wavelength with energy sufficient to convert the photosensitizer to an excited state and thereby render it capable of activating molecular oxygen to singlet oxygen.
      <br/>
      The excited state for the photosensitizer capable of exciting molecular oxygen is generally a triplet state which is more than about 20, usually at least 23, Kcal/mol more energetic than the photosensitizer ground state.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the medium is irradiated with light having a wavelength of about 450 to 950 nm although shorter wavelengths can be used, for example, 230-950 nm.
      <br/>
      The luminescence produced may be measured in any convenient manner such as photographically, visually or photometrically to determine the amount thereof, which is related to the amount of analyte in the medium.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      Although it will usually be preferable to excite the photosensitizer by irradiation with light of a wavelength that is efficiently absorbed by the photosensitizer, other means of excitation may be used as for example by energy transfer from an excited state of an energy donor such as a second photosensitizer.
      <br/>
      When a second photosensitizer is used, wavelengths of light can be used which are inefficiently absorbed by the photosensitizer but efficiently absorbed by the second photosensitizer.
      <br/>
      The second photosensitizer may be bound to an assay component that is associated, or becomes associated, with the first photosensitizer, for example, bound to a surface or incorporated in the particle having the first photosensitizer.
      <br/>
      When a second photosensitizer is employed it will usually have a lowest energy singlet state at a higher energy than the lowest energy singlet state of the first photosensitizer.

      The 632.6 nm emission line of a helium-neon laser is an inexpensive light source for excitation.

      The method and compositions of the invention may be adapted to most assays involving sbp members such as ligand-receptor; e.g., antigen-antibody reactions; polynucleotide binding assays, and so forth.

      The assays may be homogeneous or heterogeneous, competitive or noncompetitive.
      <br/>
      The assay components, chemiluminescent compound and photosensitizer, can be utilized in a number of ways with (1) a surface, when employed, (2) nucleic acid or receptor and (3) nucleic acid or ligand.
      <br/>
      The association may involve covalent or non-covalent bonds.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will be able to choose appropriate associations depending on the particular assay desired in view of the foregoing and the following illustrative discussion.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      In a homogeneous assay approach, the sample may be pretreated if necessary to remove unwanted materials.
      <br/>
      The reaction for a noncompetitive sandwich type assay can involve an sbp member, (e.g., an antibody, nucleic acid probe, receptor or ligand) complementary to the analyte and associated with a chemiluminescent compound; a photosensitizer associated with an sbp member, (e.g., antibody, nucleic acid probe, receptor or ligand) that is also complementary to the analyte; the sample of interest; and any ancillary reagents required.
      <br/>
      Preferably, at least the chemiluminescent compound is incorporated in particles to which an sbp member is attached.
      <br/>
      The photosensitizer may be directly attached to an sbp member or it may also be incorporated into particles.
      <br/>
      In a competitive protocol one sbp member can be a derivative of the analyte and the other sbp member can be complementary to the analyte, e.g., an antibody.
      <br/>
      In either protocol the components may be combined either simultaneously or wholly or partially sequentially.
      <br/>
      The ability of singlet oxygen produced by an activated photosensitizer to react with the chemiluminescent compound is governed by the binding of an sbp member to the analyte.
      <br/>
      Hence, the presence or amount of analyte can be determined by measuring the amount of light emitted upon activation of the photosensitizer by irradiation, heating or addition of a chemical reagent, preferably by irradiation.
      <br/>
      Both the binding reaction and detection of the extent thereof can be carried out in a homogeneous solution without separation.
      <br/>
      This is an advantage of the present invention over prior art methods utilizing chemiluminescence.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      In a heterogeneous assay approach, the assay components comprise a sample suspected of containing an analyte which is an sbp member; an sbp member bound to a support, which may be either a non-dispersible surface or a particle having associated with it one member of a group consisting of the chemiluminescent compound and the photosensitizer; and an sbp member having the other member of the group associated with it wherein the sbp members can independently, either directly or indirectly, bind the analyte or a receptor for the analyte.
      <br/>
      These components are generally combined either simultaneously or wholly or partially sequentially.
      <br/>
      The surface or particles are then separated from the liquid phase and either the separated phase or the liquid phase is subjected to conditions for activating the photosensitizer, usually by irradiating the particular phase in question, and measuring the amount of light emitted.

    <p num="121">
      The binding reactions in an assay for the analyte will normally be carried out in an aqueous medium at a moderate pH, generally that which provides optimum assay sensitivity.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the activation of the photosensitizer will also be carried out in an aqueous medium.
      <br/>
      However, when a separation step is employed, non-aqueous media such as, e.g., acetonitrile, acetone, toluene, benzonitrile, etc. and aqueous media with pH values that are very high, i.e., greater than 10.0, or very low, i.e., less than 4.0, usually very high, can be used.
      <br/>
      As explained above, the assay can be performed either without separation (homogeneous) or with separation (heterogeneous) of any of the assay components or products.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      The aqueous medium may be solely water or may include from 0.01 to 80 volume percent of a cosolvent but will usually include less than 40% of a cosolvent when an sbp member is used that is a protein.
      <br/>
      The pH for the medium of the binding reaction will usually be in the range of about 4 to 11, more usually in the range of about 5 to 10, and preferably in the range of about 6.5 to 9.5. When the pH is not changed during the generation of singlet oxygen the pH will usually be a compromise between optimum binding of the binding members and the pH optimum for the production of signal and the stability of other reagents of the assay.
      <br/>
      When elevated pH's are required for signal production, a step involving the addition of an alkaline reagent can be inserted between the binding reaction and generation of singlet oxygen and/or signal production.
      <br/>
      Usually the elevated pH will be greater than 10, usually 10-14.
      <br/>
      For heterogenous assays non-aqueous solvents may also be used as mentioned above, the main consideration being that the solvent not react efficiently with singlet oxygen.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      Various buffers may be used to achieve the desired pH and maintain the pH during an assay.
      <br/>
      Illustrative buffers include borate, phosphate, carbonate, tris, barbital and the like.

      The particular buffer employed is not critical to this invention, but in an individual assay one or another buffer may be preferred.

    <p num="124">
      Moderate temperatures are normally employed for carrying out the binding reactions of proteinaceous ligands and receptors in the assay and usually constant temperature, preferably, 25 (degree)  to 40 (degree) , during the period of the measurement.
      <br/>
      Incubation temperatures for the binding reaction will normally range from about 5 (degree)  to 45 (degree)  C., usually from about 15 (degree)  to 40 (degree)  C., more usually 25 (degree)  to 40 (degree)  C. Where binding of nucleic acids occur in the assay, higher temperatures will frequently be used, usually 20 (degree)  to 90 (degree) , more usually 35 (degree)  to 75 (degree)  C. Temperatures during measurements, that is, generation of singlet oxygen and light detection, will generally range from about 20 (degree)  to 100 (degree) , more usually from about 25 (degree)  to 50 (degree)  C., more usually 25 (degree)  to 40 (degree)  C.

    <p num="125">The concentration of analyte which may be assayed will generally vary from about 10-4 to below 10-16 M, more usually from about 10-6 to 10-14 M. Considerations, such as whether the assay is qualitative, semiquantitative or quantitative, the particular detection technique the concentration of the analyte of interest, and the maximum desired incubation times will normally determine the concentrations of the various reagents.</p>
    <p num="126">
      In competitive assays, while the concentrations of the various reagents in the assay medium will generally be determined by the concentration range of interest of the analyte, the final concentration of each of the reagents will normally be determined empirically to optimize the sensitivity of the assay over the range.
      <br/>
      That is, a variation in concentration of the analyte which is of significance should provide an accurately measurable signal difference.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      The concentration of the sbp members will depend on the analyte concentration, the desired rate of binding, and the degree that the sbp members bind nonspecifically.
      <br/>
      Usually, the sbp members will be present in at least the lowest expected analyte concentration, preferably at least the highest analyte concentration expected, and for noncompetitive assays the concentrations may be 10 to 106 times the highest analyte concentration but usually less than 10-4 M, preferably less than 10-6 M, frequently between 10-11 and 10-7 M. The amount of photosensitizer or chemiluminescent compound associated with a sbp member will usually be at least one molecule per sbp member and may be as high as 105, usually at least 10-104 when the photosensitizer or chemiluminescent molecule is incorporated in a particle.

    <p num="128">
      While the order of addition may be varied widely, there will be certain preferences depending on the nature of the assay.
      <br/>
      The simplest order of addition is to add all the materials simultaneously.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the reagents can be combined wholly or partially sequentially.
      <br/>
      When the assay is competitive, it will often be desirable to add the analyte analog after combining the sample and an sbp member capable of binding the analyte.
      <br/>
      Optionally, an incubation step may be involved after the reagents are combined, generally ranging from about 30 seconds to 6 hours, more usually from about 2 minutes to 1 hour before the sensitizer is caused to generate singlet oxygen and the light emission is measured.

      In a particularly preferred order of addition, a first set of specific binding pair members that are complementary to and/or homologous with the analyte are combined with the analyte followed by the addition of specific binding pair members complementary to the first specific binding pair members, each associated with a different member of the group consisting of a photosensitizer and a composition of the present invention.

      All monoclonal antibodies were produced by standard hybrid cell technology.
      <br/>
      Briefly, the appropriate immunogen was injected into a host, usually a mouse or other suitable animal, and after a suitable period of time the spleen cells from the host were obtained.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, unsensitized cells from the host were isolated and directly sensitized with the immunogen in vitro.
      <br/>
      Hybrid cells were formed by fusing the above cells with an appropriate myeloma cell line and culturing the fused cells.
      <br/>
      The antibodies produced by the cultured hybrid cells were screened for their binding affinity to the particular antigen, e.g. TSH or HCG.

      A number of screening techniques were employed such as, for example, ELISA screens.
