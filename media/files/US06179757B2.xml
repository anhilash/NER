      Exercise apparatus for strengthening the arm, shoulder, and back muscles.
      <br/>
      A weight bearing bar capable of holding free weights is moved through a path as the user draws a pair of elongate handles over the front of the body.
      <br/>
      As the weight bearing bar is moved, the moment arm of the weight is reduced, thereby reducing the effort required to draw the elongate levers downward as the leverage of the user's muscles declines.
      <br/>
      The elongate handles are mounted to a moveable assembly which is rotatable over a limited range and also is pivotable toward the user.
      <br/>
      The apparatus may be placed in a storage position when use is complete.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention pertains to exercise equipment and particularly to exercise equipment for muscles of the arms, shoulders, and back of the user.</p>
    <p num="2">
      In the field of body exercise and strength training, there is a need to exercise the upper body and arms under a resistive load.
      <br/>
      Various devices have been developed to provide a resistive force to the user as the user moves his or her arms from a position with the arms extended above the head to a position with the hands positioned below the shoulders.
      <br/>
      In such equipment, the resistance is routinely provided by an arrangement of cables and pulleys which vertically lift a stack of weights as the handles of the device are brought downward.
      <br/>
      In such devices, the resistance provided by the machine remains constant, regardless whether the user has the arms and shoulders in a relatively stronger or weaker position.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In other devices, free weights mount to lever arms at a relatively high position, requiring an attendant or the user to lift free weights high in the air to mount them to the apparatus.
      <br/>
      As the user pulls down on levers, the resistance provided by the weights varies little if any as the arms are moved from an overhead position to a position in front of the chest.
    </p>
    <p num="4">In other devices, elaborate counterbalance features are required in order to make the apparatus useful to those users with lesser upper body strength due to the weight of the weight bearing structure even when not loaded.</p>
    <p num="5">A need exists for an easily used, safe, pull-over exercise machine which can be used by persons of various strengths and sizes and which varies the resistive load to the muscles of the arms, shoulders and back as muscle strength and leverage decline, thereby improving exercise of the muscles over a range of motion of the arms.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention provides a safe and effective exercise machine which provides a varying resistance to the exercised muscles as the leverage and strength of the muscles increase or decrease over a range of motion.
      <br/>
      The invention provides an apparatus which safely exercises the muscles of the arms, shoulders and back as the arms are moved from a fully extended overhead position to a position with elbows at the side of the body.
      <br/>
      A base frame is provided with an inclined bench and seat mounted over it which allows a user to easily place himself or herself in position to exercise in a reclined position.
      <br/>
      The bench is inclined downwardly toward a first end of the base frame.
      <br/>
      A cushioned bar is mounted below the seat so that the user can place his or her legs around the cushioned bar and lock the bar behind the knees to restrain upward movement of the user's body when the loaded handles are pulled downward.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      An upright support member is positioned on the base frame between the inclined bench and the second end of the base frame.
      <br/>
      Pivotally mounted to the top of the upright support is a moveable assembly which comprises a first lever and an arm mounted perpendicularly to the lever which extends away from the bench.
      <br/>
      At the free end of the arm is a transverse bar.
      <br/>
      Free weights may be selectively placed on the transverse bar as desired by the user to provide the preferred resistive load of the machine.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The arm of the moveable assembly is equipped with a downwardly depending stub arm to the side of which a roller is mounted.
      <br/>
      The roller may roll along the side of a rest support post mounted at the end of the frame to center the moveable assembly behind the user.
      <br/>
      The moveable assembly may be parked in a storage position with the roller resting in a cradle atop a rest support post mounted near the second end of the base.
      <br/>
      The first lever of the moveable assembly is provided with a cross member at its free end.
      <br/>
      The cross member is centered on the first lever and each end of the cross member has an elongate handle angularly extending from it toward the upper end of the bench.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      After loading the transverse bar with free weights as desired, the user may position himself or herself on the machine, reach upwardly and grasp the elongate handles and pull down on the handles slightly to lift the roller from the cradle.
      <br/>
      The user then rotates the moveable assembly slightly so the roller is out of alignment with the cradle and then may fully extend the arms overhead to commence an exercise session.
      <br/>
      The exercise activity comprises alternately retracting and extending the arms to exercise the upper body muscles as the weights on the transverse bar are moved over a path which reduces the moment arm of the weights as the handles are pulled downward.
      <br/>
      When the exercise session is finished, the user retracts the handles part way and rotates the moveable assembly to alignment over the rest support and then lowers the roller into the cradle to rest the apparatus in its storage position.
    </p>
    <p num="10">It is an object of the invention to provide an overhead pull apparatus which eases in resistance as the arms are moved to positions of reduced strength and leverage.</p>
    <p num="11">It is also an object of the invention to provide an exercise apparatus which prevents the user from being displaced as the user pulls on the overhead pull levers.</p>
    <p num="12">It is a further object of the invention to provide an overhead pull apparatus which allows the user to remove the apparatus from a storage position while in position on the device ready to exercise.</p>
    <p num="13">It is a further object of the invention to provide an overhead pull exercise apparatus which may be used by persons of a wide variety of strengths and sizes.</p>
    <p num="14">These and other objects will be understood from review of the detailed description below.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      In FIG. 1, the preferred embodiment of the invention is isometrically illustrated, while a front elevation of the device is shown in FIG. 2 with weight plates 55 thereon shown in phantom.
      <br/>
      A base frame 2 includes a first end 4 and a second end 6, with a user support assembly 8 mounted above the base frame 2 and substantially axially centered thereon above central rail 10.
      <br/>
      User support assembly 8 comprises a first upright member 12 mounted to central rail 10 which, at its higher end 16, supports inclined rail 18.
      <br/>
      Inclined rail 18 is supported at its lower end 19 by its mounting atop support post 20 which is mounted upright upon first end 4 of base frame 2.
      <br/>
      Inclined bench 14 is mounted upon inclined rail 18 and is disposed above seat 22 which depends from inclined rail 18 in a generally horizontal direction.
      <br/>
      Seat 22 and inclined bench 14 provide a rest on which the exercising user may recline.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      A knee lock bar 24 is transversely mounted below seat 22 so that a user may place the user's legs around knee lock bar 24 such that it is behind the user's knees while the user sits on the seat 22 so that the user's pulling on handle members 62 and 64 will not pull the user upward along inclined bench 14.
      <br/>
      Knee lock bar 24 is provided with foam surrounds 30 to cushion it.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Disposed between user support assembly 8 and second end 6 of base frame 2 is moveable assembly 32 which comprises a first lever 34 which is pivotable at its lower end upon pivot support member 36.
      <br/>
      An elongate arm 40 cantilevers perpendicularly from first lever 34 toward the second end 6 of base frame 2.
      <br/>
      A gusset 37 strengthens the mounting of elongate arm 40 to first lever 34.
      <br/>
      A stabilizer beam 45 is disposed between first upright member 12 and pivot support member 36.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      At the free end 44 of elongate arm 40 is transversely mounted a weight carrying bar 46 which is provided with a central segment 48 and opposing rod ends 50, 52.
      <br/>
      Weight carrying bar 46 is centered on free end 44 of arm 40, but central segment 48 is not.
      <br/>
      Hence, one rod end 50 of weight carrying bar 46 is longer than the other rod end 52.
      <br/>
      Weight carrying bar 46 is provided to receive commonly used free weights 55 of circular plate shape which may be selectively added or removed from weight carrying bar 46 according to the resistance desired by the user.
      <br/>
      Weight plate 55 is preferably an "Olympic" weight with a two-inch diameter hole.
      <br/>
      Hence rod ends 50, 52 are preferably slightly less then two inches in diameter.
      <br/>
      Resilient washers 53 are mounted adjacent the opposing ends of central segment 48.
    </p>
    <p num="20">The height of pivot support member 36 is selected such that the weight carrying bar 46 is never movable past a vertical over pivot pin 43.</p>
    <p num="21">
      At the upper end 58 of first lever 34 is mounted a cross member 60 to which are mounted handle members 62 and 64 at the opposing ends of cross member 60.
      <br/>
      Left and right handle members 62 and 64 extend upwardly and toward upper end 26 of inclined bench 14 at an angle of approximately forty-five degrees from the axis of first lever 34.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Mounted to and depending below arm 40 is a stub arm 54 which is fixed to arm 40 at an acute angle from free end 44 thereof, and thereby extends toward second end 6 of base frame 2 such that, as moveable assembly 32 pivots about pivot pin 43 away from inclined bench 14, the free end of stub arm 54 will reach abutment on top of second end 6 of base frame 2 and prevent further rotation of moveable assembly 32.
      <br/>
      The length of stub arm 54 may be selected such that handle members 62 and 64 will be moveable just out of the reach of the outstretched hands of most users.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the apparatus is typically parked in an intermediate position for storage at which the handles may be easily grasped by most users.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Stub arm 54 is provided with a bearing member, specifically a roller 42 mounted to one of its sides.
      <br/>
      The roller 42 is disposed so its axis is generally parallel to the axis of arm 40 and further so that roller 42 may rest in a storage position on the top of rest support post 38.
      <br/>
      Rest support post 38 extends above base frame 2 and is disposed angularly such that the locus of travel of roller 42 will generally coincide with the incline of rest support post 38.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In FIG. 5 it is seen that each handle member 62 and 64 is provided with an inwardly directed segment 66, 68, each distal from the mounting of each handle member 62, 64 to cross member 60.
      <br/>
      Curved handle members 62, 64 are slightly concave relative to the space between them and are sleeved with cushioned material or a cushioning coating.
      <br/>
      The angle of inwardly directed segments 66 and 68 is selected to provide a comfortable hold for the user who will reach over his or her head to grasp handle members 62, 64 along inwardly directed segments 66, 68.
      <br/>
      This arrangement facilitates the user in drawing handles 62, 64 from a position above the user's head to a position even with the user's chest without allowing the elbows of the user to spread from his or her body, thereby preventing unnecessary stress on the ball and sockets of the shoulders of the user.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 3 discloses the detail of the compound pivot member 28 interconnecting moveable assembly 32 and pivot support member 36.
      <br/>
      A U-shaped yoke 70 is fixed by pivot pin 43 to first lever 34 such that first lever 34 may pivot about pivot pin 43.
      <br/>
      The first lever 34 is moveable within a vertical plane defined by the axes of pivot support member 36 and stabilizing beam 45.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      U-shaped yoke 70 is fixed at its lower end 76 to upper bearing plate 72 which is separated by a washer or other similar bearing element from lower bearing plate 74.
      <br/>
      Thus U-shaped yoke 70 and hence moveable assembly 32 may rotate upon pivot support member 36 about its substantially vertical axis.
      <br/>
      The axial rotation of moveable assembly 32 is limited by the presence of tongue 78 which protrudes into the space between opposing legs 71 and 73 of U-shaped yoke 70.
      <br/>
      Tongue 78 is fixedly mounted to stabilizing arm 45 by vertical post 80.
      <br/>
      Transversely mounted below tongue 78 is plate 82 which provides adjustment screws 84, 86 at the opposing ends of plate 82.
      <br/>
      Adjusting screws 84 and 86 are selectively adjusted to provide limits for the rotation of upper bearing plate 72, thereby limiting the range of rotation of moveable assembly 32 to about ten degrees of rotation.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      FIG. 4 illustrates the structure and function of roller 42 when moveable assembly 32 has been lifted from its storage position with roller 42 resting in concave cradle 41 which is mounted atop rest support post 38.
      <br/>
      If the user does not exert equal force on each of handles 62, 64 as moveable assembly 32 is rotated about pivot pin 43 toward inclined bench 14, moveable assembly 32 may rotate about the vertical axis until roller 42 abuts the side of rest support post 38.
      <br/>
      As handle members 62, 64 are drawn downward by the user's outstretched arms, roller 42 may roll along rest support post 38 thereby reducing frictional resistance and causing moveable assembly 32 to remain essentially centered behind the user reclining on inclined bench 14.
      <br/>
      The limits of rotation of moveable assembly 32 due to the effect of screws 84, 86 engaging upper bearing plate 72 prevents moveable assembly 32 from becoming seriously misaligned as it is pivoted about pivot pin 43.
    </p>
    <p num="28">FIG. 2 illustrates the position of moveable assembly 32 when roller 42 is separated from its storage position atop rest support post 38 and weight carrying bar 46 is lowered to its fully extended position with stub arm 54 abutting base frame 2 and resting on bumper 56.</p>
    <heading>OPERATION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="29">
      As can be understood from the drawings, with the apparatus in its storage position with roller 42 resting in cradle 41, a user places himself or herself on inclined bench 14 and seat 22 in a reclined position.
      <br/>
      The user may then reach up and backward and grasp elongate handle members 62 and 64.
      <br/>
      At that point, the user is ready to release the moveable assembly and commence the exercise maneuvers.
      <br/>
      By grasping left and right handle members 62 and 64 at the inwardly directed segments 66 and 68 respectively, the user may draw the handle members 62 and 64 toward the user far enough to disengage roller 42 from cradle 41.
      <br/>
      The user then rotates the moveable assembly 32 into a centered position and exercises upper extremity muscles by alternately extending the arms overhead and drawing the elbows to the user's sides.
      <br/>
      As the first lever 34 pivots about pivot pin 43, the weight carrying bar 46 and free weight plates 55 positioned thereon are moved through an arc which varies the moment arm between weight carrying bar 46 and pivot pin 43 thereby decreasing the vector force of the free weights as the elbows of the user are drawn toward the sides of the user in which position less muscle strength is present.
      <br/>
      As the elbows of user reach the sides of the user, the free weight plate 55 continues to be outboard of the pivot pin 43 though the force required to finish the movement declines as the axis of the free weight plates 55 approaches alignment over the pivot pin 43.
      <br/>
      As a result, a decreasing load is presented to the user as the natural strength of the user declines in the range of motion of the exercise.
      <br/>
      When the exercise session is complete, the apparatus may be parked in its storage position with the roller 42 lowered into the concave cradle 41.
