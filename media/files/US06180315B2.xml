    <p num="2">The present invention relates to novel compositions for making structured color images and applications thereof.</p>
    <p num="3">
      As methods for forming polymer pattern or image layers, there are known various techniques like photolithography, impact printing, such as screen printing, gravure printing, flexo printing and offset printing, non-impact printing, such as ink-jet printing, thermal dye diffusion transfer, laser marking, electrodeposition, etc.
      <br/>
      In all such imaging and recording methods, the actual coloring material comprises pigments and dyestuffs combined with appropriate resins, binders, polymers and additives.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Such colors are applied, thus, for example, as recording elements of optical memories as disclosed in JP Kokai 05050757 A, as recording elements of thermal recording memories as disclosed in EP-A535788, and as coloring materials for color filters of LCDs (liquid crystal displays) as described in H. Aruga, J. Photopolym.

      Sci. Technol., 3(1)9-16(1990), EP-A380223, K. Mizuno et al., Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., Part 1, 30 3313-17(1991) and K. Kobayashi, Solid State Technology, 11(1992)15-18. Polymeric pattern layers may be coloured after crosslinking, for example through thermal dye diffusion transfer with well-known dyes as mentioned in EP-008828.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      According to the above literature, pigments and dyestuffs are used in the form of compositions containing pigments or dyestuffs, polymers or prepolymers and optionally other additives, which are subject to image formation in order to achieve recording or form colored patterns.
      <br/>
      The process usually comprises the polymerization of a prepolymer or the depolymerization of a structurable polymer by applying heat or electromagnetic radiation or the combination thereof, and the subsequent development using appropriate developers; alternatively, pigments or dyestuffs may be applied directly in a selective pattern, for example through non-impact printing.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      While dyes in general are deficient in terms of light, heat, solvent and chemical resistance, pigments in such applications show problems related to dispersion and dispersion stability, transparency, profile sharpness of absorption or transmission spectra and/or lack of solubility or diffusibility.
      <br/>
      Many properties desirable for the dye's or pigment's nice incorporation into critical systems such as colour LCD's are contradictory with such required for high quality applications.
      <br/>
      Unsatisfactory compromises have thus to be complied with, like in JP Kokai 60180889 where stability is obtained at the cost of low optical reflection density and poor color gamut, and many pigment classes cannot be used at all.
      <br/>
      The present invention overcomes this problem.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Recent development in imaging and recording technology requires, however, compositions for producing patterns or images with:</p>
    <p num="8">
      higher transparency (i.e. high light transmittance), especially for color filter of LCDs,
      <br/>
      higher contrast ratio,
      <br/>
      higher color purity and strength,
      <br/>
      higher pattern resolution and precision of image,
      <br/>
      no (dye) color mixing,
      <br/>
      no clogging of sieves during purification of color/polymer mixtures,
      <br/>
      smoothness of image surface,
      <br/>
      pinhole free and noncontaminated image layer,
      <br/>
      higher registration accuracy,
      <br/>
      higher sharpness of image edges,
      <br/>
      higher thermal, chemical and light stability, and
      <br/>
      ultra thin film characteristics.

    <p num="9">It has now been found, surprisingly, that special soluble pigment precursors may be effected by chemical, thermal, photolytical means, by laser and other means of irradiation to undergo in situ generation of insoluble nano-sized pigment particles, and that the compositions containing the above special pigment precursors for structured color patterns and image formation satisfy the aforementioned requirements.</p>
    <p num="10">The present invention relates, accordingly, to novel compositions for forming structured color images containing soluble pigment precursors, in which the precursors regenerate insoluble nano-sized pigment particles by the effect of chemical, thermal, photolytical means or by laser and other means, and application thereof to recording and imaging technology, especially to the fabrication of color filters for LCDs.</p>

      There are different ways to perform step (1) of forming a polymer layer containing a dissolved pigment precursor component (a), a high molecular weight organic binder material (b') and optionally (c).
      <br/>
      One way is for example to use a composition containing all the desired components.
      <br/>
      Another is to prepare a receiver layer containing no pigment precursor (a), onto which the pigment precursor (a) is applied afterwards for example by ink-jetting an ink containing the pigment precursor (a) or preferably by thermal dye diffusion transfer from a donor material containing the pigment precursor (a).
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      Thermal dye diffusion transfer is a technology not to be confused with technologies based on mordants or chemical reactivity, where silver compounds (like in instant photography where a thermal development may be included) or colour formers (for example lactones which need a reactive partner--usually an acid or a phenol--in the receiver) are involved, though scientists still disagree on the terminology or use it improperly.
      <br/>
      A description can be found for example in Spec.
      <br/>
      Publ.--R. Soc. Chem. 133/pp. 73-85 (1993), Proc.
      <br/>
      SPIE--Int. Soc. Opt. Eng. 1912/pp. 252-260 (1993), Nippon Shashin Gakkaishi 55(6)/pp.--456-464 (1992), Journal of Imaging Technology 16(6)/pp. 238ff (1990) and many other publications.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      The principle of thermal dye diffusion transfer is the following: a thin donor sheet (usually 1-10  MU m) containing the dye is brought in contact with a receiver material, then heat is generated in a way such that the desired quantity of dye transfers to selected target areas.
      <br/>
      This can be achieved by simple heating of a broad area, but usually electronically controlled thermal array heads moving across the back surface of the donor are used.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a high-intensity light flash (EP-391303, EP-529362) through a screen or a laser source (Proc. SPIE--Int Soc.
      <br/>
      Opt. Eng. 1912/p. 261 ff. �19931�) can be used; preferably a laser beam focussed onto the donor is used as an energy source; in this case, the donor layer preferably contains IR dyes which convert the light into heat, the laser is an IR laser (as in EP-529561) and extremely high resolutions can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="146">Thus, thermal dye diffusion transfer is a completely dry process totally under electronic control, leading as desired to continuous or full tone images in mosaic pixel patterns, such as needed for electronic photography printouts, color proofing and especially colour filters for LCD's.</p>
    <p num="147">The present soluble pigment precursors (a) are known to decompose thermally at temperatures below 200 (degree)  C., for example N,N'-bis-tert. -butoxycarbonyl-1,4-diketo-3,6-diphenyl-pyrrolo-�3,4-c�pyrrole starts to decompose at 150 (degree)  C. (peak at 175 (degree)  C.) and is totally converted to 1,4-diketo-3,6-diphenyl-pyrrolo-�3,4-c�pyrrole in less than 10 min at 180 (degree)  C. In thermal dye diffusion transfer, the temperature raises well above the glass transition point of the receiver; practically, printers work at temperatures above 230 (degree)  C., typically the surface of the thermal head reaches 350 (degree)  C. Thus, it had to be expected that upon printing the pigment precursors (a) would decompose within the donor, what would inhibit their transfer to the receiver; but highly surprising, it has now been found that they can be transferred thermally without any apparent decomposition.</p>

      The donor may be re-used many times, and the relative motion of donor and receiver may be varied, for example in order to increase the colour intensity.

      The samples are tested for their fading resistance through irradiation under window glass in an Atlas Ci35 with a light intensity of 80 kLux until the desired exposure energy level of xx kJ/cm2 is reached.
      <br/>
      Then the optical density DchannelXX is determined for the blue, green and/or red channel and the ratio �(D0 -Dxx)/(D0 * 0.01)� is used to determine the degree of fading -DDchannel(D0 )XX in % given an initial density of D0 before exposure.

      <br/>
      The yellow print of example 14A fades almost immediately and completely (-DDblue(0.5)15 =96%), while the orange-red print of example 14B almost immediately turns red as residues of N,N'-bis-tert. -butoxycarbonyl-1,4-diketo-3,6-diphenyl-pyrrolo-�3,4-c�pyrrole fade, then does not change significantly anymore (-DDgreen(0.5)60 =8%), due to the excellent lightfastness of the transparent 1,4-diketo-3,6-diphenyl-pyrrolo-�3,4-c�pyrrole pigmentary form.
