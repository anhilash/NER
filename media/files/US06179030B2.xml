      A labelling machine is operable for applying carrier-supported labels for delivery to produce articles arranged in rows in a tray.
      <br/>
      The labelling machine includes at least one label transfer mechanism operative to apply labels from a carrier onto produce articles.
      <br/>
      The labelling machine also includes memory operative to store print information.
      <br/>
      A printer of the labelling machine is positioned upstream of the label transfer mechanism and is operative to print user-configurable print information.
      <br/>
      Control circuitry of the labelling machine is electrically coupled to the printer and the memory, and is operative to configure the printer to print user-configurable print information.
      <br/>
      A user interface of the labelling machine is signal-coupled to the control circuitry and memory, and is operable by a user to select the user-configurable print information to be printed by the printer.
      <br/>
      A method is also provided.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to automated labelling machines and the like.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention relates to improved labelling machines capable of controllably printing label information onto labels and delivering such printed labels onto rows of tray supported articles such as fruits and vegetables.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      One previously known technique for applying labels to articles is to utilize a hand-held label machine, or labeller, which is operable by a user to hand apply labels to individual articles needing identification.
      <br/>
      Several such hand-held labellers are presently commercially available.
      <br/>
      One such hand-held labeller is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,015,324 to Goodwin, et al.
      <br/>
      This labeller has a thermal print head for custom printing of information onto labels.
      <br/>
      Labels are then individually hand applied to articles by an operator.
      <br/>
      However, one problem with such hand-held labellers results from the fact that an operator is required to hand apply the labels to individual articles.
      <br/>
      Another problem is caused by the fact that an operator is unable to apply labels at a fast enough rate to process a large number of articles when the articles are being sorted and delivered via an automated storing, stacking and delivering operation.
      <br/>
      For example, different grades and sizes of fruits or vegetables need to be labelled during a sorting and/or packing operation, which requires the ability to apply a large number of labels in a relatively fast manner.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Another previously known technique for applying labels to articles uses an automated labelling machine such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,194,941 to Briggs, et al.
      <br/>
      According to such a device, a mechanism is presented for automatically labelling articles by delivering the articles through a delivery chute where they are guided into contact with an upstanding label.
      <br/>
      As each article engages with the label, the label is transferred to the article, which causes movement of a new label into a transfer position.
      <br/>
      The new label is then positioned to be delivered to a subsequent article that is delivered into contact with the upstanding new label.
      <br/>
      However, such labelling machines require that the articles be delivered down a chute.
      <br/>
      Therefore, labels can only be applied to articles prior to sorting and stacking the articles.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Yet another previously known technique for applying labels to articles uses a delivery line or conveyor that transports individual produce articles within cups.
      <br/>
      A line of such cups carries articles for delivery past individual stations.
      <br/>
      Each station contains a solenoid that causes the cup to tip and eject such carried produce article when a specific characteristic of the article has been detected.
      <br/>
      One characteristic comprises article size.
      <br/>
      For example, a camera and imaging computer/software can be used to optically detect and estimate the image size for apples supported in individual cups.
      <br/>
      Other characteristics comprise color, shape and grade.
      <br/>
      Several stations can be dedicated for separating variously sized articles, or apples, a solenoid at each station being triggered to tip a cup based upon the detected size of an article passing thereby.
      <br/>
      Such article is dropped via tipping of the conveying cup, with such article being dropped to a chute where similarly sized articles are directed to a conveyor having trays where the articles are loaded thereon.
      <br/>
      However, labels are applied to the apples prior to dropping the sorted apples which can lead to loosening or dislodgement of labels from the apples.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, labelling of such articles while within cups is limited to the speed with which labels can be practically applied to the articles upstream of the sorting location.
      <br/>
      Presently, such label application speeds are limited by the speed with which present label applicators can operate.
      <br/>
      Hence, such produce article sizer machines have operating speeds that are limited to the speed with which labels can be applied to the cup supported articles.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      One problem caused by labelling articles prior to sorting and stacking such articles into trays results from the specific process used to sort and stack articles.
      <br/>
      For the case where apples, or produce, are being sorted and stacked via a sorting machine, the apples are delivered down a conveyor line and/or a chute where labels are applied to individual apples.
      <br/>
      A sizer then sorts the labelled apples and delivers them onto a large number of conveyors, each dedicated to a specific apple size.
      <br/>
      In one case, a sizer receives an input stream of apples on single delivery chute and outputs 32 different-sized apples to 32 separate conveyors.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the use of a labelling machine as taught in Briggs, et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,194,941) greatly limits the speed with which a sizer can operate since labelling machines such as that taught in Briggs generally can only run at a maximum of 500-600 labels per minute.
      <br/>
      At greater speeds, the labels are not adhered sufficiently to the apples so as to be able to withstand contact pressures and rubbing that occur within a sizer.
      <br/>
      Additionally, there is a physical limit to the speed with which labels can be applied according to the apparatus of Briggs as well as other prior art devices.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the labelling of produce upstream of a sorting/sizing station results in the labelling of spoiled or bad produce that will end up being separated from desirable produce by the sorter/sizer.
      <br/>
      Hence, additional labels are used, which leads to waste.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there exists a need for an apparatus capable of applying labels to apples downstream of a sizer, at the drop, wherein the articles are already positioned within rows in a tray, and where spoiled or bad articles have already been separate out.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Utilization of prior art devices such as Briggs, et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,194,941) will not work well with many existing high-speed packing houses wherein sorting and stacking lines are contained therein.
      <br/>
      The articles are labelled during a delivery process prior to sorting and stacking, which often leads to labels being damaged or inadvertently removed during subsequent sorting or stacking.
      <br/>
      Removed labels present a problem because the articles can no longer be identified and the labels, which come off during transport of the articles, can reattach themselves to components of the processing machine, which can gum up or restrict operation of the machine.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a need to apply labels downstream of a delivering and sorting operation, or sizer, such that the labels are less susceptible of being inadvertently removed during transport of the articles.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, there exists a need to apply labels downstream of a sizer such that the operating speed of a sizer can be increased.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Yet another previously known technique for labelling articles is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,387,302 to Bernard, et al.
      <br/>
      According to such apparatus and method, labels are automatically applied to individual produce articles such as fruit or vegetables.
      <br/>
      Such articles are first sorted into trays having parallel rows or indentations sized to receive articles being labelled.
      <br/>
      The articles are disposed for storage and delivery into trays in single-file lines, and the trays and stored articles are delivered via a continuously moving conveyor, downstream of a sizer or sorting machine.
      <br/>
      The rows are disposed during delivery perpendicular to the advance direction of the conveyor.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      According to the apparatus taught in Bernard, et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,387,302), at least one labelling head is moved over a row of indentations with composite rectilinear translation motion.
      <br/>
      Such motion results from a combination of longitudinal advance motion corresponding to the motion of the conveyor in combination with a transfer motion perpendicular to the conveyor such that a label is placed successively on each article in a row.
      <br/>
      Such operation is renewed for each of the rows of a tray being labelled.
      <br/>
      However, such labelling cannot be implemented downstream of the drop, where articles are loaded into trays for later stacking and loading into crates or boxes, due to the number of articles and the speed with which the trays are conveyed during processing.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, such a method and apparatus is highly complicated, takes up a considerable amount of space along a processing line since the machine is relatively large and cumbersome, and requires considerably more components, maintenance, complexity, and cost to implement.
      <br/>
      Even furthermore, such apparatus has a labelling head that is too wide to simultaneously label adjacent rows of tray supported articles.
      <br/>
      Likewise, such apparatus is expensive, complicated and slow at applying labels to articles, and still does not enable printing of desired information onto labels.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Therefore, there exists an additional need to provide for improved automated tray-labelling of articles that are being delivered during a sorting and packing operation.
      <br/>
      More particularly, there exists a need for a machine capable of accurately printing customizable/reconfigurable information onto labels and applying such labels to tray-supported articles prior to being loaded into storage crates/boxes.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, there exists a need to apply such labels to articles in a manner that is quick and effective, that does not limit the speed of a sizer machine, and wherein the labels are less susceptible of being removed during transport, sorting and packing.
    </p>
    <p num="10">There further exists a need for an automated labelling device that is reconfigurable and adjustable such that desired label information can be selectively applied to individual labels in an accurate manner, and such information can be adjusted depending on the articles being labelled.</p>
    <p num="11">There exists yet a further need for improvements in controlling and delivering label information to such labels, for detecting the positioning of individual labels on a carrier during a labelling operation, for detecting the placement of a label onto an article such that a new label can be delivered for presentment to a subsequent article, and for enabling an operator and/or user to selectively reconfigure the operating characteristics, label information and performance of such a labelling machine in the field in a quick and simple manner.</p>
    <p num="12">Objects, features and advantages of this invention are to provide such an automated labelling machine suitable for use with tray-labelling downstream of the drop, or sorting station, of an article sizer where articles have been loaded into trays, and to provide for quick, easy, and high-capacity presentment of selectively configured and/or customizable printed information onto a label that is applied to sorted and tray-supported articles.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="18">This disclosure of the invention is submitted in furtherance of the constitutional purposes of the U.S. Patent Laws "to promote the progress of science and useful arts" (Article 1, Section 8).</p>
    <p num="19">
      A preferred embodiment automated labelling machine and label print information control system in accordance with the invention is first described with reference to FIGS. 1-3 and 5.
      <br/>
      Additional implementation details are disclosed with reference to FIGS. 6-61. Such figures show various aspects and dimensional characteristics described further below with respect to an automated labelling machine having desirable printer control features.
      <br/>
      The automated labelling machine includes a control system and is designed in FIGS. 1-3 and 5 generally with reference numeral 10.
      <br/>
      Automated labelling machine 10 comprises a plurality of label transfer mechanisms 12 which are individually removably received and supported by a support frame 14.
      <br/>
      Support frame 14 carries individual mechanisms 12 in side-by-side relation above a conveyor 36 in locations where they are each operative to apply individual labels 24 to rows of articles 26 being delivered by conveyor 36 as shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      According to the implementation depicted in FIG. 1, conveyor 36 comprises a sizer conveyor located downstream of a fruit-sorting, or sizer, machine immediately following a location where sorted fruit is loaded onto trays at a specific "drop".
      <br/>
      The fruit is sorted and loaded onto trays depending on identified characteristics such as size, grade, or color, for delivery to a stacking and packaging station.
      <br/>
      According to such one implementation, articles 24 comprise fruit (e.g., apples) which are sorted and stowed for transport in trays 32 carried along conveyor 36 and beneath mechanisms 12.
      <br/>
      Details of one related art automated labelling machine are disclosed in Applicant's co-pending patent application, "Automated Labeller", by inventor William R. Rietheimer, U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/953,252, filed Oct. 17, 1997, and now abandoned.
      <br/>
      Such patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/953,252 is herein incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      It is understood that a typical sorting machine, or sizer, can have a large number of drop locations, each feeding several sizer conveyors such as conveyor 36.
      <br/>
      Each of such sizer conveyors 36 are configured to have a dedicated automated labelling machine 10.
      <br/>
      By providing an automated labelling machine 10, including a plurality of label transfer mechanisms 12, for each of a number of conveyors 36, downstream of a sizer, the sizer can run at a higher operating speed than with prior art labelling machines.
      <br/>
      Such prior art labelling machines limit operating speed of a sizer since articles are serially labelled as they move down a single delivery chute, before being sized, sorted and delivered to trays.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a significantly higher operating speed is realized, with labels being serially applied such that the actual travel speed of articles relative to the labelling machine is significantly reduced as a result of the serial application of labels to a plurality of rows of articles 26.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As shown in FIG. 1, articles 26 are depicted in the form of produce such as apples.
      <br/>
      However, articles 26 can take on other forms such as vegetables, legumes, or other articles, including fasteners, machine parts, and components being manufactured, sorted, packaged, recycled and/or delivered.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, automated labelling machine 10 includes a main controller board 140 (see FIG. 5) that forms a control system having control circuitry.
      <br/>
      Main controller board 140 (of FIG. 5), contained within user interface 18, is shown implemented on one dedicated labelling machine 10 comprising a single frame 14 and a repair/setup frame 58.
      <br/>
      However, it is understood that automated labelling machine 10 can optionally be formed from a plurality of frames 14, each functioning as a separate automated labelling machine that is individually coupled with a common, or central, main controller board 140 (see FIG. 5) of a common user interface 18.
      <br/>
      For such optional configuration, each frame has a smaller dedicated printed circuit (PC) board and circuitry, including diodes, for notifying an operator as to which mechanisms are printing.
      <br/>
      For purposes of simplification, automated labelling machine 10 is illustrated with a single frame 14 having a plurality of label transfer mechanisms 12 carried thereon.
      <br/>
      Use of a plurality of frames 14, each supporting a plurality of label transfer mechanisms 12, enables one user interface 18 to be centrally located within a packing house, and requires only one common main controller board 140 (see FIG. 5).
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      According to the construction depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2, a plurality of individual label transfer mechanisms, or label applicators, 12 are each removably supported in support frame 14 in adjacent, side-by-side relation.
      <br/>
      Each individual label transfer mechanism 12 is operative to apply labels to a dedicated row 28-31 of articles 26 situated on tray 32.
      <br/>
      Individual articles 26 are stored within individual recesses 34 of tray 32.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      For example, one of label transfer mechanisms 12 is configured to apply labels 24 to each of articles 26 contained within row 28.
      <br/>
      Another of label transfer mechanisms 12 is configured to apply labels 24 to each of articles 26 contained within row 29.
      <br/>
      Similar label transfer mechanisms 12 are supported for dedicated application of labels 24 to each of articles 26 in each of rows 30 and 31, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      As shown in FIG. 1, individual label transfer mechanisms 12 are removably supported by a cross-arm 56 of frame 14.
      <br/>
      Each label transfer mechanism 12 contains a pivot pin 52 configured to support mechanism 12 on cross-arm 56.
      <br/>
      Cross-arm 56 contains a plurality of vertical slots 64 sized to receive a mating rear-most edge on label transfer mechanism 12.
      <br/>
      Label transfer mechanism 12 is loaded onto arm 56 by registering pin 52 within a complementary cylindrical slot, or groove, 54 formed along a top edge of arm 56.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, label transfer mechanism 12 is pivotally supported along pin 52 by cross-arm 56 such that a proximate edge of label transfer mechanism 12 is urged within slot 64 due to gravity.
      <br/>
      In this manner, label transfer mechanism 12 is pivotally carried by arm 56.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Pin 52 and arm 56 are configured such that label transfer mechanism 12 pivotally engages a take-up gear 48 in interlocking rotatable engagement with a drive gear 50 on cross-arm 56.
      <br/>
      Drive gear 50 is secured for rotation on drive shaft 16.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Drive shaft 16 is journalled for rotation beneath cross-arm 56, and contains a plurality of drive gears 50, each dedicated for driving a take-up reel 44, via take-up gear 48, on one of label transfer mechanisms 12.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, a single drive motor 74 is used to rotatably drive a common drive shaft 16, drive gears 50, take-up gears 48, and take-up reels 44.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Optionally, drive shaft 16 can be constructed with a single spline gear with slots or adjustable support brackets provided on cross-arm 56 that enable lateral adjustable positioning between the label transfer mechanisms.
      <br/>
      Such adjustable positioning enables reconfiguring of machine 12 to label articles within trays that contain rows having a different spacing.
      <br/>
      Likewise, additional mechanisms 12 can be added for the case where additional rows are to be provided in a new size/shape of tray.
      <br/>
      Such spline gear is configured to engaged the associated take-up gear 48 on each mechanism 12, regardless of the lateral positioning of such mechanism relative to frame cross-arm 56.

      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, a user interface 18 is provided on automated labelling machine 10 to enable a user to access the printer control system of labelling machine 10.
      <br/>
      User interface 18 contains a keyboard (or keypad) and a display that enable a user to selectively configure the operating characteristics for each automated labelling machine 10, and associated label transfer mechanisms 12, that are coupled with the main controller board 140 (see FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      Optionally, each automated labelling machine 10 can be provided as a stand-alone unit, incorporating a dedicated main controller board.
      <br/>
      Further optionally, a single automated labelling machine 10 can be provided with a single label transfer mechanism 12.
      <br/>
      Even further optionally, a processor from a sizer, or sorting machine, can be used to relay labelling information directly to such main controller board so as to selectively configure each automated labelling machine 10 with desired print information and position/diagnostics of such information.
      <br/>
      Such information received from the sizer can be used to actuate individual solenoids to tip support cups and "drop" articles based upon identified characteristics such as size, color, or shape.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, communication between a sizer and machine 10 will enhance processing and sorting efficiency and speed.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, such operations can be carried out as separate processes.

    <p num="30">
      As shown in FIG. 1, each label transfer mechanism 12 comprises a label canister 19, which is carried by a main plate or body, a print head assembly 40, and a peel plate assembly 42.
      <br/>
      A label reel 20 is removably supported within label canister 19.
      <br/>
      Label reel 20 is received within label canister 19 and contains a supply of individual adhesive-backed labels 24 spaced sequentially along a carrier web, or carrier, 22.

      In operation, carrier 22 is advanced through print head assembly 40, around a rotatable roller 68 and over peel plate assembly 42, and back onto a take-up reel 44 where scrap carrier 22 is stored.
      <br/>
      Carrier 22 is folded over a leading edge of peel plate assembly 42 so as to cause labels 24 to be removed or peeled off carrier 22 by a lip edge of peel plate assembly 42, after which such carrier 22 is doubled back under assembly 42 and rotatably stored onto take-up reel 44.
    </p>
    <p num="32">According to one construction depicted in FIG. 1, take-up reel 44 comprises a central cylindrical hub that is frictionably carried via a fastener for rotation against take-up gear 48 such that tension on carrier 22 causes frictionable slippage between take-up reel 44 and take-up gear 48, with take-up gear 48 rotatably advancing take-up reel 44 sufficiently so as to impart drive or travel tension along carrier 22.</p>
    <p num="33">
      A separate drive motor 92 (see FIG. 3) is provided within each print head assembly 40 of each label transfer mechanism 12 which further facilitates advancement of carrier 22 and labels 24.
      <br/>
      Further details of such motor are provided below with reference to FIG. 3.

    <p num="34">
      As shown in FIG. 1, conveyor 36 comprises a sizer conveyor which includes an endless conveyor belt 38 that is supported for rotation by a plurality of rollers (not shown).
      <br/>
      At least one of the rollers is driven by a drive motor of a sizer machine so as to movably drive conveyor belt 38.
      <br/>
      In this manner, a plurality of trays 32 are carried for movement by belt 38 and are delivered to pass directly beneath labelling machine 10.
      <br/>
      Prior to labelling articles 26 within individual trays 32, articles 26 have been pre-sorted and loaded within indentations, or recesses, 34 of tray 32 in a previous, upstream article processing operation.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In operation, a sizer or sorting machine receives articles 26 from a supply belt (not shown) which are to be sorted, and the articles are transferred to a singulator section where they are presented in one of several single rows where they are sorted by identifiable characteristics such as size, color, grade, etc.
      <br/>
      The articles, sorted by a characteristic such as size, then enter individual rows (supported in cups) comprising transfer sections (belts) which transfer the articles for delivery into each of rows 28-31 on each tray 32 (for each conveyor 36).
      <br/>
      Typically, the transfer section is a row of size-sorted articles that are dropped into individual rows of a tray.
      <br/>
      Trays 32 are then transported on conveyor 36 downstream of the article drop location (where articles 26 are loaded into trays 32) for labelling, followed by stacking and loading of trays 32 into crates.

    <p num="36">
      According to one article sorting and loading operation, articles 26 are arranged such that a smooth and presentable surface of article 26 is placed in close proximity for contact with each of label transfer mechanisms 12.
      <br/>
      According to one such implementation, articles 26 comprise apples.
      <br/>
      Hence, labels 24 are better able to be adhered directly thereon.
      <br/>
      For example, for the case where articles 26 comprise apples, the stems are preferably oriented to extend in a generally lateral, or horizontal, plane such that a smooth apple surface is presented upwardly for receiving an adhesive-backed label 24.

      Canister 19 is configured to receive a label reel 20 containing a supply of labels 24 by simply loading label reel 20 into canister 19 and securing the transparent cover with a rotatable quick release fastener.
      <br/>
      Print head assembly 40 is carried on a main plate of each label transfer mechanism 12, and is operative to print configurable/customizable information onto each label 24 as they are delivered through print head assembly 40.
      <br/>
      Carrier 22 and labels 24 are guided onto peel plate assembly 42 where individual labels 24 are sequentially removed from carrier 22 and delivered onto successive individual articles 26.
      <br/>
      Labels 24 dislodge from assembly 42 and carrier 22 as individual articles 26 move into contact with assembly 42.
      <br/>
      Adhesive backing on labels 24 causes lodging onto articles 26.
      <br/>
      A smooth silicon surface on carrier 22 facilitates dislodgement of labels 24 from carrier 22.

      According to one implementation, additional extra label transfer mechanisms 12 are stored on frame 58 where they are available to an operator who might need to remove one label transfer mechanism 12 from machine 10 due to a detected problem caused during operation.
      <br/>
      One such problem is generated when an individual label reel 20 is empty.
      <br/>
      Another problem can be caused if a carrier 22 on a label reel 20 separates or tears.

      FIG. 3 illustrates the print and apply label features of Applicant's invention.
      <br/>
      Individual label transfer mechanisms 12 are able to print specific print information onto labels 24 comprising combinations of apple variety and size (via a PLU-).
      <br/>
      One exemplary label 102 (of FIG. 4), similar to label 24, is depicted with reference to FIG. 4 and is described below in further detail.
      <br/>
      According to prior art techniques, where apple variety and specific PLU numbers (-'s) cannot be selectively printed onto labels, it is necessary to inventory as many as 60 different print reels, each having labels that are pre-printed with a specific combination of apple variety and PLU number (PLU-).
      <br/>
      Such prior art techniques are often configured to only sort and label two different sizes of articles, small and large.
      <br/>
      If more than two sizes are sorted and labelled, 120 or even 240 different print reels might be needed.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Each time a different combination of apple variety and PLU- is being sorted and printed by a machine, the label reel has to be changed by inserting an appropriate label reel having the desired pre-printed labels that are retrieved from a stored inventory of reels.
      <br/>
      Hence, it may be necessary with prior art techniques to change label reels 5 or 6 times a day.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, each time a new label reel is loaded, carrier and labels are wasted during loading and unloading.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      FIG. 3 illustrates the ability to print and apply such label information pursuant to Applicant's invention.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is possible to eliminate such a large inventory of dedicated label reels having specific pre-printed labels.
      <br/>
      Hence, even greater amounts of specific information can be imparted to a label without requiring an increase in the number of label reels that need to be inventoried and stored for use in an article-sorting and labelling operation.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      As illustrated in FIG. 3, label reel 20 contains labels 24 that are pre-printed with specific graphical information 104 and textual information 106 (see FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Additional print information 108 and 110 needed for specific operations is applied to label 102 by print head assembly 40, as shown in partial breakaway view (see FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, common information that is needed for all labelling operations can be pre-printed, such as graphical information 104 and textual information 106.
      <br/>
      Additional print information that is needed for specific labelling operations can be customized, configured and/or adjusted by the control system of Applicant's invention such that additional label reels do not need to be inventoried.
      <br/>
      For purposes of illustration, exemplary apple label 102 of FIG. 4 is shown as a circular shaped label.
      <br/>
      In contrast, label 24 of FIGS. 1-3 is shown as an elliptical label.
      <br/>
      However, it is understood that labels 24 (of FIGS. 1-3) and label 102 (of FIG. 4) are essentially identical for purposes of this disclosure.

      As shown in FIG. 3, a batch of labels 24 can be retrieved from label reel 20 and printed with specific desired information for sorted articles by print head assembly 40.

      Such printing occurs just before a label 24 is applied to an article 26 via peel plate assembly 42.
      <br/>
      Labels are then advanced for delivery to articles 26 by applying travel tension to carrier 22 via take-up reel 44 and by motor-driven rotatable resilient print (or feed) roller 90.
      <br/>
      Preferably, take-up reel 44 is designed to rotate such that a greater travel distance is imparted to carrier 22 than is imparted by roller 90 such that take-up reel 44 frictionably slips relative to associated take-up gear 48 (see FIG. 2).

      Print head assembly 40 of FIG. 3 is shown in partial breakaway view so as to illustrate the travel path taken by carrier 22 through print head assembly 40.

      Carrier 22 is unwound from label reel 20 via the application of travel tension to carrier 22.
      <br/>
      Carrier 22 is drawn over guide member 94 by such travel tension.
      <br/>
      Preferably, guide member 94 contains a recessed slot that is sized in width nearly identically to the width of carrier 22 such that the lateral positioning of carrier 22 is precisely controlled.
      <br/>
      Hence, carrier 22 is prevented from wandering laterally of the travel direction extending along guide member 94 such that the lateral positioning of labels 24 is accurately rolled with respect to printer, or print head, 88.

    <p num="51">
      As shown in FIG. 3, guide member 94, when viewed in cross-section relative to the view depicted in FIG. 3, contains a recessed slot (not shown) shaped as a dovetail.
      <br/>
      More particularly, such slot is narrower along a top surface of guide member 94 and is wider at the bottom of such slot.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the dimension of such slot is sized at its bottommost location such that the slot is identical in width to the width of carrier 22.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, carrier 22 is guided within such slot accurately which prevents any lateral movement or pulling (via the dovetail shape).
      <br/>
      Such configuration precisely presents labels 24 such that little or no lateral variation is presented between labels 24 and print head 88.

      Print head base arm 84 and print head outer arm 86 are each formed from a piece of aluminum.
      <br/>
      Print head base arm 84 is sized with sufficient mass so as to form a heat sink suitable for drawing heat from a thermal print head 88 of outer arm 86 that is generated during printing while pressed against print roller 90.

      Thermal print head 88 comprises a linear heater mechanism in the form of heatable dots configured in a linear array of 200 dots per inch.

      Positioning of a label against thermal print head 88 enables printing of material, or information, onto such label via application of heat to each individual dot in an array that defines the desired textual/graphical/encoded pattern.
      <br/>
      Such labels are formed from thermally printable material.
      <br/>
      Labels 24 are accurately indexed via a label detector, or optical sensor 115, for carefully positioning such labels against thermal print head 88 in order to deliver printed information onto label 24 accordingly.
      <br/>
      Hence, print roller 90 is driven responsive to the detected position of labels 24 by way of such optical sensor 115.

      Additionally, or alternatively, a separate printed circuit board containing dedicated memory control chips can be utilized for delivering such print control commands to thermal print head 88 and feed roller 90.
      <br/>
      Print control commands and delivery commands for driving roller 90 are delivered via a flexible printer cable and a connector configured in the form of a serial connection.
      <br/>
      Such flex cable comprises a communication line for delivering print control commands to thermal print head 88.

      Such opening of cover assembly 100 draws tension on the ribbon cable, pivoting print head arm assembly 82 away from roller assembly 90, about pivot pin 83.
      <br/>
      Such construction enables an operator to feed carrier 22 and labels 24 between thermal print head 88 and resilient print roller 90.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      According to one construction, resilient print roller 90 is formed from a Neoprene (tm)  material.
      <br/>
      Such pivotable access therebetween further enables an operator to perform rethreading of carrier 22, or maintenance and cleaning, particularly when labels 24 become inadvertently dislodged from carrier 22 within print head assembly 40, or when carrier 22 is torn.
      <br/>
      When cover assembly 100 is closed, a spring (not shown) on assembly 100 forces thermal print head 88 against carrier 22, labels 24, and print roller 90.

      FIG. 4 illustrates one exemplary apple label 102 containing pre-printed information 104 and 106, as well as printed information 108 and 110, which is printed just before delivery of a label 102 to an article.
      <br/>
      Such information 108 and 110 is configurable and modifiable by way of implementation of aspects of Applicant's invention to configure user-specified, or selected, print information for printing onto labels.
      <br/>
      More particularly, apple label 102, for purposes of this disclosure, is substantially identical to label 24 as depicted in FIGS. 1-3 and is supported on a carrier reel via a carrier.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      As shown in FIG. 4, apple label 102 is pre-printed with graphical information 104 and textual information 106 by a label manufacturer who supplies such labels 102 in a serially spaced-apart configuration on a carrier of a label reel.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, an apple packing house having Applicant's automated labelling machine can warehouse and stock a single type of apple label for use with many different types of apples because specific information relating to the type of apple being packaged and the specific size are contained within printed textual information 108 comprising a printed article, or apple type, and printed information 110 comprising a PLU number (PLU-).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, an infinite number of configurations for print information can be provided onto such labels.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      FIG. 4 illustrates apple label 110 wherein pre-printed graphical information 104 comprises a graphical representation of an apple.
      <br/>
      Pre-printed textual information 106 comprises the pre-printed name of an apple packing house.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      In contrast, printed information 108 and 110 comprise customizable, tailorable, and selectively configurable print information that is printed onto a label during a conveying and packing operation, downstream of a sorting operation within a packing house.
      <br/>
      According to one aspect, such comprises the novel features of Applicant's invention.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, print information 108 (or past tense, printed information) comprises textual information describing the article type being labelled and packaged, in this case "Red Delicious" apples.
      <br/>
      Likewise, printed information 110 comprises a specific PLU number (PLU-) indicative of a particular size and/or type of apple that has been sorted by a sorting machine, or sizer, upstream of the labelling operation.
      <br/>
      In this case, printed information 110 comprises a PLU number "4016".
      <br/>
      Stores use such PLU numbers to track articles.
      <br/>
      The ability to print more PLU numbers will enable stores to improve the tracking of products.
      <br/>
      For example, stores can track apples having several different sizes, not just "small" and "large" sizes.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      It is understood that the configurable information printed by Applicant's automated labelling machine and control system; namely, print information 108 and 110, can be tailored to include the printing of textual information, graphical information, data, bar codes or any other printed matter.
      <br/>
      For example, it is possible to also configurably print information 104 and 106 such that a label supplier can supply labels 102 to a packing house that has no pre-printed information contained thereon.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, all information to be placed on the labels is printed "on the fly" as a tray 32 of apples 26 is being moved on a conveyor 36 past a label transfer mechanism 12 of Applicant's automated labelling machine 10 (of FIG. 1).
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Examples of selectively configurable print information for apple label 102 of FIG. 1 include printing any of a number of apple types for print information 108.
      <br/>
      For example, print information 108 could be selectively configured for applying labels to packaged apples comprising "Red Delicious", "Fuji", "McIntosh", "Cortland" or "Golden Delicious".
      <br/>
      Similarly, print information 110 can be printed so as to indicate the size of apples which have been sorted onto trays contained within such conveyor by a sizer operating upstream of Applicant's label transfer mechanism.
      <br/>
      For example, print information 110 might include any one of PLU numbers (PLU-'s) "4016", "4026", "4106", "4135", "14016", etc.
      <br/>
      Such optional print configurations can be stored in memory where they can be selectively enabled by an operator or by setup personnel, or automatically, when implementing Applicant's invention pursuant to the hardware implementation depicted in FIGS. 5-49 and software implemented by the state diagrams depicted in FIGS. 50-59.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      FIG. 5 illustrates in schematic block diagram form automated labelling machine 10 according to a preferred embodiment of this invention, as illustrated by the apparatus depicted in FIGS. 1-3 and 6.
      <br/>
      Machine 10 is configured with a single, common main controller board 140 and a plurality of printer PC boards 113 that couple with associated components.
      <br/>
      Although only a single printer PC board 113 is illustrated as being coupled with main controller board 140, it is understood that a plurality of such printer PC boards 113 can be coupled to a single, common main controller board 140.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Main controller board 140 is housed within user interface 18 as illustrated in FIGS. 1-3 and 6.
      <br/>
      Likewise, printer PC board 113 is housed within cover assembly 100 (of FIG. 3) on each label transfer mechanism 12.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      For example, automated labelling machine 10 includes a single user interface 18 which contains main controller board 140, and five different printer PC boards 113, one located in each label transfer mechanism 12.
      <br/>
      Although four label transfer mechanisms 12 are being utilized to label apples 26, as shown in FIG. 1, an extra backup label transfer mechanism 12 can also be coupled with main controller board 140 (via user interface 18) while being stored on repair/setup frame 58.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Furthermore, it is possible to provide main controller board 140 such that a single user interface 18 is provided on one automated labelling machine 10 such that several automated labelling machines 10 are controlled from a single user interface 18 provided on one of the automated labelling machines 10 (of FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      In this manner, the main controller board 140 of FIG. 5 can be used to control several different automated labelling machines, each dedicated to a single conveyor.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Additionally, as depicted in FIG. 5, an external computer 128 is provided in signal-coupled relation via a communication link 130 with printed PC board 113.
      <br/>
      More particularly, an external computer, such as a main packing house computer, or a network computer, can be signal-coupled and decoupled via a programming interface 132 with a processor 114 of printer PC board 113.
      <br/>
      According to one implementation, external computer 128 can be signal-coupled via a serial bidirectional interface so as to transfer data and/or power.
      <br/>
      For example, if a new type of apple is to be run on a number of different conveyors, it is possible to selectively reconfigure each automated labelling machine and each label transfer mechanism to print information 108 describing a new, previously undefined apple type.
      <br/>
      Such updating of printing capabilities can be imparted by external computer 128 from a central location.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      Additionally, or optionally, an operator is able to update printer characteristics such as the content of print information, positioning of print information on a label, and quality of print information via main controller board 140 through use of a user interface 18.
      <br/>
      User interface 18 couples with a processor 142 on main controller board 140 such that a user is able to determine characteristics that have been selected for print information 108 and 110 on label 102 (see FIG. 4).
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      Printer PC board 113 contains a central processor 114.
      <br/>
      In one implementation, processor 114 comprises a microcontroller.
      <br/>
      Additionally, PC board 113 includes memory, such as SRAM memory 120, an address latch 118, an input/output (I/O) latch 122, a motor drive 124 (such as motor drive circuitry), and an external clock 116.
      <br/>
      Motor drive 124 is operatively coupled with a motor 126 that accurately drives print roller 90 in rotation (see FIG. 3) to deliver labels.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, PC board 113 includes a thermal print head interface 112 configurable for operatively coupling with thermal print head (printer) 88.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Printer PC board 113 further includes programming interface 132 which signal-couples the communication link 130 with external computer 128.
      <br/>
      Similarly, processor 114 of PC board 113 couples via a serial data communication device 134 with main controller board 140.
      <br/>
      Preferably, serial data communication device 134 is removably coupled with main controller board 140 via a removable signal connector.
      <br/>
      Additionally, PC board 113 includes a connector 136 configured for coupling with a sensor 138.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      Connector 136 couples with sensor 138 (in one embodiment, a Hall-effect sensor with a threshold detector; in another, a contact switch) such that an input is provided when peel plate upward movement is detected.
      <br/>
      According to one implementation, such input comprises an on/off input corresponding to raising and lowering of such peel plate.
      <br/>
      According to another implementation, such input comprises a digital on/off signal that is derived from an analog Hall-effect sensor signal 148 that has been converted by D/A converter 146 (of FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      The differential time between peaks or valleys in such signal can be monitored.
      <br/>
      Such time information can be stored in a look-up table, with the speed of a drive motor being speeded up or delayed based upon experiential information, or patterns, that are determined to be found within such stored information.
      <br/>
      For example, a delay might be detected following the labelling of each group of six apples, indicative of the spacing between adjacent apply trays (where six apples are supported in each row of a tray).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, such experiential information can be used to optimize performance and timing of label application and printing.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      According to one implementation, processor 114 is signal-coupled via connector 136 with a sensor 138 comprising an on/off switch.
      <br/>
      One such sensor can be implemented by a Hall-effect sensor wherein a threshold voltage is characterized and monitored by processor 114, contained in memory, to detect "on" and "off" conditions.
      <br/>
      Optionally, processor 114 is signal-coupled via connector 136 to optional signal line 152 with a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter 146 and a Hall-effect sensor 148 through signal line 154.
      <br/>
      According to such optional implementation, Hall-effect sensor 148 generates an analog output signal similar to a sinusoidal signal indicative of pivotal movement of peel plate 70 (see FIG. 3) as contact is made with individual apples 26. D/A converter 146 is utilized to convert the analog signal into a digital signal that can be processed by processor 114.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, such information can be used to judge the relative height of individual apples, and to judge or predict the expected timing between application of labels to adjacent apples.
      <br/>
      Also, such information provides a feedback signal for the control system.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      In this manner, variations in apple placement, shape and profile can be monitored by the machine control system based on a feedback signal so as to optimize the feeding of labels 24 from peel plate 70 (of FIG. 3) such that optimum placement and delivery of labels is imparted to articles.
      <br/>
      Hence, improvements can be made to the delivery of labels to tray-supported articles by enhancing the timing of label advancement to correspond with the expected position of a subsequent article to be labelled.
    </p>
    <p num="80">It is envisioned that any of a number of signal processing techniques can be utilized to monitor and characterize variations in elevational positioning (as well as adjacent spacing between articles) of articles that contact and displace peel plate 70.</p>
    <p num="81">
      As shown in FIG. 3, peel plate 70 is pivotally carried by a main plate (or base) of label transfer mechanism 12.
      <br/>
      A tray 32 of articles 26 is moved beneath label transfer mechanism 12 such that contact occurs with peel plate 70 along lip edge 80.
      <br/>
      Such contact causes pivotal raising of peel plate 70 and application of a label 24 to an article 26.
      <br/>
      Such contact is also detected as peel plate movement via sensor 138 and magnet 139 (of FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      Sufficient timing is required to feed a subsequent label for delivery to the next article, following delivery of a label 24 to a previous article.
      <br/>
      Hall-effect sensor 148 can be substituted for sensor 138 such that pivotal movement of peel plate 70 is detected.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      As shown in FIG. 3, sensor 138 is implemented as a switch via a Hall-effect sensor that is carried at a stationary location in the base plate of label transfer mechanism 12.
      <br/>
      A marker 139 of magnetic material is embedded in an adjacent side of peel plate 70, next to the stationary base plate, with sensor 138 (or Hall-effect sensor 148) embedded flush within such base plate.
      <br/>
      Movement of such peel plate 70 and marker 139 generates a detectable analog signal via such sensor (or switch) which is detectable by processor 114 via a threshold detector that turns such analog signal into a digital "on"/"off" signal.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the pivotal movement of peel plate 70 can be monitored so as to detect when contact (and label application) occurs with articles 26.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Information relating to the relative amount of movement of peel plate 70 (highest and lowest positions) that is imparted by contact with articles 26, as well as the timing of such movement induced with contact by articles 26, can be utilized to predict when a next label needs to be advanced for delivery.
      <br/>
      Additionally, such detection enables a determination of when a new tray 32 is being fed beneath label transfer mechanism 12 (see FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      The positioning of a new tray can be spaced apart from a preceding tray such that the distance between apples is greater.
      <br/>
      Optionally, such trays can be nested in adjoining contact such that the distance between adjacent (on adjacent trays) apples still varies, based upon the rows, positioning and sizing of such trays.
      <br/>
      If the number of apples in individual rows of a tray is known, modifications can be made when controllably delivering labels 24 via peel plate 70 by modifying the speed of operation of motors 92 (of FIG. 3) and motor 74 (see FIG. 2) so as to correspond to the desired delivery speed which enhances label delivery to articles 26, no matter which tray such articles are positioned within.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      Also shown in FIG. 5, printer PC board 113 signal-couples via processor 114 with an optical sensor 115.
      <br/>
      Such optical sensor 115 is positioned within print head assembly 40 to detect a center position for each label 24 positioned along carrier 22.
      <br/>
      Such optical sensor 115 comprises an optical emitter and a detector positioned on opposing sides of carrier 22.
      <br/>
      Carrier 22 is translucent, or semi-transparent, with labels 24 imparting additional opacity thereto.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, optical sensor 115 is positioned on either side of carrier 22 about a hole in guide member 94 (of FIG. 3) such that individual labels 24 interrupt the detectable passage of light therethrough.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a beginning edge portion and a trailing edge portion of a label can be monitored, by calculating the mid-point which corresponds with a center line position extending transverse of the travel direction of such label.
      <br/>
      Carrier 22 is accurately guided along guide member 94, within a carefully sized elongate slot which prevents any lateral movement such that sensor 115 can detect a label center position along the carrier.
      <br/>
      Hence, the positioning of labels 24 on carrier 22 is accurately placed and determined such that optical sensor 115 is only required to monitor the positioning of labels 24 along the elongate direction of carrier 22.
      <br/>
      Detection of such center position on each label 24 is necessary in order to accurately place print information 108 and 110 (see FIG. 4) onto individual apple labels 24 (or label 102 of FIG. 4).
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      Printer (PC) board 113 contains flash memory that enables downloading of one image comprising print information for a label.
      <br/>
      Other images of print information are stored in memory of main controller board 140.
      <br/>
      Hence, the bulk of such information is stored on board 140 which reduces the amount of information that needs to be stored on board 113 at any given time.

    <p num="86">
      FIG. 6 illustrates another important aspect of Applicant's invention.
      <br/>
      It has been found by Applicant that utilization of optical sensor 115 (see FIGS. 3 and 5) enables relatively accurate placement of print information 108 and 110 (see FIG. 4) onto labels.
      <br/>
      However, it is often necessary that an operator be enabled with the ability to more accurately adjust the positioning of print information 108 and 110 such that a label 102 is imparted with a high degree of accuracy and a clean and neat appearance as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      In order to achieve such result, Applicant's invention enables the ability for an operator to finely adjust or tune such positioning by way of user interface 118 as depicted in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Hence, labels are imparted with a more precise, readable and neat appearance.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      As shown in FIG. 6, user interface 18 includes a display screen 156 and a keyboard, or keypad, 158.
      <br/>
      Display screen 156, according to one implementation, comprises a liquid crystal display (LCD) signal-coupled via a 14-pin connector via keyboard display interface 208 (of FIG. 7) and 14-pin display connector 200 (see FIG. 23).
      <br/>
      Also shown in FIG. 23, a keyboard layout is depicted for a C&amp;K 4B01H322PCFQ keyboard.
      <br/>
      Such layout corresponds to the keyboard depicted in FIG. 6.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      More particularly, keyboard 158 is laid out as a 4 * 4 switch array.
      <br/>
      One such construction comprises a set of input keys configured in the form of a keypad that interfaces via a keyboard interface containing a serial interface, logic circuitry and a keyboard controller to enable a user to input information via user interface 18 with main controller board 140 and/or printer PC board 113.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      According to one construction, keyboard 158 comprises a keypad containing input keys 160-190.
      <br/>
      Such input keys 160-190 comprise electromechanical input devices, each input key comprising a key switch configured from any of a number of presently understood designs.
      <br/>
      According to one construction, an input key, or key switch, uses an elastomer or molded boot consisting of two collapsible domes.
      <br/>
      However, it is understood that various keyboard arrangements are possible, with many variations being found in many presently available keyboard/keypad device applications.
      <br/>
      Techniques for detecting input via an input key may be through magnetic read relays, solid-state circuits, or more exotic devices such as Hall-effect sensors.
      <br/>
      However, such operation is only incidental to the operation of Applicant's invention, and is intended to include any of a number of present membrane technologies suitable for constructing keys on a keypad or keyboard.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      As shown in FIG. 6, input keys 160-164, 168-172, and 176-180 are visibly marked with labels comprising individually assigned reference numerals 1-3, 4-6, and 7-9, respectively.
      <br/>
      More particularly, reference key 162 is also marked (or labelled) with an "up arrow".
      <br/>
      Similarly, reference key 168 is marked with a "left arrow".
      <br/>
      Reference key 172 is marked with a "right arrow".
      <br/>
      Furthermore, reference key 178 is marked with a "down arrow".
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      The arrows represented by reference keys 162, 168, 172 and 178 enable an operator to adjust to the centered positioning of print information 108 and 110 (of FIG. 4) such that the print information 108 and 110 can be incrementally adjusted by an operator during a setup mode by depressing an arrow to incrementally move the print information in the desired direction and print a sample label.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, such information 108 and 110 can be adjustably positioned relative to a label to achieve an optically pleasant, accurate, and balanced placement of print information 108, 110 on apple label 102 (of FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, activation of any one of input keys 162, 168, 172 or 178 imparts an incremental movement or adjustment of print information 108 and 110 relative to the detected position of apple label 102 (of FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, each time one of input keys 162, 168, 172 and 178 are pushed, a sample label is printed such that an operator can visually determine whether such adjustment has produced a desirable repositioning of the print information on the label.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      For example, each incremental selection of input key 162 adjusts the positioning of print information 108 and 110 relative to the detected position of label 102 by moving it upward 0.1 mm relative to pre-printed information 104, 106.
      <br/>
      Therefore, an operator is able to adjust positioning of printed information on a label in a setup mode by a desired amount via incrementing the number of times such input key is selected, or touched.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      As shown in FIG. 6, input key 170 is utilized to toggle through a menu so as to select the specific apple type represented by print information 108.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a list of apple types is displayed on display 156, wherein a user toggles between such selections via input key 170 so as to outline a desired apple type for assignment to print information 108 (of FIG. 4).
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      Similarly, input key 166 is labelled with "NEXT IMAGE" (not shown) which enables a user to toggle between a number of different desired images.
      <br/>
      Likewise, input key 174 is labelled "SELECT PLU-".
      <br/>
      Input key 174 enables an operator to toggle through and select one of a number of pre-stored PLU numbers that are visually displayed on display 156.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      Input key 182 enables an operator to monitor printer status via display 156.
      <br/>
      For example, the printer status of individual print head assemblies 40 on individual label transfer mechanisms 12 (see FIGS. 1-3 and 5) can be monitored via display 156 by an operator at user interface 118.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, diagnostics can be performed for each individual print head assembly 40.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      Furthermore, input key 190 is labelled "PRINTER TEST".
      <br/>
      Input key 190 enables an operator to initiate a printer test for each print head assembly 40 on each label transfer mechanism 12 (of FIGS. 1-3 and 5).
      <br/>
      Details of such printer tests are described below with reference to state diagrams depicted in FIGS. 50-59. Such implementation causes a label 102 (of FIG. 4) to be printed with print information 108 and 110 so that an operator can visually determine the default placement of such information onto label 102.
      <br/>

      Optionally, such information can be entered from select PLU, or by a default setup implemented via power-up as depicted in FIG. 52. Such information is then downloaded to printers by "SENDING AN IMAGE" to each print head assembly.

      Once such downloading has occurred, a "STOP" is issued to all printers.
