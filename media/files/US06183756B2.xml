    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention pertains to the field of immunopharmacology and, in particular, the use of a solvent extract or active fraction thereof derived from Pseudomonas to increase platelet count in individuals affected with thrombocytopenia, a platelet depletion disorder, or at risk of developing thrombocytopenia.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets are the essential cells of the human hematopoietic system.
      <br/>
      The primary function of erythrocytes, also known as red blood cells, is to transport hemoglobin, which in turn carries oxygen from the lungs to tissues.
      <br/>
      Oxygenated hemoglobin gives the erythrocytes a red color.
      <br/>
      Leukocytes, also referred to as myeloid cells, are a heterogenous group of cells that mediate immune responses and which include granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes.
      <br/>
      These cells are found predominately in the blood, bone marrow, lymphoid organs and epithelium.
      <br/>
      Leukocytes are referred to as white blood cells because of a lack of natural pigment which gives the cells a whitish or transparent appearance.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Platelets are small (2-4  MU m) anucleate disk-like cells which play an important role in blood coagulation.
      <br/>
      Platelets are derived by cytoplasmic fragmentation of the precursor stem cells, megakaryocytes, found in bone marrow.
      <br/>
      After formation, platelets leave the bone marrow and travel through the spleen and into the blood, with approximately one third of the platelets becoming sequestered in the spleen.
      <br/>
      The platelets which are transported to the blood, circulate for approximately seven to ten days.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Platelets which are normally present in human blood at a concentration of 150,000-400,000 per microliter play a crucial role in hemostasis, or the regulation of bleeding.
      <br/>
      When the level of platelets falls below normal in a subject, the risk of hemorrhage increases in the subject.
      <br/>
      The condition associated with low levels of platelets is referred to as thrombocytopenia.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Ordinarily when the level of circulating platelets decreases a feedback mechanism is initiated which results in increased production in the number, size, and ploidy of megakaryocytes.
      <br/>
      This mechanism, in turn, causes the production and release into the circulation of additional platelets.
      <br/>
      Although the feed back regulation of platelet levels is ordinarily sufficient to maintain a normal level of platelets in the circulation, several physiological conditions are capable of causing a significant imbalance in the level of platelets.
      <br/>
      Such conditions result in either thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis (a condition caused by an increased level of platelets in the blood).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      At least three physiological conditions are known to result in thrombocytopenia: a decreased production of platelets in the bone marrow; an increased splenic sequestration of platelets; or an accelerated destruction of platelets.
      <br/>
      In conventional therapies in order to successfully treat thrombocytopenia, one must first identify which mechanism is causing the decrease in platelet levels and then treat the subject by administering a drug or instituting a procedure which will eliminate the underlying cause of the platelet loss.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A loss of platelets due to decreased production of bone marrow, may be established by the examination of a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy which demonstrates a reduced number of megakaryocytes.
      <br/>
      A decreased production of bone marrow may result from myelosuppression as a consequence of gamma irradiation, therapeutic exposure to radiation, or cytotoxic drug treatment.
      <br/>
      Chemicals containing benzene or anthracene and even some commonly used drugs such as chloramphenicol, thiouracil, and barbiturate hypnotics can cause myelosuppression, resulting in thrombocytopenia.
      <br/>
      Additionally, rare bone marrow disorders such as congenital amegakaryocytic hypoplasia and thrombocytopenia with absent radii (TAR syndrome) can selectively decrease megakaryocyte production, resulting in thrombocytopenia.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Splenic sequestration of platelets can cause an increase in spleen size.
      <br/>
      Splenic sequestration can often be determined by bedside palpation to estimate splenic size.
      <br/>
      An increase in spleen size, or splenomegaly, is typically caused by portal hypertension secondary to liver disease, splenic infiltration with tumor cells in myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative disorders, or macrophage storage disorders such as Gauchers disease.
      <br/>
      Splenectomy is often used to increase platelet counts in cases of excessive splenic sequestration.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Thrombocytopenia resulting from accelerated destruction of platelets is generally the cause of decreased levels of platelets in the blood when impaired production of bone marrow and splenic sequestration have been ruled out.
      <br/>
      The accelerated destruction of platelets is caused by either an immunologic disorder or a non-immunologic disorder.
      <br/>
      Immunologic thrombocytopenia can be caused, for example, by autoimmune disorders such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), viral or bacterial infections, and drugs.
      <br/>
      Non-immunologic thrombocytopenia is caused by vasculitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and prosthetic cardiac valves.
      <br/>
      Chronic ITP is often treated with high doses of steroids, intravenous gamma globulins, splenectomy, and even immunosuppressive drugs.
      <br/>
      Each of these therapeutic modalities provides only temporary relief and is associated with serious side effects.
      <br/>
      Additionally, approximately 20 percent of the chronic ITP patients do not respond to any of the known treatments.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Factors which induce proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes have been proposed as therapeutic treatments for increasing platelet counts, regardless of the mechanism causing thrombocytopenia.
      <br/>
      Thus far three such factors have been identified, but have not yet been well characterized.
      <br/>
      A recent report has suggested that the three factors, C-MpL ligand, thrombopoietin, and megakaryocytes colony stimulating factor (MK-CSF) are the same molecule (Wendling F. et al., C-MpL ligand is a humoral regulator of megakaryocytopoesis, Nature, 369; p. 571-574 (1994)).
      <br/>
      Interleukin 11 has been shown to induce megakaryocytopoesis in an animal model.
      <br/>
      It is unclear whether these compounds will be effective clinical treatments for thrombocytopenia.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      There presently exists a need for therapeutic methods for increasing platelet levels or preventing significant decreases in platelet levels.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the therapy should eliminate thrombocytopenia in individuals exhibiting thrombocytopenia or prevent thrombocytopenia in individuals at risk of developing thrombocytopenia.
      <br/>
      Such therapy preferably should be easy and safe to administer and require few diagnostic tests to follow the course of treatment.
      <br/>
      The patient preferably should be allowed to be treated on an ambulatory basis, thereby reducing the hospital visits while still allowing an improved quality of life.
      <br/>
      Such therapy preferably should be effective for all types of thrombocytopenias regardless of the underlying physiological condition causing platelet depletion.

      Infection-induced thrombocytopenia is a disorder characterized by a low level of platelets in peripheral blood which is caused by an infectious agent such as a bacteria or virus.

      Treatment-induced thrombocytopenia is a disorder characterized by a low level of platelets in peripheral blood which is caused by therapeutic treatments such as gamma irradiation, therapeutic exposure to radiation, cytotoxic drugs, chemicals containing benzene or anthracene and even some commonly used drugs such as chloramphenicol, thiouracil, and barbiturate hypnotics.
      <br/>
      Physiologically-induced thrombocytopenia is a disorder characterized by a low level of platelets in peripheral blood which is caused by any mechanism other than infectious agents or therapeutic treatments causing thrombocytopenia.
      <br/>
      Factors causing physiologically-induced thrombocytopenia include, but are not limited to, rare bone marrow disorders such as congenital amegakaryocytic hypoplasia and thrombocytopenia with absent radii (TAR syndrome), an increase in spleen size, or splenomegaly, caused by portal hypertension secondary to liver disease, or macrophage storage disorders such as Gauchers disease, autoimmune disorders such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), vasculitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and prosthetic cardiac valves.

      As used herein, "a subject at risk of developing thrombocytopenia" is a subject who has a high probability of acquiring or developing thrombocytopenia.
      <br/>
      For example, a patient with a malignant tumor who is prescribed a chemotherapeutic treatment is at risk of developing treatment-induced thrombocytopenia and a subject who has an increased risk of exposure to infectious agents is at risk of developing infection-induced thrombocytopenia.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      One embodiment of the present invention is a method of treating thrombocytopenia.
      <br/>
      The method comprises the step of administering to a subject exhibiting thrombocytopenia a solvent extract of Pseudomonas or active fraction thereof, that stimulates when administered subcutaneously in vivo an increase in platelet counts in a thrombocytopenic mammal.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The Pseudomonas solvent extract or active fraction thereof is administered in an amount effective to increase platelet counts in the subject.
      <br/>
      An amount effective to increase platelet counts in the subject is an amount which causes an increase in the count of circulating platelet levels.
      <br/>
      The actual levels of platelets achieved will vary depending on many variables such as the initial status of the immune system in the subject, i.e., whether the subject has mild to severe thrombocytopenia (e.g., resulting from an autoimmune disease or splenic sequestration).
      <br/>
      In general, the platelet levels of a subject who has severe thrombocytopenia will initially be very low.
      <br/>
      Any increase in the platelet levels of such a subject, even increases to a level which are still below a normal level, can be advantageous to the subject.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The platelet levels of a subject at risk of developing thrombocytopenia, on the other hand, are generally within a normal range.
      <br/>
      The Pseudomonas solvent extract or active fraction thereof prevents the platelet levels of such a subject from decreasing to a level which would cause thrombocytopenia.
      <br/>
      Thus, administering the Pseudomonas solvent extract fraction to the subject will inhibit to a medically significant extent, the decrease in platelet count that would otherwise occur in the absence of treatment according to the invention thereby preventing the development of thrombocytopenia.
      <br/>
      Preferably the effective amount is one which prevents platelet levels from decreasing below a level of 50,000 platelets per microliter.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      An effective amount of a Pseudomonas solvent extract or active fraction thereof for increasing platelet levels may be measured by any conventional method known in the art for measuring platelet levels or for measuring parameters which correlate with platelet levels.
      <br/>
      Platelet count is determined simply by obtaining a blood sample and counting the number of platelets per microliter of blood.
      <br/>
      Platelet count also can correlate with bleeding time, a measure of platelet levels.

      The Pseudomonas solvent extract or active fraction thereof may be prepared by a solvent extraction of Pseudomonas.

      For example, pelleted Pseudomonas may be incubated with acetone to produce a first precipitate and then the active components of the first precipitate extracted with ethanol.
      <br/>
      Other hydrophilic solvents may, of course, be used in place of ethanol (e.g., water, lower alkyl, alcohols).
      <br/>
      As will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, multiple ethanol extractions may be performed to further refine the active fraction.

      The active fraction may be precipitated by acetone to produce the Pseudomonas solvent extract or active fraction thereof of the invention.
      <br/>
      Indeed, as will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, a variety of fractionation and separation techniques (e.g., chromatography, dialysis, filtration, electrophoresis) may be employed in various orders and multiplicities to further refine the Pseudomonas solvent extract or active fraction thereof and to isolate the active ingredient(s).
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Briefly, solvent extraction procedures are performed by addition of a solvent or mixture of solvents to differentially dissolve or extract either active or inactive components from the mixture in such a way that the active components are enriched in either the insoluble material (residue) or in the resulting solution (extract).
      <br/>
      Solvent crystallization or precipitation procedures are carried out by causing either active or inactive components of the mixture to crystallize or precipitate from solution so that they can be separated from the remaining solution by a technique such as filtration or sedimentation.
      <br/>
      Solvent precipitation can employ a single solvent or a mixture of solvents and relies on changes in temperature and/or addition of other solvents and/or solutes to differentially affect the solubility of the components of the original mixture.
      <br/>
      Solvent partition procedures utilize mixtures of solvents to form two or more immiscible phases that can be separated from each other physically and which will result in the differential distribution of active and inactive components between phases, based on the varying solubility of the components in the respective solvents.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      A wide variety of chromatographic procedures can be used to produce sample fractions containing active components at higher levels of enrichment than existed in the original sample.
      <br/>
      The types of chromatographic supports (stationary phase, adsorbent, column packing, etc.) that can be utilized in these separations include the following: 1) normal phase chromatography using any of a variety of polar chromatographic supports (adsorbents) along with a wide variety of elution solvents; 2) reverse phase chromatographic methods using any of a variety of hydrophobic chromatographic supports with any of a variety of elution solvents; 3) ion exchange chromatographic methods using any of a variety of either anionic, cationic, or mixed anionic and cationic chromatographic supports, with a wide variety of elution solvents containing any of a wide variety of ionic modifiers; 4) various types of gel permeation or size exclusion chromatography; and 5) partition chromatography utilizing a stationary liquid phase with a liquid mobile phase.
