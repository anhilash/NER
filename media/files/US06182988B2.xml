    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a folding device, and more particularly to a folding device for a scooter.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Normally, a scooter has a foldable handle, such that not much space is needed when the scooter is put away for storage.
      <br/>
      A conventional scooter usually includes a head tube, a base pivotally connected to the head tube, a front wheel assembly rotatably connected to the head tube and another wheel assembly rotatably mounted on the opposite end of the base.
      <br/>
      The pivotal connection between the base and the head tube is achieved by a combination of a bolt and nut whereby the bolt is inserted through both the base and the head tube, and the nut tightens and holds the head tube in position.
      <br/>
      With such an arrangement, at least two separated through holes are defined in the base.
      <br/>
      One hole is defined to hold the handlebar in an upright position relative to the base, and the other hole is defined to secure the handlebar in a horizontal or stowed position relative to the base.
      <br/>
      This type of scooter needs an extra tool(s) to open or fold the scooter, which makes the scooter inconvenient to the user.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Still, there is another type of conventional connection between the base and the head tube.
      <br/>
      This connection is achieved by a bolt and spring combination.
      <br/>
      With the bolt and spring combination, the user is readily able to change the relative position between the handlebar and the base.
      <br/>
      Although, the scooter has a convenient connection structure between the base and the handlebar, the connection is not as secured as it should to be.
      <br/>
      When the scooter of this type is in use, the handlebar will shake and make the user standing on the base very unstable and unsafe.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      With reference to FIG. 7, a conventional folding device for a scooter has a connector (3). a stud (6), a limit (51) and a spring (S).
      <br/>
      The connector (3) is securely connected to the base (A) and pivotally connected to a heat tube (5).
      <br/>
      The stud (6) is inserted through the connector (3) and the head tube (5) to enable the head tube (5) to pivot relative to the connector (3).
      <br/>
      The limit (51) is movably received in an arcuate opening (31) in the connector (3), The spring (S) is connected between the limit (51) and the stud (6).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a notch (32) defined at each distal end of the arcuate opening (31) communicates with the arcuate opening (31), and the limit (51) is alternatively received in either one of the notches (32).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      When the limit (51) is received in forward the notch (32), the head tube (5) stands in an upright position relative to the base (A), and when the limit (51) is received in the aft notch (32), the head tube (5) lies parallel to the base (A).
      <br/>
      When the limit (51) is moved between the two notches (32), the spring (S) applies a downward force to the limit (51), such that the limit (51) is pulled into and held in the notches (32).
      <br/>
      This secures the relative position between the heat tube (5) and the base (A).
      <br/>
      This kind of folding device does have the capability to fold and open the scooter.
      <br/>
      However there are still shortcomings that need to be overcome.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The friction between the limit (51) and the arcuate opening (31) when moving the limit (51) between notches (32) will enlarge the dimension of the arcuate opening (31) and damage the surface of the limit (51), which will cause the downward force from the spring (S) to be diminished.
      <br/>
      A sudden impact to the base (A) could cause the limit (51) to jump out of the notch (32) and the scooter to unexpectedly fold, which could be extremely dangerous especially at moderate to high speeds.
    </p>
    <p num="9">To overcome the shortcomings, the present invention provides a scooter with an improved folding device that allows the engagement between the head tube and the base to be secured when in use.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The main objective of the invention is to provide an improved folding device for a scooter.
      <br/>
      The folding device has a first extension extending down and out at an angle from the head tube and a second extension extending up from the base and corresponding to the first extension.
      <br/>
      The first extension has an elongated slot on each side aligning with a through holes defined in each ear extending from the second extension.
      <br/>
      The first extension is able to be inserted into the space between the two ears and is secured between the two ears by the engagement of a hook to a shaft.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Another objective of the invention is to provide an eccentric head pivotally connected with the shaft, such that the shaft inserted through the elongated slot and the through holes is able to be held in position by the eccentric head.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the engagement between the head tube and the base is firmly secured.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Other objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

      <br/>
      One free end of the spring (43) abuts the outer periphery of the first extension (21), and the other abuts the lever (50) to hold the hook (40) down.
      <br/>
      After the lever (51) and the hook (40) are mounted on the first extension (21), the hook (40) is able to pivot together with the lever (50).
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The free end of the first extension (21) is inserted into the hollow second extension (11) so that the through holes (13) in the ears (12) align with the elongated slot (22) in the first extension.
      <br/>
      The compression lock (30) shaft (31) is inserted through the elongated slot (22) and the aligned through holes (13) in the ears (12) so that the shaft (31) is movably received in the elongated slot (22).
      <br/>
      The nut (32) is screwed onto the free end of the shaft (31).
      <br/>
      To further enhance the engagement of the compression lock (30) to the first extension (21), the eccentric head (34) abuts the outer surface of the first extension (21), such that the compression lock (30) is held in a desired location in the slot (22).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      When the scooter with the folding device is in use, the hook (40) clamps the shaft (31) to provide a first safety feature to the user.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the abutment of the eccentric head (34) to the outer surface of the first extension (21) provides a second safety feature to the user.
      <br/>
      It is because the abutment of the eccentric head (34) to the outer surface of the first extension (21) helps to position the compression lock (30) relative to the first extension (21), such that the connection of the hook (40) to the shaft (31) is improved.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      When the scooter with the folding device is to be folded, the user first pivots the lever (50) to disengage the connection between the hook (40) and the shaft (31).
      <br/>
      Then the user pivots the handle (33) to release the eccentric head (34) from the outer surface of the first extension (21).
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the first extension (21) can be pulled away from the second extension (11) and pivoted relative to the second extension (11), as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5.
      <br/>
      After the first extension (21) is pulled away from the second extension (11), the first extension (21) is able to pivot relative to the second extension (11) to place the head tube (20) parallel to the base (10).
      <br/>
      Then, the user is able to use the hook (40) to connect the shaft (31) again and pivots the handle (33) to secure the position of the compression lock (30) to the first extension (21) to hold the scooter in a folded condition, as shown in FIG. 6.
