      A toy bank for saving coins therein.
      <br/>
      The device includes a stuffed doll having an exterior configured to resemble a predetermined figure.
      <br/>
      The stuffed doll has stuffed head and body portions each configured to resemble the head and body of the predetermined figure.
      <br/>
      The body portion has an interior, a top, a bottom, a front and a back.
      <br/>
      The bottom of the body portion is adapted for resting on a surface such that the head and body portions are generally vertical with respect to the surface.
      <br/>
      A container is provided in the interior of the body portion.
      <br/>
      The body portion has a slot into the container adapted for inserting coins into the container.
      <br/>
      The slot is located on the back of the body portion towards the top of the body portion.
      <br/>
      The body portion has a hole into the container adapted for removing coins disposed in the container.
      <br/>
      The hole is located on the back of the body portion towards the bottom of the body portion.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to toy banks and more particularly pertains to a new toy bank for saving coins therein.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The use of toy banks is known in the prior art.
      <br/>
      More specifically, toy banks heretofore devised and utilized are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Known prior art toy banks include U.S. Pat. No. 4,345,400; U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,292; U.S. Pat. No. 4,401,259; U.S. Pat. No. 2,472,064; U.S. Pat. No. Des. 139,465; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,304,087.</p>
    <p num="6">
      While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objectives and requirements, the aforementioned patents do not disclose a new toy bank.
      <br/>
      The inventive device includes a stuffed doll having an exterior configured to resemble a predetermined figure.
      <br/>
      The stuffed doll has stuffed head and body portions each configured to resemble the head and body of the predetermined figure.
      <br/>
      The body portion has an interior, a top, a bottom, a front and a back.
      <br/>
      The bottom of the body portion is adapted for resting on a surface such that the head and body portions are generally vertical with respect to the surface.
      <br/>
      A container is provided in the interior of the body portion.
      <br/>
      The body portion has a slot into the container adapted for inserting coins into the container.
      <br/>
      The slot is located on the back of the body portion towards the top of the body portion.
      <br/>
      The body portion has a hole into the container adapted for removing coins disposed in the container.
      <br/>
      The hole is located on the back of the body portion towards the bottom of the body portion.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In these respects, the toy bank according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of saving coins therein.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of toy banks now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new toy bank construction wherein the same can be utilized for saving coins therein.</p>
    <p num="9">The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new toy bank apparatus and method which has many of the advantages of the toy banks mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new toy bank which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art toy banks, either alone or in any combination thereof.</p>
    <p num="10">
      To attain this, the present invention generally comprises a stuffed doll having an exterior configured to resemble a predetermined figure.
      <br/>
      The stuffed doll has stuffed head and body portions each configured to resemble the head and body of the predetermined figure.
      <br/>
