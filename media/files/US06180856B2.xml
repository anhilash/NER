    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">Plant Breeding</p>
    <p num="3">
      Field crops are bred through techniques that take advantage of the plant's method of pollination.
      <br/>
      A plant is self-pollinated if pollen from one flower is transferred to the same or another flower of the same plant.
      <br/>
      A plant is cross-pollinated if the pollen comes from a flower on a different plant.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Plants that have been self-pollinated and selected for type for many generations become homozygous at almost all gene loci and produce a uniform population of true breeding progeny.
      <br/>
      A cross between two different homozygous lines produces a uniform population of hybrid plants that may be heterozygous for many gene loci.
      <br/>
      A cross of two plants each heterozygous at a number of gene loci will produce a population of hybrid plants that differ genetically and will not be uniform.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Maize (Zea mays L.), often referred to as corn in the United States, can be bred by both self-pollination and cross-pollination techniques.
      <br/>
      Maize has separate male and female flowers on the same plant, located on the tassel and the ear, respectively.
      <br/>
      Natural pollination occurs in maize when wind blows pollen from the tassels to the silks that protrude from the tops of the ears.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The development of a hybrid maize variety in a maize plant breeding program involves three steps: (1) the selection of plants from various germplasm pools for initial breeding crosses; (2) the selfing of the selected plants from the breeding crosses for several generations to produce a series of inbred lines, which, although different from each other, breed true and are highly uniform; and (3) crossing the selected inbred lines with unrelated inbred lines to produce the hybrid progeny (F1).
      <br/>
      During the inbreeding process in maize, the vigor of the lines decreases.
      <br/>
      Vigor is restored when two different inbred lines are crossed to produce the hybrid progeny (F1).
      <br/>
      An important consequence of the homozygosity and homogeneity of the inbred lines is that the hybrid created by crossing a defined pair of inbreds will always be the same.
      <br/>
      Once the inbreds that create a superior hybrid have been identified, a continual supply of the hybrid seed can be produced using these inbred parents and the hybrid corn plants can then be generated from this hybrid seed supply.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Large scale commercial maize hybrid production, as it is practiced today, requires the use of some form of male sterility system which controls or inactivates male fertility.
      <br/>
      A reliable method of controlling male fertility in plants also offers the opportunity for improved plant breeding.
      <br/>
      This is especially true for development of maize hybrids, which relies upon some sort of male sterility system.
      <br/>
      There are several options for controlling male fertility available to breeders, such as: manual or mechanical emasculation (or detasseling), cytoplasmic male sterility, genetic male sterility, gametocides and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Hybrid maize seed is typically produced by a male sterility system incorporating manual or mechanical detasseling.
      <br/>
      Alternate strips of two inbred varieties of maize are planted in a field, and the pollen-bearing tassels are removed from one of the inbreds (female) prior to pollen shed.
      <br/>
      Providing that there is sufficient isolation from sources of foreign maize pollen, the ears of the detasseled inbred will be fertilized only from the other inbred (male), and the resulting seed is therefore hybrid and will form hybrid plants.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The laborious, and occasionally unreliable, detasseling process can be avoided by using cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) inbreds.
      <br/>
      Plants of a CMS inbred are male sterile as a result of factors resulting from the cytoplasmic, as opposed to the nuclear, genome.
      <br/>
      Thus, this characteristic is inherited exclusively through the female parent in maize plants, since only the female provides cytoplasm to the fertilized seed.
      <br/>
      CMS plants are fertilized with pollen from another inbred that is not male-sterile.
      <br/>
      Pollen from the second inbred may or may not contribute genes that make the hybrid plants male-fertile.
      <br/>
      Usually seed from detasseled fertile maize and CMS produced seed of the same hybrid are blended to insure that adequate pollen loads are available for fertilization when the hybrid plants are grown.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      There are several methods of conferring genetic male sterility available, such as multiple mutant genes at separate locations within the genome that confer male sterility, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,654,465 and 4,727,219 to Brar et al. and chromosomal translocations as described by Patterson in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,861,709 and 3,710,511.
      <br/>
      These and all patents referred to are incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      In addition to these methods, Albertsen et al., of Pioneer Hi-Bred, U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,068, have developed a system of nuclear male sterility which includes: identifying a gene which is critical to male fertility; silencing this native gene which is critical to male fertility; removing the native promoter from the essential male fertility gene and replacing it with an inducible promoter; inserting this genetically engineered gene back into the plant; and thus creating a plant that is male sterile because the inducible promoter is not "on" resulting in the male fertility gene not being transcribed.
      <br/>
      Fertility is restored by inducing, or turning "on", the promoter, which in turn allows the gene that confers male fertility to be transcribed.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      There are many other methods of conferring genetic male sterility in the art, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.
      <br/>
      These methods use a variety of approaches such as delivering into the plant a gene encoding a cytotoxic substance associated with a male tissue specific promoter or an antisense system in which a gene critical to fertility is identified and an antisense to that gene is inserted in the plant (see: Fabinjanski, et al.
      <br/>
      EPO 89/3010153.8 publication no. 329,308 and PCT application PCT/CA90/00037 published as WO90/08828).
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Another system useful in controlling male sterility makes use of gametocides.
      <br/>
      Gametocides are not a genetic system, but rather a topical application of chemicals.
      <br/>
      These chemicals affect cells that are critical to male fertility.
      <br/>
      The application of these chemicals affects fertility in the plants only for the growing season in which the gametocide is applied (see Carlson, Glenn R., U.S. Pat. No. 4,936,904).
      <br/>
      Application of the gametocide, timing of the application and genotype specificity often limit the usefulness of the approach.

      The use of male sterile inbreds is but one factor in the production of maize hybrids.
      <br/>
      The development of maize hybrids in a maize plant breeding program requires, in general, the development of homozygous inbred lines, the crossing of these lines, and the evaluation of the crosses.
      <br/>
      Maize plant breeding programs combine the genetic backgrounds from two or more inbred lines or various other broad-based sources into breeding pools from which new inbred lines are developed by selfing and selection of desired phenotypes.
      <br/>
      Hybrids also can be used as a source of plant breeding material or as source populations from which to develop or derive new maize lines.
      <br/>
      Plant breeding techniques known in the art and used in a maize plant breeding program include, but are not limited to, recurrent selection backcrossing, pedigree breeding, restriction length polymorphism enhanced selection, genetic marker enhanced selection and transformation.
      <br/>
      The inbred lines derived from hybrids can be developed using said methods of breeding such as pedigree breeding and recurrent selection.
      <br/>
      New inbreds are crossed with other inbred lines and the hybrids from these crosses are evaluated to determine which of those have commercial potential.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Recurrent selection breeding, backcrossing for example, can be used to improve inbred lines and a hybrid which is made using those inbreds.
      <br/>
      Backcrossing can be used to transfer a specific desirable trait from one inbred or source to an inbred that lacks that trait.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished, for example, by first crossing a superior inbred (recurrent parent) to a donor inbred (non-recurrent parent), that carries the appropriate gene(s) for the trait in question.
      <br/>
      The progeny of this cross is then mated back to the superior recurrent parent followed by selection in the resultant progeny for the desired trait to be transferred from the non-recurrent parent.
      <br/>
      After five or more backcross generations with selection for the desired trait and for the germplasm inherited from the recurrent parent, the progeny will be homozygous for loci controlling the characteristic being transferred, but will be like the superior parent for essentially all other genes.
      <br/>
      The last backcross generation is then selfed to give pure breeding progeny for the gene(s) being transferred.
      <br/>
      A hybrid developed from inbreds containing the transferred gene(s) is essentially the same as a hybrid developed from the same inbreds without the transferred gene(s).
    </p>
    <p num="15">There are many important factors to be considered in the art of plant breeding, such as the ability to recognize important morphological and physiological characteristics, the ability to design evaluation techniques for genotypic and phenotypic traits of interest, and the ability to search out and exploit the genes for the desired traits in new or improved combinations.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The objective of commercial maize hybrid line development resulting from a maize plant breeding program is to develop new inbred lines to produce hybrids that combine to produce high grain yields and superior agronomic performance.
      <br/>
      The primary trait breeders seek is yield.
      <br/>
      However, many other major agronomic traits are of importance in hybrid combination and have an impact on yield or otherwise provide superior performance in hybrid combinations.
      <br/>
      Such traits include percent grain moisture at harvest, relative maturity, resistance to stalk breakage, resistance to root lodging, grain quality, and disease and insect resistance.
      <br/>
      In addition, the lines per se must have acceptable performance for parental traits such as seed yields, kernel sizes, pollen production, all of which affect ability to provide parental lines in sufficient quantity and quality for hybridization.
      <br/>
      These traits have been shown to be under genetic control and many if not all of the traits are affected by multiple genes.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Pedigree Breeding</p>
    <p num="18">The pedigree method of breeding is the mostly widely used methodology for new hybrid line development.</p>
    <p num="19">
      In general terms this procedure consists of crossing two inbred lines to produce the non-segregating F1 generation, and self pollination of the F1 generation to produce the F2 generation that segregates for all factors for which the inbred parents differ.
      <br/>
      An example of this process is set forth below.
      <br/>
      Variations of this generalized pedigree method are used, but all these variations produce a segregating generation which contains a range of variation for the traits of interest.

    <p num="22">The number of genotypes in the F2 is 36 for six segregating loci (729) and will produce (26)-2 possible new inbreds, (62 for six segregating loci).</p>
    <p num="23">
      Each inbred parent which is used in breeding crosses represents a unique combination of genes, and the combined effects of the genes define the performance of the inbred and its performance in hybrid combination.
      <br/>
      There is published evidence (Smith, O. S., J. S. C. Smith, S. L. Bowen, R. A. Tenborg and S. J. Wall, TAG 80:833-840 (1990)) that each of the lines are different and can be uniquely identified on the basis of genetically-controlled molecular markers.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      It has been shown (Hallauer, Arnel R. and Miranda, J. B. Fo. Quantitative Genetics in Maize Breeding, Iowa State University Press, Ames Iowa, 1981) that most traits of economic value in maize are under the genetic control of multiple genetic loci, and that there are a large number of unique combinations of these genes present in elite maize germplasm.
      <br/>
      If not, genetic progress using elite inbred lines would no longer be possible.
      <br/>
      Studies by Duvick and Russell (Duvick, D. N., Maydica 37:69-79, (1992); Russell, W. A., Maydica XXIX:375-390 (1983)) have shown that over the last 50 years the rate of genetic progress in commercial hybrids has been between one and two percent per year.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The number of genes affecting the trait of primary economic importance in maize, grain yield, has been estimated to be in the range of 10-1000.
      <br/>
      Inbred lines which are used as parents for breeding crosses differ in the number and combination of these genes.
      <br/>
      These factors make the plant breeder's task more difficult.
      <br/>
      Compounding this is evidence that no one line contains the favorable allele at all loci, and that different alleles have different economic values depending on the genetic background and field environment in which the hybrid is grown.
      <br/>
      Fifty years of breeding experience suggests that there are many genes affecting grain yield and each of these has a relatively small effect on this trait.
      <br/>
      The effects are small compared to breeders' ability to measure grain yield differences in evaluation trials.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the parents of the breeding cross must differ at several of these loci so that the genetic differences in the progeny will be large enough that breeders can develop a line that increases the economic worth of its hybrids over that of hybrids made with either parent.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      If the number of loci segregating in a cross between two inbred lines is n, the number of unique genotypes in the F2 generation is 3n and the number of unique inbred lines from this cross is +(2n)-2}. Only a very limited number of these combinations are useful.
      <br/>
      Only about 1 in 10,000 of the progeny from F2's are commercially useful.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      By way of example, if it is assumed that the number of segregating loci in F2 is somewhere between 20 and 50, and that each parent is fixed for half the favorable alleles, it is then possible to calculate the approximate probabilities of finding an inbred that has the favorable allele at +(n/2)+m} loci, where n/2 is the number of favorable alleles in each of the parents and m is the number of additional favorable alleles in the new inbred.
      <br/>
      See Example 2 below.
      <br/>
      The number m is assumed to be greater than three because each allele has so small an effect that evaluation techniques are not sensitive enough to detect differences due to three or less favorable alleles.
      <br/>
      The probabilities in Example 2 are on the order of 10-5 or smaller and they are the probabilities that at least one genotype with (n/2)=m favorable alleles will exist.

    <p num="138">Strip Test Data for Hybrid 38N40</p>
    <p num="139">
      Comparison data was collected from strip tests that were grown by farmers.
      <br/>
      Each hybrid was grown in strips of 4, 6, 8, 12, etc. rows in fields depending on the size of the planter used.
      <br/>
      The data was collected from strip tests that had the hybrids in the same area and weighed.
      <br/>
      The moisture percentage was determined and bushels per acre was adjusted to 15.5 percent moisture.
      <br/>
      The number of comparisons represent the number of locations or replications for the two hybrids that were grown in the same field in close proximity and compared.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      Comparison strip testing was done between Pioneer Brand Hybrid 38N40 and Pioneer Brand Hybrids 37M81, 3730, 3751, and 3752.
      <br/>
      The comparisons come from all the hybrid's adapted growing areas in the United States.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      These results are presented in Table 3.
      <br/>
      As can be seen from the table hybrid 38N40 demonstrates a harvest moisture, test weight, root lodging, and income advantage over the combined average of the hybrids compared.
      <br/>
      Hybrid 38N40's advantage for these traits plus its advantage for other characteristics over these hybrids will make it an important addition for most of the areas where these hybrids are grown.

    <p num="146">Further Embodiments of the Invention</p>
    <p num="147">
      This invention includes hybrid maize seed of 38N40 and the hybrid maize plant produced therefrom.
      <br/>
      The foregoing was set forth by way of example and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="148">As used herein, the term plant includes plant cells, plant protoplasts, plant cell tissue cultures from which maize plants can be regenerated, plant calli, plant clumps, and plant cells that are intact in plants, or parts of plants, such as embryos, pollen, ovules, flowers, kernels, ears, cobs, leaves, seeds, husks, stalks, roots, root tips, anthers, silk and the like.</p>
    <p num="149">
      Duncan, Williams, Zehr, and Widholm, Planta, (1985) 165:322-332 reflects that 97% of the plants cultured which produced callus were capable of plant regeneration.
      <br/>
      Subsequent experiments with both inbreds and hybrids produced 91% regenerable callus which produced plants.
      <br/>
      In a further study in 1988, Songstad, Duncan &amp; Widholm in Plant Cell Reports (1988), 7:262-265 reports several media additions which enhance regenerability of callus of two inbred lines.
      <br/>
      Other published reports also indicated that "nontraditional" tissues are capable of producing somatic embryogenesis and plant regeneration. K. P. Rao, et al., Maize Genetics Cooperation Newsletter, 60:64-65 (1986), refers to somatic embryogenesis from glume callus cultures and B. V. Conger, et al., Plant Cell Reports, 6:345-347 (1987) indicates somatic embryogenesis from the tissue cultures of maize leaf segments.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is clear from the literature that the state of the art is such that these methods of obtaining plants are, and were, "conventional" in the sense that they are routinely used and have a very high rate of success.
    </p>
    <p num="150">
      Tissue culture of maize is described in European Patent Application, publication 160,390, incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Maize tissue culture procedures are also described in Green and Rhodes, "Plant Regeneration in Tissue Culture of Maize," Maize for Biological Research (Plant Molecular Biology Association, Charlottesville, Va. 1982, at 367-372) and in Duncan, et al., "The Production of Callus Capable of Plant Regeneration from Immature Embryos of Numerous Zea Mays Geneotypes," 165 Planta 322-332 (1985).
      <br/>
      Thus, another aspect of this invention is to provide cells which upon growth and differentiation produce maize plants having the genotype of 38N40.

    <p num="151">Transformation of Maize</p>
    <p num="152">
      With the advent of molecular biological techniques that have allowed the isolation and characterization of genes that encode specific protein products, scientists in the field of plant biology developed a strong interest in engineering the genome of plants to contain and express foreign genes, or additional, or modifed versions of native or endogenous genes (perhaps driven by different promoters) in order to alter the traits of a plant in a specific manner.
      <br/>
      Such foreign, additional and/or modified genes are referred to herein collectively as "transgenes".
      <br/>
      Over the last fifteen to twenty years several methods for producing transgenic plants have been developed, and the present invention, in particular embodiments, also relates to transgenic versions of the claimed hybrid maize line 38N40.
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      Plant transformation involves the construction of an expression vector which will function in plant cells.
      <br/>
      Such a vector comprises DNA comprising a gene under control of or operatively linked to a regulatory element (for example, a promoter).
      <br/>
      The expression vector may contain one or more such operably linked gene/regulatory element combinations.
      <br/>
      The vector(s) may be in the form of a plasmid, and can be used, alone or in combination with other plasmids, to provide transformed maize plants, using transformation methods as described below to incorporate transgenes into the genetic material of the maize plant(s).
    </p>
    <p num="154">Expression Vectors for Maize Transformation</p>
    <p num="155">Marker Genes</p>
    <p num="156">
      Expression vectors include at least one genetic marker, operably linked to a regulatory element (a promoter, for example) that allows transformed cells containing the marker to be either recovered by negative selection, i.e. inhibiting growth of cells that do not contain the selectable marker gene, or by positive selection, i.e., screening for the product encoded by the genetic marker.
      <br/>
      Many commonly used selectable marker genes for plant transformation are well known in the transformation arts, and include, for example, genes that code for enzymes that metabolically detoxify a selective chemical agent which may be an antibiotic or a herbicide, or genes that encode an altered target which is insensitive to the inhibitor.
      <br/>
      A few positive selection methods are also known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      One commonly used selectable marker gene for plant transformation is the neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptll) gene, isolated from transposon Tn5, which when placed under the control of plant regulatory signals confers resistance to kanamycin.
      <br/>
      Fraley et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 80: 4803 (1983).

      Another commonly used selectable marker gene is the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene which confers resistance to the antibiotic hygromycin.

    <p num="159">
      Other selectable marker genes for plant transformation are not of bacterial origin.

    <p num="160">
      Another class of marker genes for plant transformation require screening of presumptively transformed plant cells rather than direct genetic selection of transformed cells for resistance to a toxic substance such as an antibiotic.
      <br/>
      These genes are particularly useful to quantify or visualize the spatial pattern of expression of a gene in specific tissues and are frequently referred to as reporter genes because they can be fused to a gene or gene regulatory sequence for the investigation of gene expression.
      <br/>
      Commonly used genes for screening presumptively transformed cells include  BETA -glucuronidase (GUS),  BETA -galactosidase, luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.

    <p num="163">Promoters</p>
    <p num="164">
      Genes included in expression vectors must be driven by a nucleotide sequence comprising a regulatory element, for example, a promoter.
      <br/>
      Several types of promoters are now well known in the transformation arts, as are other regulatory elements that can be used alone or in combination with promoters.
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      As used herein "promoter" includes reference to a region of DNA upstream from the start of transcription and involved in recognition and binding of RNA polymerase and other proteins to initiate transcription.
      <br/>
      A "plant promoter" is a promoter capable of initiating transcription in plant cells.
      <br/>
      Examples of promoters under developmental control include promoters that preferentially initiate transcription in certain tissues, such as leaves, roots, seeds, fibers, xylem vessels, tracheids, or sclerenchyma.
      <br/>
      Such promoters are referred to as "tissue-preferred".
      <br/>
      Promoters which initiate transcription only in certain tissues are referred to as "tissue-specific".
      <br/>
      A "cell type" specific promoter primarily drives expression in certain cell types in one or more organs, for example, vascular cells in roots or leaves.
      <br/>
      An "inducible" promoter is a promoter which is under environmental control.
      <br/>
      Examples of environmental conditions that may effect transcription by inducible promoters include anaerobic conditions or the presence of light.
      <br/>
      Tissue-specific, tissue-preferred, cell type specific, and inducible promoters constitute the class of "non-constitutive" promoters.
      <br/>
      A "constitutive" promoter is a promoter which is active under most environmental conditions.

      Exemplary inducible promoters include, but are not limited to, that from the ACEI system which responds to copper (Mett et al. PNAS 90: 4567-4571 (1993)); In2 gene from maize which responds to benzenesulfonamide herbicide safeners (Hershey et al., Mol. Gen. Genetics 227: 229-237 (1991) and Gatz et al., Mol. Gen. Genetics 243: 32-38 (1994)) or Tet repressor from Tn10 (Gatz et al., Mol. Gen. Genet 227: 229-237 (1991).
      <br/>
      A particularly preferred inducible promoter is a promoter that responds to an inducing agent to which plants do not normally respond.
      <br/>
      An exemplary inducible promoter is the inducible promoter from a steroid hormone gene, the transcriptional activity of which is induced by a glucocorticosteroid hormone.

    <p num="176">Signal Sequences for Targeting Proteins to Subcellular Compartments</p>
    <p num="177">
      Transport of protein produced by transgenes to a subcellular compartment such as the chloroplast, vacuole, peroxisome, glyoxysome, cell wall or mitochondrion, or for secretion into the apoplast, is accomplished by means of operably linking the nucleotide sequence encoding a signal sequence to the 5' and/or 3' region of a gene encoding the protein of interest.
      <br/>
      Targeting sequences at the 5' and/or 3' end of the structural gene may determine, during protein synthesis and processing, where the encoded protein is ultimately compartmentalized.

    <p num="179">
      With transgenic plants according to the present invention, a foreign protein can be produced in commercial quantities.
      <br/>
      Thus, techniques for the selection and propagation of transformed plants, which are well understood in the art, yield a plurality of transgenic plants which are harvested in a conventional manner, and a foreign protein then can be extracted from a tissue of interest or from total biomass.
      <br/>
      Protein extraction from plant biomass can be accomplished by known methods which are discussed, for example, by Heney and Orr, Anal.
      <br/>
      Biochem. 114: 92-6 (1981).

      According to a preferred embodiment, the transgenic plant provided for commercial production of foreign protein is maize.
      <br/>
      In another preferred embodiment, the biomass of interest is seed.
      <br/>
      For the relatively small number of transgenic plants that show higher levels of expression, a genetic map can be generated, primarily via conventional Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLP), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis, and Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) which identifies the approximate chromosomal location of the integrated DNA molecule.
      <br/>
      For exemplary methodologies in this regard, see Glick and Thompson, METHODS IN PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY 269-284 (CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1993).
      <br/>
      Map information concerning chromosomal location is useful for proprietary protection of a subject transgenic plant.
      <br/>
      If unauthorized propagation is undertaken and crosses made with other germplasm, the map of the integration region can be compared to similar maps for suspect plants, to determine if the latter have a common parentage with the subject plant.
      <br/>
      Map comparisons would involve hybridizations, RFLP, PCR, SSR and sequencing, all of which are conventional techniques.
