    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to an electrical apparatus, and more particularly to an electrically apparatus for electrically assembling a CPU device to a printed circuit board.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Conventional ZIF sockets are used for assembling a CPU to a printed circuit board.
      <br/>
      The socket generally comprises a base member including an array of contacting terminals, and a cover member defining an array of through holes corresponding to the contacting terminals.
      <br/>
      The cover member is movable with respect to the base member.
      <br/>
      An end of each contacting terminal is soldered into a mounting hole of the PCB.
      <br/>
      The ZIF socket includes actuation means for selectively displacing the cover member between a first position and a second position.
      <br/>
      When the cover member is at the first position, connecting pins of the CPU are easily inserted into the corresponding holes, i.e. zero-insertion-force.
      <br/>
      When the actuating means is actuated, the cover member is moved to the second position thereby electrically connecting each pin of the CPU with the corresponding contacting terminal.
      <br/>
      The CPU is secured in the socket when the cover member is at the second position.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      ZIF sockets function properly when the CPU is small.
      <br/>
      When the CPU becomes increasingly powerful, such as the Intel Pentium Series, heat dissipation becomes a critical factor for functional operation of the CPU.
      <br/>
      To address this problem, a heat sink and cooling fan assembly is attached to an upper face of the CPU for dissipating heat generated thereby to ensure normal operation of the CPU.
      <br/>
      However, operation of the cooling fan generates vibrations.
      <br/>
      The vibrations caused by the cooling fan are negligible when the heat sink and cooling fan assembly is small since the vibrations do not adversely affect the electrical connection between the CPU and the socket.
      <br/>
      However, the heat sink and cooling fan assembly for Intel Pentium series or other high performance CPUs is large and heavier than conventional heat sink and cooling fan assemblies.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, vibrations caused by the larger heat sink and cooling fan assembly adversely affect the electrical connection between the connecting pins of the CPU and the connecting terminals of the socket.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In order to solve this problem, a retainer is used to secure the CPU to a frame thereby ensuring reliable electrical connection between the connecting pins of the CPU and the connecting terminals of the socket.
      <br/>
      However, once the CPU is held stationary, the conventional ZIF socket is of no use because it is impossible to move the connecting pins of the CPU by means of the cover member.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">An objective of this invention is to provide an electrical apparatus for electrically assembling a stationary CPU to a printed circuit board whereby a slide member thereby an electrical connection between connecting pins of the CPU and conductive contacts of a printed circuit board can be attained by bridging terminals carried on a slide member of the apparatus.</p>
    <p num="6">
      In order to achieve the objective set forth, an electrical apparatus in accordance with the present invention comprises an electrical device including at least a first terminal.
      <br/>
      A carrier for electrically connecting the electrical device to a printed circuit board including at least a conductive contact includes at least a bridging terminal disposed between the first terminal and the conductive contact.
      <br/>
      The bridging terminal is arranged to be selectively displaced between a first position at which the first terminal and the conductive contact are not connected, and a second position at which the first terminal and the conductive contact are electrically connected by the bridging terminal.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      According to another embodiment of an electrical apparatus for electrically assembling a CPU to a printed circuit board, the CPU forming an array of first terminal comprises a base member securely assembled to the printed circuit board.
      <br/>
      The base member includes an array of metal posts corresponding to the array of first terminals.
      <br/>
      An end of each metal post is electrically connected to a conductive contact of the printed circuit board.
      <br/>
      A cover member is securely assembled to the base member and a receiving slot is defined between the cover and base members.
      <br/>
      The cover member defines an array of through holes corresponding to the array of first terminals of the base member.
      <br/>
      A slide member is movably arranged within the receiving slot and defines an array of terminal cells corresponding to the array of first terminals.
      <br/>
      Each cell securely receives a bridging terminal therein.
      <br/>
