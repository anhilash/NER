    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to a medical diagnostic ultrasound system and method for improving Doppler processing, such as color flow imaging.
      <br/>
      In particular, increasing the accuracy of Doppler estimates is provided by using signals at multiple frequency bands.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Doppler imaging comprises receiving signals in a single frequency band, such as at a fundamental frequency band or at a second harmonic frequency band of the fundamental frequency band.
      <br/>
      Typically, the frequency band is narrowly defined within the available broadband system bandwidth, increasing the amount of transmitted power and the signal to noise ratio (SNR).
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      One ensemble of received signals is processed to estimate motion at each point in space along an ultrasound line.
      <br/>
      This process is repeated over many ultrasound lines within an image frame.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Doppler imaging of tissue and blood is a qualitative diagnostic tool.
      <br/>
      The tool remains qualitative partly due to the inaccuracies of estimates.
      <br/>
      The demand for adequate frame rates, diagnostic resolution, and reasonable interrogated areas dictate that an ultrasound system typically only transmit 2 to 16 pulses to insonify any distinct point in space.
      <br/>
      This constraint may create estimate drop-outs in flow fields and demand extensive spatial and/or temporal averaging of estimates resulting in inaccurate differentiation between flow and tissue.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Some processes to increase sensitivity to Doppler velocities above conventional maximum velocity detection limits use signals at two different frequency bands.
      <br/>
      Conventional Doppler systems may not provide for accurate detection of velocities beyond a maximum value determined primarily by the center frequency within a single receive band.
      <br/>
      The sensitivity to velocities above this limit (the aliasing limit) is increased by using two different frequency bands.
      <br/>
      The difference between Doppler frequencies obtained from two separate narrow frequency bands is calculated.
      <br/>
      Since this difference Doppler frequency is less than the Doppler frequency from either of the two frequency bands independently, the maximum detect able Doppler frequency is extended.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      For example, Powers describes in U.S. Pat. No. 4,534,357 a system that transmits broad, single band, pulses and then processes receive signals from two narrow receive bands for each broadband pulse transmitted.
      <br/>
      In other examples, Fehr in U.S. Pat. No. 5,046,500 and Burckhardt in U.S. Pat. No. 5,183,047 describe systems that transmit pulses composed of two separate narrow frequency bands and then process signals from a corresponding two narrow receive bands for each transmitted pulse.
      <br/>
      However, methods extend the maximum detectable velocities only.

      No. 08/838,920, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,961,460, filed Apr. 11, 1997, imaging enhancements using two different frequency bands are disclosed.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, two different types of scan-converted images are combined into a single image by using a two-dimensional look-up-table (LUT).
      <br/>
      For example, an image of contrast agents corresponding to a harmonic frequency band is combined with an image corresponding to a fundamental frequency band.
      <br/>
      In one further embodiment in the above referenced application, "either or both of the fundamental and harmonic images are generated from signals detected by the Doppler detector 22 with no clutter filtering" (page 16).

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="18">
      In preferred embodiments described below, the bandwidth of the ultrasound system may be more effectively used to generate accurate Doppler images.
      <br/>
      The spectral bandwidth of an ultrasound system and associated phased array transducer is proportional to information content.
      <br/>
      Narrowband pulses are common in color flow mapping (i.e. Doppler imaging), since narrowband pulses may improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
      <br/>
      Due to transmit voltage limits, narrowband pulses can increase the transmitted power as compared to broadband, shorter pulses.
      <br/>
      Narrowband pulses are also common in gated spectral Doppler systems, since the pulse length is usually matched to the user's selected gate size and increased pulse lengths can improve the SNR.
      <br/>
      Further, when the SNR is sufficient, a narrowband pulse may still be preferred over a broadband pulse since the axial resolution of a broadband pulse can exceed the lateral resolution of a system.
      <br/>
      Sample volumes with comparable resolutions along orthogonal dimensions are often preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The information made available to a motion detection system is increased by selectively processing received signals from two or more frequency bands.
      <br/>
      The transmitted pulses may be composed of a single broadband spectrum or single or multiple narrow frequency band spectra.
      <br/>
      To acquire the greater information content, separate Doppler estimates or values are obtained at the two or more received frequency bands.
      <br/>
      This additional information may be used to improve the accuracy and precision of Doppler images and better differentiate tissue from fluid flow.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      This process effectively increases the flow sample count for Doppler processing.
      <br/>
      The number of pulses transmitted along any one scan line is called the flow sample count (FSC).
      <br/>
      These multiple transmissions result in an ensemble or set of received signals for estimating motion at each depth along the scan line.
      <br/>
      The received signals are filtered to isolate information at two or more different frequency bands, such as at, including at least some of, or within the transmitted band of frequencies (i.e. the fundamental frequency band) or at or within a harmonic band of the fundamental band of frequencies.
      <br/>
      As used herein, harmonic broadly includes integer harmonics (e.g. the second, third, fourth . . . harmonic), fractional sub-harmonics (e.g. 1/2 harmonic) and fractional ultra-harmonics (e.g. 3/2 harmonic).
      <br/>
      The isolated receive signals for each frequency band are separately used to estimate motion, such as velocity, energy, and/or variance of motion.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The accuracy and precision of each parameter estimate is limited by the FSC.
      <br/>
      By generating Doppler values for each frequency band, the estimation of motion may be improved without any additional firings.
      <br/>
      Combining the ensembles and/or providing a selection process based upon thresholds increases the accuracy and effective FSC for each Doppler value used to generate an image.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Referring to FIG. 1, one preferred embodiment of a medical diagnostic ultrasound system for implementing the Doppler processing and combination and/or selection discussed above is shown generally at 20.
      <br/>
      The ultrasound system 20 comprises a transmitter 22, a switch 24, a transducer 26, a receive beamformer 28, a motion detection system 30, a B-mode processor 32, a scan converter 34 and a display 36.
      <br/>
      These components are connected as shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The system 20 generally comprises one of any conventional ultrasound systems, such as ultrasound systems manufactured by Acuson Corporation under the trade names 128XP, Aspen, and Sequoia.
      <br/>
      Other ultrasound systems by other manufacturers may be used, including digital or analog systems currently manufactured and systems yet to be manufactured or designed.
      <br/>
      These ultrasound systems are designed or altered to provide the motion detection system 30 discussed herein.
      <br/>
      As discussed above, motion detection is performed for each of two or more frequency bands.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The transmitters 22 comprise transmitters for generating appropriately delayed and apodized waveforms for an aperture of the transducer 26.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the transmitters 22 are operable to generate waveforms for transmit pulses with a signal content composed of one frequency band or multiple frequency bands.
      <br/>
      The transmitters 22 may comprise unipolar or bipolar gate burst devices, analog or digital devices, and/or programmable devices.
      <br/>
      For example, the transmitters described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,046,500 and 5,675,554 are used.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The waveforms generated by the transmitters 22 are switched to the transducer 26 by switch 24.
      <br/>
      The switch 24 comprises a multiplexer or other device for separating the transmitter 22 from the receive beamformer 28.
      <br/>
      The transducer 26 preferably comprises a phased array transducer for imaging in one or more of various formats.
      <br/>
      The transducer may be a 1D, 1.5D, or 2D phased array transducer.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The transducer 26 generates a transmit pulse in response to the waveforms.
      <br/>
      The pulse comprises an ultrasonic wave focused along one or more scan lines.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The transmit pulse is characterized by one or more bandwidths and spectral distributions.
      <br/>
      For example and referring to FIG. 3, one possible frequency distribution of a transmitted pulse is shown at 50.
      <br/>
      The frequency distribution 50 includes two more narrow band frequency distributions 52 and 54.
      <br/>
      Each more narrow frequency band 52 and 54 is defined by a center frequency fx and a bandwidth BWx.
      <br/>
      The frequency distribution 50 of the transmitted pulse, including the more narrow frequency bands 52 and 54, is within a bandwidth 56 of the transducer 26 and the imaging system 20.
      <br/>
      The bandwidth may be defined at any level relative to the peak sensitivity, such as -3 dB or -6.82 dB. Different spectral shapes (e.g. fall off) and distributions may be used, including transmitting only at one dominant single frequency band.
      <br/>
      For example, a transducer with a relative bandwidth of 80 percent (e.g. 4 MHz centered about 5 MHz) is used to transmit a pulse with a bandwidth of about 1 MHz centered about 4 MHz.
      <br/>
      For higher frequency imaging and improved lateral resolution, a higher center frequency may be used.
      <br/>
      Broadband pulses may also be used.
      <br/>
      Frequencies within the transmitted bandwidth comprise fundamental frequencies.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The wave propagates through and reflects off of structures within a target.
      <br/>
      The target may comprise one or more of various fluids, tissues and optionally contrast agents.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Referring to FIG. 1, the transducer 26 converts reflected echoes of the ultrasonic wave into electrical signals.
      <br/>
      For each transmission, the echoes are sampled along the scan line by the receive beamformer 28.
      <br/>
      The receive beamformer 28 comprises a digital or analog beamformer for converting the electrical signals of multiple channels in the transducer 26 into receive samples representing the target along the scan line.
      <br/>
      These receive samples correspond to range gates or depth.
      <br/>
      The receive samples may comprise digital or analog data.
    </p>
    <p num="30">This transmission and reception process is repeated two or more times along each scan line to generate an ensemble comprising a number of received samples equaling the FSC for each depth of interest along one or more scan lines.</p>
    <p num="31">
      The received samples are optionally passed to the B-mode processor 32 for detection.
      <br/>
      The detected information is scan converted by scan converter 34 for display of an image on the display 36.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The received samples are also provided to the motion detection system 30.
      <br/>
      The motion detection system 30 comprises two filters 38 and two Doppler processors 40 in parallel data paths connected to a combination and/or selection processor 42.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The filters 38 comprise bandpass, high pass, low pass or other filters for isolating receive signals at a selected frequency band from the received samples.
      <br/>
      Each filter 38 isolates information at a different frequency band.
      <br/>
      In alternative embodiments, only one filter 38 and a memory are provided for sequentially isolating the receive signals at two or more different frequency bands.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Referring to FIG. 2, a preferred embodiment of each filter 38 is shown at 60.
      <br/>
      The filter 60 comprises a demodulator 62 and a baseband filter 64.
      <br/>
      The demodulator shifts the frequencies of interest into the passband of the baseband filter 64.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the baseband filter 64 is characterized by a center of the passband being at DC (i.e., zero frequency), such as a low pass filter.
      <br/>
      The baseband filter 64 may have a programmable pass band.
      <br/>
      Demodulation down to a frequency other than DC and a baseband filter with a passband centered at a frequency other than zero may also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The frequency used for demodulation may change as a function of depth, such as to account for propagation characteristics of the transmit pulse.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the baseband filter characteristics may change as a function of depth and/or scan line position.
      <br/>
      The baseband filter may comprise a real or complex filter for providing variable filter impulse responses for changing the bandwidth, center frequency and/or roll-off.
      <br/>
      If nonlinear phase modulated pulses are transmitted, as with many coded waveforms, complex filtering can be used to decode the waveforms accurately.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the filtering may change as a function of the receive beam for imaging modes that use more than one receive beam per transmit beam.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Referring to FIG. 1, the filters 38 isolate receive signals at two or more different frequency bands.
      <br/>
      The two or more receive frequency bands may comprise: (1) components substantially within the same frequency components as transmitted, where the transmitted pulse may be composed of a single broadband spectrum or separate narrowband spectra; (2) one receive band substantially the same as or within the transmitted frequency band and one receive band with signal components originating from nonlinear scattering, reflection, or propagation of ultrasound; or (3) both receive bands containing frequency components substantially not present in the transmitted pulse.
      <br/>
      For example and referring to FIG. 3, the filters 38 separately isolate receive signals at the two more narrow frequency bands 52 and 54.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The isolated receive signals at the two different frequency bands are provided to the Doppler processors 40.
      <br/>
      The Doppler processors 40 comprise motion detectors or signal processors incorporating Doppler processing algorithms or other motion detection algorithms, such as auto-correlation algorithms, cross-correlation algorithms or Fast Fourier transform algorithms.
      <br/>
      Preferably, at least two Doppler processing paths or processors 40 are provided for processing the receive signals at the two frequency bands in parallel.

      A set of received signals from two or more transmitted pulses are stored in the corner turning memory 72.

      Low pass or bandpass filters may also be used.

      Estimating clutter signal characteristics may be useful for adaptive clutter suppression techniques.

      Furthermore and referring to FIGS. 1 and 4, with the use of two separate Doppler processors 40, the two clutter filters 74 may be applied independent of each other.

      For example, one clutter filter 74 has an impulse response with a lower cut-off frequency than the other clutter filter 74.

      Independent application is useful since nonlinear propagation and other mechanisms for generating harmonic energy may produce signals associated with broader bandwidths than the transmitted bandwidth.

      This broader bandwidth improves resolution and thus can reduce deleterious clutter.

      FIG. 5 represents the preferred averaging embodiment.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the Doppler values at each frequency band are weighted.
      <br/>
      Given two different frequency bands, two Doppler values for each parameter at each spatial location are averaged as a function of the relative weights or coefficients  ALPHA  and 1- ALPHA .
      <br/>
      The coefficients may be selected as a function of the imaging application or otherwise set.
      <br/>
      For example, each coefficient is set to 0.5 for averaging the Doppler values equally.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      In a preferred alternative embodiment, the coefficients are adaptively selected as a function of one or more Doppler values, such as represented by parameter weighting block 90.
      <br/>
      For example, the coefficients used to weight the different Doppler values are determined as a function of the two input energy estimates.
      <br/>
      Preferably, estimates generated under high SNR conditions are weighted more heavily than those estimates that were generated under low SNR conditions.
      <br/>
      If a velocity or variance was estimated under poor SNR conditions, the Doppler value may not be accurate.
      <br/>
      Energy estimates may provide a measure of SNR.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The coefficient, a, may be fixed at 0.5 within a scale of 0 to 0.5 if the energy between the estimates at different frequency bands are similar or within a range of each other.
      <br/>
      Other functions of the two energy Doppler values may be defined for selecting the coefficients.
      <br/>
      For example, the weighting coefficient,  ALPHA , may be linear over the dynamic range of the received energy values.
      <br/>
      In yet other alternatives, Doppler values representing parameters other than energy are used to select the coefficients, or different parameters may be used for determining coefficients applied to fewer than all of the other Doppler parameters.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      As an alternative to linear selection of the coefficients, non-linear selection may be provided.
      <br/>
      For example and referring to FIG. 6, the coefficient,  ALPHA , is selected as a function of a ratio of the two energies at the different frequency bands, such as fundamental and harmonic frequency bands.
      <br/>
      If the ratio is below a threshold Eth1, or above a threshold Eth2, the coefficient is constant at 0 and 0.5, respectively.
      <br/>
      Between these two thresholds, a linear or nonlinear relationship between the coefficient and the energy ratio is used.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 shows a linear function between Eth1 and Eth2.
      <br/>
      Experimentation for each clinical application may yield different functions.

      Energy values for determining the coefficients may be defined for Doppler values at any one or both of the two received frequency bands as the total energy above a noise level.

      The following examples show the contribution of combination and/or selection to the display of two-dimensional color flow imaging with improved accuracy and tissue/clutter differentiation.
      <br/>
      In a first example, blood vessel imaging using the fundamental and second harmonic frequency bands without contrast agents in the target is performed.
      <br/>
      A sample volume within a blood vessel reflects energy in the transmitted fundamental frequency band and energy accumulated around the second harmonic frequency band of the fundamental energy.
      <br/>
      The clutter filters 74 remove clutter from the nearby vessel walls and other clutter signals in both frequency bands.
      <br/>
      The thresholders 78 determine that all the Doppler values are associated with valid flow (i.e., exhibit adequate SNR).
      <br/>
      The combination and/or selection processor 42 sets the weighting coefficient to 0.5 since the energy estimates are similar in magnitude.
      <br/>
      The decision criteria block 96 selects the combination data for one or more parameters since the Doppler energy values at each frequency band are strong and the Doppler velocity values are nonzero.
      <br/>
      By using combined data from two frequency bands, the imaging value provides reduced estimation variability (i.e. effectively higher FSC).
      <br/>
      If the Doppler values at the second harmonic frequency band are unacceptable due to a poor SNR (e.g., low energy) and optionally low velocity, the Doppler value at the fundamental frequency band is selected.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      In a second example, imaging at the fundamental and second harmonic frequency bands without contrast agents of a blood vessel and tissue distal to the blood vessel is provided.
      <br/>
      A conventional system may inaccurately display a velocity estimate at the tissue sample volume, despite the lack of any blood flow.
      <br/>
      This problem may be due to acoustic reverberations where multiple reflections have delayed the reception of a velocity estimate from the center of a vessel, such that the estimate results in erroneous display of information distal to the blood vessel.
      <br/>
      Since tissue generated signals at harmonic frequencies may originate, reflect, and propagate along an effectively different path to the same point in space than signals at the transmitted fundamental frequency band, acoustic reverberations of the signals at harmonic frequencies may be significantly diminished.
      <br/>
      After clutter filtering, the harmonic frequency band Doppler value more accurately indicates a lack of flow.
      <br/>
      In this scenario, the decision criteria block 96 is provided two strong Doppler energy values, one nonzero large velocity estimate for the fundamental frequency band, and one low velocity estimate (or zero) for the harmonic frequency band.
      <br/>
      Since the harmonic frequency band Doppler values represent the sample volume as clutter (i.e., low or zero velocity, and possibly low variance) and indicate adequate SNR (e.g. high energy), the image value is selected as a null value, reducing the bleed over of inaccurate velocity estimates at sample volumes representing tissue.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Since the level of signals at the second harmonic generated from tissue propagation can be 20-30 dB below the peak signal level at the fundamental frequency band, a two dimensional color flow image generated solely based on second harmonic energy may have inferior SNR over a practical display area.
      <br/>
      Thus, generating second harmonic color flow images may be impractical without contrast agents, but the available energy from nonlinear propagation can be used to complement the detection process of energy at fundamental frequencies by using combination data.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      In a third example, signals at fundamental and harmonic frequency bands are used to image contrast agents in a target.
      <br/>
      When imaging with contrast agents, processing signals at the second harmonic frequency band is preferred.
      <br/>
      Second harmonic energy from contrast agents increases agent specificity.
      <br/>
      Since the flow-to-clutter ratio of signals at the second harmonic frequency band can be larger than the flow-to-clutter ratio of signals at the fundamental frequency band, selecting the second harmonic frequency band may provide improved clutter and flash suppression.
      <br/>
      Doppler values at the harmonic and fundamental frequency bands are averaged, or the combination selected, when the Doppler values at the harmonic frequency band are "good," such as a high energy, and optionally high variance and non-zero velocity.
      <br/>
      The Doppler values at the fundamental frequency are selectively included without reducing the benefits of increased specificity and sensitivity when harmonics are the preferred imaging mode.
      <br/>
      Since the harmonic image is preferred in this application, Doppler values at the fundamental frequency band are not included in the final output image (e.g. Doppler values at the second harmonic frequency band are selected instead of the combination data) when the Doppler values at the second harmonic are "poor," such as associated with a low SNR.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      In a fourth example, signals received at fundamental and harmonic frequency bands are used to image contrast agents in a target after transmitting at one or more frequency bands.
      <br/>
      Imaging at the second harmonic or a sub-harmonic frequency of the fundamental may be preferred.
      <br/>
      As was described in the previous example three, harmonic frequency information may improve agent specificity and "good" harmonic estimates may be identified based on high energy levels and optionally other parameters, such as high variance and/or non-zero velocity.
      <br/>
      In this example, Doppler values, preferably energy values, at the two frequency bands are multiplied together and made available at the switches 98.
      <br/>
      When the Doppler values from both frequency bands are "good" values, the decision criteria block 96 selects the multiplied combination.
      <br/>
      The multiplied combination effectively increases specificity of harmonic signals since the multiplication of the two like parameters can be designed to yield a result that is larger than the summation of the two values.
      <br/>
      If the harmonic frequency parameter is a "good" estimate and the fundamental frequency parameter is a "poor" estimate, the value of the harmonic frequency is selected instead of the multiplied combination.
      <br/>
      A "poor" fundamental estimate may be identified based on low variance and/or low velocity.
      <br/>
      Values at the fundamental frequency band may be more significantly corrupted by clutter than is the case with the harmonic frequency estimate.
      <br/>
      If both frequency band estimates are "poor" the null parameter is selected with the switches 98.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Harmonic frequency bands other than the second harmonic may be used.
      <br/>
      For example, signals at a sub-harmonic frequency band are isolated.
      <br/>
      For sub-harmonics, the transmit pulse may include some energy at the sub-harmonic frequency band, such as seeding the desired sub-harmonic frequency band with energy in the transmit pulse sufficient to provide adequate SNR.

      If one of the Doppler energy values at the two different frequency bands corresponding to the Doppler velocity values is below a threshold indicative of adequate SNR, then the algorithm to extend the limit is bypassed (i.e. not applied) regardless of whether the velocities are within or beyond the conventional limits.
      <br/>
      Using energy to determine application of the algorithm avoids displaying poor velocity estimates due to poor SNR or significant suppression by the clutter filters 74.

      While the invention has been described above by reference to various embodiments, it will be understood that many changes and modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      For example, selection without combination may be used to improve accuracy, or combination without selection may be used to improve accuracy.
      <br/>
      Clutter filtering, spatial filtering, temporal filtering, application of the algorithm to extend the maximum velocity limits and other processing may be bypassed or not provided.
      <br/>
      Various techniques for estimating motion may be used.
