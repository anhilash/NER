      A soil sampling system includes a rig for driving a drive casing, a sample barrel, and sample liners simultaneously into soil to be sampled.
      <br/>
      The rig includes mechanisms for driving the casing, barrel, and lining in three modes: hydraulic hammer, continuous pressure, and vibration.
      <br/>
      The three drive mechanisms can be operated singly or in any combination.
      <br/>
      After the casing, barrel, and liners are advanced a selected depth into the soil, the barrel and liners are removed.
      <br/>
      The drive casing remains in the soil.
      <br/>
      New sample liners are put into the sample barrel, and an inner rod is attached to the sample barrel.
      <br/>
      The sample barrel is then replaced into the drive casing, and extensions are attached to the drive casing.
      <br/>
      The drive casing, including extensions, and the sample barrels, along with sample liners and inner rod, are driven further down into the soil.
      <br/>
      The rig also includes a winch that can be coupled to the inner rod or sample barrel so that the casing and/or barrel (including sample liners) can be retrieved from the drive casing.
      <br/>
      A clamp system allows the sampler to be hydraulically retracted from the ground when sampling is finished.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to soil sampling systems and, more particularly, to hollow-tubed soil samplers.
      <br/>
      A major objective of the present invention is to provide for enhanced collection of soil samples for chemical or physical analysis.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Contamination of soils is a major environmental concern.
      <br/>
      Toxic compounds can remain in the soil for years, and can seep into groundwater, causing serious environmental and health problems.
      <br/>
      Because contamination is often located many feet below the surface, identifying and treating contaminated soils can be problematic.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In a typical system for sampling for soil contamination, soil samples are collected at discrete levels.
      <br/>
      A hollow-stem auger powered by a large motor drill rig is typically used.
      <br/>
      The drilling rig can weigh as much as 30 tons, and is typically mounted on a large truck.
      <br/>
      The auger is typically about 8" in diameter.
      <br/>
      The outside has a spiral flighting that aids travel through the soil and that removes the waste dirt ("cuttings") from the borehole.
      <br/>
      During drilling, the hollow auger is plugged.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      After the initial soil depth to be investigated is reached, and while the auger is in place in the ground, the plug is removed.
      <br/>
      Next, a hollow cylindrical drive sampler is inserted into the hole created by the auger.
      <br/>
      The drive sampler is driven, via a drive rod and hydraulic or pneumatic hammer, ahead of the lead auger into the soil to be sampled.
      <br/>
      Soil is forced into the hollow center of the drive sampler, which can contain stainless steel or brass sample sleeves.
      <br/>
      A large winch, usually attached to a mast about 20' tall, then engages the drive rod, and the drive rod, sampler, sleeves, and soil are removed, leaving an open hole.
      <br/>
      For the next sample, the auger drills to the next depth to be sampled, and the process is repeated.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In cases of chemical contamination, contaminated soil may be confined to thin soil layers, sometimes only an inch or two thick.
      <br/>
      The discrete sampling of many previous systems, often taken at intervals of several feet, can miss areas of contamination and yield false negative results.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Furthermore, where contamination is encountered, the cuttings created by the typical augering system and brought to the ground surface, are also often contaminated, and must be disposed of as hazardous waste.
      <br/>
      Such disposal is often difficult and very expensive, because the soil requires special handling and disposal.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Single-rod non-auger drilling systems are sometimes used to sample relatively shallow depths.
      <br/>
      Single-rod systems can often be driven by more compact drilling rigs, but they are associated with other problems.
      <br/>
      To retrieve the sampler from the soil, skin friction of the soil must be overcome, requiring a significant amount of pull.
      <br/>
      In addition, because the borehole is not continuously cased off, contaminants from upper levels often slough off and contaminate lower levels, leading to false positive readings.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The drilling rig and winch in the typical prior art system can often harm the environment around the area to be tested.
      <br/>
      As described above, the entire system can be over 20' tall, weigh 30 tons, and be mounted on a truck 20' long.
      <br/>
      A rig in place can disrupt traffic.
      <br/>
      Landscaping around the area to be tested can be destroyed.
      <br/>
      If the area to be tested is under an existing structure, roofs or walls may have to be removed.
      <br/>
      Providing access for the equipment can also be destructive, time-consuming, and expensive.
    </p>
    <p num="10">What is needed is a soil sampling system that is compact and efficient, that allows for continuous, accurate soil samples to be collected, and that minimizes the amount of cuttings created during sampling.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      In accordance with the present invention, a soil sampling system includes a double-rod sampler and a driving rig.
      <br/>
      The double-rod sampler includes a casing and inner sample barrel, along with sample liners, that are driven simultaneously into the soil to be sampled.
      <br/>
      The system allows a vertically continuous sample to be collected while casing off the hole, thus sealing the borehole from sloughed-off contaminants from higher levels to minimize false readings of contamination.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The drive casing and sample barrel (with sample liners) are driven simultaneously into the ground.
      <br/>
      The barrel and liners are then removed, while the drive casing stays in place.
      <br/>
      New sample liners are placed in the sample barrel, and a new length of drive casing and an inner rod are attached.
      <br/>
      The liners, barrel, drive casing, and inner rod are then driven a further distance into the ground, and the process is repeated.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Minimal cuttings are created by the double-rod sampling system.
      <br/>
      Since the sample rod system is narrow (for example, the system can be only 2.25" in diameter at the widest point that enters the ground as opposed to 8" typical of systems in the prior art), far fewer cuttings are created.
      <br/>
      Most of the soil displaced by the double-rod system is retrieved in the sample barrel; the rest is compressed into the surrounding soil.
      <br/>
      The double rod system also does not have flightings that can carry contaminated cuttings to the surface, as does the hollow-stem auger.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Removal of the sample from the soil is much easier than in the prior art.
      <br/>
      Because the borehole is sealed off by the drive casing, there is no soil-skin friction to overcome when retrieving the sample barrel.
      <br/>
      Removal of the sample barrel (containing the soil samples in the sample liners) is easier and quicker, improving the speed and efficiency of the system of the invention as compared to previous systems.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The rig driving the soil sampling system can be significantly more compact than is typical in the prior art.
      <br/>
      It can be mounted on a conventional skid loader, and thus can be conveniently moved into locations that would not accommodate a conventional drilling rig.
      <br/>
      The rig can be configured to slant drill and can even drill horizontally.
      <br/>
      The double-rod sampling system can thus sample under buildings or existing structures without the necessity of dismantling or destroying them.
      <br/>
      Thus, the invention provides for reliable and effective sampling of contaminated soils, even at sites where access is restricted.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In a method in accordance with the invention, a drive casing, sample barrel, and sample liners are driven simultaneously into the soil to essentially the same depth.
      <br/>
      Thus, all portions of the borehole are sealed off while the sample is obtained, preventing sample contamination from sloughed-off soil from higher levels.
      <br/>
      In addition, the sample barrel and liners can be removed and replaced while the drive casing stays in place.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The method of the invention of taking and retrieving samples facilitates the taking of continuous samples.
      <br/>
      The bottom sample depth attained by one round of sampling becomes the top sample depth of the next round of sampling.
      <br/>
      A continuous sample is thus obtained and even thin layers of contamination are retrieved, thus maximizing sampling reliability.
      <br/>
      These and other features and advantages of the present invention are apparent in the following description with reference to the drawings below.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="19">
      In accordance with the present invention, a double-rod soil sampling system 100 comprises a sampling rig 110 and a double-rod sampler 150, a shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      Sampling rig 110 includes three driving systems: a hydraulic hammer 112, hydraulic vibrators 114, and hydraulic pressure cylinders 116, shown in block diagram in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Respective drive controls include hammer controls 118 (including a hammer slide control that horizontally positions hammer 112 and a hammer pounding control the controls the pounding of hammer 112); a vibrator control 120; and a pressure control 122.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Sampling rig 110 also includes two retraction systems and their controls, as shown in block diagram in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      A sample retrieval system includes a winch control 202 and a winch 204.
      <br/>
      A sampler retrieval system includes an upper clamp control 206, controlling upper clamp 208, and a lower clamp control 210, controlling lower clamp 212.
      <br/>
      The controls are mounted on the rig and control the respective driving and retracting systems of FIGS. 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      Sampling rig 110 drives and retracts a double-rod sampler 150 and its components, shown in block diagram in FIGS. 1 and 2.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In double-rod sampler 150, a drive shoe 152 is attached to a non-rotatable drive casing 154.
      <br/>
      Next, sample liners 156 are placed inside a sample barrel 158, which in turn is placed within drive casing 154.
      <br/>
      A drive head 160 is then attached to the top of drive casing 154, rigidly coupling drive casing 154 and sample barrel 158.
      <br/>
      Double-rod sampler 150 is then driven into the soil by one or a combination of the drive systems of rig 110.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Drive head 160, drive casing 154, sample barrel 158, sample liners 156, and drive shoe 152 are thus driven into the soil as a unit.
      <br/>
      When the bottom depth for a round of sampling is reached, drive head 160, drive casing 154, sample barrel 158, sample liners 156, and drive shoe 152 are in the same relative positions they were in before being driven into the soil.
      <br/>
      Sample liners 156 are filled with soil sample.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the bottom edges of drive casing 154, sample barrel 158, and sample liners are at the same level, with the bottom edge of drive shoe extending about 1.8" below that level.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the bottom edge of drive casing 154 can extend up to 12" below the bottom edge of sample liners 156.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Once sample liners 156 are filled with a sample, winch 204 is attached to sample barrel 158.
      <br/>
      Winch control 202 then causes winch 204 to pull sample barrel 158, containing sample liners 156, from the soil.
      <br/>
      Drive casing 154 can be left in the soil to case off the hole while the barrel and liners are removed.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      New sample liners can then be placed into sample barrel 158, and sample barrel 158 and liners 156 can then be replaced within drive casing 154.
      <br/>
      An additional length of drive casing can then be attached to the drive casing in the soil.
      <br/>
      An inner rod 162 can be attached to the sample barrel to keep the sample barrel and liners pressed to the bottom of double-rod sampler 150.
      <br/>
      Inner rod 162 is a three-foot steel tube about 1.5" in diameter.
      <br/>
      The upper end of inner rod 162 is female threaded, and the bottom end is male threaded, so that lengths of inner rod can be coupled together.
      <br/>
      Use of the inner rod allows for the use of only one segment of sample barrel.
      <br/>
      Because inner rod 162 is attached for sampling only after the first round of sampling, it is shown in the block diagrams (FIGS. 1 and 2) in dashed lines.
      <br/>
      Drive head 160 is then replaced, and system 100 is ready for another round of sampling.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The pressure, hammer, and vibration systems, each of which is suitably used as a direct push system, can be operated singly or in any combination to drive sampler 150 into the ground.
      <br/>
      The selection of drive mechanisms is operator controlled, based on soil conditions and monitoring of the driving process.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Winch 204 is attached indirectly to sample barrel 154.
      <br/>
      Winch 204 is then operated alone to retrieve sample barrel 158 and sample liners 156 for each round of sampling.
      <br/>
      When the sampling procedure is completed, upper clamp 208 is clamped to drive casing 154, and pressure cylinders 116 are operated in reverse to remove drive casing 154 and drive shoe 152 from the ground.
      <br/>
      Upper clamp 208 and lower clamp 212 are operated independently.
      <br/>
      When sampler 150 is retracted over 3' from the ground, the upper clamp can be released, and the upper 3' section of drive casing can be removed.
      <br/>
      During this removal, lower clamp 212 is clamped to a lower section of drive casing to keep sampler 150 suspended in the borehole.
      <br/>
      Upper clamp 208 is then reclamped, lower clamp 212 is released, and the procedure is repeated.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Rig 110, shown in perspective view in FIG. 3, is a compact mounting system for hammer 112, vibrator 114, pressure device 116, and winch 204 of FIGS. 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      The rig weighs about two tons, and can be approximately 8' * 3' * 3'. Rig 110 drives and retracts the double-rod soil sampler shown schematically in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Soil sampler 150 is placed within the jaws of an upper clamp 208, beneath a hammer housing 302.
      <br/>
      Hydraulic hammer 112 is a jackhammer-type pile drive housed in rectangular hammer housing 302.
      <br/>
      One example of such a hammer is the OKADA model OKB301, as available for purchase in September 1992, from Okada Company, Osaka, Japan.
      <br/>
      The hydraulic hammer delivers energy of about 250 ft. lbs. per blow, with variable rates of about 800-1300 blows per minute.
      <br/>
      The hammer blows are delivered by a piston that is hydraulically moved up and down within hammer housing 302.
      <br/>
      A hammer foot 304 contacts drive head 160 to force double-rod sampler 150 into the soil.
      <br/>
      The hydraulic hammer is particularly useful in penetrating soil conditions such as unconsolidated sediments or gravel deposits.
      <br/>
      The number and force of blows required to advance the sampler depends on the compaction/density and composition of the soil being sampled.
      <br/>
      For example, for a given force, very dense sand can take more than five times as many blows to advance the sampler a given distance than would loose sand; hard clay can take more than ten times as many blows than would very soft clay.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      A hammer slide 306 slides hammer 112 horizontally by means of interlocking slots to position it over sampler 150 for maximum striking effectiveness, and to move hammer 112 out of the way so that the winch line can be attached to retrieve sample barrel 158 and sample liners 156 after a round of sampling.
      <br/>
      Hammer slide 306 is bolted to a hammer support stanchion 308.
      <br/>
      Hammer support stanchion 308 is fitted with rollers 310 that allow it to move vertically to position hammer foot 304 to contact or release soil sampler 150.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Pressure cylinders 116 transmit pressure to double-rod sampler 150 through a rectangular upper-clamp-drive housing 312.
      <br/>
      Pressure cylinders 116 can provide up to 14,000 pounds per square inch of continuous pulldown pressure.
      <br/>
      Hydraulic pressure cylinders 116 can also be operated in reverse for retraction of double-rod sampler 150.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Upper clamp 208 clamps onto drive casing 154, activated by hydraulic cylinders (not shown) housed inside upper-clamp-drive housing 312.
      <br/>
      Upper clamp 208 steadies and guides double-rod sampler 150 and applies pull-down force from hydraulic cylinders 116 as sampler 150 is driven into the soil.
      <br/>
      Extension springs 314 compress when pressure is applied to clamp 208.
      <br/>
      Upper clamp 208 can also transmit vibrations from vibrators 114, located inside upper-clamp-drive housing 312, when the vibrators are activated.
      <br/>
      The vibrators are industrial vibrators typically operated at a range of 50-125 Hertz (Hz).
      <br/>
      The vibrations help reduce soil friction, and thus help ease the sampling rods into the soil.
      <br/>
      Upper clamp 208 is also clamped to the drive casing during retraction of the drive casing from the borehole.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Lower clamp 212 (not shown so as not to obscure other features) is located about three feet directly below upper clamp 208.
      <br/>
      The lower clamp contains a hydraulic cylinder only, not vibrators.
      <br/>
      Lower clamp 212 holds drive casing 154 during retrieval, preventing it from falling into the borehole.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      To retrieve sample barrel 158, hammer slide 306 moves hammer 112 out of the way.
      <br/>
      Drive head 160 is removed from the exposed drive casing, and a retrieval head is screwed on.
      <br/>
      The retrieval head is threaded for attachment at the lower end, and has a bail at the upper end.
      <br/>
      Wire rope from winch 204 is attached to the bail.
      <br/>
      Winch control 202 is then operated to cause winch 204 to pull sample barrel 158 from drive casing 154.

      <br/>
      The first round of a multi-round sampling proceeds as follows.
      <br/>
      At step 510, a fresh sample barrel is prepared, as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The following substeps 511-514 of step 510, shown in FIG. 6, are undertaken to prepare the barrel: Sample liners 156 are inserted, at substep 511, into sample barrel 158.
      <br/>
      An expansion bushing 410 and other inner components, including expansion bolt 408, are attached, at substep 512, to the sample barrel.

      A drive shoe 152 is screwed onto drive casing 154 at substep 513.
      <br/>
      The sample barrel (with rigidly attached expansion bushing 410 and expansion bolt 408) is placed, at substep 514, into drive casing 154.
      <br/>
      Drive head 160 is then attached, at step 530, to rigidly couple the sample container and drive casing 154, as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The coupled drive casing and sample container are then driven, at step 540, into the soil to a sample bottom depth.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      As the sampler is driven into the soil, sample liner 156 becomes filled with soil.
      <br/>
      When sample liner 156 is filled with a soil sample, it is removed, at step 550, from the drive casing.
      <br/>
      Substeps 551-554 of step 550 are shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      To effect removal, drive head 160 and compression bushing 410 are removed, at substep 551, from sample barrel 158.
      <br/>
      A retrieval head, threaded at one end and with a ball at the other, is screwed onto sample barrel 158 at substep 552.
      <br/>
      Line from winch 204 is then fed through the bail to attach the winch to the retrieval head, at substep 553.

      Substeps 571-575 of step 570 are shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      To effect removal, upper clamp 208 is pressurized, at substep 571, to close around drive casing 154.

      Upper clamp 208 is then released, at substep 574.

      Use of the apparatus and method of the invention creates minimal cuttings.

    <p num="54">
      Materials other than steel can be used to manufacture the soil sampler.
      <br/>
      The rig of the invention can be configured in many different ways, so long as the claimed functions are enabled.
      <br/>
      Alternative embodiments employ other dimensions of rig 110 and sampler 150.
      <br/>
      The rig may be mounted on other than skid loaders (for example, on a small truck, forklift, or four-wheel drive vehicle), or may be free standing.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The system is compatible with standard sample liners as preferred by testing laboratories, but can be used with other sample liners.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the invention does not require a separate sample barrel and liners; one cylinder can suffice for both functions.
      <br/>
      Except where particularly specified, the term "drive" applied to advancing the double-rod solid sampler comprises all methods of advancing the sampler, including pounding, hammering, continuous pressure, intermittent pressure, and vibration.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Normally, it is contemplated that the sampler will be driven straight down or at a small angle from the vertical.
      <br/>
      However, the invention provides for drilling at greater angles from the vertical, horizontally, and even in an upward direction.
      <br/>
      Each sample has a minimum depth from surface and a maximum depth from the surface.
      <br/>
      When the sampler is driven straight down, the maximum depth is at the bottom of the sample.
      <br/>
      When the sampler to driven horizontally, the maximum sample depth is the furthest distance of the sample from the surface through which the sample was accessed.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The double-rod system is compatible with other uses of accessing subsurface volumes.
      <br/>
      The system can be used to measure or collect groundwater samples.
      <br/>
      For example, a piezometer can be disposed within the drive casing after the sample barrel has been removed and prior to removing the drive casing.
      <br/>
      The piezometer can then be used to measure water levels.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a soil vapor extraction well can be disposed within the drive casing after the sample barrel has been removed.
      <br/>
      The soil vapor extraction well can then be used to extract vapor samples.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The double-rod system can be used in soil venting.
      <br/>
      Soil venting is typically used to increase the activity of bacteria already in the soil.
      <br/>
      The bacteria consume hydrocarbons, and soil venting is used to accelerate the process of cleaning the soil.
      <br/>
      To vent soil, a length of perforated small-diameter polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, sized to fit the inner diameter of drive casing 154, can be disposed within the drive casing instead of a sample barrel and liners after the sample barrel has been removed and prior to removing the drive casing.
      <br/>
      Bacterial nutrients such as oxygen and nitrogen can then be pumped into the soil.
      <br/>
      In some cases, the temperature can be elevated to improve bacterial activity.
      <br/>
      The pipe need not be PVC and need not be perforated.
