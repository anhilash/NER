    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus and a method of manufacturing and adjusting the same and, more particularly, to an image forming apparatus using a multi-electron-beam source in which a plurality of surface conduction electron-emitting devices are arranged, and a method of manufacturing and adjusting the same.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventionally, two types of devices, namely hot and cold cathode devices, are known as electron-emitting devices.
      <br/>
      Examples of cold cathode devices are field emission type emission devices (to be referred to as FE type devices hereinafter), metal/insulator/metal type emission devices (to be referred to as MIM type devices hereinafter), and surface conduction electron-emitting devices.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Known examples of the FE type devices are described in W. P. Dyke and W. W. Dolan, "Field emission", Advance in Electron Physics, 8,89 (1956) and C. A. Spindt, "Physical properties of thin-film field emission cathodes with molybdenum cones", J. Appl. Phys., 47,5248 (1976).</p>
    <p num="6">A known example of the MIM type devices is described in C. A. Mead, "Operation of Tunnel-emission Devices", J. Appl. Phys., 32,646 (1961).</p>

      A known example of the surface conduction electron-emitting devices is described in, e.g., M. I. Elinson, Radio.

    <p num="8">
      The surface conduction electron-emitting device utilizes the phenomenon that electron emission is caused in a small-area thin film, formed on a substrate, by passing a current parallel to the film surface.
      <br/>
      The surface conduction electron-emitting device includes devices using an Au thin film (G.
      <br/>
      Dittmer, "Thin Solid Films", 9,317 (1972)), an In2 O3 /SnO2 thin film (M.

      Hartwell and C. G. Fonstad, "IEEE Trans.
      <br/>
      ED Conf.", 519 (1975)), and a carbon thin film (Hisashi Araki, et al., "Vacuum", Vol. 26, No. 1, p. 22 (1983)), and the like, in addition to an SnO2 thin film according to Elinson mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      FIG. 24 is a plan view of the surface conduction electron-emitting device according to M. Hartwell et al. as a typical example of the structures of these surface conduction electron-emitting devices.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 24, reference numeral 3001 denotes a substrate, and 3004 a conductive thin film made of a metal oxide formed by sputtering.
      <br/>
      This conductive thin film 3004 has an H-shaped pattern, as shown in FIG. 24. An electron-emitting portion 3005 is formed by performing an electrification process (referred to as an energization forming process to be described later) with respect to the conductive thin film 3004.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 24, a spacing L is set to 0.5 to 1 mm, and a width W is set to 0.1 mm. The electron-emitting portion 3005 is shown in a rectangular shape at the center of the conductive thin film 3004 for the sake of illustrative convenience.
      <br/>
      However, this does not exactly show the actual position and shape of the electron-emitting portion 3005.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In the above surface conduction electron-emitting device by M. Hartwell et al., typically the electron-emitting portion 3005 is formed by performing the electrification process called the energization forming process for the conductive thin film 3004 before electron emission.
      <br/>
      According to the energization forming process, electrification is performed by applying a constant DC voltage which increases at a very slow rate of, e.g., 1 V/min, to both ends of the conductive thin film 3004, so as to partially destroy or deform the conductive thin film 3004 or by changing the properties of the conductive thin film 3004, thereby forming the electron-emitting portion 3005 with an electrically high resistance.
      <br/>
      Note that the destroyed or deformed part of the conductive thin film 3004 or the part where the properties are changed has a fissure.
      <br/>
      Upon application of an appropriate voltage to the conductive thin film 3004 after the energization forming process, electron emission is performed near the fissure.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The above surface conduction electron-emitting devices are advantageous because they have a simple structure and can be easily manufactured.
      <br/>
      For this reason, many devices can be formed on a wide area.
      <br/>
      As disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 64-31332 filed by the present applicant, a method of arranging and driving a lot of devices has been studied.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Regarding applications of surface conduction electron-emitting devices to, e.g., image forming apparatuses such as an image display apparatus and an image recording apparatus, charged beam sources and the like have been studied.</p>
    <p num="13">
      As an application to image display apparatuses, in particular, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,066,883 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2-257551 filed by the present applicant, an image display apparatus using the combination of a surface conduction electron-emitting device and a phosphor which emits light upon irradiation of an electron beam has been studied.
      <br/>
      This type of image display apparatus is expected to have better characteristics than other conventional image display apparatuses.
      <br/>
      For example, in comparison with recent popular liquid crystal display apparatuses, the above display apparatus is superior in that it does not require a backlight since it is of a light emissive type and that it has a wide view angle.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The present inventors have examined surface conduction electron-emitting devices according to various materials, manufacturing methods, and structures, in addition to the above conventional devices.
      <br/>
      The present inventors have also studied a multi-electron-beam source in which a lot of surface conduction electron-emitting devices are arranged and an image display apparatus to which this multi-electron source is applied.
    </p>
    <p num="15">The present inventors have also examined a multi-electron-beam source according to an electric wiring method shown in FIG. 25. More specifically, this multi-electron source is constituted by two-dimensionally arranging a large number of surface conduction electron-emitting devices and wiring these devices in a matrix, as shown in FIG. 25.</p>
    <p num="16">
      Referring to FIG. 25, reference numeral 4001 denotes a surface conduction electron-emitting device, 4002 a row wiring layer, and 4003 a column wiring layer.
      <br/>
      The row wiring layers 4002 and the column wiring layers 4003 actually have limited electrical resistances which are represented as wiring resistances 4004 and 4005 in FIG. 25. The wiring shown in FIG. 25 is referred to as simple matrix wiring.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      For illustrative convenience, the multi-electron source constituted by a 6 * 6 matrix is shown in FIG. 25. However, the scale of the matrix is not limited to this arrangement, as a matter of course.
      <br/>
      In case of a multi-electron-beam source for an image display apparatus, a number of devices sufficient to perform desired image display are arranged and wired.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In the multi-electron source in which the surface conduction electron-emitting devices are wired in a simple matrix, as shown in FIG. 25, appropriate electrical signals are supplied to the row wiring layers 4002 and the column wiring layers 4003 to output desired electron beams.
      <br/>
      When the surface conduction electron-emitting devices of an arbitrary row of the matrix are to be driven, a selection voltage Vs is applied to the row wiring layer 4002 of the selected row.
      <br/>
      Simultaneously, a non-selection voltage Vns is applied to the row wiring layers 4002 of unselected rows.
      <br/>
      In synchronism with this operation, a driving voltage Ve for outputting electron beams is applied to the column wiring layers 4003.
      <br/>
      According to this method, a voltage (Ve-Vs) is applied to the surface conduction electron-emitting devices of the selected row, and a voltage (Ve-Vns) is applied to the surface conduction electron-emitting devices of the unselected rows, assuming that a voltage drop caused by the wiring resistances 4004 and 4005 is negligible.
      <br/>
      When the voltages Ve, Vs, and Vns are set to appropriate levels, electron beams with a desired intensity are output from only the surface conduction electron-emitting devices of the selected row.
      <br/>
      When different driving voltages Ve are applied to the respective column wiring layers, electron beams with different intensities are output from the respective surface conduction electron-emitting devices of the selected rows.
      <br/>
      Since the response of the surface conduction electron-emitting device is very quick, the period of time over which electron beams are output can also be changed in accordance with the period of time for applying the driving voltage Ve.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The multi-electron source having surface conduction electron-emitting devices arranged in a simple matrix can be used in a variety of applications.
      <br/>
      For example, the multi-electron source can be suitably used for an image display apparatus by appropriately supplying an electrical signal according to image information.
    </p>
    <p num="20">However, the multi-electron source in which the surface conduction electron-emitting devices are arranged in the simple matrix has the following problem in fact.</p>
    <p num="21">As described above, when an image display apparatus is constituted by combining surface conduction electron-emitting devices and phosphors which emit light upon irradiation of electron beams, phosphors of three primary colors, i.e., red (R), green (G), and blue (B) are normally used.</p>
    <p num="22">However, since the R, G, and B phosphors exhibit different light emission characteristics, as will be described later, no satisfactory white balance can be obtained when electron beams having the same intensity are incident on the phosphors of the respective colors.</p>
    <p num="23">
      FIG. 26A is a graph showing typical light emission characteristics of the phosphors of the respective colors.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 26A, the characteristic curve of a phosphor changes depending on the color of emitted light and has non-linearity.
      <br/>
      The light emission characteristic of a phosphor is defined depending on the total amount of charges reaching a unit-area phosphor surface per unit time.
      <br/>
      The degree of non-linearity also changes depending on the type of the phosphor.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The non-linearity of the characteristic curve of the phosphor can be corrected to an almost linear characteristic by inserting, for each color, a gamma correction circuit which is conventionally used for a CRT or the like.
      <br/>
      FIG. 26B is a graph showing the characteristics of the respective color phosphors after gamma correction.
      <br/>
      The gradient changes depending on the colors.
      <br/>
      When the difference between the gradients according to the colors does not correspond to the ratio of incident electron beam intensities for the respective colors, which ratio defines a satisfactory white balance, the color reproduction properties are degraded.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="38">An embodiment of the present invention will be described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="39">&lt;First Embodiment&gt;</p>
    <p num="40">In this embodiment, a display panel for performing image display will be described as an example of an image forming apparatus using surface conduction electron-emitting devices.</p>
    <p num="41">&lt;&lt;Arrangement and Manufacturing Method of Display Panel&gt;&gt;</p>
    <p num="42">FIG. 1 is a partially cutaway perspective view of a display panel to which the first embodiment is applied, showing the internal structure of the panel.</p>
    <p num="43">
      Referring to FIG. 1, reference numeral 1005 denotes a rear plate, 1006 a side wall and 1007 a face plate.
      <br/>
      These parts form an airtight vessel for maintaining a vacuum in the display panel.
      <br/>
      To construct the airtight vessel, it is necessary to seal-connect the respective parts to allow their junction portions to hold a sufficient strength and airtight condition.
      <br/>
      For example, a frit glass is applied to the junction portions and baked at 400 (degree)  C. to 500 (degree)  C. in air or a nitrogen atmosphere for 10 minutes or more, thereby seal-connecting the parts.
      <br/>
      A method of evacuating the airtight vessel will be described later.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The rear plate 1005 has a substrate 1001 fixed thereon, on which N * M surface conduction electron-emitting devices 1002 are formed.
      <br/>
      M and N are positive integers of 2 or more and appropriately set in accordance with a target number of display pixels.
      <br/>
      For example, in a display apparatus for high-definition television display, preferably N=3,000 or more, and M=1,000 or more.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, N=3,071, and M=1,024.
      <br/>
      The N * M surface conduction electron-emitting devices are arranged in a simple matrix with M row wiring layers and N column wiring layers 1004.
      <br/>
      The portion constituted by the substrate 1001, the surface conduction electron-emitting devices 1002, the row wiring layers 1003, and the column wiring layers 1004 will be referred to as a multi-electron-beam source.
      <br/>
      The manufacturing method and structure of the multi-electron source will be described later in detail.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In this embodiment, the substrate 1001 of the multi-electron source is fixed to the rear plate 1005 of the airtight vessel.
      <br/>
      However, if the substrate 1001 of the multi-electron source has sufficient strength, the substrate 1001 itself of the multi-electron source may be used as the rear plate of the airtight vessel.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Furthermore, a phosphor film 1008 is formed on the lower surface of the face plate 1007.
      <br/>
      As this embodiment is a color display panel, the phosphor film 1008 is coated with red (R), green (G), and blue (B) phosphors, i.e., three primary color phosphors used in the general CRT field.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2A, color phosphors 92 are applied in a striped arrangement.
      <br/>
      A black conductive material 91 is provided between the stripes of the phosphors.
      <br/>
      The purpose of providing the black conductive material 91 is to prevent display color misregistration even if the electron beam irradiation position is shifted to some extent, to prevent degradation of display contrast by shutting off reflection of external light, to prevent charge-up of the phosphor film 1008 by electron beams, and the like.
      <br/>
      The black conductive material 91 of this embodiment mainly consists of graphite, though any other material may be used as long as the above purpose can be attained.
    </p>
    <p num="47">The arrangement of the phosphors of the three primary colors is not limited to the striped arrangement shown in FIG. 2A. For example, a delta arrangement as shown in FIG. 2B or other arrangements may be employed.</p>
    <p num="48">
      For a color display, a slurry method is used to apply the phosphors 92.
      <br/>
      However, even when a printing method is used for a color display, a similar coating film can be obtained, as a matter of course.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Furthermore, a metal back 1009, which is well-known in the general CRT field, is provided on the rear plate 1005 side surface of the phosphor film 1008.
      <br/>
      The purpose of providing the metal back 1009 is to improve the light-utilization ratio by mirror-reflecting part of light emitted from the phosphor film 1008, to protect the phosphor film 1008 from collision with negative ions, to use the metal back 1009 as an electrode for applying an electron beam accelerating voltage of, e.g., 10 kV, to use the metal back 1009 as a conductive path of electrons which excited the phosphor film 1008, and the like.
      <br/>
      The metal back 1009 is formed by forming the phosphor film 1008 on the face plate 1007, applying a smoothing process (normally called filming) to the phosphor film surface, and depositing aluminum (Al) thereon by vacuum deposition.
      <br/>
      Note that when a phosphor material for a low voltage is used for the phosphor film 1008, the metal back 1009 is not used.
    </p>
    <p num="50">Furthermore, for application of an accelerating voltage or improvement of the conductivity of the phosphor film, transparent electrons made of, e.g., ITO may be provided between the face plate 1007 and the phosphor film 1008.</p>
    <p num="51">
      Referring to FIG. 1, reference symbols Dx1 to DxM, Dy1 to DyN, Dz1 to DzN, and Hv denote electric connection terminals for an airtight structure provided to electrically connect the display panel to an electric circuit (not shown).
      <br/>
      The terminals Dx1 to DxM are electrically connected to the row wiring layers 1003 of the multi-electron source; the terminals Dy1 to DyN, to the column wiring layers 1004 of the multi-electron source; the terminals Dz1 to DzN, to the column wiring layers 1004 of another group; and the terminal Hv, to the metal back 1009 of the face plate.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      To evacuate the airtight vessel, after forming the airtight vessel, an exhaust pipe and a vacuum pump (neither are shown) using no oil are connected, and the airtight vessel is evacuated to a vacuum of about 10-7 Torr.
      <br/>
      While keeping evacuation, the display panel is heated to 80 (degree)  C. to 200 (degree)  C. and baked for 5 or more hours to reduce the partial pressure of an organic gas.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the exhaust pipe is sealed.
      <br/>
      To maintain the vacuum in the airtight vessel, a getter film (not shown) is formed at a predetermined position in the airtight container immediately before/after the sealing.
      <br/>
      The getter film is a film formed by heating and evaporating a gettering material mainly consisting of, e.g., Ba, by heating or RF heating.
      <br/>
      The suction effect of the getter film maintains a vacuum of 1 * 10-5 to 1 * 10-7 Torr in the airtight vessel.
      <br/>
      In this case, the partial pressure of the organic gas mainly consisting of carbon and hydrogen and having a mass number of 13 to 200 is set to be smaller than 10-8 Torr.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The basic arrangement and manufacturing method of the display panel according to this embodiment have been described above.
      <br/>
      A method of manufacturing the multi-electron source used in the display panel above will be described next.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      For the multi-electron source used in the image display apparatus of this embodiment, any material or shape of the surface conduction electron-emitting device may be employed so long as it is for a multi-electron-beam source having surface conduction electron-emitting devices arranged in a simple matrix.
      <br/>
      However, the present inventors have found that among the surface conduction electron-emitting devices, one having an electron-emitting portion or its peripheral portion consisting of a fine particle film is excellent in electron-emitting characteristic and can be easily manufactured.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, such a surface conduction electron-emitting device is the most appropriate surface conduction electron-emitting device to be employed in a multi-electron-beam source of a high-brightness, large-screen image display apparatus.
      <br/>
      In the display panel of this embodiment, the surface conduction electron-emitting devices each having an electron-emitting portion or its peripheral portion made of a fine particle film are used.
      <br/>
      First, the basic structure, manufacturing method, and characteristic of the preferred surface conduction electron-emitting device will be described, and the structure of the multi-electron source having many devices wired in a simple matrix will be described later.
    </p>
    <p num="55">&lt;&lt;Preferred Structure and Manufacturing Method of Surface conduction electron-emitting device&gt;&gt;</p>
    <p num="56">The typical structure of the surface conduction electron-emitting device having an electron-emitting portion or its peripheral portion made of a fine particle film includes a plane type structure and a step type structure.</p>
    <p num="57">&lt;&lt;Plane Type Surface conduction electron-emitting device&gt;&gt;</p>
    <p num="58">The structure and manufacturing method of a plane type surface conduction electron-emitting device will be described first.</p>
    <p num="59">
      FIG. 3A is a plan view of the plane type surface conduction electron-emitting device.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3B is a sectional view of the plane type surface conduction electron-emitting device.
      <br/>
      The structure of the plane type surface conduction electron-emitting device will be described.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 3A and 3B, reference numeral 1101 denotes a substrate, 1102 and 1103 device electrodes, 1104 a conductive thin film, 1105 an electron-emitting portion formed by an energization forming process, and 1113 a thin film formed by an activation process.
    </p>
    <p num="60">As the substrate 1101, various glass substrates of, e.g., silica glass and soda-lime glass, various ceramic substrates of, e.g., alumina, or any of those substrates with an insulating layer consisting of, e.g., SiO2 and formed thereon can be employed.</p>
    <p num="61">
      The device electrodes 1102 and 1103 formed on the substrate 1101 to be parallel to its surface and oppose each other are made of a conductive material.
      <br/>
      For example, one of the following materials may be selected and used: metals such as Ni, Cr, Au, Mo, W, Pt, Ti, Cu, Pd, and Ag, alloys of these materials, metal oxides such as In2 O3 --SnO2, and semiconductors such as polysilicon.
      <br/>
      The electrodes can be easily formed by the combination of a film-forming technique such as vacuum deposition and a patterning technique such as photolithography or etching, however, any other method (e.g., a printing technique) may be employed.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The shape of the device electrodes 1102 and 1103 is appropriately designed in accordance with an application purpose of the surface conduction electron-emitting device.
      <br/>
      Generally, a spacing L between the device electrodes 1102 and 1103 is designed to be an appropriate value in a range from several hundreds  Angstrom  to several hundreds  MU m. The most preferable range for an image display apparatus is from several  MU m to several tens  MU m. As for a thickness d of the device electrodes 1102 and 1103, an appropriate value is generally selected from a range from several hundreds  Angstrom  to several  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The conductive thin film 1104 is made of a fine particle film.
      <br/>
      The "fine particle film" is a film which contains a lot of fine particles (including an insular aggregate).
      <br/>
      Microscopic observation of the fine particle film will reveal that the individual fine particles in the film are spaced apart from each other, adjacent to each other, or overlap each other.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      One particle in the fine particle film has a diameter within a range from several  Angstrom  to several thousands  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      Preferably, the diameter falls within a range from 10  Angstrom  to 200  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      The thickness of the fine particle film is appropriately set in consideration of the following conditions: a condition necessary for electrical connection to the device electrode 1102 or 1103, a condition for the forming process to be described later, a condition for setting the electric resistance of the fine particle film itself to an appropriate value to be described later.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the thickness of the film is set in a range from several  Angstrom  to several thousands  Angstrom , and more preferably, 10  Angstrom  to 500  Angstrom .
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      For example, materials used for forming the fine particle film are metals such as Pd, Pt, Ru, Ag, Au, Ti, In, Cu, Cr, Fe, Zn, Sn, Ta, W, and Pb, oxides such as PdO, SnO2, In2 O3, PbO, and Sb2 O3, borides such as HfB2, ZrB2, LaB6, CeB6, YB4, and GdB4, carbides such as TiC, ZrC, HfC, TaC, SiC, and WC, nitrides such as TiN, ZrN, HfN, semiconductors such as Si and Ge, and carbons.
      <br/>
      An appropriate material is selected from these materials.
    </p>
    <p num="66">As described above, in this embodiment, the conductive thin film 1104 is formed using a fine particle film, and the sheet resistance of the film is set to fall within a range from 103 to 107  OMEGA /.quadrature..</p>
    <p num="67">
      As it is preferable that the conductive thin film 1104 is electrically connected to the device electrodes 1102 and 1103, they are arranged so as to partly overlap each other.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 3A and 3B, the respective parts are stacked in the following order from the bottom: the substrate 1101, the device electrodes 1102 (1103), and the conductive thin film 1104.
      <br/>
      This overlapping order may be: the substrate 1101, the conductive thin film 1104, and the device electrodes 1102 (1103), from the bottom.

    <p num="68">
      The electron-emitting portion 1105 is a fissure portion formed at a part of the conductive thin film 1104.
      <br/>
      The electron-emitting portion 1105 has an electric resistance higher than that of the peripheral conductive thin film 1104.
      <br/>
      The fissure portion is formed by the energization forming process on the conductive thin film 1104.
      <br/>
      In some cases, particles, having a diameter of several  Angstrom  to several hundreds  Angstrom , are arranged within the fissure portion.
      <br/>
      As it is difficult to exactly illustrate the actual position and shape of the electron-emitting portion 1105, FIGS. 3A and 3B show the fissure portion schematically.

      The same reference numerals as in FIGS. 3A and 3B denote the same parts in FIGS. 4A to 4D, and a detailed description thereof will be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="75">1) First, as shown in FIG. 4A, the device electrodes 1102 and 1103 are formed on the substrate 1101.</p>
    <p num="76">
      In forming these device electrodes 1102 and 1103, the substrate 1101 is fully cleaned with a detergent, pure water, and then an organic solvent, and a material for the device electrodes 1102 (1103) is deposited on the substrate 1101.
      <br/>
      As a depositing method, a vacuum film-forming technique such as deposition or sputtering may be used.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the deposited electrode material is patterned by a photolithographic etching technique.
      <br/>
      Thus, the pair of device electrodes 1102 and 1103 in FIG. 4A are formed.

      In forming the conductive thin film 1104, an organic metal solution is applied to the substrate 1101 prepared in FIG. 4A first, and the applied solution is then dried and sintered, thereby forming a fine particle film.

      Thereafter, the fine particle film is patterned into a predetermined shape by the photolithographic etching method.

      The organic metal solution means an organic metal compound solution containing a material for fine particles, used for the conductive thin film 1104, as the main element.

    <p num="104">Improvement of the electron-emitting characteristic by the activation process will be described first.</p>
    <p num="105">
      As described above, when the electron-emitting portion of the surface conduction electron-emitting device is to be formed, a process (energization forming process) of flowing a current through the conductive thin film 1104 to partially destroy, deform, or deteriorate the thin film and form a fissure, is performed.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the activation process is preferably performed.
      <br/>
      As described above, the activation process is a process of performing electrification of the electron-emitting portion 1105 formed by the energization forming process, under appropriate conditions, to deposit carbon or a carbon compound near the electron-emitting portion 1105.
      <br/>
      For example, in a vacuum atmosphere where an organic substance at an appropriate partial pressure exists, and the total pressure is 10-4 to 10-5 Torr, a voltage pulse is periodically applied.
      <br/>
      With this process, any one of monocrystalline graphite, polycrystalline graphite, amorphous carbon, and a mixture thereof is deposited near the electron-emitting portion 1105 to a thickness of 500  Angstrom  or less.
      <br/>
      The above vacuum atmosphere can be achieved by evacuating the vacuum vessel by using an oil diffusion pump or a rotary pump, though this atmosphere can also be achieved by evacuating the vacuum vessel by a vacuum pump using no oil and simultaneously introducing an organic gas.
      <br/>
      Various organic gases are available, including aromatic hydrocarbons.
      <br/>
      The type of gas and its partial pressure may be appropriately selected in accordance with the material and shape of the surface conduction electron-emitting device.
      <br/>
      In addition, the waveform of the voltage pulse to be applied may also be appropriately selected in accordance with the material and shape of the surface conduction electron-emitting device.
    </p>
    <p num="106">Comparing the surface conduction electron-emitting device after the activation process with that immediately after the energization forming process, the emission current at the same applied voltage can be increased typically 100 times or more.</p>
    <p num="107">The environment necessary for realizing the electron-emitting characteristic memory function will be described below.</p>
    <p num="108">To satisfactorily realize the memory function, the partial pressure of the organic gas in the vacuum atmosphere around the surface conduction electron-emitting device must be reduced not to newly deposit carbon or a carbon compound at the electron-emitting portion or its peripheral portion even when a voltage is applied to the surface conduction electron-emitting device, and this state must be maintained.</p>
    <p num="109">
      Preferably, the partial pressure of the organic gas in the atmosphere is reduced to 10-8 Torr or less, and this state is maintained.
      <br/>
      If possible, the partial pressure is preferably maintained at 10-10 Torr or less.
      <br/>
      Note that the partial pressure of the organic gas is obtained by integrating the partial pressures of organic molecules mainly consisting of carbon and hydrogen and having a mass number of 13 to 200, which is quantitatively measured using a mass spectrograph.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      A typical method of reducing the partial pressure of the organic gas around the surface conduction electron-emitting device is as follows.
      <br/>
      The vacuum vessel incorporating the substrate on which the surface conduction electron-emitting device is formed is heated.
      <br/>
      While desorbing the organic gas molecules from the surface of each member in the vessel, vacuum evacuation is performed using a vacuum pump such as a sorption pump or an ion pump using no oil.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      After the partial pressure of the organic gas is reduced in this manner, this state can be maintained by continuously performing evacuation using the vacuum pump with no oil.
      <br/>
      However, this method using the vacuum pump for continuous evacuation has disadvantages in volume, power consumption, weight, and cost depending on the application purpose.
      <br/>
      When the surface conduction electron-emitting devices are to be applied to an image display apparatus such as a display panel, the organic gas molecules are sufficiently desorbed to reduce the partial pressure of the organic gas, and thereafter, a getter film is formed in the vacuum vessel, and at the same time, the exhaust pipe is sealed, thereby maintaining the state.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      In many cases, the origin of the organic gas remaining in the vacuum atmosphere is the vapor of an oil used in the vacuum exhaust unit such as a rotary pump or an oil diffusion pump or the residue of an organic solvent used in the manufacturing processes of the surface conduction electron-emitting device.
      <br/>
      Examples of the organic gas are aliphatic hydrocarbons such as alkane, alkene, and alkyne, aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, amines, phenols, organic acids such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid, or derivatives of the above-described organic substances: more specifically, butadiene, n-hexane, 1-hexene, benzene, toluene, O-xylene, benzonitrile, chloroethylene, trichloroethylene, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone, methylamine, ethylamine, acetic acid, and propionic acid.

      In the period of Vf=Vf2, i.e., the interval T5, the emission current Ie is kept at Ie2.

      In the third period, although the pulse given by Vf=Vf1 is applied again, the emission current Ie changes according to the characteristic curve Iec(2).

      <br/>
      In the fall time Tf of the driving pulse, the emission current Ie abruptly decreases according to the characteristic curve Iec(2).
    </p>
    <p num="124">As described above, in the third period, since the characteristic curve Iec(2) in the second period is stored in the surface conduction electron-emitting device, the emission current Ie becomes smaller than that in the first period.</p>
    <p num="125">
      With regard to the (device voltage Vf) vs. (device current If) characteristic as well, as shown in FIG. 10B, the surface conduction electron-emitting device operates according to a characteristic curve Ifc(1) in the first period.

      As is apparent, however, the above phenomenon that the characteristic curve is stored is not limited to this condition.
      <br/>
      In applying a pulse voltage to a surface conduction electron-emitting device having a memory function, when a pulse having a voltage value larger than that of a previously applied pulse is applied, a characteristic curve of the device shifts, and the resultant characteristic is stored into the device.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the characteristic of the device is kept stored unless a pulse having a larger voltage value is applied to the device.

      Such a memory function has not been observed in other emission devices including FE type emission devices.

      In this embodiment, phosphors of red (R), green (G) and blue (B), i.e., the three primary colors, are used, and the characteristic of each surface conduction electron-emitting device is stored such that a satisfactory white balance for the emission colors can be obtained when the same accelerating voltage is applied to the respective color phosphors, and at the same time, the same driving voltage is applied to the surface conduction electron-emitting devices for the respective colors to irradiate electron beams.
      <br/>
      For example, to set a white balance when the sensitivities (light emission luminance/irradiation current) of the three primary color phosphors are given as "G&gt;R&gt;B", the electron-emitting characteristics (the magnitude of the emission current Ie obtained upon application of the same voltage) of the surface conduction electron-emitting devices of the respective colors are set as "B device&gt;R device&gt;G device" and stored.
      <br/>
      That is, in FIGS. 10A and 10B, the characteristic curves of the respective color devices are set to be arranged in this order: B device, R device, and G device from left to right side, and stored.

    <p num="130">
      For this purpose, the partial pressure of an organic gas in a vacuum atmosphere is sufficiently reduced, and thereafter, a voltage pulse is applied to each device for each color to store the electron-emitting characteristic.

      In fact, however, the shift amount of each characteristic curve was quantitatively set on the basis of the sensitivity ratio of the respective color phosphors and the characteristic curve of the corresponding surface conduction electron-emitting device, so that the peak value of the voltage pulse for the memory function was quantitatively determined.

      As described above, after different electron-emitting characteristics are stored in units of surface conduction electron-emitting devices for the respective colors, the devices are driven on the basis of image information to practically perform image display.

      At this time, the maximum voltage of the driving signal is suppressed to the peak value or less of the memory voltage pulse such that the driving signal applied to the devices for display does not shift the stored characteristic curve.
      <br/>
      To maintain the memory function even during image display, the partial pressure of the organic gas component in the vacuum atmosphere is kept low, as a matter of course.

      FIG. 13 is a block diagram schematically showing the arrangement of a driving circuit for performing TV display on the basis of an NTSC TV signal.

      The display panel 101 is connected to an external electronic circuit through the terminals Dx1 to DxM, the terminals Dy1 to DyN, and the high-voltage terminal Hv.
      <br/>
      Scanning signals for sequentially driving the surface conduction electron-emitting device groups arranged in the multi-electron source in the display panel 101, i.e., in an M * N matrix one row (N devices) at a time are supplied to the terminals Dx1 to DxM.
      <br/>
      Modulating signals for controlling output electron beams from the respective surface conduction electron-emitting devices of one row which is selected by the scanning signals are supplied to the terminals Dy1 to DyN.
      <br/>
      A DC voltage of, e.g., 10 kV is applied from the DC voltage source Va to the high-voltage terminal Hv.
      <br/>
      This DC voltage is an accelerating voltage for imparting the electron beams output from the surface conduction electron-emitting devices with sufficient energy to excite the phosphors.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      The scanning circuit 102 will be described next.
      <br/>
      The scanning circuit 102 incorporates M switching devices (schematically illustrated by S1 to SM in FIG. 13).
      <br/>
      Each of the switching devices selects the output voltage of the DC voltage source Vx or 0 V (ground level) and electrically connects the selected voltage to a corresponding one of the terminals Dx1 to DxM of the display panel 101.
      <br/>
      The switching devices S1 to SM operate on the basis of a control signal Tscan output from the control circuit 103.
      <br/>
      The switching devices can be easily constituted by combining switching devices such as FETs.

    <p num="146">The DC voltage source Vx of this embodiment is set, based on the characteristics of the surface conduction electron-emitting devices, to output a constant voltage of 7 V.</p>
    <p num="147">
      The control circuit 103 acts to coordinate the operation of each component so as to present an appropriate display on the basis of an externally input image signal.
      <br/>
      On the basis of a synchronizing signal Tsync sent from the synchronizing-signal separating circuit 106 (to be described below), the control circuit 103 generates control signals Tscan, Tsft, and Tmry to each of the components.
      <br/>
      The timing of each control signal will be described later in detail with reference to FIG. 18.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      The synchronizing-signal separating circuit 106 is a circuit for separating a synchronizing signal component and a luminance signal component from an externally input NTSC television signal.
      <br/>
      As is well known, the synchronizing-signal separating circuit 106 can be easily constituted using a frequency separating circuit (filter).
      <br/>
      The synchronizing signal separated by the synchronizing-signal separating circuit 106 comprises a vertical synchronizing signal and a horizontal synchronizing signal, as is well known.
      <br/>
      For descriptive convenience, these signals are represented by the signal Tsync.
      <br/>
      The luminance signal component of the image, which is separated from the TV signal, is subjected to gamma correction by the gamma correction circuit 108.
      <br/>
      The corrected signal is represented by a DATA signal, for descriptive convenience.
      <br/>
      This DATA signal is sequentially input to the shift register 104.
      <br/>
      The shift register 104 converts the DATA signal as a serial signal into a parallel signal in units of lines of the image and operates on the basis of the control signal Tsft sent from the control circuit 103.
      <br/>
      The control signal Tsft may be referred to as the shift clock of the shift register 104.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      The serial/parallel-converted data of one line of the image (corresponding to drive data of N surface conduction electron-emitting devices) is output from the shift register 104 as N parallel signals Id1 to IdN.
      <br/>
      The line memory 105 is a memory for storing one line of image data for a requisite period of time.
      <br/>
      The line memory 105 appropriately stores the contents of Id1 to IdN in accordance with the control signal Tmry sent from the control circuit 103.
      <br/>
      The stored contents are output as I'd1 to I'dN and input to the modulating signal generator 107.
      <br/>
      The modulating signal generator 107 is a signal source for appropriately modulating and driving each of the surface conduction electron-emitting devices in accordance with the image data I'd1 to I'dN.
      <br/>
      The output signals from the modulating signal generator 107 are supplied to the surface conduction electron-emitting devices in the display panel 101 through the terminals Dy1 to DyN.
    </p>
    <p num="150">
      As described above, in this embodiment, predetermined electron-emitting characteristics are stored in the respective surface conduction electron-emitting devices in accordance with the luminous efficiencies of the R, G and B, i.e., three primary color phosphors.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, when the electron-emitting characteristics are stored in the surface conduction electron-emitting devices, voltage pulses of 15.0 V, 15.3 V, and 15.6 V are used.
      <br/>
      As described above, the voltage of a display driving signal must be controlled not to exceed the voltage of the memory pulse such that the stored electron-emitting characteristics are not shifted upon displaying an image.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the voltage of the driving signal for image display is set to 14.0 V for all the surface conduction electron-emitting devices.
      <br/>
      The luminance of the image is modulated by changing the pulse width (i.e., the length along time axis) of the driving signal.
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      The functions of the respective components shown in FIG. 13 have been described above.
      <br/>
      Before a description of an entire operation, the operation of the display panel 101 will be described in more detail with reference to FIGS. 14 to 17. For illustrative convenience, the number of pixels of the display panel 101 is set to 6 * 6 (i.e., M=N=6).
      <br/>
      As is apparent, however, the display panel 101 to be actually used has a much larger number of pixels.

      FIG. 14 is a circuit diagram showing a multi-electron-beam source in which surface conduction electron-emitting devices are wired in a 6 * 6 matrix.

    <p num="153">
      When an image is to be displayed by driving such a multi-electron-beam source, the image is sequentially formed in units of lines parallel to the X-axis.
      <br/>
      To drive surface conduction electron-emitting devices corresponding to one line of the image, of the terminals Dx1 to Dx6, the terminal of the row corresponding to the display line is supplied with a voltage of 0 V, and the remaining terminals are supplied with a voltage of 7 V. In synchronism with this operation, modulating signals are supplied to the terminals Dy1 to Dy6 in accordance with the image pattern of the display line.
    </p>
    <p num="154">
      An example will be described in which an image pattern as shown in FIG. 15 is displayed.
      <br/>
      For descriptive convenience, the luminances of the light-emitting portions of the image pattern equal each other and correspond to, e.g., 100 �ftxL�. In the display panel 101, a known P-22 was used as a phosphor, the accelerating voltage was 10 kV, the repeating frequency of the image display was 60 Hz, and the surface conduction electron-emitting devices having the above characteristics were used as emission devices.
      <br/>
      In this case, a voltage of 14 V is suitable (this voltage value changes when the respective parameters are changed).
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      For the image shown in FIG. 15, a period for light emission of the third line will be described.
      <br/>
      FIG. 16 is a view showing voltage values applied to the multi-electron source through the terminals Dx1 to Dx6 and Dy1 to Dy6 while light is emitted from the third line of the image shown in FIG. 15. As is apparent from FIG. 16, the surface conduction electron-emitting devices D(2,3), D(3,3), and D(4,3) are applied with a voltage of 14 V and output electron beams.
      <br/>
      The remaining devices are applied with a voltage of 7 V (hatched devices in FIG. 16) or 0 V (white devices in FIG. 17).
      <br/>
      These voltages are lower than the electron emission threshold voltage, so no electron beams are output from these devices.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      For the remaining lines as well, the multi-electron source is driven in a similar manner in accordance with the display pattern shown in FIG. 15. FIG. 17 is a timing chart time-serially showing this driving operation.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 17, when the multi-electron source is sequentially driven from the first line, an image display free from flicker can be realized.
    </p>
    <p num="157">To change the light emission luminance of the display pattern, i.e., to increase (reduce) the luminance, the length of the pulse of the modulating signal applied to the terminals Dy1 to Dy6 is made larger (smaller) than 10  MU s. With this operation, modulation is enabled.</p>
    <p num="158">
      The method of driving the display panel 101 using the multi-electron source with 6 * 6 pixels has been described above.
      <br/>
      The entire operation of the apparatus shown in FIG. 13 will be described below with reference to the timing charts of FIGS. 18A-18F.
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      Referring to FIGS. 18A-18F, FIG. 18A represents the timing of the luminance signal DATA separated from the externally input NTSC signal by the synchronizing-signal separating circuit 106 and corrected by the gamma correction circuit 108.
      <br/>
      The DATA signal is sequentially sent in the order of the first line, the second line, the third line, . . . . In synchronism with this operation, the shift clock Tsft is output from the control circuit 103 to the shift register 104, as shown in FIG. 18B. When the data of one line is accumulated in the shift register 104, the memory write signal Tmry is output from the control circuit 103 to the line memory 105, at a timing as shown in FIG. 18C, so that the drive data of one line (for N devices) is stored and held.
      <br/>
      As a result, the contents of I'd1 to I'dN as output signals from the line memory 105 are changed at the timing in FIG. 18D.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      On the other hand, the contents of the control signal Tscan for controlling the operation of the scanning circuit 102 are represented by the timing as shown in FIG. 18E. More specifically, when the first line is to be driven, only the switching device S1 in the scanning circuit 102 is applied with the voltage of 0 V, and the remaining switching devices are applied with the voltage of 7 V. When the second line is to be driven, only the switching device S2 is applied with the voltage of 0 V, and the remaining switching devices are applied with the voltage of 7 V. This applies to all the lines in the above manner, and the operation is controlled in units of lines.
      <br/>
      In synchronism with this operation, a modulating signal is output from the modulating signal generator 107 to the display panel 101 at the timing shown in FIG. 18F.
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      Although no description has been made, the shift register 104 and the line memory 105 can be either of a digital signal type or of an analog signal type as long as serial/parallel conversion or storage of the image signal is performed at a predetermined speed and timing.
      <br/>
      In the case of a digital signal type, the output signal DATA from the gamma correction circuit 108 must be converted into a digital signal.
      <br/>
      This processing can be easily realized by arranging an A/D converter at the output portion of the correction circuit 108, as a matter of course.

    <p num="186">In the second embodiment, the grids 206 each having the electron pass holes 205 with a diameter of almost 50  MU m are arranged almost 10  MU m above the substrate 1001 through an insulating layer (not shown) consisting of, e.g., SiO2. When an accelerating voltage of 6 kV is applied, ON/OFF of an electron beam (i.e., whether the electron beam passes through the electron pass hole 205 or not) can be controlled by a modulating voltage (grid voltage Vg) of 50 V or less.</p>

      FIG. 22 is a graph showing the relationship between the grid voltage Vg applied to the grids 206 and the phosphor current flowing to the phosphor film 1008.

      As the grid voltage Vg is increased to a certain threshold voltage Vg1 or more, the phosphor current starts to flow.
      <br/>
      When the grid voltage Vg is further increased, the phosphor current monotonously increases and is saturated eventually at Vg2.

      The main arrangement of the driving circuit for TV display is almost the same as that of the first embodiment shown in FIG. 13. In the second embodiment, however, an output voltage from a modulating signal generator 107 is set to a voltage suitable for modulation by the grids 206 and connected to the terminals G1 to Gn of the display panel.
