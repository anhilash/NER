      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a screen, and more particularly to a shower screen.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Typical shower curtains comprise a sheet of water proof cloth material having an upper portion slidably engaged on a top rail.
      <br/>
      The cloth material may be unfolded to prevent water from spilling when showering.
      <br/>
      However, the curtain may not suitably prevent water from spilling.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In order to solve such problems, the applicant has developed an improved shower screen which has been issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,822,810 to Chen.
      <br/>
      However, the bottom portion of the shower screen is not secured to the lower bar and may be easily separated from the bar, such that the water may also split out through the gap formed between the lower portion of the shower screen and the bar.
    </p>
    <p num="6">The present invention has arisen to mitigate and/or obviate the afore-described disadvantages of the conventional shower curtains.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a shower screen for preventing water from spilling and for stably securing the bottom portion of the shower screen to a lower guide bar.</p>

      <br/>
      The beams each includes a bottom portion, the slidably securing means includes two retaining members secured to the bottom portions of the beams respectively and slidably engaged with the outer surface of the wall.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The retaining members each includes a projection extended upward therefrom and secured to the bottom portions of the beams respectively.
      <br/>
      The base includes an upper portion having a tapered surface formed thereon and facing away from the wall.
      <br/>
      The wall includes an upper portion having a flange extended laterally therefrom.
    </p>

    <p num="14">Further objectives and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a careful reading of a detailed description provided hereinbelow, with appropriate reference to accompanying drawings.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 1 is an exploded view of a shower screen in accordance with the present invention; and
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a lateral cross sectional view of the shower screen.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="16">
      Referring to the drawings, a shower screen in accordance with the present invention comprises a pair of vertical posts 10 each including a longitudinal channel 11 formed therein and facing toward each other.
      <br/>
      Two brackets 12 are secured on top of the posts 10 respectively and each includes a key 13 provided therein.
      <br/>
      A guide rod 20 includes two ends engaged in the brackets 12 and includes a groove 21 formed in the bottom and having two ends engaged with the respective keys 13 for preventing the guide rod 20 from rotating relative to the brackets 12.
      <br/>
      Two caps 14 are secured on top of the brackets 12 for securing the guide rod 20 in place.
      <br/>
      Two sleeves 22 are engaged on the end portions of the guide rod 20 for engaging with the brackets 12 when the guide rod 20 is short, and for extending the length of the guide rod 20, such that the guide rod 20 of a shorter length may also be stably secured to the brackets 12.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that the rail 23 extends inward of the sleeves 22 (FIG. 4), for forming a solid structure.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      A screen member includes a number of foldable panels 30 each having a slide 31 provided on the upper portion thereof and slidably engaged in the groove 21 of the guide rod 20 for allowing the panels 30 to be folded and unfolded.
      <br/>
      Two beams 32 are secured to the side portions of the panels 30 and each includes a rib 33 for engaging into the channel 11 of the respective posts 10 and for forming a complete screen so as to prevent spilling while showering.
      <br/>
      A guide bar 40 is secured in the bottom portions of the posts 10 and has two ends secured to the posts 10 for forming a bottom block and guide member.
      <br/>
      The beams 32 each includes a notch 34 formed therein for engaging with the guide bar 40 and for preventing the beams 32 from moving outward beyond the bath tub 90 (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      The panels 30 are pivotally secured together at a number of live hinges for allowing the panels 30 to be folded relative to each other and for forming a perfect screen.
      <br/>
      The ribs 33 of the beams 32 may be engaged into the channels 11 of the posts 10 so as to form a perfect water proof screen.
      <br/>
      In addition, the sleeves 22 allow the top guide rod 20 to be secured to the brackets 12 when the guide rod 20 is short.
      <br/>
      The above described structure is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,822,810 which is taken as a reference for the present invention.
      <br/>
      Instead of the panels 30, a screen member of cloth materials may also be secured between the beams 32 and slidably secured to the guide rod 20 by slides 31.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The guide bar 40 includes a wall 41 extended upward from a base 42 and includes a flange 43 extended laterally from the top portion of the wall 41 and extended inward of the bath tub 90, such that the size of the guide bar 40 may be reduced as compared with that of the applicant's prior U.S. Pat. No. 5,822,810. The base 42 is secured on top of the bath tub 90 and preferably includes a tapered surface 44 formed on the upper portion thereof and facing away from the wall 41 and facing inward of the bath tub 90 for guiding the water inward of the bath tub 90.
      <br/>
      One or two retaining members 35 are further provided and each includes a projection 37 extended upward therefrom for engaging into the respective beams 32 and for securing to the beams 32 by such as a force-fitted engagement or by adhesive materials or by the other fasteners.
      <br/>
      The retaining member(s) 35 are engaged with the outer surface 47 of the guide bar 40 for slidably securing the beams 32 to the guide bar 40 and for guiding the beams 32 to move along the guide bar 40 and for preventing the beams 32 from being separated from the guide bar 40.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Accordingly, the shower screen in accordance with the present invention includes a stably structure for preventing water spilling and for stably and slidably securing the panels to the guide rod and the guide bar and for stably securing the bottom portion of the beams of the shower screen to the lower guide bar.</p>
    <p num="20">Although this invention has been described with a certain degree of particularity, it is to be understood that the present disclosure has been made by way of example only and that numerous changes in the detailed construction and the combination and arrangement of parts may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.</p>
