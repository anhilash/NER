    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to constructs and methods for the generation, detection, and isolation of enzymes possessing a desired chemical or biological activity.
      <br/>
      In particular it relates to a method for the generation, detection and isolation of enzymes or proteins with enzyme-like activity, with a novel substrate or reaction specificity or with improved activity.
      <br/>
      In addition, the invention permits the subsequent identification and isolation of the nucleic acid encoding the enzyme.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      A number of different approaches have hitherto been taken to generate novel polypeptides with new, modified, or improved biological activity.
      <br/>
      For example, the alteration of individual residues at the active site of enzymes of known crystallographic structure (Winter et al., 1982; Wilkinson et al., 1984), immunization with transition state analogues (Tramontano et al., 1986) the screening of mutant microorganisms harbouring new properties (Cunningham and Wells, 1987), the alteration of specific residues within a signal peptide window and the generation of novel antibodies by phage display (Marks et al., 1994) have all led to the generation of polypeptides with tailored functions.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Antibody fragments have been expressed bacterially and in bacteriophage (phage) display repertoires by fusion to phage coat proteins, in particular the minor coat protein cpIII.
      <br/>
      Subsequent selection of phage with antigen has allowed the isolation of high affinity antibodies from large libraries without immunisation.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The endogenous genetic machinery of phage, and the ability to generate a large population of individually unique phage clones means that a huge (&gt;108) variety of different recombinant polypeptides can be produced.
      <br/>
      A large number of variants of a certain polypeptide chain are cloned into the genome of filamentous phage or constructed as phagemids and expressed as a fusion protein with the phage coat protein.
      <br/>
      This library is then selected by panning to the ligand of interest; after extensive washings and elution, those phages expressing a binding variant are rescued by infection of bacteria.
      <br/>
      Multiple rounds of selection allow the isolation of very rare phage (&lt;1/107).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Phage display has also been used as a tool to investigate the relative efficacy of signal peptides, to evaluate the individual contribution of each residue of an epitope, and to refine the properties of such biological molecules.
      <br/>
      For example, phage display has been used to isolate zinc finger domains with altered DNA-binding specificity, improved hormones and novel inhibitors.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The generation of novel enzymes, or enzymes with improved function has proven more difficult.
      <br/>
      The main obstacles in this case are associated with methods of selection.
      <br/>
      In nature, new enzymes arise through random mutation and Darwinian selection.
      <br/>
      Initial attempts to mimic this process used mutant microorganisms, selecting for increased enzyme activity by growth advantage (Cunningham and Wells, 1987).
      <br/>
      More recently, both alkaline phosphatase and trypsin have been displayed on the surface of phage, and have been shown to retain their catalytic activity (McCaf ferty et al., 1991, Corey et al., 1993).
      <br/>
      Such phages have been enriched by binding to suicide inhibitors that bind irreversibly to the protein.
      <br/>
      Soumillion et al., 1994 describe incubation of phage displaying a  BETA -lactamase with a  BETA -lactamase suicide inhibitor connected by a spacer to a biotin moiety.
      <br/>
      Active phages were selected by binding and elution from streptavidin-coated beads.
      <br/>
      Such a procedure suffers from the drawback that a suicide inhibitor or a transition state analogue must be available for the reaction of interest.
      <br/>
      This is not generally the case.
      <br/>
      Moreover, indirect selections result in low rate accelerations.
      <br/>
      A direct selection for the desired catalytic activity would yield better results.

    <p num="12">
      The term "enzyme" as used herein refers to any molecule capable of accelerating the rate of conversion of a substrate to a product, such that the product of the reaction is distinguishable from the substrate.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the enzyme comprises a polypeptide.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The conversion of the substrate to the product may comprise a physical or chemical change.
      <br/>
      For example, the conversion may comprise the modification, addition or removal of one or more chemical groups.
      <br/>
      Modification of the substrate includes any disproportion, rearrangement or isomerization that lends different properties to the product compared to those of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The modification of substrate may also be through a conformational change.
      <br/>
      For example, contact of an enzyme with a substrate such as a protein may result in the induction of a temporary or permanent conformational change in that substrate.
      <br/>
      Such a change may allow the isolation of product from the substrate within the lifetime of the conformationally-altered state.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In an alternative embodiment, the substrate may comprise a polypeptide linked to the enzyme via a peptide bond in a fusion protein.
      <br/>
      Knowledge of the position of the active site in the tertiary structure of the enzyme may allow the introduction of DNA encoding a peptide substrate into the gene sequence of the enzyme.
      <br/>
      Most commonly this will be introduced at the carboxy or amino terminus end of the enzyme, but can also be included as a "window" loop.
      <br/>
      When the substrate is converted intramolecularly to product, this remains bound to the enzyme and allows isolation of the enzyme.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In the present invention the substrate is physically or chemically linked to the enzyme such that upon reaction of the enzyme with the substrate, the substrate, and subsequently the product remains physically or chemically linked to the enzyme.
      <br/>
      By maintaining a link between the enzyme and the product, the product provides a "handle" by which active enzyme may be isolated from the reaction mixture.
      <br/>
      The present invention permits, for example, separation of active enzyme from enzyme libraries.
      <br/>
      Further rounds of selection may be used to select for enzymes with improved or modified activity.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The substrate may be linked to the enzyme by any suitable means which permits reaction of the enzyme with the substrate.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the enzyme and substrate are linked by a flexible linker which permits association of the substrate with the active site of the enzyme, reaction of the enzyme with the substrate to produce the product and subsequent dissociation of the product from the active site of the enzyme.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the substrate/product is linked to the enzyme at a site outside, but in the vicinity of the active site of the enzyme in a manner that interferes minimally with the chemical or biological activity of the enzyme.
    </p>
    <p num="17">By "active" site of the enzyme is meant the region in the tertiary structure of the protein at which conversion of substrate to product takes place.</p>
    <p num="18">The linker may comprise a covalent linker such as a hydrocarbon chain, an aliphatic, heteroaliphatic, aromatic or heteroaromatic chain, a polymeric chain or a polypeptide or nucleic acid chain.</p>
    <p num="19">
      The linker between the enzyme and the substrate/product may be entirely covalent.
      <br/>
      The advantage of using such a covalent linker is that a strong link is maintained between product and enzyme.
      <br/>
      This aspect of the invention is therefore particularly useful for the isolation of enzymes which have a very slow reaction time.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The linker may be linked to the enzyme and substrate via any suitable functional groups present in the linker, enzyme and substrate.
      <br/>
      For example, where the enzyme is a protein the linker may be linked to the enzyme via a peptide linkage or via functional groups, such as thiol, hydroxy, amino and aromatic group, present in the side chains of the amino acids of the protein.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The cysteine residue possesses a thiol group and is thus particularly suitable for use according to this aspect of the invention.
      <br/>
      A variety of reagents that react selectively with the thiol group of a cysteine are available (Hermanson, G. T., 1996).
      <br/>
      Moreover, the coat proteins of filamentous phages do not generally have many free thiols exposed on their surfaces.
      <br/>
      Similarly, reduced and exposed thiol groups (i.e., not in the form of disulphide bridges) are very uncommon in antibodies.
      <br/>
      Hence, introducing a mutation to cysteine in the vicinity of the antibody active site can allow the specific covalent linkage of a ligand that carries an appropriate thiol reactive group with little or no non-specific linking to other residues of the antibody or the phage particle.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The linker or part thereof may be produced as a fusion protein with the enzyme.
      <br/>
      Methods of construction of such fusion proteins by recombinant DNA technology are well known to those of skill in the art as illustrated, for example, in Sambrook et al. (1989).
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the linker comprises a binding pair.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term binding pair refers to any pair of molecules capable of releasably binding to one another.
      <br/>
      Incorporation of a binding pair as part of the linker between the enzyme and substrate/product or as the linker itself is advantageous in that it permits easy linkage of the substrate or a modified substrate to the enzyme.
      <br/>
      It also permits easy release of the enzyme from the product after purification.
      <br/>
      Preferably, association and dissociation of the binding pair takes place under defined conditions such as temperature, concentration, solvent, ion concentration, such that linking and cleavage of the enzyme and substrate/product may be controlled by modification of the conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Preferably, the enzyme and all or part of the linker comprise a fusion protein.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the fusion protein comprises a fusion of the enzyme and calmodulin.
      <br/>
      By joining the substrate for the enzyme to a ligand for calmodulin, the substrate may be linked to the enzyme by means of the calmodulin-ligand binding pair interaction.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that each member of any binding pair, such as the calmodulin-ligand binding pair, may be used interchangeably with its counterpart.
      <br/>
      Thus, the enzyme may be linked to calmodulin and the substrate linked to a calmodulin ligand or vice versa.
    </p>
    <p num="25">A particular feature of the present invention is that it permits selection and isolation of an enzyme on the basis of its phenotype (ie enzymatic activity) while coupled to its corresponding genotype (e.g. DNA encoding the enzyme).</p>
    <p num="26">Thus, according to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of isolating DNA encoding an enzyme comprising linking the enzyme to a substrate for the enzyme; reacting the enzyme with the substrate such that a product is produced which remains linked to the enzyme; and isolating the enzyme by selectively isolating the product linked to the enzyme; wherein the enzyme is further linked to DNA encoding the enzyme.</p>
    <p num="27">
      The enzyme may be displayed on the surface of a support containing a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme.
      <br/>
      The support may comprise any suitable cell, phage or particle capable of containing a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme, expressing the DNA encoding the enzyme and displaying the enzyme on its surface.
      <br/>
      Suitable host cells include eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells such as bacterial, mammalian, yeast and baculoviral systems.
      <br/>
      Suitable bacterial cells include E. coli and many others.
      <br/>
      Suitable mammalian cell lines available for expression of a heterologous fusion peptide include HeLa cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, COS cells and many others.
      <br/>
      The choice of cell line will be dependent on the particular characteristics of the expressed protein, and the levels of expression required.
      <br/>
      Suitable particles include viral and retroviral systems, such as baculovirus, and phage particles.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Preferably, the support comprises a filamentous bacteriophage.
      <br/>
      Filamentous bacteriophage may be used to display the enzyme by fusion of the enzyme to a coat protein such as the minor g3p (Smith, 1985; Bass et al., 1990; McCafferty et al., 1990) minor g6p (Jespers et al., 1995) or major (g8p) (Kang et al., 1991) coat proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The gene encoding the displayed enzyme can be isolated by selecting for the enzyme product which is linked to the enzyme which in turn is linked to the phage particle which comprises the gene.
      <br/>
      The gene may be amplified by growth of the phage.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The isolation of active enzyme may be performed by any method that allows separation of the enzyme product from unchanged enzyme substrate.
      <br/>
      The method may comprise chemical or physical separation techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The physical properties (such as solubility) of the substrate and product may be sufficiently different that direct physical separation of the enzyme-product conjugate from the enzyme-substrate conjugate is possible.
      <br/>
      The difference in the physical properties may be enhanced by selective chemical modification or derivatisation of the enzyme-product conjugate or enzyme-substrate-conjugate (Illangasekare et al., 1995).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, separation may be accomplished by selective chemical reaction of the enzyme-product conjugate or enzyme-substrate conjugate with a reactive chemical moiety bound to a solid matrix (Lonsch &amp; Szostak, 1992).
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      A site for cleavage, for example by a specific protease, may be incorporated in the linker.
      <br/>
      Suitable proteases include Factor Xa (EP 0 161 937) and enterokinase (EP 0 035 384).
      <br/>
      This provides a means for the release of the enzyme from the product following purification.
    </p>
    <p num="33">Where the enzyme-product conjugate and enzyme-substrate conjugates are linked to cells or particles such as phage particles, they may be physically separated for example by the techniques of antibody panning, rosetting, agglutination, precipitation or by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).</p>
    <p num="34">
      Preferably, enzyme-product conjugate and enzyme-substrate conjugate may be separated by biopanning on immunotubes coated with a suitable affinity reagent, or by affinity chromatography using a solid matrix to which is bound an affinity reagent, such as an antibody, capable of selectively binding the enzyme-product conjugate or the substrate-enzyme conjugate (Tawfik et al., 1993; Tawfik et al., 1997).
      <br/>
      The affinity matrix may comprise any suitable solid support such as a resin, beads or any other conventional matrix.
      <br/>
      The affinity matrix may selectively bind the substrate-enzyme conjugate such that the product-enzyme conjugate remains in the elute.
      <br/>
      Preferably however, the affinity reagent selectively binds the product-enzyme conjugate such that the substrate-enzyme conjugate is completely removed by washing.
      <br/>
      The product-enzyme conjugate may be recovered from the affinity matrix by use of appropriate desorption conditions such as low pH, raised salt concentration or competitive binding.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Where the enzyme is linked to the product via a binding pair, the enzyme may be released from the affinity matrix under conditions which cause dissociation of the binding pair.</p>
    <p num="36">
      The binding affinity of the two members of the binding pair should be strong enough to survive the enzymatic conversion of the substrate to the product and the purification strategy employed for the isolation of product.
      <br/>
      The binding affinity of the two members of the binding pair may be defined in terms of the dissociation constant (Kd) for the interaction wherein:
      <br/>
      Kd =koff /kon
    </p>
    <p num="37">where</p>
    <p num="38">
      kon is the kinetic association constant of the reaction
      <br/>
      and koff is the kinetic dissociation constant of the reaction
    </p>
    <p num="39">Preferably, the binding pair employed in the present invention has a dissociation constant (Kd) of 10 nM or less, more preferably 1 nM or less, measured at a pH of between 6 and 9 at 20 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="40">
      Alternatively, the kinetic stability of the association of the binding pair may be measured.
      <br/>
      This may be defined in terms of the half-life t1/2 of the complex in conditions of irreversible dissociation wherein:
    </p>
    <p num="41">t1/2 =1/koff</p>
    <p num="42">
      The half-life of this interaction should be of sufficient length to allow for the conversion of substrate to product, and purification of product.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the half-life of the interaction is at least 15 minutes, preferably at least one hour.
    </p>
    <p num="43">Examples of binding pairs that may be used in the present invention include an antigen and an antibody or fragment thereof capable of binding the antigen, the biotin-streptavidin binding pair, a protein and an inhibitor capable of binding the protein such as an RNase and an RNase inhibitor (eg RNasin or barstar) and a calcium-dependent binding polypeptide and ligand thereof.</p>
    <p num="44">
      Preferably, the binding pair comprises a calcium-dependent binding protein and ligand thereof, wherein the binding of the protein and ligand is dependent upon the concentration of calcium ions.
      <br/>
      By this is meant that the dissociation constant for the ligand is reduced in the presence of calcium ions, that is, binding is much stronger in the presence of calcium ions.
      <br/>
      For the applications described herein it is preferred that this reduction is at least ten-fold where the binding protein has one tenth of its calcium binding sites occupied.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the dissociation constant is greater than 10 nM in the absence of calcium ions and 10 nM or less in the presence of calcium ions, preferably 1 nM or less, at a pH of between 6 and 9 at 20 (degree)  C. The mutual affinity of the binding pair may be modulated by the addition of calcium chelators such as EGTA, or EDTA.
      <br/>
      For some calcium dependent binding proteins, other analogous ions may replace calcium, for example strontium.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The calcium-dependent binding protein of choice is calmodulin, a small protein of 148 residues.
      <br/>
      Calmodulin is very resistant to denaturation and contains no disulphide bridges within the protein sequence, meaning that it can be expressed in bacteria and phage.
      <br/>
      Several proteins, peptides and organic compounds bind to calmodulin with high affinity (nM or sub nM).
      <br/>
      These ligands include calmidazolium, melittin, NO-30, AC-28, melatonin, (skeletal) myosin light chain kinase, and mastaporan.
      <br/>
      The latter two and their derivatives are the preferred ligands in this application, since they both show high affinity for calmodulin, and the interaction has a long half-life.
      <br/>
      In addition, derivatives of these peptides in which substitutions replace wild type residues have been recently discovered (Montigiani et al., 1996; Torok and Trentham, 1994; O'Neal and DeGrado, 1989).
      <br/>
      Due to their helix-forming properties, such peptides bind to calmodulin with even greater affinity than do the wild type substrates, and thus are preferred candidates for use in this application (see Neri et al. (1996) J. Mol. Biol. in press and copending International Patent Application "Calcium dependent binding ligands" in the name of the Medical Research Coucil filed on the Apr. 25, 1997, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference)
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Other calcium-dependent binding proteins include troponin C, calcineurin, parvalbumin and oncomodulin.
      <br/>
      In addition, fragments, and derivatives of calcium dependent binding proteins that retain binding activity may be used.
      <br/>
      The term "derivative" includes variants containing amino acid deletions, substitutions, or insertions.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Preferably, the enzyme-linker conjugate is produced by expression from gene fusions.
      <br/>
      Nucleic acid encoding such molecules is provided by the present invention.
      <br/>
      Suitable vectors for the expression of such molecules can be chosen or constructed, containing suitable promoter sequences, enhancer sequences, ribosome binding sites, expression signals, polyadenylation signals, termination sequences, signal sequences, and appropriate marker genes.
      <br/>
      Host cells may then be grown in culture in vitro to cause or allow production of the fusion molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The enzyme-calmodulin fusion protein of the present invention is linked to its encoding nucleic acid via a support.
      <br/>
      A support may be any species that allows the linkage of the enzyme to the nucleic acid that encodes it.
      <br/>
      This allows the simultaneous isolation of the encoding gene when the product of successful catalysis is identified, bound to the active enzyme.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Preferably, enzyme is displayed on the surface of phage.
      <br/>
      Phage is the preferred host for a number of reasons.
      <br/>
      First, as discussed above, large expression libraries may be generated by packaging of DNA into phage particles.
      <br/>
      Gene libraries encoding up to 109 unique protein species may be produced, from any organism, tissue, cell type, or developmental stage.
      <br/>
      Second, fusion to a coat protein allows display of the enzyme to the surrounding medium.
      <br/>
      Thus, the active site is readily displayed to the substrate-ligand complex.
      <br/>
      Third, phage can be easily analyzed and clonally selected through infection and plaque assays.
      <br/>
      Also, once purified, a clonal phage population can be amplified to produce a high titre of infective units.
      <br/>
      The high infectivity that phage display towards bacteria allows the preparation of large amounts of phage-encoded protein within a specific bacterial strain.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The enzyme is displayed on the surface of phage by fusion to a phage coat protein.
      <br/>
      A preferred coat protein is the tail protein, pIII (Smith, 1985; Bass et al., 1990, McCafferty et al., 1990).
      <br/>
      Other fusion partners can be pVIII (Kang et al., 1991), or pVI (Jespers et al., 1995).
      <br/>
      The enzyme-calmodulin-pIII protein is produced by genetic fusion to the 3' end of the phage coat protein gene.
      <br/>
      A substrate-enzyme conjugate may be formed by binding the calmodulin-enzyme fusion to a ligand-substrate fusion via the calmodulin-ligand binding pair interaction.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The isolation of active enzyme may be performed by any method that allows the "capture" of product.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment of the invention, affinity separation techniques are employed to enrich for members of the phage library that bind a target immobilized on a solid matrix.
      <br/>
      This target specifically binds the product of the catalysed reaction.
      <br/>
      Thus, inactive phage are washed from the support.
      <br/>
      Subsequent elution of active phage allows the clonal isolation and amplification of individual phage through infection of bacteria.
      <br/>
      Multiple rounds of selection make this approach extremely efficient.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The method of generation of the protein expression library may be through the use of vectors encoding nucleic acid species from cDNA libraries.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, one individual gene encoding one protein may be expressed in the phage population and exposed to mutagenesis using a repair-deficient strain of E. coli . This results in the production of a phage library displaying protein species mutated throughout the length of the sequence.
      <br/>
      Most of these will be inactive, or will be less catalytically efficient than the wild type protein.
      <br/>
      However, in a large library, some species may be produced that exhibit improved properties.
      <br/>
      These may be isolated by modification of the reaction conditions to favour the isolation of species with improved characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      As referred to above, phage expressing active protein are isolated by binding to a target that itself binds the product of the reaction.
      <br/>
      The experimental parameters may be modified to allow the isolation of the most highly active phage enzyme.
      <br/>
      For enzymatic reactions this may be through modulation of parameters such as temperature, time of reaction, pressure, by using various concentrations of competitors or inhibitors, or by varying the length of the linker between enzyme and substrate.
      <br/>
      In this way only the most active phage convert substrate to product under the conditions used, and only these phage are isolated.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Fusion of recombinant enzyme with pVIII (of which there are .about.2800 copies per cell) allows multivalent display of a protein derived from one nucleic acid species.
      <br/>
      Thus, product will be detected by the target reagent in conditions of higher stringency.
      <br/>
      In this way phage expressing recombinant protein species with lower activities may be isolated.

    <p num="58">Construction of Recombinant Calmodulin Fusion Proteins</p>
    <p num="59">
      Initially, test experiments were run to check whether a calmodulin tag of pDN323 was compatible with protein display on filamentous phage.

      Linear and cyclic peptides, an antibody fragment and three enzymes were cloned into the phagemid pDN323.

    <p num="140">Alternative Tagging Methodologies</p>
    <p num="141">1) Development of Phage Expressing Mutant ScFvs.</p>
    <p num="142">To exemplify a tagging methodology that utilises selective and site-specific chemical labeling, rather than binding pairs, we displayed on filamentous phage an ScFv derivative of antibody D2.3. This antibody was elicited by immunisation with the transition state analogue NBP, and which catalyses the hydrolysis of p-nitrobenzyl ester (NBE).</p>
    <p num="143">
      Cysteine mutants of this scFv fragment were then generated, at the following six positions in the heavy and light chains of the molecule; Threonine H30, Threonine H31, Serine H57, Serine L27, Serine L56 and Serine L52.
      <br/>
      Analysis of the structure of a large number of antibodies elicited using small synthetic antigens has indicated that these residues are part of the hypervariable regions yet in most antibodies they do not interact directly with the hapten.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the selected residues are solvent exposed in most murine antibodies and their modification should have minor effects on the overall structure and activity of the antibody.
      <br/>
      These positions are also highly conserved in most murine antibodies and hence in phage-antibody libraries based on murine sequences.
      <br/>
      Analogous positions can be identified in other antibodies (e.g., human antibodies) and in enzymes.
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      The cysteine mutants were constructed using overlapping PCR.
      <br/>
      Two fragments were amplified by PCR with plasmid D2.3-pCANTAB (Se-Ho Kim, Ph.D thesis, Weizmann Institute of Science, 1997) as template using primers carrying each mutation.
      <br/>
      The primers used were as follows: Thr30-Back: (CAAGAC-TTCTGGATACATCTTCTGCAGCTACTGGATTCACTGGGTAAAAC (SEQ ID NO: 22)(the codon encoding for Cys30 is underlined) and fdSEQ1:(GAATTTTCTGTATG-AGG) for amplifying one fragment and Thr30-Forward: (GCAGAAGATGTATCCAGA-AGTGTTG) (SEQ ID NO: 23) and pCANTAB-SEQ1: (TTGGAGATTTTCAACGTG) (SEQ ID NO:23) for amplifying the second fragment.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      These fragments were then assembled by a subsequent PCR using primers fdSEQ1 and pCANTAB-SEQ1 and plasmid D2.3-pCANTAB as template.
      <br/>
      The PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, digested with restriction enzymes NcoI and NotI and ligated into plasmid pHEN1 (Harrison et al., 1996; Hoogenboom et al., 1991) digested with the same enzymes.
      <br/>
      The resulting plasmids (D2.3-pHEN-) were transformed into E. coli-TG1 bacteria and phagemid particles were produced as described by Harrison et al., 1996. In general, phage titres of all six cysteine mutants were low relative to the wild type, yet infectivity was retained.
    </p>
    <p num="146">
      Conditions were optimised so that relatively high titres of phages displaying active antibodies could be obtained.
      <br/>
      In particular, growing the bacteria carrying the plasmids encoding for the cysteine mutants (after infection with VCS-M13 helper phage) at 25 (degree)  C. gave high titres.
      <br/>
      The growth of bacteria at various temperatures is shown in FIG. 7.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      The phage particles displaying the cysteine mutants of antibody D2.3 were purified by PEG-precipitation and analysed by phage-ELISA on NBP-BSA as described above.
      <br/>
      All the cysteine mutants except L27 exhibited binding activity.
      <br/>
      Phage mutants L56 and H57 exhibited binding activity that is only slightly lower than that observed in the parental D2.3 phage antibody.
      <br/>
      The results of the phage ELISA are shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      Results are given in optical density at 450 and 650 nm at 1:25 phage dilution.

    <p num="148">
      The phages carrying the cysteine mutants of D2.3-ScFv were used to re-infect E.Coli-TG1 bacteria that do not carry the D2.3-pHEN plasmid and to produce new particles that carry D2.3-ScFv (as demonstrated by phage ELISA).
      <br/>
      Hence, the cysteine mutation did not affect the infectivity of the phage particles.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      These results demonstrate that certain conserved residues or positions that are close to the active site and solvent exposed can be mutated to cysteine with the resulting ScFv retaining binding activity.
      <br/>
      The positions modified are conserved in murine antibodies and are hence suitable for modification not only in a single antibody but also in a library that encodes for a larger repertoire.
      <br/>
      Moreover, phage particles that display these cysteine mutants (fused to coat protein pIII) are infective and hence a basic requirement for selection is met.

      This approach to tagging is based on the intramolecular reaction of the enzyme to be selected with a covalently linked substrate.
      <br/>
      For this approach to work successfully, reagents and conditions must be used under which a negligible amount of substrate links to wild type phage particles, or to phage particles displaying an antibody that does not carry the cysteine mutation.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      To demonstrate the above, the following samples of phages were prepared: wild type phage VCS-M13, VCS-M13 phages displaying D2.3-ScFv antibody and VCS-M13 phages displaying the cysteine mutants either L56, L52 or H57 of D2.3-ScFv antibody.
      <br/>
      Biotin was used as a molecular probe.

      The p-nitrobenzyl ester substrate of antibody D2.3 was therefore linked via a 25  Angstrom  linker to a dithiopyridine group to allow its conjugation to phage particles carrying the cysteine mutants L56, L52 or H57 of ScFv-D2.3. This derivative (NBE-HPDP:

      The inhibition of the ELISA signal by the NBP hapten indicates that the conversion of the covalently-linked NBE substrate into the corresponding product was indeed catalysed by the phage-displayed ScFv-D2.3. Moreover, the background signal observed in the presence of phage particles displaying just D2.3, or phage particles displaying the cysteine mutants that were not modified with NBE-HPDP, was significantly lower.
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      This demonstrates that the substrate can be covalently linked at the vicinity of the active site of a catalytic antibody via a flexible linker and intramolecularly converted to product.
      <br/>
      This results in the specific binding of those phage particles displaying the catalytic antibody to antibodies that bind that product.
