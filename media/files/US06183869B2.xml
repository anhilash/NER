    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a fixing member such as a heat roll, belt and the like used in a fixing portion and the like of a copying apparatus, printer, and other various image forming apparatuses used in an electrophotography method in which the member is always exposed to heating and cooling cycles and mechanical press-contacting, a primer composition suitably used for such a fixing member, and a fixing device using such a fixing member.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">As a method for fixing a toner image formed on paper in a copying apparatus, a printer, and other various image forming apparatuses used in an electrophotography method, there is usually adopted a method in which a supporting substrate such as paper and the like on which a toner image is formed is passed between two rotating members which are heated by a heat generating body such as a lamp and the like placed thereabout and press-contacted with each other, to fuse the toner image on the supporting substrate.</p>
    <p num="5">
      As one example of the fixing device used in such a method, a heat roll fixing device as shown in FIG. 1 is listed, and this heat roll fixing device is composed of a pair of rolls being a heat roll 1 and a pressure roll 11.
      <br/>
      The heat roll 1 comprises hollow core metal 2 in the form of a cylinder composed of aluminum, iron, and the like having a surface coated with a fluororesin layer 4 composed of a heat resistant elastomer or heat resistant resin having excellent releasing properties such as a fluorine-based resin such as fluororubber, silicone rubber, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene with perfluoroalkylvinyl ether (PFA), and the like.
      <br/>
      Further, inside the heat roll 1, a heat generating body 21 such as a halogen lamp and the like is placed to impart a heat roll function to the roll 1.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      On the other hand, the pressure roll 11 comprises hollow core metal 12 in the form of a cylinder composed of aluminum, iron, and the like having a surface coated with a fluororesin layer 14 composed of a heat resistant elastomer or heat resistant resin having excellent releasing properties of the same kind or of a different kind from those used for the heat roll 1.
      <br/>
      The heat roll 1 and the pressure roll 11 are press-contacted with each other by a spring and the like.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, 27 indicates an inlet, 28 indicates an outlet, and 29 indicates a releasing agent application apparatus which applies a releasing agent to the surface of the heat roll 1.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In this heat roll fixing device, paper 31 carrying a toner image 32 on the surface is conveyed between the heat roll 1 and the pressure roll 11, and the toner image 32 is fixed on the paper 31, then, the paper 31 is conveyed by a pair of rolls through the outlet 28.</p>
    <p num="8">The fixing member coated on the surface of a substrate such as a roll and the like is required not to cause a hot offset phenomenon in which a part of a fused toner image adheres to the rotating member, and the phenomenon in which a toner image does not separate from the rotating member and is curled onto the rotating member together with the substrate.</p>
    <p num="9">
      On the other hand, since a heating and cooling cycle is repeated in which the fixing member is heated to temperatures as high as 200 (degree)  C. as the setting temperature when the apparatus is operating and cooled down to room temperature when the operation is terminated, the fixing member is also required to be able to tolerate this cycle.
      <br/>
      Further, on the outermost surface of the rotating member, the fixing members installed facing each other are press-contacted against each other, and the fixing member is placed under severe stress from a stripping finger for preventing paper curl which is always press-contacted with the member, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Therefore, the heat resistant elastomer or heat resistant resin having excellent releasing properties coated on a rotating member of a fixing apparatus is limited to silicone-based or fluorine-based polymer materials such as fluororubber, silicone rubber, fluororesin, and the like.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, although these polymer materials have excellent releasing properties, their adhesion to a substrate such as metal and the like is poor, therefore, it is difficult to coat them directly as a surface layer in producing a heat roller.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Hence, as a method for coating a fluororesin having low adhesion on the surface of a substrate, there is suggested a method in which an adhesive member called primer is inserted between the fluororesin layer and the metal surface.</p>
    <p num="12">
      For example, regarding a case in which a PFA resin is used as a fluororesin, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 57-177067 suggests a method in which hollow core metal and a PFA resin layer are adhered via an adhesive primer containing a PFA resin and a polyimide precursor obtained by reaction of pyromellitic anhydride with diaminodiphenyl ether, diaminodiphenylmethane, and the like.
      <br/>
      Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 63-112674 suggests a method in which hollow core metal and a PFA resin are adhered by an adhesive primer containing in a mixed solvent of a water-soluble organic solvent with water, a PFA resin and a material obtained by neutralizing with amine an aromatic polyimide precursor or free carboxylic acid thereof prepared by reacting pyromellitic anhydride with 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone, as main components.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Further, regarding a case in which a PTFE resin is used instead of a PFA resin as a fluororesin, U.S. Pat. No. 4,049,863 describes a primer containing PTFE, colloidal silica, and polyamideimide (PAI) in which the ratio of PTFE to PAI is 1:9, and suggests coating this primer on a metal core roll which has been surface-treated by grid blasting, flame fusing or frit coating with metal or metal oxide, or phosphoric acid, chromic acid or the like, so as to obtain a dry film thickness of 2 to 15  MU m. U.S. Pat. No. 3,801,379 suggests coating poly(arylene sulfide) containing 5 to 20% PTFE on an aluminum substrate after treatment of the surface of a core roll with hot water or vapor.
      <br/>
      Canadian Patent No. 887,122 suggests conducting coating in gradated structure conditionusing PAI and PTFE.
      <br/>
      Further, U.K. Patent No. 1,512,495 suggests that in PAI coating containing a PTFE powder, the minimum ratio of PTFE to PAI is 1:7.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Particularly, in fixing members used in an image forming apparatus in electrophotography mode, as an example of a fixing member obtained by adhering a fluororesin layer to a substrate such as metal and the like by a primer, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 64-1534 suggests a fluororesin-coated cylindrical member obtained by heat-fusing a heat-flowable fluororesin tube containing a filler onto a cylindrical member whose surface has been treated previously with a primer containing a fluororesin.
      <br/>
      Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) Nos. 4-8543, 4-45931 and 4-78533 suggest a fluororesin-coated cylindrical member obtained by heat-fusing a fluororesin tube onto a cylindrical member having a primer layer containing a polyparabanic acid resin or polyimide resin.
    </p>
    <p num="15">These primers contain as the main component a heat resistant resin such as a polyamide, polyimide, polyamideimide, polyarylene sulfide, and the like and have the drawbacks that when a substrate and a fluororesin are adhered using the above-described adhesive primer or in the case of a fixing member obtained by adhering a fluororesin layer to a substrate such as metal and the like by a primer, adhesion between the fluororesin layer and the substrate such as metal and the like exhibits excellent results in the initial stages, however, under the severe conditions of use for a fixing member used in an electrophotographic type image forming apparatus, deterioration with age occurs and the fluororesin peels easily off the substrate, and therefore the life span thereof is not long.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      The present invention has been accomplished in view of the above-described problems, and the object thereof is to provide a fixing member in which a primer layer is provided between a substrate and a fluororesin layer having excellent heat resistance and adhesion with the substrate and also with the fluororesin layer and, even under the severe conditions described above, the fluororesin layer does not easily peel off the substrate, particularly a metal substrate and has excellent durability, the fixing member being used in an electrophotographic type image forming apparatus, and a primer composition suitably used in this fixing member.
      <br/>
      Another object of the present invention is to provide a fixing apparatus using the fixing member having these excellent properties.
    </p>
    <p num="17">The present inventors after studying a material composition containing a composition which is covalent-bonded with a hydroxyl group on the surface of a substrate, completed the present invention.</p>
    <p num="18">
      The first primer composition of the present invention is a primer composition for a fluororesin containing a heat resistant resin, fluororesin, and a coupling agent.
      <br/>
      This primer composition can be applied widely in various fixing members used under severe conditions, and exhibits excellent adhesion between a metal substrate and a fluororesin layer in a fixing member.
    </p>
    <p num="19">One of the fixing members of the present invention is a fixing member obtained by forming a fluororesin layer via a primer layer on the surface of a substrate wherein the primer layer is made from the first primer composition comprising a heat resistant resin, fluororesin, and coupling agent.</p>
    <p num="20">
      In the fixing member using the first primer composition of the present invention, adhesion between a fluororesin layer, having releasing properties and a metal substrate in particular, is excellent as compared with conventional articles, and even under severe conditions, this adhesion does not noticeably deteriorate with age and the fluororesin does not peal off the metal substrate for a long period of time.
      <br/>
      This primer composition used in the heating member has excellent adhesion between the metal substrate and the fluororesin and durability thereof, and can be widely used for improving adhesion between a metal substrate and a fluororesin in a heating member.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The second primer composition of the present invention is a primer composition for a fluororesin comprising a fluororesin and a silicone-modified polyimide.</p>
    <p num="22">One of the fixing members of the present invention is a fixing member obtained by forming a fluororesin layer via a primer layer on the surface of a substrate wherein the primer layer is made from the second primer composition comprising a fluororesin and a silicone-modified polyimide.</p>
    <p num="23">It is hypothesized that in the fixing member using the second primer composition of the present invention, adhesion of the metal to the fluororesin is improved and heat resistance, heat cycle resistance, stress resistance, and the like are excellent, as compared with conventional fixing members since the primer layer according to the present invention is composed of fluororesin and silicone-modified polyimide having excellent adhesion to metal so that when the fluororesin of the fluororesin layer is heat-fused, this fluororesin is compatibilized with the fluororesin in the primer layer to form an gradated structure at the boundary surface of the fluororesin layer with the primer layer.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The fixing member using the second primer composition of the present invention has a primer layer having remarkably improved adhesion to inorganic materials such as metal in particular as compared with conventional primer layers, and has excellent heat resistance, heat cycle resistance, stress resistance, and the like.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the fixing member of the present invention, deterioration of the primer layer with age does not readily occur even under the severe conditions of the member being normally exposed to heating and cooling cycles and mechanical stress, and the fluororesin does not peel away from the substrate such as metal and the like for a long period of time, therefore, the life of the fixing member is greatly lengthened as compared with conventional fixing members, and it becomes possible to improve reliability and to lower running costs.
    </p>
    <p num="25">The third primer composition of the present invention is a primer composition for a fluororesin comprising a fluorine-containing polyimide resin.</p>
    <p num="26">One of the fixing members of the present invention is a fixing member obtained by forming a fluororesin layer via a primer layer on the surface of a substrate wherein the primer layer is made from the third primer composition for a fluororesin comprising a fluorine-containing polyimide resin.</p>
    <p num="27">
      The fixing member using the third primer composition of the present invention has a primer layer having remarkably improved adhesion to inorganic materials such as metal, in particular, as compared with conventional primer layers, and has excellent heat resistance, heat cycle resistance, stress resistance, and the like.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the fixing member of the present invention, the primer layer does not readily deteriorate with age even under the severe conditions of the primer layer being normally exposed to heating and cooling cycles and mechanical stress, and the fluororesin does not peel away from the metal for a long period of time, therefore, the life of the fixing member is greatly lengthened as compared with conventional fixing members, and it becomes possible to improve reliability and to lower running costs.
    </p>
    <p num="28">It is hypothesized that in the fixing member using the third primer composition of the present invention, adhesion of the metal to the fluororesin is improved and heat resistance, heat cycle resistance, stress resistance, and the like are excellent as compared with conventional fixing members since the primer layer according to the present invention is composed of a fluorine-containing polyimide so that when the fluororesin of the fluororesin layer is heat-fused, this fluororesin is compatibilized with the fluorine-containing polyimide to improve adhesion between the primer and the fluororesin.</p>
    <p num="29">Therefore, according to the fixing member using the third primer composition of the present invention, there is provided a fixing member in which deterioration with age and peeling of the fluororesin from the metal do not occur for a long period of time even under the severe conditions of the member being normally exposed to heating and cooling cycles and mechanical stress, and durability is excellent as compared with conventional fluororesin-coated fixingmembers usingaprimer, the fixing member being used in an electrophotographic type image forming apparatus.</p>

      The substrate used in the present invention may be a substrate composed of an inorganic material, or may be a substrate composed of a heat resistant resin containing an inorganic material as a filler.
      <br/>
      Examples of the inorganic material include metal such as aluminum, copper, nickel, and the like, alloys such as stainless alloy, silver alloy, nickel alloy, and the like, or ceramics and the like, having excellent heat conductivity.
      <br/>
      Examples of the heat resistant resin containing an inorganic material as a filler include metal, inorganic oxides such as SiO2, TiO2, Al2 O3, MgO, CaO, Fe2 O3 and the like, heat resistant resins such as a polyamide, polyamideimide, polyimide, polyarylene sulfide, polyether, and the like to which a fine particle of Sic (silicon carbide) or BN (boron nitride) is added.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      When an inorganic material is added to the heat resistant resin as a filler, the content of the inorganic material which is a filler in the substrate is preferably from 0.1% by weight to 50% by weight, and more preferably from 1% by weight to 30% by weight.
      <br/>
      The average particle size of the inorganic material is desirably set at not more than 5  MU m. When the average particle size is over 5  MU m, there is the concern that the inorganic material will tend to fallout from the heat resistant resin.
      <br/>
      Further, in view of dispersibility, the inorganic material having an average particle size of 0.001  MU m or more is more preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="36">When the substrate is composed of an inorganic material such as metal and the like, the substrate is provided in the form of a roll of a hollow core metal and the like or a belt of a Ni electrocast sheet and the like, and when the substrate is composed of a heat resistant resin to which an inorganic material is added, the substrate is provided in the form of a belt of, for example, a polyimide film and the like, however, the substrate is not limited to these forms.</p>
    <p num="37">
      It is preferable to conduct a surface treatment of the substrate to firmly adhere the primer layer on the surface of the substrate using the primer composition of the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, in the case of a metal substrate, it is preferable to conduct a de-greasing and washing treatment using an organic solvent and the like and a surface roughing treatment, and it is more preferable to conduct the surface roughing treatment after the surface cleaning treatment such as de-greasing and washing and the like has been conducted.
      <br/>
      This surface roughing treatment can be conducted by a known method such as sandblasting, chemical etching, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="38">(Primer Layer)</p>
    <p num="39">Next, the primer layer will be explained.</p>
    <p num="40">The fixing member of the present invention can be made into three kinds of fixing members by changing the primer composition forming the primer layer to the first primer composition, second primer composition, and third primer composition.</p>
    <p num="41">(First Primer Composition)</p>
    <p num="42">
      The first primer composition of the present invention is a composition comprising at least a fluororesin, coupling agent, and heat resistant resin.
      <br/>
      More specifically, this primer composition comprises as an essential component a silane coupling agent containing Si in the molecule, heat resistant resin or precursor thereof, and fluororesin.
    </p>
    <p num="43">It is preferable that the first primer composition of the present invention is a two-part type primer composition composed of a first solution containing as a main component a silane coupling agent and a second solution containing a fluororesin and heat resistant resin.</p>
    <p num="44">(Silane Coupling Agent)</p>
    <p num="45">
      As the coupling agent in the present invention, a coupling agent composed of an inorganic material such as a Ti, Al, or Zn-based compound and the like can also be used, however, when the substrate is made from an inorganic material, silane coupling agents having Si are preferred in order to firmly adhere the fluororesin layer composed of an organic material to the substrate composed of an inorganic material, and among them, a silane coupling agent represented by the following general formula (1) is particularly preferred.
      <br/>
      (X)4-n --Si--(OR)n  General formula (1)
    </p>
    <p num="46">(wherein, R represents a methyl group or ethyl group, X represents a monovalent organic group which may contain a vinyl group, epoxy group, methacryl group, mercapto group, amino group, ethoxy group, and methyl group, and n is an integer from 2 to 4.) is particularly preferred.</p>
    <p num="47">
      Among these, the coupling agents having the best heat resistance are tetramethoxysilane and tetraethoxysilane in which four ethoxy groups or methoxy groups are aligned.
      <br/>
      It is believed that these compounds further improve heat resistance since the compounds do not leave an organic residue when the coupling reaction is conducted.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      A coupling agent has two or more different reactive groups in the molecule and works by chemically bonding an organic material to an inorganic material.
      <br/>
      The mechanism of this adhesion will be described regarding the silane coupling agent represented by the general formula (1) as follows: An alkoxysilyl group (Si--OR) in the silane coupling agent is hydrolyzed either by water or moisture to be a silanol group (Si--OH).
      <br/>
      This silanol group and a hydroxyl group on the surface of the inorganic material form a Si--O--M bond by a dehydration condensation reaction.
      <br/>
      Further, one reactive group (--X) can be bonded to or compatibilized with the organic material and consequently can be bonded to both the organic material and the inorganic material.
    </p>
    <p num="49">The aim of using the coupling agent is to observe the difference in the size of the bonding energy, and the point thereof is to use strong covalent bonding energy and not to effect adhesionbypartial covalent bonding or hydrogenbonding, or by a weak bonding force such as van der Waals force and the like, as is the case with conventional primers.</p>
    <p num="50">(Heat Resistant Resin)</p>
    <p num="51">
      As the heat resistant resin which can be used in the first primer composition of the present invention, any heat resistant resin having a continuous use temperature of 180 (degree)  C. or more can be used, and in view of their effectiveness, aromatic heat resistant resins such as apolyimide, polyamideimide, polyether sulfone, polyphenylene sulfide, and the like are listed as preferable examples.
      <br/>
      The polyimide is generally obtained by reacting tetracarboxylic dianhydride with a diamine in an organic polar solvent.
    </p>
    <p num="52">In the present invention, the same effect is obtained when instead of the heat resistant resin, a precursor thereof is used, therefore, when a resin is referred to as a heat resistant resin in the present invention, that resin may also be a precursor thereof.</p>
    <p num="53">
      For example, in the primer layer constituting the fixing member of the present invention, a polyimide or precursor thereof (polyamic acid) can be used as the heat resistant resin.
      <br/>
      The polyamideimide is a polymer having a structure containing an amide group and an imide group alternately, and can be produced usually from an aromatic tricarboxylic anhydride and an aromatic diamine.
      <br/>
      According to the acid chloride method, a precursor polyamic acid is obtained, and when this is dehydrated and ring-closed, it becomes a polyamideimide, and according to the isocyanate method or direct polycondensation method, a polyamideimide can be obtained in one step.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, apolyamideimde or precursor thereof is used.
      <br/>
      The polyether sulfone (PES) is a type of an aromatic polycondensation type polymer generally obtained by a condensation reaction using dichlorodiphenyl sulfone as the main raw material.
      <br/>
      The polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) is a type of an aromatic polymer having a melting point of 283 (degree)  C. and a continuous use temperature of 200 to 220 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="54">(Fluororesin)</p>
    <p num="55">
      As the fluororesin which is the third essential component of the first primer composition of the present invention, a resin having excellent heat resistance is preferred for enabling continuous use at 200 (degree)  C. or more by heating the fixing member, and examples thereof include PTFE, PFA, tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene copolymer (FEP) and the like.
      <br/>
      Among them, PFA is particularly preferred in view of its resistance to mechanical stress and excellent processability.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      This fluororesin is prepared in the form of a powder or an aqueous dispersed material called a dispersion and compounded in the primer.
      <br/>
      The fluororesin in the primer is melted by heat applied when the fluororesin layer is formed and compatibilizes the fluororesin in the fluororesin layer.
      <br/>
      It is compounded for the purpose of firmly adhering the fluororesin to the primer by forming an gradated structure in the concentration of the fluororesin at the boundary surface between the fluororesin layer and the primer layer.
    </p>
    <p num="57">(Other Additives)</p>
    <p num="58">
      In the primer composition, in addition to the essential components and a solvent for dissolving them, various additives can be used together for improving properties and conditions in the range which is not harmful to the effects of the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, a surfactant such as polyoxyethylenephenyl ether and the like may be added for improving dispersibility of the fluororesin in the primer solution.
    </p>
    <p num="59">(Formation of Primer Layer)</p>
    <p num="60">A method for forming a primer layer of a fixing member using the first primer composition of the present invention will be described.</p>
    <p num="61">
      In general, there are largely two methods for adding a silane coupling agent to the primer layer.
      <br/>
      One of them is called the integral blend method in which when a resin layer is adhered to an inorganic material, a mixture, prepared by mixing the silane coupling agent together with other materials of the primer composition, is applied to the surface of the inorganic material, and can be easily integrated into the production process and has excellent workability.
      <br/>
      However, in this method, the amount used of the silane coupling agent increases since this method can not easily match the effects of direct treatment on the surface of the inorganic material.
      <br/>
      The other method is called a pre-treatment method in which a substrate formed from inorganic material is previously surface-treated with a treating agent containing, as a main agent, a silane coupling agent, and can easily match the effects of the silane coupling agent, and when the treatment is conducted in wet mode, treatment efficiency is high and uniform treatment can be effected, therefore, this method is industrially widely used.
    </p>
    <p num="62">When the primer layer of the fixing member of the present invention is formed, it is preferred to add a silane coupling agent by a wet pre-treatment method in which strong adhesive strength is obtained with a smaller amount of primer composition, and the primer composition used in this method is preferably a two-part type composition composed of a first solution containing as a main component a silane coupling agent and a second solution containing a fluororesin and heat resistant resin, being coated sequentially.</p>
    <p num="63">
      When a primer layer is formed using asilane coupling agent by the integral blend method, the primer layer is formed by coating on the surface of a substrate an adhesive primer solution prepared by dissolving the above-described heat resistant resin or precursor thereof and the above-described fluororesin and silane coupling agent together into a water-soluble organic solvent such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, furfuryl alcohol, butanol, isopropanol, ethanol, and the like.
      <br/>
      In this case, the amount of the silane coupling agent to be added and mixed is preferably from 1% by weight to 20% by weight based on the primer solution, and more preferably from 1% by weight to 10% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      Further, when a primer layer is formed using a silane coupling agent by the wet pre-treatment method, the primer layer is formed by applying a first solution containing as a main agent a silane coupling agent to the surface of a substrate, then, applying to the surface of the substrate, on which the first solution has been coated and dried, a second solution prepared by dissolving the above-described heat resistant resin or precursor thereof and the fluororesin together in a water-soluble organic solvent.
      <br/>
      In this case, as the first solution, it is preferable to dilute the silane coupling agent with a solvent to be a concentration from 1 to 20% by weight for use.
      <br/>
      As the solvent used in this case, almost all organic solvents such as alcohols, toluene, xylene, ethyl acetate, methylethylketone, acetone or a mixed solvent of alcohol with water, and the like, can be applied.
      <br/>
      Further, after applying the first solution, it is preferable to remove the solvent by air drying, then, to conduct heat treatment at a temperature in the range of from 100 to 200 (degree)  C. to increase the strength of the primer layer.
    </p>
    <p num="65">In any case, the ratio after mixing of the above-described heat resistant resin or precursor thereof to the fluororesin is in the range of from 10:90 to 90:10, and preferably from 30:70 to 70:30 by weight.</p>
    <p num="66">As a method for coating the primer solution, a dipping method, spin method, spray method, roll coat method, and the like can be used, and the dipping method and spray method are preferred, and the film thickness of the primer layer after drying is from 1 to 50  MU m, and preferably 3 to 20  MU m. The drying can be conducted by heating or air drying.</p>
    <p num="67">(Second Primer Composition)</p>
    <p num="68">The second primer composition of the present invention comprises a fluororesin and silicone-modified polyimide.</p>
    <p num="69">(Fluororesin)</p>
    <p num="70">
      As the fluororesin used in the second primer composition of the present invention, a resin having excellent heat resistance is preferred for enabling continuous use at 200 (degree)  C. or more by heating the fixing member, and examples thereof include PTFE, PFA, tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene copolymer (FEP) and the like.
      <br/>
      Among these, PFA is particularly preferred in view of its resistance to mechanical stress and its excellent processability.

    <p num="71">
      This fluororesin is prepared in the form of a powder or an aqueous dispersed material called a dispersion, and compounded in the primer.

      The fluororesin in the primer is melted by heat applied when the fluororesin layer is formed and compatibilizes the fluororesin in the fluororesin layer.
      <br/>
      It is compounded for the purpose of firmly adhering the fluororesin to the primer by forming an inclined structure in the concentration of the fluororesin at the boundary surface between the fluororesin layer and the primer layer.

    <p num="72">(Silicone-modified Polyimide)</p>
    <p num="73">As the silicone-modified polyimide used in the second primer composition of the present invention, a polyimide is preferred which is obtained by reacting as a monomer at least one of a tetracarboxylic dianhydride represented by the following general formula (2) containing a polysiloxane unit and a diamine represented by the following general formula (3) containing a polysiloxane unit.

(Chemical Structure image '34' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="99">
      These fluorine-containing polyimides manifest excellent adhesion to the carrier, and are easily compatibilized with the fluororesin in the outermost releasing layer formed after the application of the above-described primer since they contain a fluorine atom.
      <br/>
      Therefore, these polyimides are compounded for obtaining firm adhesion between the fluororesin and the primer.
    </p>

      The above-described fluorine-containing polyimide maybe prepared in the form of a polyimide obtained by complete dehydration and condensation of the monomers, aromatic tetracarboxylic dianhydrice and diamine, and compounded in a primer solution for adhesion, or may be prepared in the form of a polyamic acid which is a partially dehydrated and concentrated precursor and compounded in an adhesive primer solution.
      <br/>
      In view of processability and handling, the compounding of a polyamic acid into an adhesive primer solution is preferred.

    <p num="101">(Silane Coupling Agent)</p>
    <p num="102">The printer layer in the present invention preferably further contains a silane coupling agent.</p>
    <p num="103">
      The use of the coupling agent is conducted while observing the difference in bonding energy, and the point thereof is to use the strong bonding energy of a covalent bond and not to use partial covalent bond adhesion or hydrogen bond adhesion, or the adhesion of a weak bonding force such as van der Waals force and the like, as with a conventional primer.
      <br/>
      As the silane coupling agent, the same compounds as those used in the first primer composition can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="104">(Other Additives)</p>
    <p num="105">In the primer composition, in addition to the essential components and a solvent for dissolving them, various additives can be used together for improving properties and conditions in the range which is not harmful to the effect of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="106">(Formation of Primer Layer)</p>
    <p num="107">
      When a primer layer of a fixing member is formed using the third primer composition of the present invention, the primer layer is formed by applying to the surface of a substrate an adhesive primer solution prepared by dissolving the above-described fluorine-containing polyimide or precursor thereof into a water-soluble organic solvent such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, furfuryl alcohol, butanol, isopropanol, ethanol, and the like.
      <br/>
      When used in combination with a silane coupling agent, the primer layer is formed desirably by the wet pre-treatment method like the first primer composition.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      When a primer layer is formed using a silane coupling agent by the integral blend method, the primer layer is formed by applying to the surface of a substrate an adhesive primer solution prepared by dissolving the above-described fluorine-containing polyimide or precursor thereof and the silane coupling agent together into a water-soluble organic solvent such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, furfuryl alcohol, butanol, isopropanol, ethanol, and the like.
      <br/>
      In this case, the amount of the silane coupling agent to be added and mixed is preferably from 1% by weight to20% by weight based on the primer solution, and more preferably from 1% by weight to 10% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      Further, when a primer layer is formed using a silane coupling agent by the wet pre-treatment method, the primer layer is formed by applying to the surface of a substrate a first solution containing as a main agent a silane coupling agent, then, applying to the surface of the substrate on which the first solution has been applied and dried, a second solution prepared by dissolving in a water-soluble organic solvent the above-described fluorine-containing polyimide or precursor thereof.
      <br/>
      In this case, as the first solution, it is preferable to dilute the silane coupling agent with a solvent to be a concentration of from 1 to 20% by weight for use.
      <br/>
      As the solvent used in this case, almost all organic solvents such as alcohols, toluene, xylene, ethyl acetate, methylethylketone, acetone or a mixed solvent of alcohol with water, and the like, can be applied.
      <br/>
      Further, after the application of the first solution, it is preferable to remove the solvent by air drying, then, to conduct heat treatment at a temperature in the range of from 100 to 200 (degree)  C. for increasing the strength of the primer layer.
    </p>
    <p num="110">The coating method is the same as for the first primer composition, and the film thickness of the primer layer after drying is preferably from 1 to 50  MU m, and more preferably 3 to 20  MU m. The drying can be conducted by heating or air drying. (Filler)</p>
    <p num="111">
      In the primer layer of the present invention, fillers may be appropriately compounded for improving the strength of the primer layer.
      <br/>
      These fillers can be used provided the adhesion between the substrate and the primer layer and between the primer layer and the fluororesin layer and the releasing properties required thereof as a fixing member are not lost.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      As the filler, fine particles of metal, inorganic oxides such as SiO2, TiO2, Al2 O3, MgO, CaO, Fe2 O3 and the like, and inorganic materials such as SiC (silicon carbide), BN (boron nitride) , Si3 N4 (silicon nitride) , and the like can be used.
      <br/>
      Among these, in view of its excellent heat resistance and durability as well as its low cost, Fe3 O3 (iron oxide red) is particularly preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      When an inorganic filler is added to the primer layer, the content of the inorganic filler in the primer layer is preferably from 0.1% by weight to 50% by weight, and more preferably from 1% by weight to 30% by weight.
      <br/>
      The average particle size of the inorganic filler is desirably set at not more than 5  MU m. When the average particle size is over 5  MU m, there is the concern that the inorganic filler will tend to fallout from the primer layer.
      <br/>
      Further, in view of dispersibility, the inorganic filler having an average particle size of 0.001  MU m or more is more preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="114">(Fluororesin Layer)</p>
    <p num="115">Next, the outermost layer among the layers formed on the substrate, i.e. the fluororesin layer, will be described.</p>
    <p num="116">As the fluororesin which forms the fluororesin layer of the present invention, a resin having excellent heat resistance is preferred for enabling continuous use at 200 (degree)  C. or more by heating a roller, and in view of their resistance to mechanical stresses such as abrasion and the like and their releasing properties, perfluoroalkylvinyl ether-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer (PFA), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), hexafluoropropylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer (FEP), and polyhexafluoropropylene are particularly preferred.</p>

      In the fluororesin layer in the present invention, fillers and other resins may be appropriately compounded for improving resistance to mechanical stresses such as abrasion and the like and releasing properties.
      <br/>
      These fillers and other resins can be used provided the adhesion between the substrate and the primer layer and between the primer layer and the fluororesin layer and the releasing properties required thereof as a fixing member are not lost.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      As the filler, fine particles of metal, inorganic oxides such as SiO2, TiO2, Al2 O3, MgO, CaO, Fe2 O3 and the like, and inorganic materials such as SiC (silicon carbide), BN (boron nitride) , Si3 N4 (silicon nitride) and the like can be used.
      <br/>
      Among these, in view of their excellent resistance to mechanical stress such as abrasion and the like, SiC, BN and Si3 N4 are particularly preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      When an inorganic filler is added to the fluororesin layer, the content of the inorganic filler in the fluororesin layer is preferably from 5% by weight to 50% by weight, and more preferably from 5% by weight to 15% by weight.
      <br/>
      The average particle size of the inorganic filler is desirably set at not more than 10  MU m to provide the necessary film thickness.
      <br/>
      When the average particle size is over 10  MU m, there is the concern that the inorganic filler will tend to fallout from the outermost layer.
    </p>
    <p num="120">As the other resin, heat resistant resins such as a polyamide, polyimide, polyamideimide, polybenzoimidazole, polyarylene sulfide, polyether, polyketone, aromatic polyester, silicone resins, and the like can be used, and among these, polymers in which either a perfluoroalkyl group or a fluorine-substituted aromatic ring has been introduced into the skeleton of either a silicone resin or these heat resistant resins are particularly preferred since their releasing properties are not lost.</p>
    <p num="121">
      When the other resin is added to the fluororesin layer, the content of the other resin in the fluororesin layer is preferably from 1% by weight to 50% by weight, and more preferably from 5% by weight to 20% by weight.
      <br/>
      Further, it is preferable that the softening point by heat of the other resin is equivalent to or more than that of the fluororesin.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      The fluororesin layer in the present invention is formed by coating a fluororesin layer onto a formed primer layer when the primer layer is either dry or wet.
      <br/>
      The outermost layer, being the fluororesin layer, can be formed for example by, after uniformly applying a fluororesin powder or a dispersion of a fluororesin powder by a dipping method, spray method, or the like, using a dispersion method in which firing is effected at temperature where a fluororesin is melted, a tube inserting method in which a fluororesin tube is heated to be constricted, or an electrostatic coating method in which a PFA particles are adhered.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      The thickness of the fluororesin layer is from 5 to 500  MU m, and preferably from 20 to 50  MU m when a primer composition containing a fluororesin and a coupling agent is used, from 0.1 to 100  MU m, and preferably from 5 to 40  MU m when a primer composition containing a fluororesin and a silicone-modified polyimide is used, and from 0.1 to 100  MU m, and preferably from 5 to 40  MU m when a primer composition containing a fluorine-containing polyimide resin is used.
      <br/>
      When the layer is too thin, then after a long period of use, the releasing layer on the surface is abraded to expose the primer layer and metal core roll surface, and the releasing properties are drastically reduced.
      <br/>
      When the layer is too thick, heat conductivity deteriorates and a long warm-up time is required.

    <p num="125">The fixing member can be applied to a fixing device which conducts fixing by heating a toner image on a receiving member, the fixing member being used as a member which needs releasing properties on its surface, under the high temperature conditions of a heating roller, fixing belt, pressure roller pressed to contact with the heating roller and the like.</p>
    <p num="126">It is preferable that the fixing member has a heat source, and as examples of fixing devices which conduct fixing by heating a toner image on a receiving member, there is a fixing device comprising a heat roll, a pressure belt which press-contacts with the heat roll, and a pressure roll which presses the pressure belt from the rearside, a fixing device comprising a heat roll and a pressure roll which press-contacts with the heat roll, a fixing device comprising a heat belt, a pressure member which press-contact swith the inner side of the heat belt, and a pressure roll placed in a position opposite to the pressure member, a fixing device comprising a heat belt, pressure member which press-contacts with the inner side of the heat belt and a pressure belt placed in a position opposite to the pressure member, and the like.</p>
