      The invention relates to the use of compounds of the formula 1 as thickeners for liquid, aqueous surfactant systemswhere R is an aliphatic radical having from 8 to 24 carbon atoms, R1 and R2, which are identical or different, are alkyl groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or hydroxyalkyl groups having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, and Z is a linear polyhydroxyhydrocarbon radical having at least 3 OH groups, which may also be alkoxylated, and also their acid addition products.
      <br/>
      The thickeners are used in industrial and standard household surfactant compositions.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The production of liquid products in the cosmetics and detergent sectors is continually increasing.
      <br/>
      Particularly in the field of body cleansing compositions, it is the liquid hair shampoos, foam baths and shower preparations which have gained importance in recent years.
      <br/>
      Liquid dishwashing detergents and liquid light-duty detergents have also gained a firm place in the market.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      A prerequisite for a useable liquid surfactant formulation is a long shelf life.
      <br/>
      The liquid must not cloud or form precipitations during temperature fluctuations.
      <br/>
      In addition, good tolerability by the skin is required.
      <br/>
      The product should degrease the skin as little as possible and should not lead to skin irritation.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      First and foremost, however, the liquid surfactant system must also have a viscosity which is matched to the particular intended use and which can be varied as much as possible.
      <br/>
      The viscosity is thus a decisive criterion for the quality of a liquid surfactant preparation.
      <br/>
      For example, a shower gel requires very high viscosities, while a hair shampoo is usually a flowable liquid having a relatively low viscosity of from 1000 to 4000 mPas.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Known thickeners for liquid surfactant formulations include nonionogenic fatty acid polyalkylene glycol esters, such as ANTIL (molecular weight about 3000, Goldschmidt AG), and, for many years now, nonionic fatty acid alkanolamides (cf. J. Amer. Oil Chem. Soc. 35, 548 (1958)).
      <br/>
      The fatty acid alkanolamide which is preferentially used in practice is coconut fatty acid diethanolamide (SUPERAMID).
      <br/>
      Compared with other fatty acid diethanolamides, it exhibits the best thickening properties.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The degree of thickening largely depends on the surfactant system and on the addition of electrolyte.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is known, for example, that sec-paraffinsulfonates as surfactants in liquid formulations present problems during viscosity adjustment.
      <br/>
      In the case of sec-paraffinsulfonates, the known currently available thickeners given above do not exhibit adequate thickening effects, even in the presence of electrolytes.
      <br/>
      EP-A-0 285 768 describes the use of N-polyhydroxyalkyl fatty acid amides as thickeners for liquid aqueous surfactant systems which, particularly in the presence of sec-paraffinsulfonates, produce a good effect.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In addition, it is known that aqueous surfactant formulations comprising fatty alcohol ether sulfates, as are often used in cosmetic formulations, can be adjusted to a desired viscosity by adding alkylamidobetaines.
      <br/>
      However, alkylamidobetaines, as byproducts, have a high sodium chloride content, which can frequently lead to corrosion during storage or processing.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Fatty acid N-alkylpolyhydroxyalkylamides and, in particular, fatty acid N-methylglucamides are nonionic surfactants which, because of their good application profile, are used, for example, for preparing detergents and cleaners.
      <br/>
      The use of these substances is the subject-matter of a large number of publications.
      <br/>
      For example, EP-A-0 285 768 describes their use as thickeners in aqueous cleaner systems.
      <br/>
      A disadvantage for the use and formulation is the limited solubility of these substances, particularly those having a chain length greater than C16.
      <br/>
      At relatively high concentrations in water they can only be handled with difficulty because of their high viscosity.
      <br/>
      Relatively high temperatures, which reduce the viscosity, however, lead to increased hydrolysis.
    </p>
    <p num="8">It was therefore the object to find thickeners for liquid aqueous surfactant systems which satisfy the various requirements in practice with regard to surfactant, electrolyte and intended use.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="9">Surprisingly, it has been found that compounds of the formula 1, as described in DE-A-195 12 299.2, are suitable as thickeners.</p>
    <p num="10">The invention provides for the use of compounds of the formula 1 as thickeners for liquid, aqueous surfactant systems  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="11">where R is an aliphatic radical having from 8 to 24 carbon atoms, R1 and R2, which are identical or different, are alkyl groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or hydroxyalkyl groups having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, and Z is a linear polyhydroxyhydrocarbon radical having at least 3 OH groups, which may also be alkoxylated, and also their acid addition products.</p>
    <p num="12">
      An essential advantage of the class of compounds to be used according to the invention is their high adaptability to the respective needs of the surfactant system by the possible variations in the substituents Z, R, R1 and R2.
      <br/>
      For example, in the class of substances according to the invention, it is possible to vary not only the fatty acid alkyl chain R, but also the hydrophobicizing substituents on the nitrogen, R1 and R2, and also the hydrophiling hydrocarbon radical Z. In addition, by virtue of the basic dialkylaminoalkylene radical, it is possible to influence the properties in a targeted manner by setting a certain pH.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Preference is given to compounds of the formula 1 in which R is fatty alkyl, R1 and R2 are methyl, and Z is the residue of a sugar alcohol derived from a reducing mono- or disaccharide, in particular from glucose.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">The object of the present invention was to develop thickeners for liquid aqueous surfactant mixtures using N-(3-dialkylamino)propyl-N-polyhydroxyalkylcarboxamides and/or their acid addition products which, in addition to improved application properties such as good solubility in water, permit high surfactant concentration without organic solvents, low melting points, favorable viscosity adjustments under the various requirements in practice with regard to surfactant, electrolyte and intended use, without causing losses in performance in the detergency of the detergent mixtures.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The formulations according to the invention may comprise a compound of the formula 1 or their acid addition products as the sole surfactant, but these surfactants are preferably combined with other customary anionic, nonionic, cationic and/or amphoteric surfactants.
      <br/>
      The mixing ratio between the surfactants of the formula 1 or their acid addition products and the other surfactants can fluctuate within wide limits, for example in the weight ratio from 1 to 99 to 99 to 1, preferably from 80 to 20 to 20 to 80.
      <br/>
      The total concentration of surfactants in the formulations according to the invention can be from 1 to 99% by weight, preferably from 5 to 50% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Suitable anionic surfactants include sulfonates, sulfates, carboxylates, phosphates and mixtures of the above compounds.
      <br/>
      Suitable cations in this case are alkali metals such as, for example, sodium or potassium, or alkaline earth metals such as, for example, calcium or magnesium, and ammonium, substituted ammonium compounds, including mono-, di- or triethanolammonium cations and mixtures of the cations.
      <br/>
      The following types of anionic surfactants are of particular interest: alkyl ester sulfonates, alkylsulfates, alkyl ether sulfates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, secondary alkanesulfonates and soaps as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Alkyl ester sulfonates include linear esters of C8 -C20 -carboxylic acids (i.e. fatty acids) which are sulfonated using gaseous SO3, as described in The Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society 52 (1975), pp. 323-329. Suitable starting materials are natural fats such as, for example, tallow, palm oil or coconut oil, but they can also be synthetic.
      <br/>
      Preferred alkyl ester sulfonates, particularly for detergent applications, are compounds of the formula  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      where R1 is a C8 -C20 -hydrocarbon radical, preferably alkyl, and R is a C1 -C6 -hydrocarbon radical, preferably alkyl.
      <br/>
      M is a cation which forms a water-soluble salt with the alkyl ester sulfonate.
      <br/>
      Suitable cations are sodium, potassium, lithium or ammonium cations, such as monoethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine.
      <br/>
      R1 is preferably C10 -C16 -alkyl and R is preferably methyl, ethyl or isopropyl.
      <br/>
      Particular preference is given to methyl ester sulfonates where R1 is C10 -C16 -alkyl.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Alkylsulfates are in this case water-soluble salts or acids of the formula ROSO3 M, where R is preferably a C10 -C24 -hydrocarbon radical, preferably C10 -C20 -alkyl or hydroxyalkyl, particularly preferably C12 -C18 -alkyl or -hydroxyalkyl.
      <br/>
      M is hydrogen or a cation, e.g. an alkali metal cation (e.g. sodium, potassium, lithium), ammonium or substituted ammonium, e.g. methyl-, dimethyl- and trimethylammonium cations and quaternary ammonium cations, such as tetramethylammonium and dimethylpiperidinium cations and quaternary ammonium cations, derived from alkylamines such as ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Alkyl chains with C12 -C16 are preferred for low wash temperatures (e.g. below about 50 (degree)  C.) and alkyl chains with C16 -C18 are preferred for higher wash temperatures (e.g. above about 50 (degree)  C.).
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Alkyl ether sulfates are water-soluble salts or acids of the formula RO(A)m SO3 M, where R is an unsubstituted C10 -C24 -alkyl or hydroxyalkyl radical, preferably a C12 -C20 -alkyl or hydroxyalkyl radical, particularly preferably C12 -C18 -alkyl- or -hydroxyalkyl radical.
      <br/>
      A is an ethoxy or propoxy unit, m is a number greater than 0, preferably between about 0.5 and about 6, particularly preferably between about 0.5 and about 3, and M is a hydrogen atom or a cation such as, for example, sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium or a substituted ammonium cation.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of substituted ammonium cations are methyl-, dimethyl-, trimethylammonium and quaternary ammonium cations such as tetramethylammonium and dimethylpiperidinium cations, and those which are derived from alkylamines, such as ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Examples which may be given are C12 -C18 fatty alcohol ether sulfates where the content of ethylene oxide is 1, 2, 2.5, 3 or 4 mol per mole of fatty alcohol ether sulfate, and where M is sodium or potassium.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
