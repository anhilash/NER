    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to human-powered ride-on vehicles, and specifically to a front wheel drive ride-on vehicle having a rear steerable wheel that is shiftable to an orientation substantially normal to the driving wheel.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      There are many forms of human-powered vehicles described in the patent and technical literature.
      <br/>
      Some of these known vehicles are intended to provide a carnival-type ride, wherein the rider may, at the rider's will, be subjected to G-forces, generally of the lateral variety.
      <br/>
      Ride-on vehicles such as the Big Wheel.RTM. achieve such G-forces through the provision of a large, driven front wheel, and the provision of independent braking systems on much smaller rear wheels.
      <br/>
      As the front wheel is also the source of motive power for the Big Wheel.RTM., the rider frequently loses the ability to provide continued power during a turn, as the turning of the wheel forces the rider's foot off of the associated pedal on the side ow the wheel away from the turn.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      A variety of power and braking systems are known for human powered, ride-on vehicles.
      <br/>
      An early braking system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 180,820, to Appel et al., granted Aug. 8, 1876 for Brakes for light vehicles.
      <br/>
      This reference depicts a braking system wherein bars are placed in frictional contact with wheels.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="15">
      Referring now to FIGS. 1-3, a ride-on vehicle constructed according to the invention is depicted generally at 10.
      <br/>
      Vehicle 10 includes a body/frame element 12, which provides a mounting structure for a pair of spaced-apart front driving wheels 14, 16, a rear, steerable wheel 18, a control stick 20, and a pedal mechanism 22.
      <br/>
      Body/frame element 12 is an integrated structure that provides support for a rider and also provides mounts for the various components of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Vehicle 10 is constructed to provide an exceptionally low center-of-gravity, as the vehicle is capable of extreme spin-out maneuvers which result in lateral G-forces, which, were the vehicle not so constructed, would likely result in the separation of the rider from the vehicle during such maneuvers.
      <br/>
      To this end, it may be seen that body 12 includes a seat 24 for the rider, which seat is contoured to provide an indented area 26 for the rider's bottom, and another indented area 28 which substantially conforms to the rider's back.
      <br/>
      Front wheels 14, 16 are substantially larger than rear wheel 18, again, to provide greater stability for the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In order to provide for lateral G-force maneuvers, steerable wheel 18 is constructed and arranged to be rotatable to substantially 90 (degree)  to front wheels 14, 16.
      <br/>
      This allows vehicle 10 to pivot about either front wheel, depending on the direction of deflection of control stick 20.
      <br/>
      In some instances, the vehicle may be constructed with differential braking, which will further accentuate the spin-out characteristics of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      A steering mechanism is operable to steer rear wheel 18 in a predetermined direction corresponding to a shifting movement of control stick 20.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring now to FIGS. 4 and 5, the steering mechanism, indicated generally at 30, of the invention will be further described.
      <br/>
      Control stick 20 is mounted on a control shaft 32, which includes a lower portion 34 and an upper portion 36.
      <br/>
      A pivot point 38 is located between lower portion 34 and upper portion 36, which allows for a side-to-side shifting movement of control stick 20 about pivot point 38.
      <br/>
      Steering mechanism 30 includes a steering linkage 39, which includes a swash plate 40, which is fixed to upper portion 36 below a hand grip 42 of control stick 20.
      <br/>
      Swash plate 40 has opposed first control rods 44,46 attached thereto, which control rods extend downward, and in the preferred embodiment, cross one another, before connecting to spaced-apart bell cranks 48, 50, respectively.
      <br/>
      Bell cranks 48, 50, are independently rotatably mounted on a brake actuator 52, which also serves as a mount for control shaft 32 lower portion 34.
      <br/>
      A pair of horizontal control links 54, 56 extend from bell cranks 48, 50 rearward.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, control links 54, 56 include horizontal control rods 55, 57 which terminate in a pair of flexible cables 58, 60, respectively.
      <br/>
      Cables 58, 60 extend over pulleys 62, 64 and terminate at a steering ring 66 of rear wheel 18.
      <br/>
      Pulleys rotate on a shaft 68, which is mounted to body 12.
      <br/>
      Alternately, the cross-over between the steering linkage components may be located adjacent the rear of the linkage mechanism, or anywhere along the length thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As will be apparent to those of skill in the art, when control stick 20 is shifted, for instance, to the right of the vehicle, swash plate 40 is also tilted to the right, pulling first control rod 44 upwards, rotating bell crank 48 clockwise, pulling horizontal control rod 54 and cable 58 forward, and turning rear wheel 18 to the right.
      <br/>
      In this instance, the predetermined direction for rear wheel 18 is to the right, which corresponds to a shifting movement of control stick 20 to the right.
      <br/>
      Other configurations may provide for control stick 20 to be moved fore and aft to steer, or a twisting movement may be allowed, although one of the benefits of the side-to-side shifting is that a rider may generally be able to exert a greater steering pressure moving control stick 20 about its pivot point than would be accomplished with a twisting movement.
      <br/>
      The swash plate, control rods, bell crank and steering ring are constructed and arranged so that rear wheel 18 may be rotated to be substantially normal to front wheel 14 and 16.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      A braking mechanism, shown generally at 69, includes elongate brake actuator 52, which is mounted in bearings 70, 72, which are mounted to body 12.
      <br/>
      Brake actuator 52 is mounted for transverse rotational movement relative to body 12.
      <br/>
      A pair of brake arms 74, 76 are fixed at either end of brake actuator 52, and contact wheels 14, 16, respectively, in a frictional braking contact, when control stick 20 is pulled rearward by the rider, thus applying rearward rotational movement to brake actuator 52.
      <br/>
      Braking mechanism 69 may be modified to operate on only one of the front wheels, or may be further modified to operate on either or both of the front wheels, depending on the rider's actions.
      <br/>
      In one form of the modified braking mechanism, push buttons may be installed on control stick 20, and linked by cable to brake arms 74, 76, to selectively engage either or both of the brake arms.
      <br/>
      In another form of the modified braking mechanism, the engagement of brake arms 74, 76 may be selected by the rider by means of a solenoid clutch arrangement, whereby one or both of the brake arms engage their respective wheel upon back force applied to control stick 20.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Rear wheel 18 is mounted on a cambered arm 78, which in turn is mounted on a rear-wheel shaft 80, which is rotatably mounted in a rear-wheel mount 82, located on the underside of body 12.
      <br/>
      Steering ring 66 is fixed to rear-wheel shaft 80.
      <br/>
      Cambered arm 78 provides that wheel 18 will substantially align with front wheels 14,16 when control stick 20 is neutralized, i.e., no right or left forces are applied thereto.
      <br/>
      With full deflection of control stick 20, the steering linkage will rotate rear wheel 18 on shaft 80 so that wheel 18 is substantially normal to front wheels 14, 16, which results in the aforementioned extreme spin-out maneuvers.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Pedal mechanism 22 provides motive power for vehicle 10 by virtue of pedals 84, 86 which are mounted on a pedal bar 88.
      <br/>
      Pedal bar 88 is mounted to body 12 by bearings 90, 92.
      <br/>
      One or both front wheels may be driven.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, only left front wheel 16 is driven, and includes a racheting drive hub, such as a BMX.RTM. hub 94 located between pedal bar 88 and wheel 16.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, wheel 14 is mounted to be free-wheeling on pedal bar 88.
      <br/>
      A second racheting drive hub 96 may be included in wheel 14, in which case, both front wheels are driven.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that regardless of whether one or both front wheels are driven, the wheels will free-wheel on their respective racheting drive hubs when the rider stops pedalling.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Thus, a front wheel drive ride-on vehicle capable of extreme spin-out maneuvers has been disclosed.
      <br/>
      Although a preferred embodiment of the ride-on vehicle, and several variations thereof, have been disclosed, it will be appreciated that further modification and variations thereof may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
