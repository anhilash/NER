      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates generally to a semiconductor memory device, and more particularly, to a semiconductor memory device having a normal operation mode and a self-refresh mode.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      In recent years, portable computers have continued to be developed.
      <br/>
      A semiconductor memory device used in such a portable computer is required to have the capabilities of holding data such as file data which used to be performed by a conventional hard disk, and of operating with low power consumption in the data holding state.
    </p>
    <p num="6">In a semiconductor memory device, a self-refresh state generally corresponds to the data holding state.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Meanwhile, a technique to lower an external power supply voltage Ext.Vcc in the data holding state (self-refresh mode), as shown in FIG. 27A, from about 3.3V in a write mode and a read mode to about 2.5V, for example, has been developed in order to reduce power consumption by portable computers.
      <br/>
      Herein, as shown in FIGS. 27B and 27C, switching from the write mode to the self-refresh mode is achieved by the generation of CBR (CAS Before RAS) timing in which an external column address strobe signal Ext./CAS us activated prior to an activation of an external row address strobe signal Ext./RAS. A self-refresh entry control signal /BBU is activated to a low (L:logical low) level as shown in FIG. 27D.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Reduction in an internal power supply voltage VCC in the data-holding state for power saving, however, causes the increase in a current Icc consumed in a substrate voltage generation circuit when voltage VCC is equal to or less than a voltage VC1 as shown by the solid line in FIG. 10. As a result, power consumption increases in the substrate voltage generation circuit, for example.</p>
    <p num="9">In addition, stable reading/writing operation from/to a memory cell is made difficult by lowering internal power-supply voltage VCC.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">An object of the invention is, therefore, to provide a semiconductor memory device capable of stable operation with reduced power consumption in the data holding state (the self refresh-mode).</p>
    <p num="11">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a semiconductor memory device includes a substrate, a memory cell array formed on the substrate and having a plurality of memory cells storing data, a memory cell selection circuit, formed on the substrate for selecting at least one of the plurality of memory cells from/to which data is read out/written, and, a substrate voltage generation circuit formed on the substrate for generating and supplying to the substrate a first substrate voltage when an internal power supply voltage is larger than a predetermined value and a second substrate voltage with an absolute value smaller than the absolute value of the first substrate voltage when the internal power supply voltage is smaller than the predetermined value.</p>
    <p num="12">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a semiconductor memory device, having a normal operation mode and a self-refresh mode, includes a plurality of word lines, a plurality of bit line pairs orthogonal to the plurality of word lines, a plurality of memory cells arranged corresponding to crossings of the plurality of word lines and the plurality of bit line pairs, a bit line precharge circuit for supplying a bit line equivalent voltage to each one of the plurality of bit line pairs, a bit line equivalent voltage generation circuit for generating a bit line equivalent voltage, and a mode switching circuit for switching the mode between the normal operation mode and the self-refresh mode according to external control signals, and the bit line equivalent voltage generation circuit includes a resistive divider for dividing the internal power-supply voltage in two by resistance to generate the bit line equivalent voltage in the self-refresh mode.</p>
    <p num="13">In accordance with still another aspect of the invention, a semiconductor memory device, having a normal operation mode and a self-refresh mode, includes a plurality of word lines, a plurality of bit lines orthogonal to the plurality of word lines, a plurality of memory cells arranged corresponding to crossings of the plurality of word lines and the plurality of bit lines, a mode switching circuit for switching the mode between the normal operation mode and the self-refresh mode according to external control signals, and a word line selection circuit for simultaneously selecting less word lines of the plurality of word lines than are simultaneously selected in the normal operation mode, when the mode switching circuit switches the mode to the self-refresh mode.</p>
    <p num="14">Accordingly, an advantage of the invention lies in that the power consumption is surely reduced in the data holding state.</p>
    <p num="15">A further advantage of the invention is that increased stability can be obtained together with the reduction in power consumption in the self-refresh operation.</p>
    <p num="16">A still further advantage of the invention is that further reduction in power consumption can be obtained in the self-refresh mode.</p>
    <p num="17">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

      FIG. 4 is a circuit diagram showing the configuration of VBB generation circuit 204 of FIG. 1.

      As shown in FIG. 4, VBB generation circuit 204 includes a VBB level detection circuit 501 receiving signal /BBUL generated in /BBUL signal generation circuit 219 to output a VBB level detection signal  PHI 501, a VBB1 pumping circuit 502 receiving VBB level detection signal  PHI 501 to output a substrate voltage VBB1, a VBB level detection circuit 503 receiving signal /BBUL to output a VBB level detection signal  PHI 503, and VBB2 pumping circuit 504 receiving VBB level detection signal  PHI 503 to output a substrate voltage VBB2 of an absolute value smaller than the substrate voltage VBB1.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Desirably, an inverter INV included in VBB level detection circuit 503 is a clocked CMOS circuit, in order to prevent a generation of through current.</p>
    <p num="30">
      FIGS. 5-8 are diagrams for describing the operation of VBB generation circuit 204 shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      In particular, FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate an operation in the normal operation mode, whereas FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate an operation in the self-refresh mode.
    </p>
    <p num="31">In the normal operation mode, VBB level detection signal  PHI 503 of an L level is always output from VBB level detection circuit 503 regardless of the absolute value of the substrate voltage as shown in FIG. 6, because VBB level detection circuit 503 shown in FIG. 4 is inactivated in response to the inactivation of signal /BBUL to a high (H) level.</p>
    <p num="32">
      When VBB level detection circuit 501 is activated and the absolute value of the substrate voltage is smaller (shallower) than a voltage VB1 determined by the threshold of N-channel MOS transistors NT1 and NT2, VBB level detection signal  PHI 501 is activated to an H level, and conversely, VBB level detection signal  PHI 501 is inactivated to an L level when the absolute value of the substrate voltage is larger (deeper) than voltage VB1, as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the normal operation mode, VBB1 pumping circuit 502 is activated to generate substrate voltage VBB1 only when the absolute value of the substrate voltage is smaller than voltage VB1.
    </p>
    <p num="33">Meanwhile, in the self-refresh mode, VBB level detection signal  PHI 501 of an L level is always output from VBB level detection circuit 501 regardless of the absolute value of the substrate voltage as shown in FIG. 7, because VBB level detection circuit 501 shown in FIG. 4 is inactivated in response to the activation of signal /BBUL to an L level.</p>
    <p num="34">
      VBB level detection signal 503 is activated to an H level when VBB level detection circuit 503 is activated and the absolute value of the substrate voltage is smaller (shallower) than a voltage VB2 (&lt;VB1) determined by the threshold of N-channel MOS transistor NT3 as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      Conversely, VBB level detection signal  PHI 503 is inactivated to an L level when the absolute value of the substrate voltage is larger (deeper) than voltage VB2 as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      Thus, in the self-refresh mode, VDC 201 is allowed to supply smaller internal power supply voltage VCC to the internal circuitry by pulling down supplied external power supply voltage Ext.VCC. Current Icc consumed in VBB generation circuit 204 can be reduced as well.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      FIGS. 9 and 10 are diagrams showing a performance characteristic of VBB generation circuit 204 when internal power supply voltage VCC is supplied by pulling down the external power supply voltage.

      FIG. 9 shows the relation of internal power supply voltage VCC and substrate voltage VBB and FIG. 10 shows the relation of internal power supply voltage VCC supplied to VBB generation circuit 204 and current Icc consumed in VBB generation circuit 204.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Referring to FIGS. 9 and 10, when the level of internal power supply voltage VCC is at VC1, for example, the level of the substrate voltage is at VB1.
      <br/>
      Current Icc consumed in VBB generation circuit 204 is represented by the solid line in FIG. 10. As shown in FIG. 9, internal power supply voltage VCC can be lowered down to voltage VC2 by supplying VB2 with an absolute value smaller than the absolute value of voltage VB1 as substrate voltage VBB.
      <br/>
      Further, in this case, the power consumption of VBB generation circuit 204 will not increase even if internal power supply voltage VCC is lowered from voltage VC1 down to voltage VC2, as can be seen from the chain-dotted line in FIG. 10 representing current Icc consumed in VBB generation circuit 204.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Thus, an operation at low voltage with reduced power consumption is allowed in the self-refresh mode by making substrate voltage VBB shallower.</p>
    <p num="38">
      The power consumption can be further reduced by making substrate voltage VBB in the self-refresh mode shallower.
      <br/>
      In this case, refresh time can be extended (that is, a refresh cycle can be extended) due to the decrease in the pn junction leakage current between storage node and substrate 200.

      <br/>
      The potential of node n11 is at a high level (and is directly proportional to internal power supply voltage VCC), when internal power supply voltage VCC is larger than voltage VCV, because the potential of node n83 is smaller than the threshold of inverter 83 as shown in FIG. 13.

      Next, referring to FIGS. 17 and 19, a 2K refresh operation and a 4K refresh operation in the self-refresh mode will be described.

      As can be seen from FIG. 19, the 2K refresh operation means simultaneously selecting one of word lines WL0 -WL255 in each one of two blocks among blocks B--B15.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 19, one word line in each of hatched blocks B0 and B8 is selected simultaneously, according to the supplied internal address (RA8, RA9, RA10)=(0,0,0), for example.

      FIG. 17 is used in describing the concept of the 4K refresh operation.

      <br/>
      If the internal address supplied to row decoder 207 is, for example, (RA8, RA9, RA10, RA11)=(0,0,0,0), only one hatched block B0 (i.e. one of word lines WL0 -WL255 therein) is selected.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the number of word lines simultaneously selected from word lines WL0 -WL4095 is less in the 4K refresh operation than in the 2K refresh operation.
      <br/>
      In the normal operation mode, the same operation as the 2K refresh operation is performed.
    </p>
    <p num="53">FIGS. 20A-20D and FIGS. 21A-21D show power supply voltage and consumed currents in the 2K refresh operation and the 4K refresh operation, respectively.</p>
    <p num="54">In the 2K refresh operation mode, two of word lines WL0 -WL4095 are activated simultaneously as in FIG. 20A, and 1024 * 2 sense amplifiers (S.A) are activated when data is read out from corresponding memory cells 18 to bit line pairs BLn, /BLn (n=0-1023) as in FIG. 20B. Thus, consumed current Icc increases as shown in FIG. 20C whereas internal power supply voltage VCC decreases as shown in FIG. 20D.</p>
    <p num="55">
      In the 4K refresh operation mode, similarly to the operation in the 2K refresh operation mode, one of word lines WL0 -WL255 is activated to read data from corresponding memory cell 18 to bit line pair BLn, /BLn as shown in FIGS. 21A-21D. Consumed current Icc and internal power supply voltage VCC change as shown in FIGS. 21C and 21D.
      <br/>
      Unlike the 2K refresh operation where two word lines of word lines WL0 -WL255 are selected simultaneously, in the 4K refresh operation only one of word lines WL0 -WL255 is selected simultaneously.
      <br/>
      Therefore only 1024 sense amplifiers (S.A) shown in FIG. 18 are activated.
      <br/>
      Thus, current Icc in FIG. 21C is smaller than current Icc in FIG. 20C, and, internal power supply voltage VCC decreases less in FIG. 21D than in FIG. 20D.

      Then each of sub row decoders 31 corresponding to the signals selects one word line of word lines WL0 -WL255 according to internal address RAn (n=0-7) input to sub row decoder 31.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Meanwhile, in the self-refresh mode, when internal power supply voltage VCC falls below the predetermined value, signal 4KE activated to an H level is supplied to row decoder 207 from 4KE signal generation circuit 220 for the 4K operation.
      <br/>
      In this case, as shown in Table 1, when an externally applied address (Ext. A8, Ext. A9, Ext. A10)=(L,L,L), for example, is input and an internal address RA11 (=L) is supplied from refresh address generation circuit 221 through address circuit 203, only signal RBS0 is activated to an H level.
      <br/>
      Then, only one corresponding sub row decoder 31 selects one of word lines WL0 -WL255 according to input internal address RAn (n=0-7).

    <p num="66">Further reduction in power consumption in the data holding state is allowed by performing the above described 4KE operation in the self-refresh mode.</p>
    <p num="67">Second Embodiment</p>
    <p num="68">A semiconductor memory device according to a second embodiment of the invention has the same configuration as the device according to the first embodiment except that VBB generation circuit 204 shown in FIG. 1 is replaced with a circuit shown in FIG. 25.</p>
    <p num="69">Referring to FIG. 25, VBB generation circuit 204 included in the semiconductor memory device of the second embodiment includes an internal power supply voltage level detection circuit 701, a first VBB level detection circuit 702 connected to internal power supply voltage level detection circuit 701, a second VBB level detection circuit 704 connected to internal power supply voltage level detection circuit 701, a first VBB pumping circuit 703 connected to first VBB level detection circuit 702, and a second VBB pumping circuit 703 connected to second VBB level detection circuit 704.</p>
    <p num="70">Internal power supply voltage level detection circuit 701 includes an internal power supply voltage node n82, a node n70, a resistive element R5 connected between node n70 and internal power supply voltage node n82, a ground node n81, N-channel MOS transistors NT4-NT6 connected in series between node n70 and ground node n81 with the gate and the drain of each being connected, and an inverter 40 connected to node n70.</p>
    <p num="71">First VBB level detection circuit 702 includes inverters 41-43, an internal power supply voltage node n82, a ground node n81, N-channel MOS transistors NT20 and NT21, and a P-channel MOS transistor PT20.</p>
    <p num="72">Second VBB level detection circuit 704 includes inverters 44 and 45, an internal power supply voltage node n82, a ground node n81, an N-channel MOS transistor NT22, and a P-channel MOS transistor PT21.</p>
    <p num="73">Each of first and second VBB pumping circuit 703 includes, a ground node n81, an NAND circuit 46, inverters 47-50, a capacitor 51, and, P-channel MOS transistors PT22 and PT23.</p>
    <p num="74">
      Next, the operation of VBB generation circuit 204 according to the second embodiment will be described.
      <br/>
      When internal power supply voltage VCC is low, the output of internal power supply voltage level detection circuit 701, that is, the output of inverter 40, is at an L level.
      <br/>
      Then P-channel MOS transistor PT21 is turned on, causing the activation of second VBB level detection circuit 704.
      <br/>
      Conversely, when internal power supply voltage VCC is high, the output of internal power supply voltage level detection circuit 701 i.e. the output of inverter 40, attains an H level, because N-channel MOS transistors NT4-NT6 are gradually turned on in sequence.
      <br/>
      In this case, first VBB level detection circuit 702 is activated as P-channel MOS transistor PT20 is turned on.
    </p>
    <p num="75">Thus, stable operation of VBB generation circuit 204 in a wider voltage range is possible by setting the level of substrate voltage (VBB) shallow when internal power supply voltage VCC is low, and by setting the level of VBB deep when internal power supply voltage VCC is high.</p>
    <p num="76">VBB generation circuit 204 according to the second embodiment differs from VBB generation circuit 204 of the first embodiment in that the latter changes the level of VBB in accordance with the mode, whereas, the former changes the level of VBB in accordance with the magnitude of internal power supply voltage VCC regardless of the mode.</p>
    <p num="77">
      Thus, VBB generation circuit 204 of the second embodiment makes the level of VBB shallow only when internal power supply voltage VCC falls down below the predetermined value and not when the mode is switched.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, VBB generation circuit 204 of the second embodiment enjoys the advantage that a malfunction of VBB generation circuit 204 due to an accidental change-over to the self-refresh mode caused by noise, for example, can be prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="78">Third Embodiment</p>
    <p num="79">A semiconductor memory device according to the third embodiment has the same configuration as the semiconductor memory device according to the first embodiment except that VBB2 generation circuit 505 shown in FIG. 4 and included in VBB generation circuit 204 shown in FIG. 1 is replaced with VBB3 generation circuit 506 shown in FIG. 26.</p>
    <p num="80">Referring to FIG. 26, VBB3 generation circuit 506 includes a VBB level detection circuit 503, an oscillation circuit 600 oscillating by receiving VBB level detection signal  PHI 503 output from VBB level detection circuit 503, a level converter 601 connected to oscillation circuit 600 and converting the amplitude of an input signal from internal power supply voltage VCC to boosted voltage VPP, an output node n601 of level converter 601, a capacitor 60 connected to level converter 601, and P-channel MOS transistors PT30 and PT31.</p>
    <p num="81">Level converter 601 includes, a node n84 to which boosted voltage VPP is supplied, a ground node n81, inverters 52 and 53, N-channel MOS transistors NT30 and NT31, and P-channel MOS transistors PT32 and PT33.</p>
    <p num="82">
      In VBB3 generation circuit 506, theoretically the absolute value of substrate voltage VBB3 is voltage (VPP -2 .vertline.Vthpt.vertline.), as the amplitude of output node n601 corresponds to boosted voltage VPP.
      <br/>
      Here, Vthpt, represents the threshold voltage of P-channel MOS transistors PT30 and PT31.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      According to the semiconductor memory device of the third embodiment, the level of the substrate voltage at a low internal power supply voltage VCC can be made sufficiently deep by using boosted voltage VPP for VBB3 generation circuit 506 included in VBB generation circuit 204.
      <br/>
      Therefore, substrate voltage VBB optimal for the self-refresh mode at low power can be generated with a sufficient margin.
    </p>
    <p num="84">In addition a device, in which voltage down converter 201 is not incorporated, may operate in a same manner, because in the semiconductor memory device according to the first to third embodiments described above, internal power supply voltage VCC can be adjusted by an external controller.</p>
    <p num="85">Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims.</p>
