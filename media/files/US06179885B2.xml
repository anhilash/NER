    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The invention relates to aromatic Mannich compound-containing compositions and to a process for making these compounds.
      <br/>
      The aromatic Mannich compounds are dispersed in alcohol, and are useful as detergent additives for hydrocarbon fuels.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Hydrocarbon fuels generally contain numerous deposit-forming substances.
      <br/>
      When used in internal combustion engines, deposits tend to form on and around constricted areas of the engine in contact with the fuels.
      <br/>
      In diesel engines, deposits tend to accumulate in the fuel injection system, thereby hampering good performance of the engine.
      <br/>
      In spark ignition engines deposits can build up on engine intake valves leading to progressive restriction of gaseous fuel mixture flow into the combustion chamber and also to valve sticking.
      <br/>
      It is common practice therefore to incorporate a detergent in the fuel composition for the purpose of inhibiting the formation, and facilitating the removal, of engine deposits, thereby improving engine performance.
      <br/>
      Mannich condensation products, obtained by reacting hydrocarbon-substituted phenols with aldehydes and amines, are known as detergents for fuels.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="8">
      As used herein, the term "hydrocarbyl substituent," "hydrocarbyl group" or "hydrocarbon group" is used to refer to a group having one or more carbon atoms directly attached to the remainder of a molecule and having a hydrocarbon or predominantly hydrocarbon character.
      <br/>
      Examples include:
      <br/>
      (1) purely hydrocarbon groups, that is, aliphatic (e.g., alkyl, alkenyl or alkylene), and alicyclic (e.g., cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl) groups, aromatic groups, and aromatic-, aliphatic-, and alicyclic-substituted aromatic groups, as well as cyclic groups wherein the ring is completed through another portion of the molecule (e.g., two substituents together forming an alicyclic group);
      <br/>
      (2) substituted hydrocarbon groups, that is, hydrocarbon groups containing non-hydrocarbon groups which, in the context of this invention, do not alter the predominantly hydrocarbon nature of the group (e.g., halo, hydroxy, alkoxy, mercapto, alkylmercapto, nitro, nitroso, and sulfoxy);
      <br/>
      (3) hetero substituted hydrocarbon groups, that is, hydrocarbon groups containing substituents which, while having a predominantly hydrocarbon character, in the context of this invention, contain other than carbon in a ring or chain otherwise composed of carbon atoms.

      Heteratoms include sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen.
