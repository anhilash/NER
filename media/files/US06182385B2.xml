      A rock and material loading system that is removably attachable to a loader bucket for loading material such as rocks into the loader bucket.
      <br/>
      The inventive device includes a pair of brackets attached to the upper rear portion of a loader bucket, a pair of lower jaws attached to the brackets, a pair of upper jaws pivotally attached to the lower jaws, an upper shaft securable within the jaws, a pair of side arms pivotally extending from the upper shaft, a lower shaft rotatably attached to the distal ends of the side arms, a plurality of teeth attached to the lower shaft, a pair of leverage arms attached to the lower shaft, and a pair of hydraulic cylinders attached to the upper shaft and to the leverage arms for manipulating the teeth.
      <br/>
      The user manipulates the hydraulics after engaging an object such as a rock for loading the rock into the conventional loader bucket.
      <br/>
      If the user requires usage of the loader bucket without the invention, the user simply opens the jaws and can easily remove the upper shaft from the jaws thereby allowing unobstructed use of the loader bucket.

    <p num="3">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="4">The present invention relates generally to rock pickers and more specifically it relates to a rock and material loading system that is removably attachable to a loader bucket for loading material such as rocks into the loader bucket.</p>
    <p num="5">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="6">
      Rock picking devices have been in use for years.
      <br/>
      Typically, a conventional rock picker includes a frame, a hitch for attaching to a tractor, a storage bin pivotally attached to the frame for receiving the rocks, a plurality of rock picking arms that rotate about the frame thereby throwing the rocks into the storage bin, and a power take off (PTO) assembly attached to the rock picking arms for connecting to the PTO of the tractor.
      <br/>
      Alternative conventional rock pickers are similar to the previous rock-picking device, however they include a loader bucket that is hydraulically raised/lowered for throwing the rock into the storage bin of the rock picking device.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Conventional rock picking devices are fine for the use they are designed for.
      <br/>
      However, conventional rock picking devices are undesirable since the user must pull the structure behind the tractor.
      <br/>
      In addition, conventional rock picking devices tend to be relatively expensive because they are generally self-contained.
      <br/>
      In addition, conventional rock picking devices are undesirable since they are not useful for retrieving rocks deep within the surface of the earth.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      An example of an attempt to solve the problem of conventional rock pickers is U.S. Pat. No. 5,664,348 to Omann.
      <br/>
      Omann teaches a rock and material loading apparatus having a plurality teeth pivotally supported about the front edge of a loader bucket.
      <br/>
      Omman further teaches a pair of knee members below the plurality of teeth for allowing the user to pivot the plurality of teeth by lowering the front edge of the bucket.
      <br/>
      Omman does not utilize any hydraulic cylinders or actuators for manipulating the plurality of teeth.

    <p num="9">
      While these devices may be suitable for the particular purpose to which they address, they are not as suitable for being removably attachable to a loader bucket for loading material such as rocks into the loader bucket.
      <br/>
      Conventional rock picking devices require pulling the structure with a large tractor.
      <br/>
      In addition, conventional rock picking devices do not allow easy removal for allowing normal utilization of the loader bucket and tractor.
    </p>
    <p num="10">In these respects, the rock and material loading system according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of being removably attachable to a loader bucket for loading material such as rocks into the loader bucket.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of rock picking devices now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new rock and material loading system construction wherein the same is removably attachable to a loader bucket for loading material such as rocks into the loader bucket.</p>
    <p num="12">The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new rock and material loading system that has many of the advantages of the rock picking devices mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new rock and material loading system which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art rock picking devices, either alone or in any combination thereof.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="28">
      Turning now descriptively to the drawings, in which similar reference characters denote similar elements throughout the several view, FIGS. 1 through 7 illustrate a rock and material loading system 10, which comprises a pair of brackets 20a-b attached to the upper rear portion of a loader bucket 16, a pair of lower jaws 22a-b attached to the brackets 20a-b, a pair of upper jaws 24a-b pivotally attached to the lower jaws 22a-b, an upper shaft 30 securable within the jaws, a pair of side arms 32a-b pivotally extending from the upper shaft 30, a lower shaft 60 rotatably attached to the distal ends of the side arms 32a-b, a plurality of teeth 70 attached to the lower shaft 60, a pair of leverage arms 50a-b attached to the lower shaft 60, and a pair of hydraulic cylinders 40a-b attached to the upper shaft 30 and to the leverage arms 50a-b for manipulating the teeth 70.
      <br/>
      The user manipulates the hydraulics after engaging an object such as a rock 18 for loading the rock 18 into the conventional loader bucket 16.
      <br/>
      If the user requires usage of the loader bucket 16 without the invention, the user simply opens the jaws and can easily remove the upper shaft 30 from the jaws thereby allowing unobstructed use of the loader bucket 16.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 through 7, a conventional loader bucket 16 comprises a front edge, a pair of side portions, a floor, and a rear portion.
      <br/>
      A pair of loader arms 14 pivotally extend from a conventional tractor 12.
      <br/>
      The distal ends of the loader arms 14 are typically pivotally attached to the loader bucket 16 for elevating and lower the loader bucket 16.
      <br/>
      The user of a conventional tractor 12 and loader bucket 16 operates a hydraulic system for elevating and lowering the loader bucket 16.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      As best shown in FIG. 7 of the drawings, a pair of brackets 20a-b are secured to the upper portion of loader bucket 16 by conventional means such as welding or fasteners.
      <br/>
      As further shown in FIG. 7 of the drawings, a pair of lower jaws 22a-b are attached to the brackets 20a-b.
      <br/>
      The lower jaws 22a-b have a cutout for removable receiving the upper shaft 30.
      <br/>
      A pair of upper jaws 24a-b are rotatably attached to the lower jaws 22a-b as further shown in FIG. 7 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      The pair of upper jaws 24a-b both have a cutout that mirror the cutout within the lower jaws 22a-b.
      <br/>
      When the upper jaws 24a-b are locked respective to the lower jaws 22a-b, the respective cutouts form an enclosed aperture for receiving the upper shaft 30.
      <br/>
      It can be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the aperture formed by the cutouts within the lower jaws 22a-b and the upper jaws 24a-b may have any well-known shape such as circular, rectangular or square.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Both pairs of upper jaws 24a-b and lower jaws 22a-b have a pair of locking apertures 26 as best shown in FIG. 7 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      A locking pin 28 is removably insertable into each of the locking apertures 26 for retaining the upper jaws 24a-b locked about the upper shaft 30 with respect to the lower jaws 22a-b as shown in FIG. 1 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      To remove the invention from the loader bucket 16, the locking pins 28 are removed thereby allowing the upper jaws 24a-b to be pivoted upwardly thereby allowing the upper shaft 30 to be removed.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As best shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 of the drawings, the upper shaft 30 is approximately the width of the loader bucket 16.
      <br/>
      The upper shaft 30 is preferably tubular for decreasing the overall weight of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The upper shaft 30 may also have any well-known cross-sectional area such as circular or rectangular.
      <br/>
      The upper shaft 30 is removably retained between the locked upper jaws 24a-b and lower jaws 22a-b as best shown in FIG. 1 of the drawings thereby preventing removal of the upper shaft 30 from the loader bucket 16.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      As best shown in FIGS. 1, 5, and 7 of the drawings, a pair of side arms 32a-b are rotatably attached to opposing ends of the upper shaft 30.
      <br/>
      A pair of bearings or other structure may be utilized within the side arms 32a-b for allowing rotation about the upper shaft 30 without significant wearing upon the pair of side arms 32a-b and the upper shaft 30.
      <br/>
      The pair of side arms 32a-b are attached to the upper shaft 30 by conventional means for preventing movement upon the longitudinal axis of the upper shaft 30.
      <br/>
      The pair of side arms 32a-b have a length approximately the same as the upper side edge of the loader bucket 16.
      <br/>
      The pair of side arms 32a-b rest upon the side edges and/or the front edge of the loader bucket 16.
      <br/>
      It can be appreciated that a conventional attachment means can be utilized for securing the pair of side arms 32a-b if desired.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      As best shown in FIG. 5 and 7 of the drawings, a lower shaft 60 is rotatably attached to the lower distal ends of the side arms 32a-b.
      <br/>
      The lower shaft 60 is preferably positioned adjacent a portion of the front edge of the loader bucket 16 and extends a finite distance above the front edge of the loader bucket 16 thereby preventing material from escaping the loader bucket 16 such as a rock 18.
      <br/>
      The lower shaft 60 is approximately the same length as the upper shaft 30.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      As best shown in FIGS. 2, 3, 5 and 7 of the drawings, a pair of leverage arms 50a-b are attached to the outer portions of the lower shaft 60.
      <br/>
      The leverage arms 50a-b preferably have a U-shaped structure as best shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      A pair of hydraulic cylinders 40a-b or other actuators, are mechanically connected between the upper shaft 30 and the leverage arms 50a-b for allowing manipulation of the lower shaft 60.
      <br/>
      The hydraulic cylinders 40a-b may also be attached to the side arms 32a-b instead of the upper shaft 30 as can be appreciated.
      <br/>
      The hydraulic cylinders 40a-b are fluidly connected to the hydraulic system of the tractor 12 which is well-known and will not be discussed.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      As best shown in FIG. 7 of the drawings, a plurality of teeth 70 are removably attached about the lower shaft 60 parallel to one another.
      <br/>
      Each of the plurality of teeth 70 preferably have a tapered structure having a narrow end 74 at the distal portion.
      <br/>
      Each of the teach includes a spacer member 76 for allowing proper spacing between the teeth 70.
      <br/>
      An attachment aperture 72 extends through the broad portion of each of the teeth 70 for being positionable about the lower shaft 60.
      <br/>
      The attachment aperture 72 preferably has a rectangular shape that corresponds to the cross-section of the lower shaft 60 for preventing rotation of the teeth 70 about the lower shaft 60.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In use, the user operates the tractor 12 within the field as normal.
      <br/>
      The user approaches a rock 18 with the teeth 70 substantially in a horizontal position.
      <br/>
      The use moves the tractor 12 forward so that the rock 18 is elevated upon the teeth 70 as shown in FIG. 1 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      The user then actuates the hydraulics within the tractor 12 for manipulating the hydraulic cylinders 40a-b thereby rotating the teeth 70 and the rock 18 toward the interior of the loader bucket 16 as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      After the rock 18 is manipulated into the interior of the loader bucket 16, the user lowers the teeth 70 so that they are parallel to or angled into the ground surface as shown in FIG. 1 of the drawing.
      <br/>
      This process continues until the user has a full load within the loader bucket 16.
      <br/>
      The user then may deposit the material into a trailer, truck or upon a rock pile.
      <br/>
      To deposit the rock 18, the user simply elevates the bucket and tilts the loader bucket 16 so that the rock 18 within is forced toward the front edge of the loader bucket 16.
      <br/>
      The pair of side arms 32a-b and lower shaft 60 are generally pivoted upon the upper shaft 30 thereby allowing the rock 18 within to easily pass from the loader bucket 16 over the front edge.
      <br/>
      After the loader bucket 16 is emptied, the user returns the loader bucket 16 to its original position thereby causing the side arms 32a-b to be positioned adjacent the upper edge of the loader bucket 16.
      <br/>
      The user is then free to continue picking rocks 18 as stated above.
      <br/>
      If the user requires use of the loader bucket 16 without the present invention, such as for removing a large rock 18, the user simply removes the pins from the jaws 22a-b, 24a-b thereby allowing easy removal of the invention without the assistance of another.
      <br/>
      When finished, the user then repositions the upper shaft 30 within the jaws 22a-b, 24a-b and then inserts the locking pin 28 into each locking aperture 26.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      As to a further discussion of the manner of usage and operation of the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above description.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of usage and operation will be provided.
    </p>
    <p num="39">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</p>
    <p num="40">
      Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention.
      <br/>
      Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.
