    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to an ethylene copolymer composition.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention relates to an ethylene copolymer composition comprising an ethylene/ ALPHA -olefin copolymer and other polyolefins, and to an ethylene copolymer composition comprising two kinds of ethylene/ ALPHA -olefin copolymers and other polyolefins.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Ethylene copolymers have heretofore been molded by various molding methods, and used in many fields.
      <br/>
      The requirement for the characteristics of the ethylene copolymers differs depending on the molding methods and uses.
      <br/>
      For example, when an inflation film is molded at a high speed, it is necessary to select an ethylene copolymer having a high melt tension compared with its molecular weight in order to stably conduct high speed molding without fluctuation or tearing of bubbles.
      <br/>
      An ethylene copolymer is required to have similar characteristics in order to prevent sag or tearing in blow molding, or to suppress width shortage to the minimum range in T-die molding.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      By the way, low density polyethylene obtained by high pressure radical method is applyed to the use of films and hollow containers due to the high melt tension thereof compared with ethylene copolymers produced by using Ziegler type catalyst.
      <br/>
      However, the low density polyethylene obtained by the high pressure radical method is poor in mechanical properties such as tensile strength, tear strength and impact strength, and further is low in heat resistance and stress cracking resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="5">In contrast, Japanese Patent L-O-P Nos. 90810/1981 and 106806/1985 propose a method for improving moldability by improving the melt tension and die swell ratio of ethylene polymers obtained by using Ziegler type catalysts, especially a titanium type catalyst.</p>
    <p num="6">The ethylene polymers obtained by using a titanium catalyst, however, especially the low density ethylene polymers generally have problems such as their broad composition distribution and stickiness of their molded articles such as films.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Of the ethylene polymers prepared by using the Ziegler type catalysts, those obtained by using chromium type catalysts are relatively excellent in melt tension but has a defect of poor heat stability.
      <br/>
      This is thought to be caused by that the chain terminals of the ethylene polymers prepared by using the chromium type catalysts tend to become unsaturated bonds.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      It is known that the ethylene polymers obtained by using a metallocene catalyst from among the Ziegler type catalysts have merits such as a narrow composition distribution and a low stickiness of their molded articles such as films.
      <br/>
      However, it is described in, for example Japanese Patent L-O-P.
      <br/>
      No. 35007/1985, that an ethylene polymer obtained by using a zirconocene compound formed from a cyclopentadienyl derivative contains one terminal unsaturated bond per molecule, and hence this ethylene polymer is presumably poor in heat stability similarly to the above-mentioned ethylene polymer obtained by using the chromium type catalyst.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Accordingly, it will industrially be of great value to provide an ethylene copolymer having good heat stability, high mechanical strength and a narrow composition distribution.</p>
    <p num="10">
      By the way, ethylene copolymers generally have no polar group in the molecule and inherently non-polar, so that they are insufficient in adhesion strength to highly polar materials such as metals and polar resins.
      <br/>
      For these reasons, when such ethylene copolymers are used by bonding them with the highly polar materials, it is necessary to subject the surface of the ethylene copolymer to a flame treatment, a corona discharge treatment, a primer treatment or the like, and hence resulting in a problem of complicated operation.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Accordingly, it will also industrially be of great value to provide an ethylene copolymer composition, which has high melt tension, good heat stability and high mechanical strength and shows sufficient adhesion strength to highly polar materials.</p>
    <heading>OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an ethylene copolymer composition of good moldability which is capable for giving a film having higher transparency and mechanical strength, and to provide an ethylene copolymer composition having good moldability and excellent transparency which is capable for giving a film having high adhesion strength to highly polar materials.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <p num="56">The composition of an ethylene/ ALPHA -olefin copolymer is generally determined by 13 C-NMR spectrum analysis of a sample prepared by homogeneously dissolving about 200 mg of the copolymer in 1 ml of hexachlorobutadiene in a sample tube having a diameter of 10 mm under the conditions of a measuring temperature of 120 (degree)  C., a measuring frequency of 25.05 MHz, a spectrum width of 1,500 Hz, a pulse repetition period of 4.2 sec and a pulse width of 6 gsec.</p>

    <p num="66">An ethylene/ ALPHA -olefin copolymer having such properties shows good moldability because of high melt tension (MT).</p>
    <p num="67">
      The melt tension (MT (g)) is determined by measuring a stress given when a molten copolymer is stretched at a constant rate.
      <br/>
      That is, a powdery polymer was melted in a conventional manner, and the molten polymer was pelletized to give a measuring sample.
      <br/>
      Then, the MT of the sample was measured under the conditions of a resin temperature of 190 (degree)  C., an extrusion rate of 15 mm/min and a take-up rate of 10 to 20 m/min using a MT measuring apparatus (produced by Toyo Seiki Seisakusho K.K.) having a nozzle diameter of 2.09 mm PHI  and a nozzle length of 8 mm.

      The flow index (FI) is determined by extruding a resin from a capillary while changing a shear rate and measuring the shear rate given when the shear stress reaches the above-mentioned value.
      <br/>
      In this measurement, the same sample as described in the above-mentioned MT measurement is used, and the FI is measured under the conditions of a resin temperature of 190 (degree)  C. and a shear stress of about 5 * 104 to 3 * 106 dyne/cm2 using a capillary type flow property tester produced by Toyo Seiki Seisakusho K.K.

In the mobile phase, 0.025% by weight of BHT (available from Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was contained as an antioxidant.

    <p num="372">The present invention is further described below with reference to examples, but it should be construed that the present invention is in no way limited to those examples.</p>
    <p num="373">In the invention, physical properties of films were evaluated in the following manner.</p>
    <p num="374">Haze</p>
    <p num="375">The haze was measured in accordance with ASTM-D-1003-61.</p>

      In the case of a graft modified ethylene/ ALPHA -olefin copolymer composition, a pressed sheet having a thickness of 0.5 mm was prepared from the composition and the pressed sheet was measured on the haze in accordance with ASTM-D-1003-61.
      <br/>
      In order to avoid an influence of the sheet surface on the measured value, the haze, namely, internal haze, was measured in the state where the pressed sheet was immersed in an optical cell made of quartz filled with benzyl alcohol.

    <p num="379">Film impact</p>
    <p num="380">The film impact was measured by means of a pendulum type film impact tester produced by Toyo Seiki Seisakusho K.K.</p>
    <p num="381">Tensile test</p>
    <p num="382">A specimen was punched using a dumbbell (JIS No.1) from the film in the machine direction (MD) or the transverse direction (TD) toward the film molding direction, and a modulus in tension (YM) and an elongation at break (EL) of the specimen were measured under the conditions of a distance between chucks of 86 mm and a cross head speed of 200 mm/min.</p>
    <p num="383">Adhesion strength</p>
    <p num="384">
      A pressed sheet of a composition containing modified polyethylene having a thickness of 100  MU m was used as a sample.
      <br/>
      The sample was heat sealed with two kinds of adherends respectively and was measured on the peel strength to evaluate the adhesion strength.
      <br/>
      One adherend is an aluminum foil having a thickness of 0.5 mm, and the other adherend is a 6-nylon sheet having a thickness of 1.0 mm. The heat sealing between the pressed sheet and the adherend was conducted using a heat sealer under the conditions of a temperature of 200 (degree)  C., a load of 1 kg/cm2 and a period of 60 sec.
      <br/>
      After the heat sealing, the pressed sheet with the adherend was cut to give a specimen having a width of 25 mm and a length of 150 mm.
      <br/>
      The adhesion strength between the two layers (the modified polyethylene composition layer and the adherend layer) of the specimen was measured by peeling the adherend layer in the direction of 180 (degree)  against the modified polymer layer at a peel rate of 200 mm/min.

      The resultant mixture was subjected to prepolymerization with ethylene at 35 (degree)  C. for 12 hours to obtain a prepolymerized catalyst in which polyethylene was prepolymerized in an amount of 10 g per 1 g of the solid catalyst.

      A 2-liter stainless autoclave thoroughly purged with nitrogen was charged with 150 g of sodium chloride (special grade, available from Wako Junyaku K.K.), followed by drying at 90 (degree)  C. for 1 hour under a reduced pressure.
      <br/>
      Then, into the autoclave was introduced a mixed gas consisting of ethylene, 1-butene and hydrogen (1-butene content: 3.0% by mol, hydrogen content: 0.012% by mol) to recover the pressure in the system to atmospheric pressure, and the temperature of the system was set to 70 (degree)  C.

    <p num="394">
      Thereafter, a mixed gas having the same composition as described above was introduced into the autoclave to initiate polymerization at the total pressure of 8 kg/cm2 -G.
      <br/>
      The temperature in the system immediately rose to 80 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="395">Then, only the mixed gas was supplied to keep the total pressure at 8 kg/cm2 -G, and polymerization was further conducted at 80 (degree)  C. for 1.5 hours.</p>
    <p num="396">After the polymerization was completed, the reaction product was washed with water to remove sodium chloride.</p>
    <p num="397">
      Then, the remaining polymer was washed with methanol and dried at 80 (degree)  C. overnight under a reduced pressure.

      To the reaction system were dropwise added 6.6 liters of a toluene solution of bis(1,3-n-butylmethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride (Zr: 34.0 mmol/l) and 2.0 liters of a toluene solution of bis(1,3-dimethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride (Zr: 28.1 mmol/l) at 80 (degree)  C. over a period of 30 minutes, and the reaction was further carried out at 80 (degree)  C. for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      Then, the supernatant liquid was removed, and the residue was washed twice with hexane to obtain a solid catalyst containing zirconium in an amount of 3.6 mg per 1 g of the solid catalyst.
    </p>
    <p num="469">�Preparation of a prepolymerized catalyst�</p>
    <p num="470">
      To 85 liters of hexane containing 1.7 mol of triisobutylaluminum were added 0.85 kg of the solid catalyst obtained above and 255 g of 1-hexene.
      <br/>
      The resultant mixture was subjected to prepolymerization with ethylene at 35 (degree)  C. for 12 hours to obtain a prepolymerized catalyst in which polyethylene was prepolymerized in an amount of 10 g per 1 g of the solid catalyst.
      <br/>
      This ethylene polymer had an intrinsic viscosity � ETA � of 1.74 dl/g.

    <p num="471">�Polymerization�</p>
    <p num="472">In a fluidized bed gas phase polymerizer of continuous type, ethylene was copolymerized with 1-hexene at the total pressure of 20 kg/cm2 -G and a polymerization temperature of 80 (degree)  C. To the polymerizer were continuously fed the prepolymerized catalyst prepared above at a feed rate of 0.18 mmol/hr in terms of zirconium atom and triisobutylaluminum at a feed rate of 10 mmol/hr while continuously feeding ethylene, 1-hexene, hydrogen and nitrogen to maintain a constant gas composition (gas composition: 1-hexene/ethylene=0.030, hydrogen/ethylene=4.1 * 10-4, ethylene concentration=23%) during the polymerization.</p>
    <p num="473">Thus, an ethylene/1-hexene copolymer (A-6) was obtained in an amount of 5.6 kg/hr. The copolymer had MFR of 1.4 g/10 min, a density of 0.924 g/cm3 and a decane-soluble portion quantity at room temperature of 0.08% by weight.</p>

To the polymerizer were continuously fed the prepolymerized catalyst prepared in Preparation Example 4 at a feed rate of 0.18 mmol/hr in terms of zirconium atom and triisobutylaluminum at a feed rate of 10 mmol/hr while continuously feeding ethylene, 1-hexene, hydrogen and nitrogen to maintain a constant gas composition (gas composition: 1-hexene/ethylene=0.030, hydrogen/ethylene=5.5 * 10-4, ethylene concentration=25%) during the polymerization.</p>
    <p num="521">Thus, an ethylene/1-hexene copolymer (A-7) was obtained in an amount of 6.0 kg/hr. The copolymer had MFR of 2.1 g/10 min, and a density of 0.923 g/cm3.</p>

    <p num="525">750 g of the polyethylene (prepared by polymerizing ethylene by using commercially available titanium catalyst, density: 0.965 g/cm3, MFR: 15.0 g/10 min) was dissolved at 160 (degree)  C. in 5.7 liters of toluene as a reaction solvent.</p>
    <p num="526">Then, to the resultant solution were slowly added a toluene solution of maleic anhydride (44.1 g/250 ml) and a toluene solution of dicumyl peroxide (DCP) (3.6 g/50 ml) over a period of 4 hours through different conduits.</p>
    <p num="527">
      After the addition was completed, the reaction was further continued for 30 minutes at 160 (degree)  C. Then, the temperature of the system was cooled to room temperature to precipitate a polymer.
      <br/>
      The precipitated polymer was filtered, then repeatedly washed with acetone and dried at 80 (degree)  C. for one day and night under a reduced pressure, to obtain an aimed modified polyethylene (B-9).
    </p>
    <p num="528">
      The modified polyethylene (B-9) was subjected to elemental analysis to determine the graft amount of the maleic anhydride.
      <br/>
      As a result, in the modified polyethylene, maleic anhydride was graft polymerized in an amount of 2.3 g per 100 g of the modified polyethylene.
      <br/>
      Further, the modified polyethylene had a density of 0.965 g/cm3 and MFR of 4.1 g/10 min.

    <p num="533">�Molding of a pressed sheet�</p>
    <p num="534">
      The ethylene type copolymer composition was heated at 200 (degree)  C. for 10 minutes by a press molding machine.

      Then, the copolymer was held under a pressure of 100 kg/cm2 for 3 minutes and was further held under a pressure of 100 kg/cm2 for 5 minutes using a cooled pressing machine of 20 (degree)  C. to mold the copolymer composition into a pressed sheet.

    <p num="536">
      As is evident from the results set forth in Table 10, the composition has a good transparency and shows a high moldability owing to high melt tension.

    <p num="541">In a fluidized bed gas phase polymerizer of continuous type, ethylene was copolymerized with 1-hexene at the total pressure of 20 kg/cm2 -G and a polymerization temperature of 70 (degree)  C. To the polymerizer were continuously fed the prepolymerized catalyst prepared in Preparation Example 4 at a feed rate of 0.18 mmol/hr in terms of zirconium atom and triisobutylaluminum at a feed rate of 10 mmol/hr while continuously feeding ethylene, 1-hexene, hydrogen and nitrogen to maintain a constant gas composition (gas composition: 1-hexene/ethylene 0.032, hydrogen/ethylene=4.5 * 10-4, ethylene concentration=25%) during the polymerization.</p>
    <p num="542">Thus, an ethylene/1-hexene copolymer (A-8) was obtained in an amount of 6.3 kg/hr. The copolymer had MFR of 0.40 g/10 min, a density of 0.908 g/cm3 and a decane-soluble portion quantity at room temperature of 0.54% by weight.</p>

      The pressed sheet was measured on various properties such as transparency and adhesion strength to an aluminum foil or to a 6-nylon sheet.
      <br/>
      The results are set forth in Table 15.
    </p>
    <p num="595">
      As is evident from the results set forth in Table 15, the composition has a good transparency and shows a high moldability owing to high melt tension and high flow index.
      <br/>
      Further, the composition is excellent in the adhesion strength to highly polar materials such as aluminum and nylon.
