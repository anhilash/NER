      A method for preparing 1,2-dihydroquinolines that is more flexible than the Skraup reaction is provided.
      <br/>
      The method comprises treating an ortho-alkenyl aniline with a ketone in the presence of a Lewis acid.
      <br/>
      Novel intermediates and products of this method useful as steroid receptor modulators, as well as pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use thereof are also claimed.

      The conversion of 5 to 7 utilizing a Skraup reaction limits the variety of compounds that can be prepared by this route due to the need to use a ketone (6) as one of the reaction partners; the substituents on C(2)-C(4) cannot be varied independently.
      <br/>
      The present invention addresses this limiting aspect of the Skraup reaction.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">The present invention provides a novel route for the conversion of anilines 5 to 1,2-dihydroquinolines 12 (the set of compounds represented by general structure 7 being recognized as a subset of the set of compounds represented by general structure 12) in which the substituents on C(2)-C(4) can be varied independently:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="7">
      First the carbon atom flanked by the aniline nitrogen and lactone carbonyl is functionalized with a halogen atom, forming a compound of structure 8.
      <br/>
      Performing a cross-coupling reaction of 8 (or an N-protected analogue of 8) with an approximately substituted metalated olefin 9 affords an ortho-alkenyl aniline 10, by a process known as a Stille, Suzuki, or Negishi coupling. +See for example: "Coupling Reactions Between sp2 Carbon Centers", D.

    <p num="17">In an optional second step, the nitrogen atom of the ortho-haloaniline may be protected, especially as an N-trimethylsilyl or as an N-trifluoroacetyl analogue:  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)</p>

    <p num="19">
      In a subsequent step, an ortho-haloaniline 8 or N-protected ortho-haloaniline 13 is treated with a metallated olefin 9, especially 2-(tributylstannyl)propene or 1-methoxy-1-ethenylboronic acid, in the presence of a catalyst or catalysts, especially tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (O) or palladium acetate/tri(2-furyl)phosphine/copper(I) iodide, to afford an ortho-alkenylaniline.

    <p num="21">In the final step of this novel process, an aniline 10 is treated with a ketone 11, especially acetone, cyclohexanone or 3-pentanone, in the presence of a catalyst, especially camphor sulfonic acid, boron trifluoride etherate or lanthanum tris(trifluoromethanesulfonate), to afford the 1,2-dihydroquinoline 12:  (Chemical Structure image '8' not included in text)</p>

    <p num="23">
      In a more general sense, an optionally substituted aniline (with hydrogen at an ortho position) can be halogenated to form an ortho-haloaniline that is subsequently treated with a metallated olefin in the presence of a catalyst or catalysts to form an ortho-alkenyl aniline of structure 14 (wherein: R16 and R17 have the definitions detailed above; and R20-23 independently represent H, C1 -C6 alkyl, substituted C1 -C6 alkyl, F, Cl, Br, I, CN, CF3, CF2 CF3, CO2 R7, CONR7 R8 (where R7 and R8 have the definitions detailed above), allyl, substituted allyl, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl or substituted heteroaryl; or where R20 and R21 OR R21 and R22 OR R22 and R23 taken together form a five- to seven-membered ring).

      The ortho-alkenyl aniline of structure 14 may be converted to an optionally substituted 2,2-disubstituted 1,2-dihydroquinoline by treatment of 14 with a ketone 11 (wherein R18 and R19 have the definitions detailed above, especially acetone, cyclohexanone, 3-pentanone or an optionally substituted acetophenone) and a Lewis acid (especially boron trifluoride etherate, lanthanum tris(trifluoromethanesulfonate) or chlorotitanium triisopropoxide) to afford the 1,2-dihydroquinoline 15.

      The progesterone receptor (PR) modulator compounds of the present invention are particularly useful for hormone replacement therapy and as modulators of fertility (e.g., as contraceptives, contragestational agents or abortifacients), either alone or in conjunction with estrogen receptor (ER) modulators.

      The PR active compounds are also useful in pregnancy maintenance therapy; the treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, leiomyomas (uterine fibroids), mood disorders and cardiovascular disease; treating tumors of the central nervous system, such as meningiomas; as well as treating various hormone-dependent cancers, including, without limitation, cancers of the breast, ovaries, endometrium and prostate. +See for example: "Preparation of Quinolines and Fused Quinolines as Steroid Receptor Modulators", T.

    <p num="34">
      It will be understood by those skilled in the art that, while the compounds of the present invention will typically be employed as selective agonists, partial agonists or antagonists, there may be instances where a compound with a mixed steroid receptor profile is preferred, including, without limitation, mixed PR/AR, PR/MR or PR/GR modulators.
      <br/>
      For example, use of a PR agonist (i.e., progestin) in female contraception often leads to the undesired effects of increased water retention and acne flare-ups.
      <br/>
      In this instance, a compound that is primarily a PR agonist, but also displays some androgen receptor (AR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist activity, may prove useful.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the mixed MR effects would be useful to control water balance in the body, while the AR effects would help to control any acne flare-ups that occur.

    <p num="38">
      In preparing the pharmaceutical compositions or compounds in oral liquid dosage forms (e.g., suspensions, elixirs and solutions), typical pharmaceutical media such as water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like can be employed.
      <br/>
      Similarly when preparing oral solid dosage forms (e.g., powders, tablets and capsules), carriers such as starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like will be employed.
      <br/>
      Due to their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage form for the pharmaceutical compositions or compounds of the present invention.

      For parenteral administration the carrier will typically comprise sterile water, although other ingredients that aid in solubility or serve as preservatives may also be included.

      The compounds of this invention also have utility when radio- or isotopically-labelled as ligands for use in assays to determine the presence of steroid receptors in a cell background or extract.

    <p num="45">
      Due to the selective specificity of many of the compounds of this invention for PR, these compounds can be used to purify samples of PR in vitro.

      In a 25-mL over-dried 2-neck flask under N2 was combined 2-isopropenylaniline (0.500 mL, 3.67 mmol), acetophenone (0.860 mL, 7.34 mmol, 2.0 eq), and anhydrous toluene (10 mL).
      <br/>
      The suspension was heated to reflux, and BF3 * Et2 O (0.090 mL, 0.04 mmol, 0.20 eq) was added under positive pressure of N2.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was stirred at reflux 3 h, until TLC indicated consumption of the starting material.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was cooled to rt and poured onto Et2 O (40 mL) and saturated sodium bicarbonate (30 mL).
      <br/>
      The aqueous layer was extracted with Et2 O (3 * 10 mL), and the combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried (Na2 SO4), filtered, and concentrated.
      <br/>
      Purification by silica gel chromatography (hexanes: Et2 O, 70:1) afforded 421 mg (49%) of 25 as a crystalline white solid.
      <br/>
