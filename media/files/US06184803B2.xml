    <p num="11">
      The twelve button touch-tone telephone keypad arrangement and twelve pairs of tones produced by independently depressing any one of the twelve buttons have become the standard throughout the world.
      <br/>
      Since the advent of the twelve key push-button telephone arrangement, many have tried to produce alphanumeric text and control means using only twelve buttons.
      <br/>
      This patent application is a continuation of a provisional patent application I filed on the 8th day of April, 1997, entitled "ALPHANUMERIC TELEPHONY KEYPAD DATA ENTRY METHOD" which is shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B. The alphabetic code, excluding punctuation, shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, I invented in August of 1972.
      <br/>
      Since 1972, I have never disclosed this invention to anyone.
      <br/>
      This application is the completion of the development of my computer access telephonic code for communicating on any standard twelve button telephone keypad.
      <br/>
      In the telephony industry, the twelve key (four high/three wide) push-button telephone keypad arrangement with twenty-four letters of the alphabet, excluding the "Q" and "Z", arranged in groups of threes, located on the faces of the keys numbered two "2" through nine "9", has become the world standard.
      <br/>
      The actuation of any one of the twelve keys, produces an analog, dual tone multifrequency signal (DTMF), which is a combination of two analog voice frequency tones.
      <br/>
      The telephone system hardware then converts the analog DTMF tones into a digital signal for processing, digital phones being the exception.
      <br/>
      In the past, the "Q" and "Z" have been located on the face of the keys in a few different locations.
      <br/>
      The most common way in the past, is where the "Q" and "Z" are located on the "1" key.
      <br/>
      Usually the "Q" and "Z" are located next to each other above the "1".

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="27">
      This invention uses the standard twelve key push-button phone keypad arrangement to produce full alphanumeric text, including a space, punctuation, symbols and control.
      <br/>
      The difference in the present invention is the telephone keypad labeling, where the letters "Q" and "Z" are represented or located on the number "1" key, with a "space" positioned between the "Q" and "Z".
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Numbers are produced by using the standard one button actuation while in the numeric mode.
      <br/>
      To produce the one-time use dash "--" between numbers, found in phone numbers, the left star "*" key is actuated simultaneously with or followed by the actuation of the right pound "-" key, which then returns the phone apparatus automatically to the numeric mode.
      <br/>
      To backspace while in the numeric mode, the right pound "-" key is actuated once.
      <br/>
      To delete all previously entered numeric data while in the numeric mode, the right pound "-" key is actuated, followed by the secondary actuation of the right pound "-" key.
      <br/>
      Actuation of the right pound "-" key three times, while in the numeric mode, produces the "ENTER/RETURN/SEND" function.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      When the left star "*" key is depressed once while in the numeric mode, the phone or apparatus enters a continuous upper-case alphabetic mode to produce a letter of the alphabet or a space.
      <br/>
      Depressing the key with the desired alphabetical data shown in FIG. 3, in simultaneous combination with or followed by the left star "*" key for the left position data, the middle zero "0" key for the center position data, or the right pound "-" key for the right position data produces the desired alphabetic data, which is shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B. Actuating the left star "*" key twice while in the numeric mode, enters a lower-case and upper-case alphabetic mode, where secondary actuation of the second key actuated to produce a lower-case letter, produces an upper-case letter, which is shown in FIGS. 6A through 6D.
      <br/>
      Actuation of the middle zero "0" key, while in the alphabetic mode, followed by the secondary actuation of the middle zero "0" key, produces a space.
      <br/>
      Actuation of the middle zero "0" key three times successively, while in the alphabetic mode, produces the "TAB" function.
      <br/>
      Actuation of the left star "*" key, while in the alphabetic mode, followed by the secondary actuation of the left star "*" key, deletes the previously entered alphabetic or punctuation bit of data, otherwise known as the backspace.
      <br/>
      Actuation of the left star "*" key three times successively, while in the alphabetic mode, deletes the previously entered word.
      <br/>
      Actuation of the left star "*" key, while in the alphabetic mode, simultaneously with or followed by the actuation of the middle zero "0" key, produces a period ".". Actuation of the left star "*" key, while in the alphabetic mode, simultaneously with or followed by the actuation of the right pound "-" key, enters a one-time use punctuation mode, which is then followed by the desired punctuation data representation on one of the ten keys numbered one "1" through zero "0", where the "1" key produces a question mark "?", where the "2" key produces a comma ",", where the "3" key produces an exclamation mark "�", where the "4" key produces an open quote """, where the "5" key produces an apostrophe "'", where the "6" key produces a closed quote """, where the "7" key produces an open parenthesis "(", where the "8" key produces a semi-colon ";", where the "9" key produces a closed parenthesis ")"; where the "0" key produces a colon ":".
      <br/>
      After the actuation of the numbered punctuation key, the keyboard automatically returns to the previous alphabetic mode.
      <br/>
      Actuation of the right pound "-" key simultaneously with or followed by the actuation of the middle zero "0", key while in the alphabetic mode, returns the keyboard to the numeric mode.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="31">
      In the telephone industry, it is well known that the depression of any given button on a standard twelve button telephone keypad generates one of twelve pairs of audio tones on the "touch tone" phone, or its digital data counterpart on a digital phone.
      <br/>
      This invention takes advantage of the customary arrangement of the markings on the face of the standard push-button telephone keypad.
      <br/>
      When one button is depressed, it produces the numerical value of the key depressed (except for the left star "*" key and the pound "-" key).
      <br/>
      When the left star "*" key is depressed once, the phone or apparatus enters a continuous upper-case alphabetic mode to produce the letters of the alphabet or a space.
      <br/>
      Depressing the key with the desired alphabetical data shown in FIG. 3, in simultaneous combination with or followed by the left star "*" key for the left position data, the middle zero "0" key for the center position data, or the right pound "-" key for the right position data produces the desired alphabetic data, which is shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B. Actuating the left star "*" key twice enters a lower-case and upper-case alphabetic mode, where secondary actuation of the second key actuated to produce a lower-case letter, produces an upper-case letter, which is shown in FIGS. 6A through 6D.
    </p>
    <p num="32">The present invention includes:</p>
    <p num="33">A nine key alphanumeric binary keyboard for entering alphanumeric data including a space, comprising nine keys, numbered one "1" through nine "9", combined with a three key binary control keyboard, preferably comprising the left star "*" key, the middle zero "0" key, and the right pound "-" key.</p>
