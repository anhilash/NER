      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">In optical wavelength-division multiplexing communication it is necessary to control both wavelength and level of each transmitted signal light in order to receive a transmitted optical signal in an optimal condition on the receiving side.</p>
    <p num="3">Furthermore, recently relay distances have been increased by installing repeaters with optical amplifiers in a transmission path between terminal stations.</p>
    <p num="4">The present invention relates to both wavelength control and level control of terminal equipment in a communication system configuration having a repeater with such an optical amplifier.</p>
    <p num="5">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="6">FIGS. 1A and 1B show the pre-emphasis (explained below) in the case where wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) transmission is made by connecting a plurality of optical amplifiers in series, and the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) after transmission.</p>
    <p num="7">In FIGS. 1A and 1B,  LAMBDA 1 to  LAMBDA 8 represent the wavelengths of the signal lights of an optical signal, and the heights of the wavelengths of the signal lights  LAMBDA 1 to  LAMBDA 8 represent the strength of each signal light.</p>
    <p num="8">In FIGS. 1A and 1B, an optical signal comprises a plurality of signal lights of different wavelengths, represented by  LAMBDA 1 to  LAMBDA 8.</p>
    <p num="9">In a transmission path 1 optical amplifiers 2-1 to 2-n used as repeaters are shown.</p>
    <p num="10">FIG. 1A shows the gain characteristic of the transmission path 1, in which the losses of optical amplifiers 2-1 to 2-n in the transmission path 1 and the transmission path itself are totaled, and the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) for each signal light, being a ratio in terms of the electric power of the signal light to that of the noise light.</p>
    <p num="11">When signal lights  LAMBDA 1 to  LAMBDA 8 with the same level are transmitted from the transmitting side, differences in levels occur between the signal lights due to the gain characteristic of the transmission path 1.</p>
    <p num="12">For this reason, as shown in FIG. 1B, to compensate for the gain characteristic of an optical repeater in the transmission path, the level of each signal light is changed on the transmitting side, by which the fluctuation in OSNR is suppressed when the signal lights are received.</p>
    <p num="13">This technology is called pre-emphasis, and is widely used.</p>
    <p num="14">The pre-emphasis shown in FIG. 1B is adjusted and fixed in the initial stages of the operation of a system.</p>
    <p num="15">However, the level of light input to the optical amplifiers 2-1 to 2-n fluctuates, and the gain of the entire transmission path 1 changes due to a fluctuation of the losses in the transmission path 1 during the operation of a system, caused by such as the insertion in the transmission path 1 of a new cable for the repair of a failed section, the insertion in the transmission path 1 of a repeater, the deterioration with the lapse of time of an optical fiber in the transmission path 1, etc., and the gain also changes due to the deterioration with the lapse of time of the optical amplifiers 2-1 to 2-n.</p>
    <p num="16">As a result, the gain characteristic of the entire transmission path changes, and the fluctuation of the OSNR cannot be compensated for by a fixed pre-emphasis method.</p>
    <p num="17">FIGS. 2A to 2C show the concept of a spectrum change of the signal lights with the lapse of time, and FIGS. 3A to 3C show the experiment results of the spectrum change of the signal lights with the lapse of time.</p>
    <p num="18">FIGS. 2A and 3A, FIGS. 2B and 3B, and FIGS. 2C and 3C show the original condition, after the lapse of a certain time, and after the lapse of a further certain time, respectively.</p>
    <p num="19">As shown in FIGS. 2A to 2C and FIGS. 3A to 3C, the fluctuation of the OSNR of each signal light increases as time elapses.</p>
    <p num="20">Particularly, this becomes a serious problem in the case of a submarine cable system used for long distance transmission.</p>
    <p num="21">As means to solve a problem like this, a technology with which the pre-emphasis can be changed on the transmitting side based on the spectrum of the receiving side, is shown in Laid-open Patent Publication No.8-321824.</p>
    <p num="22">More specifically, the spectrum of the wavelengths of each of the signal lights is measured in a receiving terminal station, the result of the measurement is overlaid on an optical signal or transmitted by being put in the vacant area of a header of the synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH), etc. to the transmitting terminal station using a downward line, and the amount of pre-emphasis is measured in the transmitting terminal station.</p>
    <p num="23">Although it is necessary to control the pre-emphasis in order to improve the OSNR on the receiving side, the gain fluctuation of the transmission path caused by the fluctuation of the losses due to the insertion in the transmission path of a new cable or the deterioration with the lapse of time, cannot be coped with by a fixed pre-emphasis method.</p>
    <p num="24">Although there is a technology to automatically control the pre-emphasis in the transmitting terminal station based on spectrum information sent from the receiving terminal, in order to cope with this situation, in this technology attention is paid only to the pre-emphasis control.</p>
    <p num="25">Although it is necessary to adjust the pre-emphasis in order to improve the OSNR of the wavelength-division multiplexed signal lights sent from the transmitting terminal station, both the wavelengths and output levels of the signal lights of the optical signal vary depending on both temperature and driving current value, since a signal light for each wavelength of the optical signal from the transmitting terminal station is output by a laser.</p>
    <p num="26">Particularly, when the high density of wavelength-division multiplexing is increased (the frequency of multiplexing), and it becomes necessary to strictly control the wavelength of each signal light, both wavelength fluctuation and level fluctuation occur if the pre-emphasis is controlled only based on information sent from the receiving terminal station.</p>

    <p num="30">Pre-emphasis can be controlled by comparing the spectrum measured in the transmitting terminal station with the spectrum measured in the receiving terminal station, and wavelengths can also be controlled based on the measured spectrum information.</p>
    <p num="31">In the wavelength-division multiplexing optical transmission system of another aspect of the present invention, where wavelength-division multiplexed optical signals are transmitted and received between a first terminal station and a second terminal station, the first terminal station is characterized in comprising a first optical spectrum analyzing unit for measuring the wavelength deviation of a signal light of each channel and the power level of a signal light for each wavelength of a wavelength-division multiplexed optical signal transmitted by the first terminal station, a wavelength adjusting unit for adjusting the wavelength of a signal light of a relevant channel if there is a deviation in wavelength, and a pre-emphasis unit for pre-emphasizing the power level of a signal light for each wavelength of a wavelength-division multiplexed optical signal transmitted by the first terminal station, when it is reported to the first terminal station from the second terminal station that the power level of a signal light for a wavelength of a wavelength-division multiplexed optical signal transmitted by the first terminal station is improper, whereas the second terminal station is characterized in comprising a second optical spectrum analyzing unit for measuring at least the power level of a signal light for each wavelength of a wavelength-division multiplexed optical signal transmitted by the first terminal station, and a transmitting unit for transmitting information on the power level of the signal light for each wavelength of a wavelength-division multiplexed optical signal transmitted by the first terminal station to the first terminal station.</p>
    <p num="32">In a wavelength-division multiplexing system for transmitting and receiving wavelength-division multiplexed optical signals between terminal stations, the terminal station is characterized in comprising a first optical spectrum analyzing unit for measuring the wavelength deviation of a signal light of each channel and the power level of a signal light for each wavelength of a wavelength-division multiplexed optical signal transmitted by the terminal station, a wavelength adjusting unit for adjusting the wavelength of a signal light of the relevant channel if there is a deviation in wavelength, and a pre-emphasis unit for pre-emphasizing the power level of a signal light for each wavelength of a wavelength-division multiplexed optical signal transmitted by the terminal station when it is reported to one terminal station from another terminal station that the power level of a signal light for a wavelength of a wavelength-division multiplexed optical signal transmitted by the terminal station is improper, a second optical spectrum analyzing unit for measuring at least the power level of a signal light for each wavelength of a wavelength-division multiplexed optical signal transmitted by the other terminal station, and a transmitting unit for transmitting information on the power level of a signal light for each wavelength of a wavelength-division multiplexed optical signal transmitted by the one terminal station to the other terminal station.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="37">The embodiments of the present invention are described below with reference to the attached drawings.</p>
    <p num="38">In FIG. 4, 1-1 and 1-2, 1-3, 3-1, 4-1, 5-1, and 6-2 represent optical fibers, a cable, an optical spectrum analyzer, a computer, a control signal transmitter, and a WDM signal transmitting device, respectively.</p>
    <p num="39">The fiber 1-1 transmits an optical signal comprising a plurality of signal lights from a transmitting terminal station to a receiving terminal station.</p>
    <p num="40">The optical spectrum analyzer 3-1 detects the received optical spectrum from the fiber 1-1.</p>
    <p num="41">The computer 4-1 calculates the optical spectrum value from the output of the optical spectrum analyzer 3-1, and transmits information based on the optical spectrum processing result to the transmitting terminal station, using the fiber 1-2.</p>
    <p num="42">This transmission can be implemented by writing the information in the overhead of a transmission signal, by amplitude-modulating a main signal with the information, by putting the information on a special wavelength used for control signal transmission, etc.</p>
    <p num="43">6-2 represents a WDM signal transmitting device for transmitting a transmission optical signal from the receiving terminal station to the transmitting terminal station.</p>
    <p num="44">FIG. 5 shows the structure of a control signal sent from a receiving terminal station to a transmitting terminal station.</p>
    <p num="45">The control signal is composed of address information corresponding to the transmitting terminal station name transmitting the control signal, and the control signal information.</p>
    <p num="46">It is because the control signal can be used in a complex network where many stations are inserted between a transmitting terminal station and a receiving terminal station that address information is attached.</p>
    <p num="47">FIGS. 6 and 7 show examples of the detailed configuration of a transmitting terminal station.</p>
    <p num="48">In FIGS. 6 and 7, the same components as in FIG. 4 are shown by the same reference number, and in addition to these, 6-1, 3-2, 4-2, 5-2 and 7-1 represent a WDM signal transmitting device, an optical spectrum analyzer, a computer, a control signal receiver and a WDM signal receiving device, respectively.</p>
    <p num="49">In FIG. 6, a control signal sent along the fiber 1-2 is received by the control signal receiver 5-2, and the spectrum of the signal lights input to the fiber 1-1 is detected by the optical spectrum analyzer 3-2.</p>
    <p num="50">The computer 4-2 compares the optical spectrum information of the signal lights on the receiving terminal station side received by the control signal receiver 5-2, with the optical information of the signal lights on the transmitting terminal station side detected by the optical spectrum analyzer 3-2, judges whether or not the readjustment of pre-emphasis is required according to established criteria, inputs both wavelength control signals and control signals for controlling the levels of the signal lights to be transmitted for pre-emphasis to the WDM signal transmitting device 6-1, and thereby controls both the wavelength and level of each signal light output to the fiber 1-1 by the WDM signal transmitting device 6-1.</p>
    <p num="51">FIG. 7 shows the configuration in the case where the control signal is received by the WDM signal receiving device 7-1 for receiving transmission signals sent from the WDM signal transmitting device on the receiving terminal station side, instead of the control signal receiver 5-2 shown in FIG. 6.</p>
    <p num="52">The configuration shown in FIG. 7 is very effective in extracting the control signal when the control signal is written in the overhead part of a frame of a transmission signal transmitted by the WDM signal transmitting device 6-2 shown in FIG. 4.</p>
    <p num="53">FIG. 8 shows the configuration of a WDM signal transmitting device and peripheral devices shown in FIGS. 6 and 7.</p>
    <p num="54">In the drawing 61-1 to 61-n, 62-1 to 62-n, 63-1 to 63-n, 65-1 to 65-n, and 64 represent laser control circuits, lasers, optical amplifiers, modulators, and a coupler, respectively.</p>
    <p num="55">In FIG. 8, the same components as in FIGS. 6 and 7 are represented by the same reference numbers.</p>
    <p num="56">The light emissions of the lasers 62-1 to 62-n are controlled by the laser control circuits 61-1 to 61-n.</p>
    <p num="57">The outputs of the lasers 62-1 to 62-n are modulated to the signals to be transmitted, by the modulators 65-1 to 65-n, and the signals are input to the optical amplifiers 63-1 to 63-n.</p>
    <p num="58">The modulated signals are amplified to predetermined levels by the optical amplifiers 63-1 to 63-n, are wavelength-division multiplexed by the optical coupler 64, and output to the fiber 1-1.</p>
    <p num="59">The computer 4-2 extracts a control command from the control signal in the main signal, the control signal from the fiber 1-2 is received by the control signal receiver 5-2, and the spectrum of signal lights input to the fiber 1-1 is detected by the optical spectrum analyzer 3-2.</p>
    <p num="60">The computer 4-2 compares the optical spectrum information of the signal lights on the receiving terminal station side received by the control signal receiver 5-2, with the optical spectrum information on the transmitting terminal station side detected by the optical spectrum analyzer 3-2, and judges according to established criteria whether or not a readjustment of pre-emphasis is required.</p>
    <p num="61">Furthermore, the computer 4-2 outputs a signal for controlling the gain of the optical amplifiers 63-1 to 63-n in order to control pre-emphasis based on the judgement result, individually adjusts the gain of each optical amplifier, and corrects the fluctuation of the OSNR characteristic of the signal light for each wavelength of an optical signal on the receiving terminal station side.</p>
    <p num="62">
      If these optical amplifiers 63-1 to 63-n are optical fiber amplifiers in which an optical fiber is doped with a rare-earth element, the computer 4-2 can control the output of a pump light source for controlling the optical fiber amplifiers.
      <br/>
      If the optical amplifiers 63-1 to 63-n are semiconductor optical amplifiers, the computer 4-2 can control the gain of the optical amplifiers 63-1 to 63-n by controlling the bias currents of the semiconductor devices.
    </p>
    <p num="63">If the outputs of the lasers 62-1 to 62-n are high enough, the levels can also be adjusted by providing variable optical attenuators instead of optical amplifiers, and attenuating the output lights of the lasers 62-1 to 62-n.</p>
    <p num="64">The outputs of the optical amplifiers 63-1 to 63-n are coupled by the coupler 64, and are output to the fiber for transmission as the signal light to be transmitted.</p>
    <p num="65">Furthermore, the computer 4-2 outputs laser wavelength control signals for controlling either or both of the temperature and driving current to the laser control circuits 61-1 to 61-n so that the interval between the wavelength of the lasers 62-1 to 62-n is controlled to be a predetermined value.</p>
    <p num="66">Using these laser wavelength control signals, the laser circuits 61-1 to 61-n control either or both of the temperature and driving current of the lasers 62-1 to 62-n, so that each wavelength is shifted to a predetermined wavelength.</p>
    <p num="67">At this time, by controlling either or both of the temperature and driving current of the lasers 62-1 to 62-n, the output levels of the lasers 62-1 to 62-n change, and the value of pre-emphasis also fluctuates.</p>

    <p num="84">
      The terminal station shown in FIG. 12 comprises a transmitting unit 102 for transmitting optical signals and a receiving unit 103 for receiving the signals.
      <br/>
      The signal processing units on the latter stages of both multiplexers 80-1 and 80-2 and demultiplexers 101-1 and 101-2 of the transmitting unit 102 and the receiving unit 103, respectively, are omitted in the drawing.

    <p num="85">
      An electric signal transmitted from the signal processing unit, not shown in the drawing, is input to the transmitting unit 102, is multiplexed by the multiplexer 80-1 or 80-2 for each channel, and is output.
      <br/>
      The multiplexed electric signal is converted from a serial signal to a parallel signal by a serial/parallel converter (S/P) units 81-1 or 81-2.
      <br/>
      Then, this parallel signal is input to a forward error correction (FEC) unit 82-1 or 82-2.
      <br/>
      In the FEC unit 82-1 or 82-2 a redundant code for correction in the case where an error occurs, is attached to the signal.
      <br/>
      Then, the parallel signal including the redundant code is input to a parallel/serial converter (P/S) unit 83-1 or 83-2, whereby it is restored to a serial signal.
      <br/>
      Then, the thus-generated serial signal is input to an external modulator (LN) 86-1 or 86-2 for generating an optical signal as a modulated signal.

    <p num="86">
      LD drivers 84-1 and 84-2 respectively, drive LDs 85-1 and 85-2 for producing laser lights with respective wavelengths, whereby lights with stable wavelengths are output.
      <br/>
      The light with the respective wavelength output from the LD 85-1 or 85-2 is modulated by the external modulator 86-1 or 86-2, and is output as a modulated signal light.
      <br/>
      This signal light is amplified by an optical amplifier 87-1 or 87-2, and is input to the coupler 88.
      <br/>
      The coupler 88 is, for example, a WDM coupler.
      <br/>
      By this coupler 88 the signal light for each wavelength is wavelength-division multiplexed into a wavelength-division multiplexed optical signal.
      <br/>
      This wavelength-division multiplexed optical signal is input to a coupler 89 for branching the signal, for example, in the ratio 4:1, and a part of the branched signal is input to an optical spectrum analyzer 90.
      <br/>
      The part of the optical signal not branched is output to a transmission path as it is.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      In the optical spectrum analyzer 90 it is detected whether or not each signal light is output with a specified wavelength.
      <br/>
      This information is input to a CPU 91.
      <br/>
      When the wavelength of a signal light of a certain channel has deviated from a specified value, and the CPU detects that the wavelength is out of tolerance, a wavelength control signal for correcting the wavelength deviation is input to the LD driver (84-1 or 84-2) of the channel in which there is deviation in wavelength.
      <br/>
      The tolerance is .+- 0 (slashed zero) 2 nm, for example, when the interval between wavelengths is 1 nm.
      <br/>
      By controlling the temperature of the LD 85-1 or 85-2 the LD driver changes the oscillation wavelength so that the wavelength of laser light may become a specified value.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      When the receiving unit 103 of the terminal station shown in the drawing receives optical signals from the transmission path, the optical signal is branched by a coupler 92, and the branched signal is input to an optical spectrum analyzer 94.
      <br/>
      In the optical spectrum analyzer 94 it is checked whether or not the power levels of the signal lights for each wavelength are uniform or whether or not the OSNR of the signal lights for each wavelength are uniform, and the result is input to a CPU 95.
      <br/>
      The CPU 95 analyzes the measurement result of the optical spectrum analyzer 94, and if the CPU 95 judges that there is a fluctuation in power levels or OSNRs among the signal lights for each wavelength, the CPU 95 transmits a pre-emphasis control command to the FEC 82-2 (or 82-1) of the transmitting unit 102 in order to convey the information to the relevant station which has transmitted the optical signal.
      <br/>
      This pre-emphasis control command is inserted in the overhead of the signal by the FEC 82-2, and is transmitted to the relevant station from the transmitting unit 102. (Although in the case of the drawing it is shown that the pre-emphasis control command is input to the FEC 82-2, the command can also be input to the FEC 82-1.
      <br/>
      Since a channel for transmitting a pre-emphasis control signal is normally fixed, the FEC of this corresponding channel is connected with the CPU 95.)
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      On the other hand, the part of the optical signal not branched by the coupler 92 is input to a coupler 93, and is demultiplexed into signal lights for each wavelength.
      <br/>
      This coupler 93 is, for example, a WDM coupler.
      <br/>
      When for a coupler 93 a WDM coupler is not used, and only a coupler for branching an optical signal like the coupler 92, is used, filters for extracting signal lights for each wavelength are required in the output stage of the coupler 92.
      <br/>
      The optical signal is demultiplexed into signal lights for each wavelength by the coupler 93, each of which is input to an optical amplifier 96-1 or 96-2, and is a-amplified.
      <br/>
      Then, the signal is received by an optical receiver 97-1 or 97-2, and is converted to an electric signal.
      <br/>
      The converted electric signal is converted to a parallel signal by a serial/parallel converter unit 98-1 or 98-2, and is input to an FEC 99-1 or 99-2.
      <br/>
      In the FEC 99-1 or 99-2 the redundant code is processed.
      <br/>
      If a pre-emphasis control signal is inserted in the overhead of the signal transmitted from the relevant station, the pre-emphasis control signal is extracted, and is sent to the CPU 91. (Although in the case of the drawing it is shown that the pre-emphasis control command is extracted only by the FEC 99-1, the command can also be extracted by the FEC 99-2.
      <br/>
      Provided that the system is so configured that an FEC corresponding to a channel to which the pre-emphasis control command may be transmitted is connected with the CPU 91, the channel to which the pre-emphasis control command is transmitted is usually fixed.) The signal processed by the FEC 99-1 or 99-2 is converted to a serial signal by a parallel/serial converter unit 100-1 or 100-2, and is sent to a demultiplexer 101-1 or 101-2.
      <br/>
      In the demultiplexer 101-1 or 101-2 the serial signal is demultiplexed, necessary data are extracted, and the data are processed by the signal processing unit, not shown in the drawing.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      The pre-emphasis control command extracted by the it FEC 99-1 is transmitted to measure the power level and OSNR of the signal lights for each wavelength of the optical signal transmitted to the station from the relevant station, and when there is a deviation, to correct the power level and OSNR.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the CPU 91 which has received the pre-emphasis control command from the FEC 99-1, outputs a pre-emphasis control signal according to the command, controls the gain of an optical amplifier 87-1 or 87-2, and adjusts the output level so that the power level or OSNR of a signal light for each wavelength received in the relevant station may become proper.
      <br/>
      Control by a pre-emphasis control command is repeated until the power level or OSNR of a signal light for each wavelength received on the receiving terminal station side becomes proper.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      Although in the drawing the adjustment of the output level of a signal light for each wavelength has been explained by adjusting the gain of the amplifier 87-1 or 87-2, the method of adjusting the output level is not limited to this.
      <br/>
      For example, the system can be so configured as to adjust the relative output levels of the signal lights for each wavelength by providing a variable optical attenuator in the position of the optical amplifier 87-1 or 87-2 in the drawing, and adjusting the attenuation of the attenuator, and to collectively amplify the wavelength-division multiplexed optical signal by providing an optical amplifier between the coupler 88 and the coupler 89.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      Although in the drawing two optical spectrum analyzers and CPUs are provided, one of each can be so configured as to be commonly used by both the transmitting unit 102 and the receiving unit 103.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is acceptable if the input to the optical spectrum analyzer is configured to be switched over by means of an optical switch, etc., and the one CPU is configured to carry out the processes of both CPUs 91 and 95 shown in the drawing.

      Of course, the wavelength to be output can also be controlled by keeping the temperature of the laser constant and changing the laser driving current.

    <p num="95">The LD driver 110 comprises a control command processing circuit 110-1 for converting a received wavelength control signal to an LD temperature control signal, a laser driving current control circuit 110-2 for supplying the laser with a constant driving current, and a Peltier element driving current control circuit 110-3.</p>
    <p num="96">The LD111 comprises a heat sink 113 for dissipating the generated heat, a laser chip 111-1 being the laser itself, and a Peltier element 111-2 for controlling the temperature of the laser chip 111-1.</p>

      The laser driving current control circuit 110-2 supplies the laser chip 111-1 with a constant current, thereby causing the laser chip 111-1 to output laser light.
      <br/>
      The Peltier element 111-2 is so configured that the element may be in close contact with the laser chip 111-1, whereby the temperature of the Peltier element may be directly conveyed to the laser chip 111-1, and the temperature of the laser chip 111-1 may become the same as the temperature of the Peltier element 111-2.
      <br/>
      The Peltier element 111-2 is thermally controlled by a current generated based on a signal applied to the Peltier element driving current control circuit 110-3 by the control command processing circuit 110-1 which has received a wavelength control signal.
      <br/>
      The Peltier element driving current control circuit 110-3 can increase or decrease the temperature of the Peltier element 111-2 by changing the polarity of the current.
      <br/>
      Since generally the laser chip 111-1 has a small heat capacity, the temperature of the laser chip 111-1 is easily changed according to the temperature of the Peltier element 111-2.
      <br/>
      The heat sink 113 dissipates heat so that the temperature in the LD111 may not be higher than required.
      <br/>
      By configuring the apparatus in this way the wavelength of the laser light from the laser chip 111-1 can be controlled to be relatively stable.

      If the control command has been received, in step S2 the pre-emphasis control command is read, and in step S3 the pre-emphasis control value is rewritten.

      A pre-emphasis value indicates how high the output level of a signal light should be for each wavelength.

      For example, a CPU-q readable RAM, etc. is prepared, in which the values are recorded as a table.
      <br/>
      In step S4 the spectrum data of signal lights sent from the transmitting unit side are read from the spectrum analyzer.
