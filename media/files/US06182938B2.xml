      <br/>
      A housing is provided which attaches to a wall and includes mechanisms for releasable attachment to a wall hanging such as a calendar.
      <br/>
      The housing may have a decorative facade and includes a depressible button which operates through a spring biased J-shaped rod or flexible strips to move a clasp member out of an elongated slot in the bottom of the housing.
      <br/>
      The slot accommodates an edge portion of a wall hanging.
      <br/>
      Securement occurs when the button is released and the spring bias or inherent flexibility of the strip member frictionally engage the wall hanging edge.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the wall hanging edge may include an engagement aperture.
      <br/>
      In such case, the clasp member will pass through the aperture and suspend the wall hanging in the housing slot.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The invention pertains to an apparatus for releasably attaching wall hangings to a vertical structure.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Wall hangings such as calendars are typically mounted to walls through primitive attachment devices, which include driving nails or pins through the wall hanging and into the wall.
      <br/>
      Adhesive means such as glue are also used.
      <br/>
      However, the aforementioned attachment devices present several disadvantages.
      <br/>
      Foremost, nailing or gluing hangings into walls creates unwanted damage, including holes and stains on the wall hanging and wall.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Hanging calendars create a particular problem because they typically contain multiple pages, where each page represents one month or other time period.
      <br/>
      In order to access all the pages, the user must repeatedly remove and reattach the calendar to the wall.
      <br/>
      Such actions may result in wall damage.
      <br/>
      Moreover, use of the prior art attachment devices can become cumbersome and tedious, requiring the user to repeatedly pin and remove the calendar.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention relates to an improved apparatus for attaching wall hangings and calendars to a wall or other vertical structure.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term "wall hanging" is intended to encompass all types of articles typically hung from a vertical support structure including artwork, shades, posters, charts, calendars, textile materials, decorative articles, lighting devices, and ornate panels.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the apparatus is attached to a wall, where it selectively engages a wall hanging, thereby removing the need to directly attach the wall hanging through primitive attachment means.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Principal elements of the invention comprise a housing having a wall attachment means, a slot in the housing for receiving a predetermined part of the wall hanging and a clasp means for holding the wall hanging in the slot.
      <br/>
      The housing may be decorative in appearance with a front and rear facade.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In the preferred embodiments, the slot extends along a bottom end of the housing.
      <br/>
      The slot has sufficient width to accommodate the thickness of a wall hanging part such as the upper end of a multi-page calendar.
      <br/>
      The clasp means includes a clasp member that will releasably engage the wall hanging.
      <br/>
      If the wall hanging is provided with an engagement aperture, the clasp member will pass through the aperture for a more secure connection.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The clasp means includes an activating button accessible from the front facade.
      <br/>
      The button is connected to an actuating means for moving the clasp member across the slot.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The invention encompasses four embodiments of the clasp means.
      <br/>
      A first embodiment utilizes a J-shaped rod as an actuating means.
      <br/>
      A top segment of the rod is fixed to the button which extends through a button recess in the front facade.
      <br/>
      From the recess, the top segment passes through the rear facade and then turns about 90 degrees to a mid-segment.
      <br/>
      The mid-segment merges into a second turn from which extends a bottom segment comprising the aforementioned clasp member.
      <br/>
      A biasing means may be inserted between the button and button recess to maintain the clasp member in a closed position in the slot.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A second embodiment provides a flexible E-strip as the actuating means.
      <br/>
      The top end of the strip is fixed to the housing rear facade.
      <br/>
      Proximate the strip midpoint is a connector element comprising a button attachment part which extends into the housing and engages the button.
      <br/>
      The lower portion of the strip is provided with the aforementioned clasp member comprising an outwardly directed clasp part.
      <br/>
      When the button is depressed, the clasp part will withdraw from the housing slot.
      <br/>
      Upon release of the button, the inherent flexural strength of the E-strip will move the clasp part back into the slot.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      A third embodiment of the actuating means comprises an L-shaped flex member.
      <br/>
      The upper end of the flex member is secured to the rear facade.
      <br/>
      The lower end is provided with the clasp member comprising a clasp element.
      <br/>
      In its normal position, the clasp member extends outwardly across the aforementioned slot.
      <br/>
      A connector element comprising a button fastener interconnects the flex member to the button.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the element may extend inwardly from the button and simply abut the inner surface of the flex member.
      <br/>
      Either way, depressing the button will cause deflection of the flex member and move the clasp element out of the slot.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The fourth embodiment utilizes a housing comprising front and rear interlocking shell parts.
      <br/>
      The actuating means comprises a flexible panel extending from the rear shell having a button connector element which secures the panel to the button.
      <br/>
      The panel also includes a clasp member comprising a clasp projection extending outwardly from the panel free end portion.
      <br/>
      When the panel is in its normal position, the projection extends into the housing slot to permit operation in a manner similar to the above embodiments.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="16">Embodiment I</p>
    <p num="17">
      With reference now to the drawings, FIGS. 1 through 5 show a housing 20 comprising an elongated solid body of predetermined thickness.
      <br/>
      It is defined by a front facade 40 and a rear facade 50 which are outlined by a top end 55.
      <br/>
      The top end merges into opposing side walls 44 which extend to a bottom end 65.
      <br/>
      The bottom end 65 is preferably straight and includes a slot 60 proximate its mid-line.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the slot extends along the entire longitudinal extent of the bottom end.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The slot interior comprises a planar slot front side 61 and a rear side 62.
      <br/>
      The sides are parallel to their respective facades and to each other.
      <br/>
      The slot has sufficient width and depth to accommodate insertion of the top end portion of at least a multi-page calendar as depicted by reference 42 in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Although not mandatory, the midpoint of the aforementioned top end portion includes an engagement aperture 43 extending therethrough.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In the lower mid-portion of the front facade is a button opening 22.
      <br/>
      The opening has a diameter and depth that is sufficient to permit in and out movement of an activating means shown as button 45.
      <br/>
      The depth should also be sufficient to contain a biasing means shown as spring 26.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The button and its corresponding opening preferably have a circular cross-sectional shape.
      <br/>
      However, other round or polygonal shapes could be used.
      <br/>
      The underside 47 of the button is preferably flat and includes a fastener opening 48 for a purpose to be hereinafter described.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      As shown in FIGS. 3-11, the rear facade 50 is provided with an undercut opening 56 for engaging a hook or nail extending from a support structure such as a wall.
      <br/>
      Additionally, wall spacers 57a, 57b and 57c on the rear facade 50 spatially buffer the housing from the wall.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In the first embodiment, the clasp means comprises a solid rod 30 of metal or plastic.
      <br/>
      The rod is bent into a J-shape and includes three integrated segments comprising a top segment 32, middle segment 34 and bottom segment 36.
      <br/>
      The bottom segment constitutes the aforementioned clasp member.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The top segment threadably engages fastener opening 48 extending into the underside 47 of the button.
      <br/>
      It passes through button opening 22 and through housing upper aperture 38 to a first corner proximate the rear facade.
      <br/>
      The portion of the top segment passing through opening 22 is circumscribed by a spring part shown as coil spring 26, which is positioned within the opening to outwardly bias the button 45.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      At the first corner, the top segment turns about 90 degrees and merges into a middle segment 34.
      <br/>
      The middle segment 34 is located within a narrow rod recess 54 that extends along the rear facade to a housing lower aperture 24.
      <br/>
      The lower aperture 24 accesses housing slot 60 through the slot rear side 62.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The middle segment of the rod extends to a second corner where it turns about 90 degrees and merges into the bottom segment 36.
      <br/>
      The bottom segment extends inwardly through housing lower aperture 24 and across slot 60.
      <br/>
      It terminates at free end 39.
      <br/>
      When the assembly is in a closed position as shown in FIG. 4, free end 39 will rest within divot 58 on slot front-side 61.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      To move the bottom segment 36 out of slot 60 to an open position, button 45 is depressed into recess 22.
      <br/>
      This action moves middle segment 34 out of the rod recess 54.
      <br/>
      Simultaneously, the bottom segment retreats from slot 60 into the housing lower aperture 24, thereby clearing the slot of obstruction.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      While holding the button in a depressed position within opening 22, as depicted in FIG. 5 and Arrow B, calendar 42 is inserted into slot 60 as shown by Arrow A in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The calendar or other wall hanging is positioned in a balanced manner a sufficient distance into the slot to permit a firm frictional engagement with free end 39 when the button is released.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      When the wall hanging or calendar include a centrally located engagement aperture, such as that shown by reference 43 in FIG. 1, alignment is facilitated by placing the aperture over divot 58 and releasing button 45.
      <br/>
      Upon release, spring 26 will return rod 30 to its original position such that free end 39 will pass through the hanging aperture and engage divot 58.
      <br/>
      In this closed position, the calendar will hang from bottom segment 30.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Embodiment II</p>
    <p num="30">
      With reference to FIGS. 6-8, a second embodiment is shown comprising elements similar to those contained in the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      Therefore, these elements will be designated by the same reference numerals in this embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The second embodiment employs a solid body housing 20 defined by front and rear facades 40,50 with a top end 55, bottom end 65 and side walls 44.
      <br/>

    <p num="44">
      With reference to FIGS. 12-16, a fourth embodiment is shown comprising elements similar to those contained in the aforementioned embodiments.
      <br/>
      Therefore, such elements are designated by the same reference numerals in this embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The fourth embodiment utilizes a two-part housing comprising a front shell 70 and a rear shell 80.
      <br/>
      The shells preferably comprise thin-walled molded structures which are interconnected by a peripheral engagement means in a manner described below.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The front shell is defined by an exterior front face 75, a front interior surface 72, a top end 73, opposing side walls 67 and a bottom end 74.
      <br/>
      Extending along the upper periphery is an upper rib 102.
      <br/>
      The rib comprises part of the engagement means for locking the shells together.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      In the lower mid-portion of the front shell is an inwardly directed boss structure 78.
      <br/>
      The boss structure is defined by an inwardly facing abutment wall 79 from which extend three orthogonal polygonal-shaped peripheral wall panels 76.
      <br/>
      The panels extend inwardly from interior surface 72 and create a box-like chamber comprising button recess 22.
      <br/>
      To provide access to the button recess, abutment wall 79 includes a central orifice 68.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The bottom of the boss structure comprises the upper end of the lower base section 95.
      <br/>
      The bottom of the abutment wall 79 comprises bottom ledge 77.
      <br/>
      As so disposed, the bottom ledge becomes part of the engagement means that extends outwardly from the inner face 96 of the lower base section 95.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The rear shell 80 is defined by a rear interior surface 81, a rear face 82, a top shell wall 83 and a bottom shell wall 84.
      <br/>
      In use, the rear shell will be oriented so that the rear face is adjacent a vertical wall structure and the rear interior surface will face the front interior surface 72 of the front shell.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The upper area of rear shell wall 101 includes an attachment opening 103 for engaging a wall hanger means such as a nail or hook.
      <br/>
      The lower shell wall area is provided with a flex opening 104.
      <br/>
      The flex opening is coextensive with the boss structure when the front and rear shells are engaged.
      <br/>
      It extends from offset wall 105 to bottom shell wall 84.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Extending inwardly and downwardly from the upper area of the shell wall into the flex opening is panel 85.
      <br/>
      As shown, the panel is integral with the rear shell wall and is constructed of a flexible material such as plastic, metal or fiberglass composites.
      <br/>
      It extends to a free end portion 87 which is slightly spaced above the bottom shell wall 84.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Extending inwardly from the mid-region of the panel is button attachment part 90.
      <br/>
      This part passes through central orifice 68 and into fastener opening 48 where it is fixed to button 45 when the front and rear shells are assembled.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      From the free end portion 87 extends clasp projection 88.
      <br/>
      The projection has sufficient length to engage divot 58 at inner face 96 when the shells are assembled and the clasp means is in a closed position as shown in FIG. 13.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The boss structure and corresponding shell walls have sufficient depth to provide the requisite separation when the shell parts are assembled for creating the slot area 60.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when a user depresses button 45 as depicted by Arrow E in FIG. 14, the panel will swing rearward causing retraction of the clasp projection 88 into the lower area of the flex opening 104.
      <br/>
      In this manner, connection and release of a wall hanging will occur in the same manner as described in the previous embodiments.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The engagement means for the housing comprises two sets of engagement structures.
      <br/>
      The first set comprises an upper rib 102 on an offset lip extension 100 of the front shell upper periphery.
      <br/>
      The upper rib engages a coextensive top groove 93 on the inner edge of shell wall 83.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The second set comprises opposing longitudinal ridge structures 77' which merge coextensively into opposing ends of bottom ledge 77.
      <br/>
      The ledge and ridge structures include a rib 71.
      <br/>
      The rear shell interior surface 81 has a shoulder structure 106 that extends coextensively with the aforementioned bottom ledge and ridge.
      <br/>
      The shoulder includes a shoulder groove 92 which corresponds with the ledge rib 71.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the above matching shell engagement structures are pressed together, a secure frictional engagement will occur.
      <br/>
      It will also be appreciated that the shell parts may be secured together in other ways known in the art.
      <br/>
      Examples are sonic or chemical bonding, adhesives, welding and mechanical fasteners.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      While the invention has been described with respect to a preferred embodiment, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and improvements may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited by the specific illustrative embodiments, but only by the scope of the appended claims.
