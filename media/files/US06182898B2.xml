    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates generally to laser scanning systems, and more particularly to an automatic bar code symbol reading system in which an automatic hand-supportable laser scanner can be interchangeably utilized as either a portable hand-held laser scanner in an automatic "hands-on" mode of operation, or as a stationary laser projection scanner in an automatic "hands-free" mode of operation.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Brief Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Bar code symbols have become widely used in many commercial environments such as, for example, point-of-sale (POS) stations in retail stores and supermarkets, inventory and document tracking, and diverse data control applications.
      <br/>
      To meet the growing demands of this recent technological innovation, bar code symbol readers of various types have been developed for scanning and decoding bar code symbol patterns and producing symbol character data for use as input in automated data processing systems.
    </p>
    <p num="6">In general, prior art hand-held bar code symbol readers using laser scanning mechanisms can be classified into two major categories.</p>
    <p num="7">
      The first category of hand-held laser-based bar code symbol readers includes manually-actuated trigger-operated systems having lightweight, hand-held laser scanners which can be supported in the hand of the user.
      <br/>
      The user positions the hand-held laser scanner at a specified distance from the object bearing the bar code symbol, manually activates the scanner to initiate reading and then moves the scanner over other objects bearing bar code symbols to be read.
      <br/>
      Prior art bar code symbol readers illustrative of this first category are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,387,297 to Swartz; U.S. Pat. No. 4,575,625 to Knowles; U.S. Pat. No. 4,845,349 to Cherry; U.S. Pat. No. 4,825,057 to Swartz, et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,903,848 to Knowles; U.S. Pat. No. 5,107,100 to Shepard, et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,080,456 to Katz, et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,047,617 to Shepard, et al.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The second category of hand-held laser-based bar code symbol readers includes automatically actuated systems having lightweight triggerless hand-held laser scanners which can be supported in the hand of the user.
      <br/>
      The user positions the hand-held laser scanner, at a specified distance from the object bearing the bar code the presence of the object is automatically detected, the presence of the bar code symbol on the object is detected, and thereafter the detected bar code symbol automatically read.
      <br/>
      Prior art illustrative of this second category of laser-based bar code symbol reading systems are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,639,606 to Boles, et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 4,933,538 to Heiman, et al.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      While prior art hand-held and stationary laser scanners have played an important role in the development of the bar code symbol industry, these devices have, however, suffered from a number of shortcomings and drawbacks.
      <br/>
      For example, hand-held laser scanners, although portable and lightweight, are not always convenient to use in assembly-line applications where the user processes bar coded objects over an extended period of time, or where the user requires the use of both hands in order to manipulate the objects.
      <br/>
      In some applications, hand-held laser scanners are difficult to manipulate while simultaneously moving objects or performing other tasks at a point-of-sale terminal.
      <br/>
      Stationary laser scanners, on the other hand, provide a desired degree of flexibility in many applications by allowing the user to manipulate bar coded objects with both hands.
      <br/>
      However, by their nature, stationary laser scanners render scanning large, heavy objects a difficult task as such objects must be manually moved into or through the laser scan field.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Attempting to eliminate the problems associated with the use of hand-held and stationary laser scanners, U.S. Pat. No. 4,766,297 to McMillan discloses a bar code symbol scanning system which combines the advantages of hand-held and stationary fixed laser scanners into a single scanning system which can be used in either a hands-on or hands-free mode of operation.</p>
    <p num="11">
      The bar code symbol scanning system in U.S. Pat. No. 4,766,297 includes a portable hand-held laser scanning device for generating, electrical signals descriptive of a scanned bar code symbol.
      <br/>
      In the hands-on mode of operation, a trigger on the hand-held laserl scanning device is manually actuated each time a bar code symbol on an object is to be read.
      <br/>
      The system further includes a fixturel having a head portion for receiving and supporting the hand-held laser scanning device, and a base portion above which the head portion is supported at a predetermined distance.
      <br/>
      In the hands-free mode of operation, the hand-held laser scanning device is supported by the fixture head portion above the fixture base portion in order to allow objects bearing bar code symbols to pass between the head and base portions of the fixture.
      <br/>
      In order to detect the presence of an object between the head and base portions of the fixture, the fixture also includes an object sensor operably connected to the hand-held laser scanning device.
      <br/>
      When the object sensor senses an object between the head portion and the base portion, the object sensor automatically initiates the hand-held laser scanning device supported in the fixture to read the bar code symbol on the detected object.
    </p>
    <p num="12">While the bar code symbol scanning system of U.S. Pat. No. 4,776,297 permits reading of printed bar code information using either a portable "hands-on" or stationary "hands-free" mode of operation, this system suffers from several significant shortcomings and drawbacks as well.</p>
    <p num="13">
      In particular, in the hands-on mode of operation, scanning bar code symbols requires manually actuating a trigger each time a bar code symbol is to be read.
      <br/>
      In the hands-free mode of operation, scanning bar code symbols requires passing the object bearing the bar code between the head and base portions of the fixture.
      <br/>
      However, in many instances where both hands are required to manipulate a bar coded object, the object is too large to be passed between the head and base portions of the fixture and thus scanning of the bar code symbol is not possible.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In an attempt to address such problems, several hand-held projection laser scanners have been developed for omnidirectional code symbol scanning.
      <br/>
      Examples of such systems include the NCR 7890 presentation scanner from the NCR Corporation and the LS9100 omnidirectional laser scanner from Symbol Technologies, inc.
      <br/>
      While each of these systems produces an omnidirectional laser scan pattern from a hand-supportable housing and have hands-free and hands-on modes of operation, each of these scanning devices suffer from a number of shortcomings and drawbacks.
      <br/>
      In particular, the spatial extent of the laser scan pattern produced from each of these scanners frequently results in the inadvertent scanning of code symbols on products placed near the scanner during its hands-free mode of operation.
      <br/>
      In the hands-on mode of operation, it is virtually impossible to use the scanners to read bar code symbol menus provided in diverse application environments.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in each of these scanner designs, the scanner is tethered to its base unit by a power/signal cord, and the user is required to handle the scanner housing in an awkward manner in the hands-on mode of operation, resulting in strain and fatigue and thus a decrease in productivity.
      <br/>
      In addition, the control structure provided in each of these hand-held projection scanners operates the scanner components in a manner which involves inefficient consumption of electrical power, and prevents diverse modes of automatic code symbol reading which would be desired in portable scanning environments.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="51">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 to 3B, automatic bar code symbol reading system 1 of the illustrative embodiment of the present invention comprises an automatic (i.e., triggerless) portable bar code (symbol) reading device 2 operably associated with a base unit 3 having a scanner support stand 4 pivotally connected thereto, for releasably supporting the automatic bar code symbol reading device 2 at any one of a number of positions above of a counter surface at a Point of Sale (POS) station.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the bar code symbol reading device 2 is operably connected with its the base unit 3 by way of a one way electromagnetic link 5 that is momentarily created between bar code symbol reading device 2 and its mated base unit 3 after the successful reading of each bar code symbol by the bar code symbol reading device.
      <br/>
      Operable interconnection between the base unit and a host system (e.g., electronic cash register system, data collection device, etc.) 6 is achieved by a flexible multiwire communications cable. 7 extending from the base unit and plugged directly into the data-input communications port of the host computer system 6.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative embodiment, electrical power from a low voltage direct current (DC) power supply (not shown) is provided to the base unit by way of a flexible power cable 8.
      <br/>
      Notably, this DC power supply can be realized in host computer system 6 or as a separate DC power supply adapter pluggable into a conventional 3-prong electrical socket.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments of the present invention, cables 7 and 8 can be integrated to provide a single flexible, multi-wire cable for transmission of power to the base unit and data to the host system.
      <br/>
      As will be described in greater detail hereinafter, a rechargeable battery power supply unit 20 is contained primarily within the handle portion of the bar code symbol reading device 2 in order to energize the electrical and electro-optical components within the device.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      As illustrated in FIGS. 1A through 1B, scanner support stand 4 is particularly adapted for receiving and supporting portable bar code symbol reading device 2 without user support, thus providing a stationary, automatic hands-free mode of operation.
      <br/>
      In general, portable bar code symbol reading device 2 includes an ultra-light weight hand-supportable housing 9 having a head portion 9A and a contoured handle portion 9B.
      <br/>
      As will be described in greater detail hereinafter, head portion 9A encloses electro-optical components which are arranged in a novel scanning platform 10 of ultra compact construction which renders possible the production of a highly collimated scanning pattern 11 through light transmission window 12 for the purpose of scanning bar code symbols on objects within a narrowly confined scanning (i.e., 3-D scan field) volume 13, while preventing unintentional scanning of, bar code symbols on objects located outside thereof at point of sale (POS) stations.
      <br/>
      Thus, by minimizing the amount of counter-space that must be clear (i.e. free) of bar coded items at point of sale POS stations, the laser scanner of the present invention provides retailers with greater counter-space availability for displaying merchandise and the like, yet without sacrificing the; increase in check-out performance and worker productivity associated with the use of bar code symbol scanners at POS stations.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      As illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 1C, the base unit 3 includes a base portion 14 which can be realized in a variety of different ways.
      <br/>
      For example, the base portion 14 can be realized, as a compact stand for support upon a countertop surface as shown in FIG. 18, or it can be realized as a support mount for vertical wall-mounting.
      <br/>
      In either embodiment, the function of the scanner stand 4 is to support the device in any one of a plurality of positions above a workspace 19 which may be a counter surface in POS applications.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, the highly collimated scanning pattern 11 can be projected about the projection axis 17 above the counter surface in any one of a plurality of orientations corresponding to the plurality of positions.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      As shown in FIGS. 1A and 15A, base portion 14 contains electronic circuitry realized on a PC board 16 for carrying out various types of functions, namely: reception of electrical power from the host system and coupling electrical power to the rechargeable battery contained within the hand-supportable housing; reception of data packets transmitted from the automatic bar code symbol reading device, and processing the same for data recovery; generation of acoustical and/or optical acknowledgement signals; and transmission of symbol character data to the host system.
      <br/>
      Each of these functions will be described in greater detail hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 15A and 15B.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      As illustrated in FIGS. 1B and 1C in particular, the head portion 9A continuously extends into contoured handle portion 9B at an obtuse angle  ALPHA  which, in the illustrative embodiment, is about 115 degrees.
      <br/>
      It is understood, however, that in other embodiments obtuse angle a may be in the range of about 100 to about 150 degrees.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 1C, the mass balance of the device is particularly designed so that when the device is held within the user's hand, the index finger of the user is disposed beneath the head portion of the housing, and provides a pivot point about which there is substantially zero torque acting upon the device, preventing it from rotating in either direction about the index finger.
      <br/>
      Instead, the resultant force distribution acting upon the user's hand is aligned in the direction of gravitational forces, as indicted in FIG. 1C. The effect of this mass-balanced scanner design is to minimize the torque imposed on the user's wrists and forearms while using the bar code symbol reading device in the hands-on mode of operation.
      <br/>
      This, in turn, minimizes the amount of energy which the user must expend during hands-on scanning operations, thereby reducing wrist and arm fatigue and increasing worker productivity.
      <br/>
      In addition to the above, advantages, the hand-supportable housing hereof is sculptured (i.e., form-fitted) to the human hand so that automatic hands-on; scanning is rendered easy and effortless.
      <br/>
      Also, the ergonomic housing design eliminates the risks of musculoskeletal disorders, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, which can result from repeated biomechanical stress commonly associated with pointing prior art gun-shaped scanners at bar code symbols, and squeezing a trigger to activate the laser scanning beam, and then releasing the trigger.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      As best shown in FIGS. 1G, 15A and 15B, stand portion 4 of the base unit 3 is pivotally supported with respect to the base portion by way of pivot pins 22A and 22B.
      <br/>
      In order to releasably hold the stand portion of the base unit relative to the base portion thereof in any one of a number of provided scanning positions, a releasable stand-locking mechanism 23 is provided.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1G, the locking mechanism is realized as a set of projections 24 formed on the inside surface of the support arms 4A of the stand portion of the base unit, and a projection-catch 25 formed on the adjacent surface of the base portion.
      <br/>
      These structure features of the base unit are shown in FIG. 1G. rhe function of the projection catch 25 is to releasably engage one of the projections 24 associated with the selected scanning position.
      <br/>
      Gentle rotation of the head portion of the scanner while supported in its stand causes the projection caught in the projection-catch 25 to release therefrom, allowing the scanner to be repositioned as desired.
      <br/>
      At the resulting scanning position, the corresponding projection 24 automatically engages with the projection-catch 25 and locks the stand portion of the base unit relative to the base portion thereof.
      <br/>
      In addition, to allow the base unit to easily rotate relative to its support surface, the bottom of the base portion is realized as a turntable structure that allows its bottom section 26A to be stationary relative to the support surface (i.e. countertop) 27 , while the upper section 26B is fixed relative to the balance of the base portion of the base unit.
      <br/>
      A pivot 26C is used to pivotally connect the upper and lower sections together for easy rotation of the base unit relative to the support surface.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      In FIGS. 1E and 1F, the automatic bar code symbol reading system of the present invention is arranged in two extreme scanning configurations during the automatic hands-free mode of system operation.
      <br/>
      In these different scanning configurations, the stand portion of the base unit is arranged differently with respect to the base portion of the base unit.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1E, the stand portion of the base unit is shown supporting the hand-supportable projection scanning device hereof so that its narrowly-confined 3-D scanning volume 13 is projected in a direction slightly off-parallel to the counter surface upon which the base unit is a supported.
      <br/>
      In this hands-free scanning configuration, code symbols on large objects can be easily scanned by simply presenting the code symbol to the narrowly-confined scanning volume 13 projected, along the "pointing direction" (i.e. longitudinal axis) of the head portion of the scanner housing.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1F, the stand portion of the base unit is shown supporting the hand-supportable projection scanning device hereof so that its scanning volume is projected downwardly, in a direction passing through the counter surface upon which the base unit is supported.
      <br/>
      In this hands-free scanning configuration, code symbols on small objects can be easily scanned by simply presenting to the code symbol to the narrowly-confined scanning volume 13 projected beneath the head portion of the scanner housing.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      As illustrated in FIGS. 2A through 3B, the head portion 9A of the hand-supportable housing has a light transmission aperture 12A formed in the front portion thereof.
      <br/>
      As shown, the light transmission window 12 is mounted over the entire light transmission aperture.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the spectral transmission characteristics of the light transmission window are such that all wavelengths greater (i.e. longer) than slightly less than 670 nm (e.g. longer than 665 nm) are permitted to exit and enter the interior volume of the housing with minimum attenuation.
      <br/>
      As a result of such characteristics, the visible laser line at 670 nanometers and the infra-red (IR) spectral line at 870 nm (produced from the object sensing circuitry hereof) are allowed to propagated through the transmission window, out of the head portion of the housing, reflect from an object/bar code surface, and return through the transmission window.
      <br/>
      Notably, all other surfaces of the handsupportable housing are opaque to electromagnetic radiation in the visible band.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      As illustrated in FIGS. 2, and 2A , in particular, the bar code symbol reading device 2 generates from its laser scanning platform 10, two different types of fields external to its hand-supportable housing.
      <br/>
      As explained below, these fields function to carry out a novel bar code symbol reading process according to the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The first field, referred to as the "object detection field", indicated by broken and dotted lines 30, is provided external to the housing for detecting energy reflected off an object (bearing a bar code symbol) located in the object detection field.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, the second field 31, referred to as the "scan field" or "3-D scan field" (i.e. narrowly-confined scanning volume 13), has a multiplicity of laser beam scanning planes contained therewithin projected external to the head portion of the housing.
      <br/>
      The function of the scanning volume (i.e. 3-D scan field) is to scan a bar code symbol on an object automatically detected in the object detection field.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, bar code symbol scanning is achieved using a scanned visible laser beam which, after reflecting off the bar code symbol in the scanning volume 13, produces laser scan data that is collected for the purpose of automatically detecting the bar code symbol and subsequently reading (i.e., scanning and decoding) the same.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      In general, detected energy reflected from an object during object detection can be optical radiation or acoustical energy, either sensible or non-sensible by the user, and may be either generated from the automatic bar code reading device or an external ambient source.
      <br/>
      However, as will be described in greater detail hereinafter, the provision of such energy is preferably achieved by transmitting a wide beam of pulsed infrared (IR) light away from transmission aperture 11, in a direction substantially parallel to longitudinal axis 16 of the hand-supportable housing.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the object detection field, from which such reflected energy is collected, is designed to have a narrowly diverging pencil-like geometry of three-dimensional volumetric expanse, which is spatially coincident with at least a portion of the transmitted infrared light beam.
      <br/>
      This feature of the present invention ensures that an object residing within the object detection field will be illuminated by the infrared light beam, and that infrared light reflected therefrom will be directed generally towards the transmission aperture of the housing where it can be automatically detected to indicate the presence of the object within the object detection field.
      <br/>
      In response to object presence detection, a visible laser beam is automatically generated within the interior of the bar code symbol reading device, projected through the light transmission aperture of the housing and repeatedly scanned across the scanning volume, within which at least a portion of the detected object lies.
      <br/>
      At least a portion of the scanned laser light beam will be scattered and reflected if the object and directed back towards and through light transmissive window 11 for collection and detection within the interior of the bar code symbol reading device, and subsequently processed in a manner which will be described in detail hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      To ensure that the user can quickly align the visible laser beam with the bar code symbol on the detected object, the object detection field of the preferred embodiment is designed to spatially encompass a significant portion of the 3-D scanning volume along the operative scanning range of the device, as illustrated in FIGS. 2A and 2B, for the first illustrative embodiment of the present invention.

When constructed in accordance with the Specifications disclosed herein, the laser scanning platform of the illustrative embodiment will produce a highly collimated set of scanning planes which extend from the light transmission window and intersect about the projection axis 17 to form a highly collimated scanning pattern within a narrowly-confined 3-D scanning volume thereabout.

      When assembled and configured as described above, the laser scanning platform 10 is mounted with the upper and lower halves of the hand-supportable housing 9A and 9B.

      Mounting is achieved by way of resiliently securing shock-mounting support posts 29A, 29B and 29C to corresponding mounting holes formed within the optical bench 35 using rubber grommets and screws.

      As shown in FIG. 7, the assembled laser scanning platform (i.e. engine) is installed within the housing in a manner described above.

      In order that the shock-absorbing mounting system can operate properly, it is important that sufficient clearance is provided between the outermost extensions of the scanning platform tand the interior wall surface of upper portion of the housing.

      In this way, the scanning platform is permitted to undergo gross displacements in the directions of the dominant oscillatory modes of system when the device is dropped onto the floor, knocked into solid objects and the like under normal or otherwise expected operating environments.
    </p>
    <p num="74">Having described the physical construction of the laser scanning engine 10 of the present invention, it is appropriate at this juncture to describe in greater detail the manner in which the laser scanning pattern is produced from the laser scanning platform hereof.</p>
    <p num="75">
      Upon detection of an object within the object detection field 30, a laser beam is produced from the laser beam production module 39 and is directed towards beam directing surface 44 mounted on the light collecting mirror 43.
      <br/>
      The laser beam reflects from the beam directing surface 44 towards the mirrored facets on the rotating scanning polygon 36.
      <br/>
      As the polygon spins, the incident laser beam reflects off the rotating mirrors 36A through 36D and sweeps the laser beam about its rotational axis along a plurality of different paths which intersect the stationary array of mirrors 38A through 38E on the optical bench.
      <br/>
      During each revolution of the scanning polygon, the laser beam reflects off the rotating mirrors and therewhile is repeatedly swept across the array of stationary mirrors thereby producing first, second, third, fourth and fifth groups of plural scan lines, respectively.
      <br/>
      These plural groups of scanlines shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B are projected out through the light transmission window and intersect about the projection axis 17 extending from the light transmission window, and within the narrowly confined scanning volume 13.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative embodiment, the intersection of the laser scanning planes extends from adjacent (e.g. about 9.5" from) the light transmission window to at least about 10.0 inches therefrom so as to produce a highly collimated projected scanning pattern within the narrowly confined 3-D scanning volume.
      <br/>
      Within this 3-D scanning volume, a bar code, symbol can be scanned omnidirectionally, while preventing unintentional scanning of code symbols on objects located outsider thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      As illustrated in the cross-sectional diagrams of FIGS. 7A and 7B, there exists a particular relationship among the scanlines of the laser scanning pattern of the illustrative embodiment.
      <br/>
      In particular, each scan line in each group of scan lines is substantially parallel to each other scan line in that group of scan lines.
      <br/>
      As a result, when the code symbol is presented to the highly collimated scanning pattern projected within narrowly confined scanning field, the code symbol is automatically scanned therewithin independent of the orientation of the code symbol within the scanning field (i.e. scanning volume).
      <br/>
      At least a portion of the laser light reflected from the scanned code symbol is directed through the light transmission window, reflected off the stationary light reflective surfaces, reflected off the rotating mirrors, collected by the light focusing mirror, and received by the photodetector 41, whereupon an electrical signal is produced for use in decode signal processing.
      <br/>
      The details of such signal processing operations, and the preferred means for achieving the same, can be best understood with a detailed description of the scan and control data processing circuitry embodied with the laser scanning device of the present invention.

    <p num="82">
      In the illustrative embodiment, DC-to-DC converter 130A is realized by configuring a low-voltage input, adjustable output step-up DC-DC converter (e.g. such as the MAX777 IC chip by SLIM Integrated Products) with an inductor (e.g. 22.0 microHenries) and two capacitors, to produce a 5.0 Volt output voltage for use in the bar code symbol reading device.
      <br/>
      As shown, resettable timer circuit 130C is realized by configuring a comparator circuit 130C1 (e.g. as provided for example in the LM2903 IC chip by National Semiconductor) with external resistors R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 and charging capacitor C1.
      <br/>
      The function of the resistors R3 and R5 is to provide to one inputs of the comparator a positive reference voltage (i.e. Vref) which is close in magnitude to the battery voltage Vbattery, with resistor R4 being connected to the output of the comparitor for hysteresis.
      <br/>
      The power control switch 130B is realized by N-channel field effect transistor (FET), wherein the source terminal is connected to the output port of the DC-to-DC converter 130A, the drain terminal is connector is connected to the input port of the power distribution circuitry 125, and the gate terminal is connected to the output port of the comparitor 130C1.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      In the illustrative embodiment, there are three different power switching events which will reset the resettable timer circuit 130C, cause the comparitor thereof to produce a high output level and drive the N-channel FET into conduction.
      <br/>
      The first power switching event comprises manually depressing power reset button 130D mounted on the exterior of the scanner housing.
      <br/>
      The second power switching event comprises placing the handle portion of the scanner housing within the recess of the scanner support stand hereof, whereby Hall-effect sensor 100 within the handle of the housing detects magnetic flux produced from permanent magnet 103 within the scanner support stand recess, as shown in FIG. 1E. The third power switching event comprises successfully reading a bar code symbol and producing activation signal A3=1.

    <p num="84">
      In order that such power switching events will effectively reset the resettable timer circuit 130C, a number of electrical devices are connected to input port of the resettable timer circuit 130C, effectively realized by resistor R2.
      <br/>
      In particular, the "good read" activation signal A3=1 produced by symbol decoding module 119 is provided to the base of a NPN transistor 130C2, which has its collector terminal connected to one end of resistor R2 and its emitter terminal connected to electrical ground.
      <br/>
      As shown, one terminal of manually depressible power reset button 130D (e.g. realized as a spring-biased push-type button switch) is connected to the same end of resistor R2, to which the collector of NPN transistor 130C2 is connected, while the other terminal of power set button 130D is connected to electrical ground.
      <br/>
      Also, one terminal of stand detector (e.g. Hall-effect sensor 100) is connected to the same end of resistor R2, to which the collector of NPN transistor 130C2 is connected, while the other terminal of the Hall-effect sensor 100 is connected to electrical ground, as shown in FIG. 8A.

      Battery supply 126 aboard the scanning device is automatically charged to its normal output voltage (i.e. Vbattery) by way of battery recharging apparatus 127, 128 and 129.
      <br/>
      A predetermined time duration  DELTA T (e.g. 1 minute, preferably 5 minutes) after the occurrence of a power switching event, power supply unit 20 attains its steady-state condition.
      <br/>
      At this state, capacitor C1 charges through resistor R1, to a voltage above Vref.
      <br/>
      This causes the output voltage of the capacitor 130C1 to drop to a level which disables FET 130B, thereby disabling the supply of battery power to power distribution circuit 125, and ultimately disabling the scanning device.
      <br/>
      Upon the occurrence of any of the above three "power switching" events described above, capacitor C1 quickly discharges through resistor R2 (i.e. R1&gt;&gt;R1), causing the output voltage of capacitor 130C1 to go to a level which enables FET 130B to supply battery power to the power distribution circuitry 125, and thereby enabling the scanning device for the predetermined time period (e.g.  DELTA T greater than 1, preferably 5 minutes).
      <br/>
      This programmed duration of power supply provides a time window  DELTA T, within which the object detection circuit of the system hereof can automatically detect an object within the object detection field.
      <br/>
      Such power resetting operation does not, however, initiate or otherwise cause laser scanning or bar code symbol reading operations to commence or cease.
      <br/>
      Only the introduction of an object into the object detection field (i.e. when the resettable timer circuit 130C has been reset) can initiate or otherwise cause laser scanning or bar code symbol reading operations to commence.

      A principal advantage of the power control scheme of the present invention is that it provides automatic power conservation in automatic code symbol reading applications, while minimally impacting upon the diverse modes of automatic operation provided by the system hereof.

      <br/>
      Also, when the hand-supportable housing of the device is placed (i.e. supported) within the support recess 60 of scanner support portion of the base unit, Hall-effect sensor 103 produces a stand detect signal which continuously causes power control circuit 130 to supply battery power from continuously recharging battery 126, to the power distribution circuit 125, thereby enabling continuous scanner operation in the hands-free mode of operation.

      In the illustrative embodiment, when power control switch 130 is in its reset (i.e. POWER ON) state, power from battery power unit 126 is provided to first control circuit C1, priffary, oscillator circuit 101 and IR object sensing circuit 106 and object detection circuit 107 so as to enable their operation, while only biasing voltages are provided to all other system components so that they are each initially disabled from operation.

      As shown in FIG. 8, primary clock oscillator circuit 101 supplies a periodic pulsed signal to both the system override signal detection circuit and the object detection circuit.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative embodiment, the primary oscillation circuit is designed to operate at a low frequency (e.g., about 1.0 Khz) and a very low duty cycle (e.g, about 1.0%).
      <br/>
      The "ON" time for the system override signal producing means and the IR object sensing circuit is proportional to the duty cycle of the primary oscillation circuit.
      <br/>
      This feature allows for minimal operating current when the bar code symbol reading device is in the object detection mode and also when the system override signal producing device is activated (i.e., produces a system override signal).
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      As shown in FIG. 8B, primary oscillation circuit 101 comprises a Schmidtt trigger 142, invertors 143 and 144, and a NMOS Field-Effect Transistor (FET) 145. As shown, the output of trigger 142 is connected to the inputs of both invertors 143 and 144.
      <br/>
      The output of invertor 143 produces clock signal CLK which is provided to system override signal detection circuit 100 and object detection circuit 107.
      <br/>
      The primary oscillation circuit is connected to first RC network 102 which comprises resistors R1 and R2, and capacitor C1 configured as shown in FIG. 8B. The function of the RC network 102 is to establish the duty cycle and the oscillation period of the primary oscillator circuit.
      <br/>
      As shown, two time constants (i.e., loads) are established by the network using capacitor C1 and resistors R1 and R2.
      <br/>
      The RC combination of R1 and C1 establishes the period of the oscillator.
      <br/>
      The ratio of the R2 to R1 provides the duty cycle of the oscillator.
      <br/>
      The value of R2 is approximately 100 times smaller than R1 to establish a 1.0% duty cycle.
      <br/>
      As shown in the timing diagram of FIG. 8C, the clock signal CLK remains low while the V1 1 signal ramps up.
      <br/>
      This ramp up time is the time it takes for the capacitor C1 to charge through R1.
      <br/>
      The clock signal CLK then goes HIGH for the shorter discharge time of the capacitor through R2.
      <br/>
      By adjusting the duty cycle (i.e., increasing or decreasing the value of resistor R2), the sensitivity of the object detection circuit can be tuned such that it activates consistently at a specified distance from the light transmission a window of the bar code symbol reading device.

      In accordance with the present invention, the purpose of object detection circuit 107 is to produce a first control activation signal A1 =1 upon determining that an object (e.g., product, document, etc.) is present within the object detection field of the bar code symbol reading device, and thus at least a portion of the scan field thereof.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 8, the object detection circuit is activated (i.e., enabled) by enabling, signal E0 supplied from first control circuit C1, and the object detection circuit provides the first control circuit C1 with first control activation signal A1 =1 when an object residing in the scan field is detected.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative embodiment, an "active" technique of automatic object detection is employed, although it is understood that "passive" techniques may be used with acceptable results.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 8, the object detection means of the system comprises two major subcomponents, namely object sensing circuit 106 and object detection circuit 107, both of which are locally controlled by control circuit C1.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative embodiment, object sensing circuit comprises an IR LED 148 driven by an IR transmitter drive circuit 149, and an IR phototransistor (or photodiode) 150 activated by an IR receive biasing circuit 151.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 7D and 7F, these components are arranged and mounted on PC board 41 so as to provide an object detection field that spatially encompasses the laser scanning plane, as described above.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 8, the object detection circuit 107 produces an enable signal IR DR which is provided to the IR transmitter drive circuit 149.
      <br/>
      The signal produced from IR phototransistor 151, identified as IR REC, is provided as input signal to the object detection circuit 107 for signal processing in a manner which will be described in detail below.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative embodiment, infrared LED 148 generates a 900 nanometer signal that is pulsed at the rate of the primary oscillation circuit 101 (e.g., 1.0 KHZ) when the object detection circuit is enabled by enable signal E0 produced from the first control circuit C1.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the duty cycle of the primary oscillation circuit 101 is less than 1.0% in order to keep the average current consumption very low.
    </p>

      As shown in FIG. 3A, in particular, this pulsed optical signal is transmitted from infrared LED 148 to broadly illuminate the scan field.
      <br/>
      When an object is present within the object detection portion of the scan field, a reflected optical pulse signal is produced and focussed through focusing lens 153 onto photodiode 150.
      <br/>
      The function of photodiode 150 is to receive (i.e., sense) the reflected optical pulse signal and, in response thereto, produce a current signal IR REC.

      As shown in FIG. 8D, produced current signal IR RE (is provided as input to the current-to-voltage amplifier (e.g., transconductance amplifier) 155 in the object detection circuit, and is converted into a voltage signal Vo.
      <br/>
      Within the object detection circuit 107, the infra-red LED drive signal IR DR is produced as the output of AND gate 157, whose inputs are enabling signal E0 supplied from the first control circuit C1 and the pulsed clock signal CLK supplied from the primary oscillation circuit 101.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      As shown in FIG. 8D, enabling signal E0 is also provided to current-to-voltage amplifier circuit 155, and the output voltage signal from AND gate 157 is provided as the second input to the synchronous transmitter/receiver circuit 156.
      <br/>
      Notably, the output voltage signal from AND gate 157 and the output voltage signal V0 from the current-to-voltage amplifier correspond to the IR pulse signal trains transmitted from and received by object sensing circuit 106.
      <br/>
      The function of the synchronous transmitter/receiver circuit is to cyclically compare the output voltage signal from AND gate 157 and the output voltage signal V0 from the current-to-voltage amplifier, and if these voltage signals synchronously match each other for a minimum of three (3) consecutive cycles of the primary oscillation circuit 101, then synchronous transmitter/receiver circuit 156 produces as output, a first control activation signal A1 =1, indicative that an object is present in the scan field of the bar code symbol reading device.
      <br/>
      Conversely, whenever first control activation signal A1 =0 is produced, then this condition indicates that an object is not present in the scan field.

    <p num="96">
      Alternatively, the automatic bar code reading device of the present invention can be readily adapted to sense ultrasonic energy reflected off an object present within the scan field.
      <br/>
      In such an alternative embodiment, object sensing circuit 106 is realized as an ultrasonic energy transmitting/receiving mechanism.
      <br/>
      In the housing of the bar code reading device, ultrasonic energy is generated and transmitted forwardly into the scan field.
      <br/>
      Then, ultrasonic energy reflected off an object within the object detection field is detected adjacent to the transmission window using an ultrasonic energy detector that produces an analog electrical signal (i.e., UE REC) indicative of the detected intensity of received ultrasonic energy.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a focusing element is disposed in front of the energy detector in order to effectively maximize the collection of ultrasonic energy reflected off objects in the scan field.
      <br/>
      In such instances, the focusing element essentially determines the geometrical characteristics of the object detection field of the device.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the energy focusing (i.e., collecting) characteristics of the focusing element will be selected to provide an object detection field which spatially encompasses at least a portion of the scan field.

    <p num="97">
      In the illustrative embodiment, object detection circuit 107 is provided with two different modes of detection, namely, a long-range mode of object detection and a short-range mode of object detection.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 8 and 8D, these modes are set by range selection circuit 115 using mode enable signal R1.
      <br/>
      When induced into the long-range mode of object detection, object detection circuit 107 will generate first control activation signal A1 =1 whenever an object has been detected within the operative range of the object detection field, independent of the particular distance at which the object resides from the transmissive window.
      <br/>
      When induced into the short-range mode of object detection, the object detection circuit will generate first activation control signal A1 =1 only when an object is detected at a distance within the short-range of the object detection field.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      As schematically indicated in FIGS. 2 and 2A, the long-range specification for object detection is preferably preselected to be the full or entire range of sensitivity provided by current-to-voltage amplifier (e.g., 0 to about 10 inches) .
      <br/>
      Preferably, the short-range specification for object detection is preselected to be the reduced range of sensitivity provided by the IR sensing circuit when mode enable signal EIRT =1 is provided to the desensitization port of amplifier 155.
      <br/>
      In the illustrated embodiment, the short-range of object detection is about 0 to about 3 inches or so to provide CCD-like scanner emulation.
      <br/>
      As will become apparent hereinafter, the inherently limited depth and width of field associated with the short-range mode of object detection prevents laser scanning mechanism 108 from flooding the scan field with laser scanning light and thus inadvertently detecting undesired bar code symbols.
      <br/>
      Particular uses to which object detection range selection can be put, will be described in greater detail hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      As shown in FIG. 8D, the sensitivity (i.e., gain) of current-to-voltage amplifier 155 is controlled by a sensitivity control signal EIRT produced from range control signal generating circuit 158.

      In the illustrative embodiment, the sensitivity control signal EIRT 160 is produced by a resistance network whose values are selected using an analog switch that is responsive to a range select signal R1 produced by range selection circuit 115.
      <br/>
      As such, the sensitivity of the current-to-voltage amplifier is simply adjusted by selecting one of two resistance values within the resistance network used to realize range control signal generating circuit 158.
      <br/>
      The short range mode of object detection is enabled by selecting a resistance value that produces an amplifier gain that is lower than that produced during the long-range mode, of object detection where detectable objects can reside further away from the light transmission window of the bar code symbol reading device.

      In general, first control logic block C1 provides the first level of system control.

      The output voltage of comparator amplifier 172 keeps transistor 174 in its non-conducting state (i.e., OFF), via NOR gate 171, thus allowing the external RC network 105 to charge to capacity.
      <br/>
      When comparator input voltage Vx exceeds reference voltage VCC/2, the comparator output voltage biases (i.e., switches ON) transistor 174 so as to begin discharging the RC timing network 105, until input voltage Vx falls below reference voltage VCC/2 upon which the process repeats, thus generating a digital clock oscillation at the comparator output.
      <br/>
      The timing cycle of digital output signal B is initiated by a transition on the activation control signal A, which toggles flip-flop 170.
      <br/>
      This toggling action sets the digital output signal B to its logical HIGH state, resetting clock divide circuit 173 and starting the digital clocks oscillator described above by toggling the Q output of flip-flop 170.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 8F, clock divide circuit 173 is constructed by cascading eleven flip-flop circuits together in a conventional manner.
      <br/>
      Each stage of the clock divider circuit divides the input clock signal frequency by the factor 2.
      <br/>
      Thus the clock divider circuit provides an overall division factor of 2048.
      <br/>
      When the clock output CLK/2048 toggles, the flip-flop circuit is cleared thus setting the digital signal B to logical LOW until the next pulse of the activation control signal A1.

      As reflected in the Boolean expressions of FIG. 8G, the state of each of the enable signals E0, E1 and E2 produced by the first control circuit C1 is dependent on whether the bar code symbol reading system is in its override state of operation.

      Also, when the laser scanning and photoreceiving circuits are activated (i.e., B=1) and override signal C3 /C1 -1=1, then enable signal E0 =1 and therefore the object detection circuit is automatically deactivated.
      <br/>
      The advantage of this control strategy is that it is generally not desirable to have both the laser scanning circuit 108 and photoreceiving circuit 109 and the object sensing circuit 105 active at the same time, as the wavelength of the infrared LED 148 typically falls within the optical input spectrum of the photoreceiving circuit 109.

      In order to repeatedly scan the produced laser beam over the scanning volume, the rotating polygon is rapidly accelerated to operating speed by motor 37 driven by a conventional driver circuit 181, as shown.
      <br/>
      Stationary mirror 44 directs the laser beam from the laser diode to the rotating polygon.
      <br/>
      To selectively activate both laser light source 38 and motor 37, a laser diode and scanning motor enable signal E1 provided as input to driver circuits 178 and 181.
      <br/>
      When enable it signal E1 is a logical "high" level (i.e., E1 =1) a laser beam is generated and projected through the light transmissive window, when the projected laser beam is repeatedly scanned through the scanning volume, and an optical scan data signal is thereby produced off the object (and bar code) residing within the scanning volume.
      <br/>
      When a laser diode and scanning motor enable signal E1 is a logical "low" (i.e., E1 =0), there is no laser beam produced, projected, or scanned across the scanning volume.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      When a bar code symbol is present on the detected object at the time of scanning, the visible laser beam is automatically scanned across the bar code symbol within the 3-D scanning volume, and incident laser light on the bar code symbol will be scattered and reflected.
      <br/>
      This scattering/reflection process produces a laser light return signal of variable intensity which represents a spatial variation of light reflectivity characteristic of the pattern of bars and spaces comprising the bar code symbol.
      <br/>
      Photoreceiving circuit 109 detects at least a portion of the reflected laser light of variable intensity and produces an analog scan data signal Dindicative of the detected light intensity.
    </p>
    <p num="108">In the illustrative embodiment, photoreceiving circuit 109 generally comprises a number of components, namely: laser light collection optics (i.e., stationary mirror array 38 and focusing mirror 43) for focusing reflected laser light for subsequent detection; photoreceiver 41 (e.g., a silicon photosensor) mounted onto PC board 40, as shown in FIG. 5D, for detecting laser light focused by the light collection optics; and frequency selective filter 186A, mounted in front of photoreceiver 41, for transmitting thereto only optical radiation having wavelengths up to a small band above 670 nanometers.</p>
    <p num="109">
      In order to prevent optical radiation slightly below 670 nanometers from passing through light transmission aperture 12A and entering the housing, the light transmissive window 68 realized as a plastic filter lens is installed over the light transmission aperture of the housing.
      <br/>
      This plastic filter lens has optical characteristics which transmit only optical radiation from slightly below 670 nanometers.
      <br/>
      In this way, the combination of plastic filter lens 12 at the transmission aperture and frequency selective filter 186A before photoreceiver 41 cooperate to form a narrow band-pass optical filter having a center frequency fc =670 nanometers.
      <br/>
      By permitting only optical radiation associated with the visible laser beam to enter the housing, this optical arrangement provides improved signal-to-noise ratio for detected scan data signals D1.
      <br/>
      This novel filtering optical arrangement is disclosed in greater detail in copending application Ser.

      In response to reflected laser light focused onto photo receiver 41, photoreceiver 41 produces an analog electrical signal which is proportional to the intensity of the detected laser light.
      <br/>
      This analog signal is subsequently amplified by preamplifier 187 to produce analog scan data signal D1.
      <br/>
      In short, laser scanning circuit 108 and photoreceiving circuit 109 cooperate to generate analog scan data signals D1 from the scan field, over time intervals specified by first control circuit C1 during normal modes of operation, and by third control module C3 during "control override" modes of operation.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      As illustrated in FIG. 8, analog scan data signal D1 is provided as input to A/D conversion circuit 110, shown in FIG. 8H. In a manner well known in the art, A/D conversion circuit 110 processes analog scan data signal D1 to provide a digital scan data signal D2 which has a waveform that resembles a pulse width modulated signal, where logical "1" signal levels represent spaces of the scanned bar code and logical "0" signal levels represent bars of the scanned bar code. A/D conversion circuit 110 can be realized using any conventional A/D conversion techniques well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Digitized scan data signal D2 is then provided as input to bar code presence detection circuit 111 and symbol decoding module 119 for use in performing particular functions required during the bar code symbol reading process of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      The primary purpose of bar code presence detection circuit 111 is to determine whether a bar code is present in or absent from the scan field, over time intervals specified by first control circuit C1 during normal modes of operation and by third control module C3 during control override modes of operation.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative embodiment, bar code presence detection circuit 111 indirectly detects the presence of a bar code in the narrowly-confined scanning volume 13 by detecting its bar code symbol "envelope".
      <br/>
      In the illustrative embodiment, a bar code symbol envelope is deemed present in the scanning volume upon detecting a corresponding digital pulse sequence in digital signal D2 that A/D conversion circuit 110 produces when photoreceiving circuit 109 detects laser light reflected off a bar code symbol scanned by the laser beam produced by laser beam scanning circuit 108.
      <br/>
      This digital pulse sequence detection process is achieved by counting the number of digital pulse transitions (i.e., falling pulse edges) that occur in digital scan data signal D2 within a predetermined time period T1 clocked by the bar code symbol detection circuit.
      <br/>
      According to the laws of physics governing the laser scanning operation, the number of digital (pulse-width modulated) pulses detectable at photoreceiver 41 during time period T1 is a function of the distance of the bar code from the light transmission window 12 at the time of scanning.
      <br/>
      Thus a bar code symbol scanned at 6" from the light transmission window will produce a larger number of digital pulses (i.e., digital count) at photoreceiver 41 during time period T1 than will the same bar code symbol scanned at 3" from the light transmission window.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      In the illustrative embodiment, the bar code symbol detection circuit 111 is provided with the capacity to detect the presence of a bar code symbol in either the long or short range portions of the scanning volume, as specified in FIGS. 3 and 3A. This is achieved by counting the digital pulse transitions present in digital scan signal D2 within predetermined time period T1 and producing second control activation signal A2S (i.e., A2S =1) when the counted number of pulse transitions equals or exceeds a first prespecified digital pulse transition count corresponding to a bar code symbol scanned in the short range portion of the scan field, and producing second control activation signal A2L (i.e., A2L =1) when the counted number of pulse transitions equals or exceeds a second prespecified digital pulse transition count corresponding to a bar code symbol scanned in the long range portion of the scanning volume.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 8, both of these second control activation signals A2L and A2S are produced and provided as input to second control circuit C2.
      <br/>
      However, second control circuit C2 selectively provides (e.g., gates) the second control activation signal that corresponds to range-mode of operation selected by the user.
      <br/>
      When the long range mode of operation has been selected by range selection circuit 115, the device will automatically undergo a transition from bar code presence detection state to bar code symbol reading state upon receiving control activation signal A2L =1.
      <br/>
      Similarly, when the short range mode of operation has been selected by the range selection circuit 115, the device will automatically undergo a transition from bar code presence detection state to bar code symbol reading state upon receiving control activation signal A2S =1.

      In the illustrative embodiment, bar code symbol presence detection circuit 111 comprises a digital pulse transition counter 190 for counting digital pulse transitions during time period T1, and a digital clock circuit (i.e., TBCD circuit) 191 for measuring (i.e., counting) time period TBCD and producing a count reset signal CNT RESET at the end of each such time period, as shown in FIG. 8K. As shown in FIG. 8K, the function of digital clock circuit 191 is to provide a time period TBCD (i.e., time window subdivision) within which the bar code symbol detection circuit attempts, repeatedly during time period T1, to detect a bar code symbol in the scan field.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, TBCD is about 0.1 seconds, whereas T1 is about 1.0 second.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 8I, in order to establish such "bar code search" time it subintervals within time period T1, the digital clock circuit 191 generates the first count reset pulse signal CNT RESET upon the detection of the first pulse transition in digital scan data signal D2.
      <br/>
      The effect of this reset signal is to clear or reset the digital pulse transition (falling edge) counter.
      <br/>
      Then at the end of each time subinterval TBCD, digital clock signal 191 generates another count reset pulse CNT RESET to reset the digital pulse transition counter.
      <br/>
      If during time window T1, a sufficient number of pulse transitions in signal D2 are counted over a subinterval TBCD, then either control activation signal A2L or A2S, will be set to "1".
      <br/>
      In response to the detection of this condition, second control circuit C2 automatically enables control activation C3 in order to initiate a transition from the bar code symbol detection state of operation to the bar code symbol reading state of operation.

      As illustrated in FIG. 9, the data packet transmission circuit comprises a carrier signal generation circuit 230, a carrier signal frequency modulation circuit 231, a power amplifier 232, a matching filter 233, and a quarterwave (1/4) transmitting antenna element 234.
      <br/>
      The function of the carrier signal generation circuit 2303 is to generate a carrier signal having a frequency in the RF region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative embodiment, the carrier frequency is about 912 Mhz, although it is understood that this frequency may vary from one embodiment of the present invention, to another embodiment thereof.
      <br/>
      As the carrier signal is being transmitted from transmitting antenna 234, frequency modulation circuitry 231 modulates the instantaneous frequency of the carrier signal using the digital data sequence (i.e., digital data stream) 235 constituting the group of data packets synthesized by the data packet synthesis module 120.

      The function of the power amplifier is to amplify the power of the transmitted modulated carrier signal so that it may be received by a base unit of the present invention located within a predetermined data transmission range (e.g., from about 0 to about 30 feet).
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      In general, each base unit of the present invention performs a number of functions.
      <br/>
      First, the base unit receives the modulated carrier signal transmitted from a hand-supportable bar code symbol reading device within the data reception range of the base unit.
      <br/>
      Secondly, the base unit demodulates the received carrier signal to recover the data packet modulated thereunto during signal transmission.
      <br/>
      Thirdly, the base unit analyzes each of the recovered data packets to determine whether the received carrier signal was transmitted from a hand-supportable bar code symbol reading device preassigned to the receiving base unit.
      <br/>
      Fourthly, the base unit recovers the symbol character data from at least one data packet in a transmitted group of data packets, and ascertaining the reliability of the recovered symbol character data.
      <br/>
      Fifthly, the base unit generates an acoustical acknowledgement signal SACK that can be audibly perceived by the operator of the transmitting bar code symbol reading device while located in the data reception range of the base unit.
      <br/>
      Finally, the base unit transmits the received symbol character data to a host computer system or like device.
      <br/>
      Each of these functions will be described in greater detail during the detailed description of the Main System Control Routine set forth in FIGS. 13A to 13C.
    </p>
    <p num="126">In order to better understand the functions performed by the bar code symbol reading device and base unit of the present invention, it will be helpful to first describe the principles underlying the data communication method of the present invention, and thereafter discuss the role that the base unit plays in carrying out this communication method.</p>
    <p num="127">
      In general, one or more bar code symbol reading devices can be mated (i.e. registered or assigned) to operate with a single base unit 3.
      <br/>
      In a first illustrative embodiment of the present invention, each bar code symbol reading device is a (resultant) system of bar code symbol reading subsystems installed in physical proximity with each other.
      <br/>
      Typically, each system is a point of sale (POS) station comprising (i) a host computer system interfaced� with a base unit of the present invention and (ii) an automatic hand-supportable bar code symbol reading device preassigned to one of the base units.
      <br/>
      In such an illustrative arrangement, each bar code symbol reading device is mated (i.e. registered or associated) with a single base unit by storing a unique, preassigned "Transmitter Identification Code" in a memory device within the assigned base unit during a set-up procedure.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      In the illustrative embodiment, the carrier frequency of the data packet transmitter in each bar code symbol reading device is substantially the same for all bar code symbol reading devices in the resultant system.
      <br/>
      Also, the data packet transmission range of each bar code symbol reading device will be substantially greater than the distance between each bar code symbol reading device and a neighboring base unit to which the bar code symbol reading unit is not assigned.
      <br/>
      Consequently, under such operating conditions, at any instance in time, any base station in the resultant system may simultaneously receive two or more packet modulated carrier signals which have been transmitted from two or more bar code symbol reading devices being used in the resultant system.
      <br/>
      These bar code symbol reading devices may include the bar code symbol reading device preassigned to the particular base unit as well as neighboring bar code symbol reading devices.
      <br/>
      Thus due to the principles of data packet transmission of present invention, there exists the possibility that any particular base unit may simultaneously receive two or more different data packets at any instant in time, thereby creating a "packet interference" situation.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      In order to ensure that each base unit in the resultant system is capable of receiving at least one data packet from a data packet group transmitted by its preassigned bar code symbol reading device (i.e., without risk of interference from neighboring bar code symbol reading device transmitters), the unique "data packet group" transmission scheme shown in FIG. 10 is employed.
      <br/>
      As shown, upon the successful reading of a first bar code symbol and the production of its symbol character data D3, data packet synthesis module 120 aboard the bar code symbol reading device automatically produces a first (i.e., N=1) group of (three) data packets, each having the packet format shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the data packet transmission circuit 121 uses the digital data bit stream, representative of the synthesized data packet group, to modulate a carrier signal transmitted from the hand-supportable bar code symbol reading device.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      In the illustrative example shown FIG. 10, only the second and third data packets of the group sent over the modulated carrier signal are shown as being received by the preassigned base unit.
      <br/>
      As shown in this drawing, the base unit transmits the recovered symbol character data D3 to its host computer system, upon receiving the second data packet in the transmitted group of data packets.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the base unit produces an acoustical acknowledgement signal SACK of sufficient intensity that it can be easily heard by the operator of the bar code symbol reading device that transmitted the received data packet.
      <br/>
      The function of the acoustical acknowledgment signal is to provide the operator with an audible acknowledgement that the symbol character data D3 (associated with the recently read bar code symbol) has been received by the base unit and transmitted to its host computer system for processing and or subsequent storage.
      <br/>
      Notably, while the third data packet N3 is also received by the base unit, the available acknowledgement signal SACK and symbol character data transmission is not produced as packet N3 contains redundant information already received by the second packet N2 of the same group.
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      In the preferred embodiment, the pitch of the transmitted acoustical acknowledgement signal SACK is uniquely specified and assigned to a particular bar code symbol reading unit.
      <br/>
      This way the operator of each bar code symbol reading (sub) system can easily recognize (i.e., discern) the audible acoustical acknowledgement signal produced from the base unit preassigned to his or her bar code symbol reading device.
      <br/>
      At the same time, this pitch assignment scheme allows each operator to ignore audible acoustical acknowledgment signals produced from neighboring base units not mated with his or her portable bar code symbol reading device.
      <br/>
      If after reading a bar code symbol, the operator does not see the visual "good read" indication light on its device "flash " or "blink" and immediately thereafter hear its preassigned acoustical acknowledgement signal emanate from its base unit, then the operator is implicitly informed that the symbol character data of the read bar code symbol was not successfully received by the base unit.
      <br/>
      In response to such an event, the operator simply rereads the bar code symbol and awaits to hear the acoustical acknowledgment signal emanating from the base unit.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      Notably, it may even be desirable in some operating environments to produce acoustical acknowledgement signals in the form of a unique series of notes preassigned to a bar code symbol reading device and its "mated" base unit.
      <br/>
      The pitch or note sequence assigned to each mated base unit and bar code symbol reading device can be stored in a memory (e.g., EPROM) realized in the base unit, and can be programmed at the time of system set-up and modified as required.
      <br/>
      Preferably, each pitch and each note sequence is selected so that it can be readily distinguished and recognized by the operator to which it is uniquely directed.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      Also shown in FIG. 10 is the case where the bar code symbol reading device reads a second bar code symbol and then transmits a second (N=2) group of data packets.
      <br/>
      However, due to interference only the third data packet in the second transmitted group of data packets is received at the respective base unit.
      <br/>
      Despite such group transmission errors (e.g., due to channel corruption or non-radio transmissive obstructions), the base unit as shown is nevertheless able to recover the transmitted symbol character data.
      <br/>
      Upon receiving the third data packet, recovering the packaged symbol character data and transmitting the same to the host computer system, the bar code symbol reading device generates an acoustical acknowledgement signal having a pitch or note sequence that the operator can hear and recognize as an indication that the data packet reception was successful.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      In FIGS. 11 and 12, the data packet transmission and reception scheme of the present invention is shown for the case of three station system.
      <br/>
      In the best case scenario shown in FIG. 11, the group of data packets transmitted from each bar code symbol reading device is transmitted at a time when there are no neighboring bar code symbol reading devices transmitting data packets.
      <br/>
      This case will occur most frequently, as the total transmission times for each group of data packets is selected to be substantially smaller than the random time durations lapsing naturally between adjacent data packet transmissions from neighboring bar code symbol reading devices.
      <br/>
      This fact is illustrated in FIG. 11, in which (i) a group of data packets from bar code reading device No. 1 are transmitted between adjacent groups of data packet transmitted from bar code symbol reading devices Nos. 2, 3 and 4 without the occurrence of data packet interference (i.e., collision).
      <br/>
      In most instances, the time delay between consecutive groups of data packets transmitted from any particular bar code symbol reading device, will be sufficient to permit a neighboring bar code symbol reading device to transmit at least one data packet to its base unit without the occurrence of data packet interference.
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      In accordance with the data transmission scheme of the present invention, data packet interference is minimized by the random presence of interference-free time slots, during which a transmitted data packet can be received at its respective base unit without neighboring packet interference.
      <br/>
      However, the present invention employs additional measures to further reduce the likelihood of data packet interference.
      <br/>
      Such measures are best appreciated when considering a high-density data packet transmission environment, in which a number of closely situated neighboring bar code symbol readers are each attempting to transmit a group of data packets to its preassigned base unit.
      <br/>
      In general, such operating conditions would present a worst case scenario for, the data packet transmission scheme of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      In the worst case scenario shown in FIG. 12, each of the four neighboring bar code symbol reading devices is assumed to consecutively read two bar code symbols and simultaneously begin the transmission of the first data packet in the first group of data packets corresponding to the first read bar code symbol.
      <br/>
      As mentioned above, each data packet is formatted essentially the same way, has substantially the same packet width, and is transmitted on a carrier signal having a frequency which is substantially the same as all other carrier signals transmitted throughout the system.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the data packet transmission circuit 121 in each bar code symbol reading device is preprogrammed to transmit adjacent data packets with a different "time delay", as shown in FIG. 12. This condition is achieved throughout the resulting system by assigning a different Packet Time Delay to each having a different Transmitter Identification Number, and then programming the bar code symbol reading device with the preassigned Packet Time Delay parameter.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 12, the value of the Packet Time Delay parameter programmed in each bar code symbol reading device is selected so that, when the neighboring bar code symbol reading devices simultaneously transmit groups of data packets, each base unit in the resulting system is capable of receiving at least one data packet (in a group thereof) that has been transmitted from its preassigned bar code symbol reading device.
      <br/>
      In general, the data packet delay scheme of the present invention involves selecting and programming the Packet Time Delay parameter in each bar code symbol reading device so that each base unit is periodically provided a vacant time slot, during which one transmitted data packet in each group thereof can be received free of "data packet interference", as shown in FIG. 12. The advantage of providing a packet time delay among the data packets of each transmitted group thereof is that rereading and retransmission of bar code symbols is effectively minimized under the data packet transmission scheme of the present invention.

    <p num="137">Having described the detailed structure and internal functions of automatic bar code symbol reading device of the present invention, the operation of the control system thereof will now be described while referring to the system block diagram shown in FIG. 8 and control Blocks A to GG in FIGS. 13A to 13C.</p>
    <p num="138">
      Beginning at the START block of Main System Control Routine and proceeding to Block A of FIG. 13A, the bar code symbol reading system is "initialized".
      <br/>
      This initialization step involves, activating system override circuit 100, first control circuit C1 and oscillator circuit 101.
      <br/>
      It also involves deactivating (i.e., disabling): (i) all external system components except the range selection circuit 115 and system override signal producing means 103 (i.e., infrared sensing circuit 105, laser scanning circuit 108, and photoreceiving circuit 109); (ii) all subcircuits aboard ASIC chip 133 not associated with the system override circuit 100, such as object detection circuit 107, A/D conversion circuitry 110, second control circuit C2 and bar code presence detection circuit 111; and (iii) third control module 114, sypbol decoding module 119 and data packet synthesis module 120.
      <br/>
      In addition, all timers T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5 are reset to t=0.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      Proceeding to Block B in FIG. 13A, the first control circuit C1 checks to determine whether it has received control activation signal A0 =1 from system override detection circuit 100.
      <br/>
      If this signal is received, then the first control circuit C1 returns to Block A. If control activation signal A0 =1 is not received, then at Block C the first control circuit C1 activates (i.e., enables) the object detection circuit by producing E0.
      <br/>
      At Block D, the object detection circuit receives either the long range mode selection signal or the short range mode selection signal produced by the range selection circuit 115 and sets the appropriate sensitivity level of the circuit.
      <br/>
      At Block E, the first control circuit C1 determines whether it has received control activation signal A1 =1, indicating that an object has been detected within the selected range of the scan field.
      <br/>
      If this control activation signal is not received, then at Block F the first control circuit C1 determines whether its has received control activation signal A0 =1.
      <br/>
      If the first control circuit C1 has received control activation signal A0 =1, then the control system returns to Block A in FIG. 13A, as shown.
      <br/>
      If the first control circuit C1 has not received control activation signal A0 =1, then the control system returns to Block E, as shown.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      If at Block E the first control circuit C1 has received first control activation signal A1 =1, then at Block G the first control circuit C1 (i) deactivates (i.e., disables) the object sensing circuit and the object detection circuit using disabling signal E0 =0, (ii) activates (i.e., enables) laser scanning circuit 108, photoreceiving circuit 109 and A/D signal conversion circuit 110 using enable signal E1 =1, (iii) activates bar code detection circuit 111 and second control circuit C2 using enable signal E2 =1, and (iv) starts timer T1 maintained in the first control circuit C1.
      <br/>
      This permits the bar code symbol reading device to collect and analyze scan data signals for the purpose of determining whether or not a bar code is within the scan field.
      <br/>
      If at Block H the second control circuit C2 does not receive control activation signal A2S =1 or A2L =1 from the bar code detection circuit within time period T1, indicating that a bar code symbol is detected in the selected range of the scan field, then the control system returns to Block A thereby returning system control to the first control unit C1, as shown in FIG. 13A. If at Block H the bar code symbol detection circuit 111 provides the second control circuit C2 with control activation signal A2S =1 or A2L =1, as the case may be, then second control circuit C2 activates (i.e., enables) third control module C3 (i.e., microprocessor 134) using enable signal E3 =1.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      At Block J, the third control module C3 polls (i.e., reads) the parameter R set by range selection circuit 115 and sets a range limit flag in the symbol decoding module 119.
      <br/>
      At Block K third control module C3 activates the symbol decoding module 119 using enable signal E4, resets and restarts timer T2 permitting it to run for a second predetermined time period (e.g., 0&lt;T2 &lt;1 second), and resets and restarts timer T3 permitting it to run for a third predetermined time period (e.g., 0&lt;T3 &lt;5 seconds).
      <br/>
      At Block L the third control module checks to determine whether control activation signal A3 =1 is received from the symbol decoding module 119 within T2 =1 second, indicative that a bar code symbol has been successfully read (i.e., scanned and decoded) within the allotted time period.
      <br/>
      If control activation signal A3 =1 is not received within the time period T2 =1 second, then at Block M third control module C3 checks to determine whether control activating signal A2 =1 is received.
      <br/>
      If a bar code symbol is not detected, then the control system returns to Block A, causing a state transition from bar code reading to object detection.
      <br/>
      However, if at Block M the third control module C3 receives control activation signal A2 =1, indicative that a bar code once again is within the scan field, then at Block N the third control module C3 checks to determine whether time period T3 has elapsed.
      <br/>
      If it has, then the control system returns to Block A. If, however, time period O &lt;= T3 &lt;= 5 seconds has not elapsed, then at Block K the third control module C3 resets and restarts timer T2 to run once again for a time period O &lt;= T2 &lt;= 1 second, while T3 continues to run.
      <br/>
      In essence, this provides the device at least another opportunity to read a bar code present within the scan field when the control system is at control Block L. During typical bar code reading applications, the control system may progress through the control loop defined by Blocks K-L-M-N-K several times before a bar code symbol in the scan field is read within the time period allotted by timer T3.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      Upon receiving control activation signal A3 =1 from symbol decoding module 119, indicative that a bar code symbol has been successfully read, the control system proceeds to Block O in FIG. 13B. At this stage of the system control process, the third, control module C3 continues activation of laser scanning circuit 108, photoreceiving circuit 109, and A/D conversion circuit 110, while deactivating symbol decoding module 119 and commencing activation of data packet synthesis module 120.
      <br/>
      While the laser beam is continuously scanned across the scan field, the operations at Blocks P to V described below, are carried out in a high speed manner under the orchestration of control module C3.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      As indicated at Block P, data packet synthesis module 120 first sets the Packet Number to "1", and increments the Packet Group Number from the previous number.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the data packet synthesis module keeps track of (i.e., manages) the "Packet Number" using a first modulo-N counter realized by programmable microprocessor 134, while it manages the "Packet Group Number" using a second modulo-M counter also realized by programmed microprocessor 134.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative embodiment, the first modulo counter has a cyclical count range of N=2 (i.e., 0,1,2,0,1,2, . . . ), whereas the second modulo counter has a cyclical jcount range of M=10 (i.e., 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2, . . . ).
      <br/>
      At Block Q, the data packet synthesis module synthesizes or constructs a data packet having a packet format as shown in FIG. 9, i.e., consisting of symbol character data, a Transmitter Identification Number, a Packet Number, a Packet Group Number, check character, and Packet Start and End (i.e., framing) Characters.
      <br/>
      After the data packet has been formed and the digital data sequence constituting the same is buffered, the third control module C3 activates at Block R the data packet transmission circuit.
      <br/>
      Thereafter at Block S, the data packet synthesis module outputs the buffered digital data sequence (of the first synthesized data packet of the group) to the data packet transmission circuit, which uses the digital data sequence to modulate the frequency of the carrier signal as it is being transmitted from the bar code symbol reading device, to its mated base unit, as described hereinabove, and then automatically deactivates itself to conserve power.
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      At Block T, the third control module C3 determines whether the Packet Number counted by the first module counter is less than "3".
      <br/>
      If the Packet Number of the recently transmitted data packet is less than "3", indicative that at most only two data packets in a specific group have been transmitted, then at Block U the data packet synthesis module 120 increments the Packet Number by +1.
      <br/>
      At Block V, the third control module then waits for a time delay T5 to lapse prior to the control system returning to Block Q, as shown in FIG. 13B. Notably, the occurrence of time delay T5 causes a delay in transmission of the next data packet in the data packet group.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 12, the duration of time delay T5 is a function of the (last two digits of the) Transmitter Numbers of the current data packet group, and thus is a function of the bar code symbol reading device transmitting symbol character data to its mated base unit.
      <br/>
      For the case of three data packet groups, time delay T5 will occur between the transmission of the first and second data packets in a packet group and between the transmission of the second and third data packets in the same packet group.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      Returning to Block Q, the data packet synthesis module synthesizes or constructs the second data packet in the same data packet group.
      <br/>
      After the second data packet has been formed and the digital data sequence constituting the same is buffered, the third control module C3 reactivates at Block R the data packet transmission circuit.
      <br/>
      Thereafter at Block S, the data packet synthesis module outputs the-buffered digital data sequence (of the second synthesized data packet) to the data packet transmission circuit, which uses the digital data sequence to modulate the frequency of the carrier signal as it is being transmitted from the bar code symbol reading device, to its mated base unit, and thereafter automatically deactivates itself.
      <br/>
      When at Block T third control module C3 determines that the Packet Number is equal to "3", the control system advances to Block W in FIG. 13C.
    </p>
    <p num="146">
      At Block W in FIG. 13C, the third control module C3 continues activation of laser scanning circuit 108 photoreceiving circuit 109, and A/D conversion circuit 110 using control override signals C3 /C1, and deactivates symbol decoding module 119, data packet synthesis module 120 and the data packet transmission circuit 121 using disable signals E4 =0, E5 =0 and E6 =0, respectively.
      <br/>
      Then at Block X the third control module C3 determines whether control activation signal A1 =1, indicating that an object is present in the selected range of the scan field.
      <br/>
      If this control activation signal is not provided to the third control module C3 then the control system returns to Block A, as shown.
      <br/>
      If control activation signal A1 =1 is received, then at Block Y the third control module C3 reactivates the bar code symbol detection circuit using override signal C3 /C2, and resets and restarts timer T3 to start running over its predetermined time period, i.e., 0&lt;T3 &lt;5 seconds, and resets and restart timer T4 for a predetermined time period 0&lt;T4 &lt;3 seconds.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      At Block Z in FIG. 13C, the third control module C3 then determines whether control activation signal A2 =1 is produced from the bar code symbol detection circuit 111 within time period T4, indicating that a bar code symbol is present in the selected range of the scan field during this time period.
      <br/>
      If this signal is not produced within time period T4, then at Block AA the third control module C3 deactivates the bar code symbol detection circuit using override signal C3 /C2, and reactivates the bar code symbol decoding module 119 using enable signal E4 =1.
      <br/>
      At Block BB, the third control module C3 resets and restarts timer T2 to run over its predetermined time period, i.e., 0&lt;T2 &lt;1 second.
      <br/>
      At Block CC the third control module C3 determines whether control activation signal A3 =1 is produced by the symbol decoding module within time period T2, indicating that the detected bar code symbol has been successfully decoded within this time period.
      <br/>
      If this control activation signal is not produced within time period T2, then at Block DD the third control module C3 determines whether control activation signal A2 =1 is being produced from the bar code symbol detection circuit, indicating that either the same or another bar code symbol resides within the selected range of the scan field.
      <br/>
      If control activation signal A2 =1 is not being produced, then the control system returns to Block A, as shown.
      <br/>
      However, if this control signal is being produced, then at Block EE the third control module C3 determines whether or not timer T3 has lapsed, indicating that time window to read a bar code symbol without redetecting the object on which it is disposed, is closed.
      <br/>
      When this condition exists, the control system returns to Block BB FIG. 13A. However, it time remains on timer T3, then at Block A in the third control module C3 resets and restarts timer T2 and returns to Block CC.
      <br/>
      As mentioned above, the control system may flow through the control loop defined by Blocks BB-CC-DD-EE-BB a number of times prior to reading a bar code within time period T3.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      When the symbol decoding module produces control activation signal A3 =1 within time period T2, the third control module C3 determines at Block FF whether the decoded bar code symbol is different from the previously decoded bar code symbol.
      <br/>
      If the decoded bar code symbol is different than the previously decoded bar code symbol, then the control system returns to Block O in FIG. 13B. If the currently decoded bar code symbol is not different than the previously decoded bar code symbol, then the third control module C3 determines whether timer T3 has lapsed.
      <br/>
      If the timer T3 has not lapsed, then the control system returns to Block BB and reenters the control flow defined at Blocks BB through GG, attempting once again to detect and read a bar code symbol on the detected object.
      <br/>
      However, if at Block GG timer T3 has lapsed, then the control system returns to Block A in FIG. 13A.

      In FIG. 16, the system architecture of base unit 3 is schematically represented.

      <br/>
      The details of such a programming implementation are known by those with ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention pertains.

    <p num="155">
      As shown in FIG. 16, receiving antenna element 274 is electrically coupled to an input signal port of radio receiver circuit 275 in a conventional manner.
      <br/>
      In general, the function of radio receiver circuit 275 is to receive and process the data-packet modulated carrier signal transmitted from a remote bar code symbol reader to its mated base unit.
      <br/>
      The radio receiver circuit of the illustrative embodiment can be realized by configuring several commercially available IC chips together, although it is understood that there are certainly other ways in which to realize the basic functions of this circuit.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 16A, receiving antenna 274 is connected to a matching filter circuit 287 realized using miniature inductive and capacitive components.
      <br/>
      The matching filter circuit is tuned to pass a 912 MHz RF carrier signal transmitted from the data packet transmission circuit 121 of the bar code symbol reading device.
      <br/>
      The output of matching filter circuit 287 is connected to the input of a first IC chip 288 which converts (i.e., translates) the frequency spectrum of the received modulated carrier signal down to an intermediate frequency band, for subsequent signal processing.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative embodiment, the first IC chip 288 is realized using the MAF2001 IC chip from Motorola, Inc., and provides a low noise amplifier 289, an double balanced mixer 290.
      <br/>
      A local oscillator 292 is needed to provide a local oscillator signal of about 922.7 MHZ for use in frequency down-conversion in the double balanced mixer 290.
      <br/>
      Typically, a matching filter 291 is commonly required between local oscillator 292 and mixer 290.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 16A, the output of the first IC chip is provided to a band-pass filter 293 tuned to about 10.7 MHZ, the intermediate frequency band of each base unit.
      <br/>
      The intermediate signal is then provided as input to a second IC chip 294.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative embodiment, the second IC chip 294 is realized using the MC13156 IC chip commercially available from Motorola, and provides inter alia an amplification circuit, a quadrature demodulation circuit 295, a binary thresholding circuit 296, and carrier signal detection circuit 297.
      <br/>
      The function of the second IC chip is four-fold.
      <br/>
      The first function of the second IC chip is to filter and amplify the intermediate signal to produce in-phase and quadrature phase signal components for use in digital data recovery.
      <br/>
      The second function of the second IC chip is to recover an analog data signal at the base band portion of the spectrum, by providing the in-phase and quadrature-phase signal components to the quadrature demodulation circuit 295.
      <br/>
      Suitable quadrature demodulation circuitry for use in practicing the present invention is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,979,230 to Marz, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 16A, the third function of the second IC chip is to convert the analog data signal produced from quadrature demodulation circuit 295 into a digital data signal using a binary-level thresholding circuit 296.
      <br/>
      The fourth function of the second IC chip is to analyze the incoming signal from the output of band-pass filter 293 in order to detect the incoming carrier signal and produce a carrier detect signal A7 to the base unit system controller 278.
      <br/>
      In order to produce a CMOS compatible signal, the recovered digital data signal produced from second IC chip 294 is amplified by a current amplification circuit 298 that is operative whenever a carrier signal is detected (i.e., A7 =1).
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 16, the output of current amplification, circuit 298 is a serial data stream that is clocked into data packet storage buffer 277 under the control of base unit system controller 278.
      <br/>
      In general, the data packet storage buffer 277 can be realized using a commercially available Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) device.
      <br/>
      The primary function of data packet buffer memory 277 is to buffer bytes of digital data in the produced digital data stream.

      In the illustrative embodiment, it necessary to provide a means within the base unit housing, to recharge the batteries contained within the hand-supportable housing of the portable bar code symbol reading device.
      <br/>
      Typically, DC electrical power will be available from the host computer system 6, to which, the base unit is operably connected by way of flexible cables 7 and 8.
      <br/>
      An electrical arrangement for achieving this function is set forth in FIG. 16. As shown, power supply circuit 273 aboard the base unit of the present invention comprises a conventional current chopper circuit 299, a high-pass electrical filter 300 in parallel therewith, and a primary inductive coil 301 in parallel with the high-pass electrical filter.
      <br/>
      Low voltage DC electrical power provided from the host computer system by way of power cable 8 is provided to direct current (DC) chopper circuit 299, which is realized on PC board 270 using high-speed current switching circuits.
      <br/>
      The function of current chopper circuit 299 is to convert the input DC voltage to the circuit into a high-frequency triangular-type (time-varying) waveform, consisting of varilous harmonic signal components.
      <br/>
      The function of the high-pass electrical filter is to filter out the lower frequency signal components and only pass the higher frequency signal components to the inductive coil 301.
      <br/>
      As such, the high frequency electrical currents permitted to flow through inductive coil 301 induce a high voltage thereacross and produce time-varying magnetic flux (i.e., lines of force).
      <br/>
      In accordance with well known principles of electrical energy transfer, the produced magnetic flux transfers electrical power from the base unit to the rechargeable battery aboard the bar code symbol reading device, whenever the primary and secondary inductive coils aboard the base unit and the mated device are electromagnetically coupled by the magnetic flux.
      <br/>
      In order to maximize energy transfer between the base unit and its mated device during battery recharging operations, high permeability materials and well known principles of magnetic circuit design can be used, to increase the amount of magnetic flux coupling the primary and secondary inductive coils of the battery recharging circuit.

    <p num="157">Referring to FIG. 16, the function of each of the data processing modules of base unit 3 will now be described in detail.</p>
    <p num="158">
      Upon reception of an incoming carrier signal and the recovery of the digital data stream therefrom, base unit system controller 278 orchestrates the processing of the recovered digital data stream.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 16, the operation of data processing modules 279, 280, 281, 282 and 283 are enabled by the production of enable signals EPFC, ETID, EDPID, EDE, and EDFC, respectively, from the base unit system controller.
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      The primary function of data packet frame check module 279 is to analyze all of the data bytes in the received data packet, including the Start and End of Packet Fields, and determine whether a complete frame (i.e., packet) of digital data bytes has been recovered from the incoming modulated carrier signal.
      <br/>
      If so, then data packet frame check module 279 produces activation control signal APFC =1, which is provided to the base unit system controller, as shown in FIG. 16.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      The primary function of the transmitter number identification module 280 is to analyze the data bytes in the Transmitter ID Field of the received data packet and determine the Transmitter ID Number preassigned to the bar code reading device that transmitted the data packet received by the base unit.
      <br/>
      If the Transmitter ID Number of the received data packet matches the preassigned Base Unit Identification No. stored in non-volatile memory (i.e., EPROM) 302 aboard the base unit, then the transmitter number identification module generates control activation signal ATID =1, which is provided to the base unit system controller.
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      The primary function of the packet number identification module 281 is to analyze the data bytes in the Packet Number Field of the received data packet and determine the Packet Number of the data packet received by the base unit.
      <br/>
      This module then advises the base unit system controller that, a different packet number was received, representing a new group (e.g., now seen) by producing an encoded signal ADPID during the system control process.
    </p>
    <p num="162">The primary function of the symbol character data extraction module 282 is to analyze the data bytes in the Symbol Character Data Field of the received data packet, determine the code represented by the symbol character data, and provided this symbol character data to the data format conversion module 283 under the control of the base unit system controller during the system control process.</p>
    <p num="163">
      The primary function of the data format conversion module 283 is to convert the format of the recovered symbol character data, into a data format that can be used by the Lost computer symbol 6 that is to ultimately receive and use the symbol character data.
      <br/>
      In the bar code symbol reading system of first illustrative embodiment, the data format conversion is from ASCII format to RS232 format, although it is understood that other inversions may occur in alternative embodiment of the present if invention.
      <br/>
      Typically, the data format conversion process is carried out using a data format conversion table which contains the appropriate data structure conversions.
    </p>
    <p num="164">
      The primary function of the serial data transmission circuit 284 is to accept the format-converted symbol character data from the data format conversion module 283, and transmit the same :1 as a serial data stream over data communication cable 7, to the data input port of the host computer system 6 (e.g., cash register, data collection device, inventory computer).
      <br/>
      Preferably, an RS-232 data communication protocol is used to facilitate the data transfer process.
      <br/>
      Thus the construction of serial data transmission circuit 284 is conventional and the details thereof are well within the knowledge of those with ordinary skill in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      The primary function of acoustical acknowledgement signal generation circuit 285 is to produce an acoustical acknowledgement signal SA in response to the successful recovery of symbol character data from a transmitted data packet.
      <br/>
      The purpose of the acoustical acknowledgement signal is to notify the user that the transmitted data packet has been successfully received by its mated base unit.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative embodiment, the intensity of the acoustical acknowledgement signal is such that the remotely situated user of the portable bar code symbol reader can easily hear the acoustical acknowledgement signal in an expected work environment having an average noise floor of at least about 50 decibels.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the pitch of the acoustical acknowledgement signal is within the range of about 1 to about 10 kilohertz, in order to exploit the sensitivity characteristics of the human auditory apparatus of the user.
      <br/>
      In the exemplary embodiment, the pitch is about 2.5 kilohertz.
      <br/>
      Under such conditions, the intensity of such an acoustical acknowledgement signal at its point of generation will typically need to have an output signal power of about 70 decibels in order to be heard by the user in a working environment having an average noise floor of about 50 decibels and an average noise ceiling of about 100 decibels.
      <br/>
      Acoustical acknowledgement signals of such character can be produced from acoustical acknowledgement signal generation circuit 285, shown in FIG. 16.
    </p>
    <p num="166">
      As shown in FIG. 16B, acoustical acknowledgement signal generation circuit 285 comprises a number of subcomponents, namely: a decoder circuit 305; a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) driver circuit 306; a VCO circuit 307; an output amplifier circuit 308; and a piezo-electric type electro-acoustic transducer 303 having an output signal bandwidth in the audible range.
      <br/>
      The operation (i.e., duration) of the acoustical acknowledgment signal generation circuit 285 is controlled by base unit system controller 278 using enable signal EAA.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative embodiment, enable signal EAA is a digital word encoded to represent one of a number of possible audible pitches or tones that are to be generated upon each successful reception of a transmitted data packet at a mated base station.
      <br/>
      The function of decoder circuit 305 is to decode the enable signal EAA produced by the base unit system controller and produce a set of voltage signals +V1 1, V2, . . . ,Vn} which correspond to a specified pitch sequence to be produced by eleclro-acoustic transducer 309.
      <br/>
      The function of VCO driver circuit 306 is to sequentially drive VCO circuit 307 with the produced set of voltages +V1 1, V2, . . . ,Vn} so that VCO circuit produces over a short time period (e.g., 0.5-1.5 seconds), a set of electrical signals having frequencies that correspond to the specified pitch sequence to be produced from the electro-acoustic transducer 309.
      <br/>
      The function of amplifier circuit 308 is to amplify these electrical, signals, whereas the function of electro-acoustical transducer 309 is to convert the amplified electrical signal set into the specified pitch sequence for the user to clearly hear in the expected operating environment.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 15A, the base housing is preferably provided with an aperture or sound port 304 so as to permit the energy of the acoustical signal from transducer 309 to freely emanate to the ambient environment of the user.
      <br/>
      In particular application, it may be desired or necessary to produce acoustical acknowledgement signal of yet greater intensity levels that those specified above.
      <br/>
      In such instances, electro-acoustical transducer 309 may be used to excite one or more tuned resonant chamber(s) mounted within or formed as part of the base unit housing.
    </p>
    <p num="167">Having described the structure and general functional components of base unit 3, it is appropriate at this juncture to now describe the overall operation thereof with reference to the control process shown in FIG. 17.</p>
    <p num="168">
      As illustrated at Block A in FIG. 17, radio receiving circuit 275 is the only system component that is normally active at this stage of the base unit system control process.
      <br/>
      All other system components are inactive (i.e., disabled), including base unit system controller 278; data packet storage buffer 277, data packet frame check module 279, transmitter number identification module 280, data packet number Identification module 281, symbol character data extraction module 282, data format conversion module 283, serial data transmission circuit 284, and acoustical acknowledgement signal generation circuit 285.
      <br/>
      With the radio receiving circuit activated, the base unit is capable of receiving any modulated carrier signal transmitted from any of the bar code symbol reading devices within the data transmission range of the base unit.
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      At Block B in FIG. 17, radio receiving circuit 275 deter-mines whether it has received a transmitted carrier signal on its receiving antenna element 274.
      <br/>
      If it has, then the radio, receiving circuit generates a system controller activation signal A7, which activates base unit system controller 278 and signal amplifier 276 shown in FIG. 16 and 16A, respectively.
      <br/>
      Then at Block C, the base unit system controller activates (i.e., enables) data packet storage buffer 277 and data packet frame check module 279 by producing activation control signals ESB=1 and EPFC =1, respectively.
      <br/>
      At Block D, the base unit system controller determines whether it has received an acknowledgement (i.,e., control activation signal APFC =1) from the data packet frame check module, indicating that the received data packet is properly framed.
      <br/>
      If the received data packet is not properly framed, then the base unit returns to Block A in order to redetect an incoming carrier signal.
      <br/>
      However, if the received data packet is properly framed, then at Block E the base unit system controller enables the transmitter number identification module by generating enable signal ETID =1.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      At Block F, the base unit system controller determines whether it has received an acknowledgment (i.e., control activation signal ATID =1) from the transmitter number identification module that the received data packet contains the correct transmitter identification number (i.e., the same number assigned to the base unit and stored in storage unit 276).
      <br/>
      If the Transmitter Identification Number contained within the received data packet does not match the base unit identification number stored in storage unit 276, then the base unit system controller returns to Block A whereupon it resumes carrier signal detection.
      <br/>
      If, however, the transmitter packet number contained within the received data packet matches the base unit identification number, then at Block G the base unit system controller enables the data packet number identification module 289 by generating enable signal EDPID =1.
    </p>
    <p num="171">
      At Block H, the base unit system controller determines whether it has received an acknowledgment (i.e., control activation signal APDID =1) from the data packet identification module indicating that the received data packet is not a redundant data packet (i.e., from the same transmitted data packet group).
      <br/>
      If the received data packet is a redundant data packet, then the base unit system controller returns to Block A, whereupon carrier signal detection; is resumed.
      <br/>
      If, however, the received data packet is not redundant, then at Block the base unit system controller enables the symbol character data extraction module by generating enable signal EDE =1.
      <br/>
      In response to the generation of this enable signal, the symbol data extraction module reads at Block J the symbol character data contained in the received data packet, checks the data for statistical reliability, and the writes the extracted symbol character data bytes into a storage buffer (not explicitly shown).
    </p>
    <p num="172">
      As indicated at Block K in FIG. 17, the base unit system controller then enables the data format conversion module by generating enable signal EDFC =1.
      <br/>
      In response to this enable signal, the data format conversion module converts the data format of the recovered symbol character data and then buffers the format-converted symbol character data bytes in a data buffer (not explicitly shown).
      <br/>
      At Block L the base unit system controller enables the serial data transmission circuit 284 by generating enable signal EDT =1.
      <br/>
      In response to this enable signal, the serial data transmission circuit transmits the format-converted symbol character data bytes over communication cable 7 using serial data transmission techniques well known in the art, as discussed above.
      <br/>
      When the serial data transmission process is successfully completed, the base unit system controller enables at Block M the acoustical acknowledgement signal generation circuit 285 by producing enable signal EAA =1.
      <br/>
      In response to the production of this enable signal, acoustical acknowledgment signal generation circuit 285 generates a high intensity acoustical signal having characteristics of the type described above, thereby informing the user that a transmitted data packet has been received and that the symbol character data packaged therein has been successfully recovered and transmitted to the host computer system.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the base unit system controller returns to the Block A, as shown.
    </p>
    <p num="173">It is appropriate at this juncture to illustrate the automatic hands-on and hands-free modes of operation of the system while utilized in different mounting installations.</p>
    <p num="174">
      A point-of-sale station is shown in FIGS. 18A and 18B, as comprising an electronic cash register 6 operably connected to the automatic bar code reading system of the first illustrative embodiment by way of flexible communication cable 7.
      <br/>
      Low voltage DC power is provided to base unit 3 by way of flexible power supply cable 8.
      <br/>
      In this particular mounting installation, base unit 3 is supported on a horizontal countertop surface.
      <br/>
      If necessary or desired in such mounting installations, the base plate of base unit 3 may be weighted by affixing one or more dense mass elements to the upper surface of the base plate.
    </p>
    <p num="175">
      With automatic bar code reading device 2 supported within scanner support stand portion of the base unit, the system is automatically induced into its automatic long-range hands-free mode of operation.
      <br/>
      The positioning of both object detection and scan fields in this mounting installation allows bar code symbols on objects to be easily read.
      <br/>
      In order to induce the system into its short-range hands-on mode of operation, the user simply encircles the handle portion of the hand-supportable device with his or her fingers, and then lifts the device out of the scanner support stand.
      <br/>
      Upon lifting the device out of its stand, the range selection circuit 115 (e.g., including a Halt-effectmagnetic flux sensor (mounted in the handle of the housing) detects the absence of magnetic flux produced from a permanent magnet mounted in the support stand, and automatically generates the short-range control activation signal (i.e., R1 =0).
      <br/>
      The details of this range mode-selection mechanism can be found in copending application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 07/761,123, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,340,971 supra.

    <p num="176">
      With the automatic bar code reading device held in the user's hand, and a bar coded object 435 in the other hand, the object is moved into the short-range portion of the object detection field as shown in FIG. 18B, where the object is automatically detected, and bar code symbol 436 automatically scanned while the visible laser beam is repeatedly scanned within the scanning volume.
      <br/>
      After the bar code symbol has beer successfully read (i.e., detected and decoded) and a transmitted data packet containing symbol character data has been received and processed at base unit 3 in a manner described hereinabove, a highly audible acoustical acknowledgement signal Sack of a predetermined pitch is produced from the base unit.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the bar code reading device is placed back within the scanner support stand, where it is once again induced into its long-range hands-free mode of operation.

    <p num="178">
      In the system control process of the illustrative embodiment, shown in FIG. 8, the polygon 36 is actively driven to its desired angular velocity only when the system is in its bar code symbol detection and read modes.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative embodiment, the moment of inertia of the polygon 36 is ultra-low so that it can instantly attain its desired angular velocity (from rest) in a very short time from when an object is detected within the 3-D scanning volume.
    </p>
    <p num="179">
      In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the control system of the laser scanner hereof can be modified so that the scanning polygon 36 is actively driven to idle at angular velocity WOD when the system is in its object detection mode, and actively driven to its desired angular velocity WBCD (i.e., where WBCD WOD) when the system is in the bar code detection mode.
      <br/>
      Using this control process, the scanning polygon is permitted to quickly attain its desired operating velocity WBCD when an object is detected in the scanning volume, for subsequent scan data collection operations.
      <br/>
      This control technique offers the advantage of using a polygon of a high moment of inertia, with the option of periodically imparting torque to the polygon motor shaft during the object detection state to maintain the idling velocity WODS in an electrically conservative manner.
      <br/>
      The motor control circuit hereof can be readily modified to realize such a pulsed-torque functionality in the system of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="180">In an alternative embodiment, where power consumption is not of critical concern, the scanning polygon can be continuously driven to the desired operating velocity at each state of system operation.</p>
    <p num="181">
      The automatic bar code reading system of the present invention is capable of performing a wide variety of complex decision-making operations in real-time, endowing the system with a level of intelligence hitherto unattained in the bar code symbol reading art.
