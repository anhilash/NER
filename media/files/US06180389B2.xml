      A virion-constrained nanoparticle of the invention comprises a shell of a virion coat protein(s) that encapsulates a core non-viral material, which is organic, inorganic or organometallic in nature.
      <br/>
      A particularly preferred virion coat is that of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV).
      <br/>
      Encapsulation of a desired particle is effected by adjusting reaction conditions, e.g., by lowering the pH of a solution containing the virion protein and the non-viral substance.
      <br/>
      Processes for producing the virion-constrained nanoparticles of the invention are also described.

      The invention further relates to methods of producing nanoscale particles, optionally through the use of controlled gating.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Ultrafine particles are useful in the production of many materials ranging, for example, from coatings, particularly coatings of one or more layers, to high performance lubricants, and from electronic devices to therapeutic delivery systems.
      <br/>
      Traditionally, fine particles have been prepared by grinding larger particles.
      <br/>
      However, such grinding results in a heterogeneous mix of particle sizes and shapes, and thus limits the usefulness of such particles.
      <br/>
      Such mixes can be further fractionated, for example, by passage though one or more sieves.
      <br/>
      In this case, the fractions collected may be in a certain size range, but within that range the size and shape distribution remains heterogeneous.
      <br/>
      Moreover, this additional size selection may result in a large amount of material that is discarded.
      <br/>
      Due to the disparity in particle shapes and sizes, discontinuities, stresses, frictions, etc. may arise in the resultant material, layer, lubricant, etc. for which the particles are employed.
      <br/>
      Thus, even after the expenditure of much effort in the prior art, suitable particles for high performance and high tolerance applications could not heretofore be reliably and economically produced by grinding methods.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Attempts to circumvent these problems have met with limited success in the past.
      <br/>
      These alternative approaches have included condensation of vaporized atoms and controlled precipitation of solutes out of solutions.
      <br/>
      In the case of precipitation where seed particles are used, the heterogeneity of the seed particles themselves render mixtures that are polydisperse.
      <br/>
      There is thus a need in the art for monodisperse particles of a desired size and/or shape.

    <p num="32">The invention provides a novel solution to the production of nanoscale particles of predetermined size and shape by advantageously employing the coat protein(s) of a virion to provide for a wide range of size-constrained reaction environments.</p>

    <p num="38">"Homogeneous size" under the invention means that the majority of the particles in a sample are of substantially the same size.</p>
    <p num="39">"Homogeneous shape" under the invention means that the majority of the particles in a sample are of substantially the same shape.</p>
    <p num="40">
      "Virion-constrained nanoparticle" under the invention refers to particles having dimensions substantially in the nanometer range, and comprising a collection of atoms and/or molecules ranging in number from 1 to the number that can fit inside the volume of the selected virion.
      <br/>
      Thus the maximum number of atoms and/or molecules under the invention in a "virion-constrained nanoparticle" is determined by the size of the nanoparticle and the size of the virion inner cavity.
    </p>
    <p num="41">"Controlled Gating" as meant herein is the controlled, reversible process leading to the formation of an opening large enough to allow atoms/molecules to enter and/or exit.</p>
    <p num="42">
      The invention is exemplified below using the coat protein of the cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV).
      <br/>
      This virus has an icosahedral structure approximately 286 angstroms in diameter and is composed of 180 identical protein subunits. (Speir et al., Structure 3: 63-78 (1995)).
      <br/>
      These subunits are themselves arranged into discrete hexamers and pentamers and self-assemble under the constraints of cubic symmetry to form a roughly spherical structure.
      <br/>
      The native virion undergoes a structural transition in response to changes in pH. (Bancroft et al., Virology 31: 354-379 (1967); Jacrot, Mol.
      <br/>
      Biol. 95: 433-466 (1975)).
      <br/>
      As the pH is raised from 5.0 to 7.0 the capsid swells, with an approximately 10 percent increase in diameter.
      <br/>
      This swelling also induces the formation of openings between the inside and outside of the virion which are approximately 20 angstroms in diameter.
      <br/>
      Upon lowering the pH, the swollen virion reversibly shrinks, closing off the large openings.
      <br/>
      Thus, the CCMV virion provides a model system in which a gating (i.e., the controlled, reversible opening and closing of the virion) can be readily and reversibly accomplished.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The CCMV coat protein has been modified to yield an extremely stable variant having inter-subunit disulfide linkages (the "cys mutant").
      <br/>
      This variant undergoes structural changes in response to changing pH similar to that of the wild-type virion.
      <br/>
      However, this mutant is able to withstand extreme pH conditions without dissociation into its component subunits or loss of quaternary structure.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In one embodiment, the present invention makes use of virion coat protein gating to provide for a constrained reaction environment in which organic, inorganic and/or organo-metallic materials can be contained.
      <br/>
      By carrying out the synthesis of, for example, inorganic materials in the presence of a virion under conditions suitable for mineral formation, and taking into advantage the controllable conformational changes in the virion coat, the present invention provides for virion-constrained nanoparticles having a predetermined size and displaying a homogeneous size distribution.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      One process of the invention for the production of virion-constrained nanoparticles comprises:
      <br/>
      a) providing an isolated and substantially pure coat protein(s) of a virion;
      <br/>
      b) incubating the coat protein(s) under solution conditions that permit re-assembly of a virion capsid;
      <br/>
      c) admixing the re-assembled virions with one or more organic, inorganic and/or organo-metallic materials under solution conditions that promote entrapment of the material, optionally by gating, so as to provide for virion-constrained nanoparticles surrounded by the virion capsid; and,
      <br/>
      d) isolating the virion-constrained nanoparticles produced and optionally releasing said nanoparticles through controlled gating.

      Another process of the invention for the production of virion-constrained nanoparticles comprises:

      <br/>
      b) incubating the coat protein(s) in a solution comprising one or more organic, inorganic and/or organo-metallic materials under solution conditions that permit virion assembly and promote entrapment of the material, optionally through controlled gating, so as to provide for virion-constrained nanoparticles surrounded by the virion; and,

      Yet another process of the invention for the production of virion-constrained nanoparticles comprises:
      <br/>
      a) providing isolated and substantially pure virions;

      <br/>
      c) isolating the virion-constrained nanoparticles produced and optionally releasing said nanoparticles through controlled gating.
    </p>
    <p num="48">In alternative embodiments, the virion-constrained nanoparticles so produced may be further incubated under solution conditions that promote removal of the proteinaceous material to provide virus-constrained nanoparticles comprising "naked" nanoparticle material.</p>
    <p num="49">The virion-constrained nanoparticles of the present invention have many utilities, such as in magnetic resonance imaging, contrasting agents, cell separation, drug delivery, semiconductor technology, magnetic memory materials for memory storage, precursors for ceramic coatings, seed crystals for bulk crystallization (such as Fe2 O3), homogeneously sized high temperature lubricants (such as Al2 O3), and the like.</p>
    <p num="50">
      The virion-constrained nanoparticles of the invention can comprise a variety of organic, inorganic and/or organo-metallic materials, ranging from single atoms and/or molecules to large conglomerates of the same. of inorganic species, the virion-constrained nanoparticles may include metal salts, metal oxides, non-metal oxides, metal and non-metal chalcogens, covalent solids such as iron oxide, coordination compounds, organo-metallic compounds, and the like.
      <br/>
      Monovalent and polyvalent metals can be advantageously used in the practice of the invention.
      <br/>
      For monovalent metal salts, silver chloride may be used to make virion-constrained nanoparticles useful for photography.
      <br/>
      Polyvalent metals include aluminum, barium, chromium, cobalt, copper, europium, gadolinium, lanthanum, magnesium, manganese, neodymium, titanium, yttrium, zirconium and the like.
      <br/>
      Radioactive isotopes of these and other metals, such as cobalt, uranium, technetium, iodine, and the like are also in some applications preferred (e.g., medical imaging and therapy).
      <br/>
      For some applications, it is desirable that the particle comprise an oxide, such as a hydrated oxide.
      <br/>
      For other applications it is desirable for the salt to comprise an anion such as acetate, bromide, carbonate, chloride, fluoride, iodide, nitrate, nitrite, oxalate, phosphate, phosphite, sulfate, sulfite and the like and mixtures thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Organic molecules and salts thereof may also be used in the practice of the invention as the core material of the virion-constrained nanoparticles.

      Examples of such particles include nanoparticles of proteins and useful polypeptides, glycoproteins, sweeteners, such as sugars and aspartame, and other flavoring agents, wherein the particles are useful in, for example, the controlled release of the encapsulated material.
      <br/>
      Drugs and salts thereof, for example sodium acetylsalicylate and acetaminophen, may also be used to form the virion-constrained nanoparticle material for controlled release in a patient.

      As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, this concentration will vary depending upon the solute/solvent employed.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, where interactions of the solute with the viral inner cavity are sufficiently strong, the empty virus particles may selectively partition the solute into the viral cavity and out of bulk solution.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In one embodiment of the invention, the shape of the virus-constrained nanoparticles can be determined by the inner cavity of the particular virion chosen.
      <br/>
      The cores comprise solid spherules in the case of CCMV, though the shape of the core is determined by the shape of the inner cavity of the particular virion chosen.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, rod-like, elongate shaped particles, orate particles, etc., can be produced under the practice of the invention.
      <br/>
      Another highly useful feature of the invention is that the size of the virion-constrained nanoparticles can be predetermined merely by choice of virion used.
      <br/>
      Thus, particles substantially in the nanometer range can be obtained upon the suitable choice of virion.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The invention may be used in conjunction with any virus coat proteins that are capable of forming a constrained environment.
      <br/>
      These include both in vitro and in vivo viral coat protein constrained environments.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the virions naturally can provide for gating, as in CCMV, under controllable and reproducible conditions to assist in the formation and, optionally, release of the virion-constrained nanoparticles.
      <br/>
      Controlled gating may be accomplished through, for example, changes in pH and/or ionic strength, the presence of metal ions and/or chelators, and the like.
      <br/>
      See generally Cram et al., "Container Molecules and Their Guests," Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, England (1994) and Houk et al., Science 273: 627-629 (1996).
      <br/>
      However, it is to be understood that gating is not necessary to the practice of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The viral coat proteins may be modified such as to provide novel characteristics beneficial for use under the invention.
      <br/>
      For example, one or more amino acids comprising the inner wall of the virion cavity may be modified (e.g., by site-directed mutagenesis) to provide for novel chemical environments in the cavity.
      <br/>
      Thus, positive charge in the cavity may be increased through modifications adding, for example, additional lysine or arginine residues.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the negative charge of the cavity may be increased through, for example, the addition of the specifically placed glutamic and aspartic acid residues.
      <br/>
      In a like manner, the hydrophobicity of the cavity may be selectively altered through use of an appropriate substituted amino acid.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Chemical modifications and functionalization may also be used to modify the cavity environment.
      <br/>
      For example, the cavity may be modified by addition of thiols with the potential to form disulfides or react with metals (e.g., cadmium, gold).
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Additionally, amino acids in the coat protein that are exposed on the outer surface of the particles may be modified to create novel properties.
      <br/>
      See U.S. Pat. No. 5,248,589. For example, such amino acid residues may be covalently linked to antibodies or fragments thereof, or other heterologous proteins, to provide for directed targeting of the virion-constrained nanoparticles to particular tissues in therapeutic and imaging techniques.
      <br/>
      As another example, the outer surface may be modified and/or functionalized with reactive groups that enhance interactions with surfaces.
      <br/>
      Covalent modifications to increase the stability of the virion particle or provide a site for further chemical modification, may also be used.
      <br/>
      Additional cysteine substitutions are particularly preferred in this embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The virion-constrained nanoparticles under the invention are also useful for providing certain ceramics having enhanced properties.
      <br/>
      Upon deposition on a substrate the particles can provide for two-dimensional crystal structure, yielding highly ordered monolayers and/or multi-layers, of the particle material.
      <br/>
      Upon subsequent treatment (e.g., heating, chemical modification, etc.) the particles may form monolayers providing a very smooth molecular surface on a substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The virion-constrained nanoparticles of the invention are also useful in high tolerance lubricants.
      <br/>
      The lubricants under the invention are particularly useful in high heat conditions, such as, for example, engines.
      <br/>
      Moreover, when the lubricants of the invention are used in conjunction with the modified surfaces described above, molecularly smooth surface interactions can be obtained providing for very high performance systems.
      <br/>
      It thus can be seen that the virion-constrained nanoparticles of the invention provide many superior qualities and are useful in many applications, others of which will be appreciated by those skilled in the various arts.
    </p>
    <p num="60">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="61">
      The "cys mutant" virion (Fox et al., Virology 227: 229-233 (1997); Zhao et al., Virology 207: 486-494 (1995) is disassembled into its free protein and RNA components by dialysis of the virus particles at pH 7.5 in 500 mM CaCl2 at 4 (degree)  for about 18 hours.
      <br/>
      After dialysis, the RNA is separated from the coat protein by centrifugation.
      <br/>
      The recovered viral coat protein is re-assembled into empty particles by dialysis against 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), 1 M sodium chloride at 4 (degree)  C. for 18 hours.
      <br/>
      The resulting empty particles are further purified by banding on a continuous sucrose gradient.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The empty virions so isolated are then incubated with 0.4 M Na2 WO4 at pH 7.0 for approximately one week.
      <br/>
      During this incubation time, bulk crystallization of the fluid is found to occur.
      <br/>
      The bulk crystals are centrifuged into a pellet and the supernatant is concentrated and washed at least five times with 10 volumes of 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.8).
    </p>
    <p num="63">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="64">
      Empty CCMV virions are prepared as in Example 1 and incubated at pH 7.5 (above the gating threshold) with the WO4-2 ions, followed by a slow decrease in pH through the slow diffusion of HCl gas.
      <br/>
      This embodiment of the invention has two complementary results.
      <br/>
      First, the tungstate undergoes oligomerization leading to precipitation in the bulk phase.
      <br/>
      Secondly, the pores of the swollen virion close, trapping the mineral inside.
      <br/>
      Thus, controlled gating is achieved in this instance, through the alteration of the solution pH.
      <br/>
      The bulk precipitation is removed by dissolution using a wash solution buffered to a pH below 6.5 (to ensure that the virion remains "closed").
      <br/>
      The mineralized virion is then isolated by centrifugation, for example on a sucrose gradient.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      After the preparation of virion-constrained nanoparticles, the samples are visualized using transmission electron microscopy and small electron dense cores are observed.
      <br/>
      These cores are the size expected based on the size of the internal cavity of the virion.
      <br/>
      Negative staining of the particles with uranyl acetate shows that the virion particles remain intact and that the electron dense cores are within the virion cavities.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The virion coat protein can also be expressed using recombinant DNA technology under another embodiment of the invention, thereby eliminating the need to separate the viral nucleic acid from the coat protein subunits.
      <br/>
      As an example of such recombinant expression, the skilled artisan may express the viral coat protein in Escherichia coli. (Zhao et al., Virology 207: 486-494 (1995)).
      <br/>
      However, any other expression system, including use of other bacterial strains, yeast, baculovirus, and mammalian expression systems may be used in this embodiment of the invention, as is recognized by those skilled in the art.

      While the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments, it is evident that there are numerous variations which will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description.
