      The active compounds according to the invention have very good herbicidal activity and can be used as defoliants, complete desiccants, haulm killers and, especially, as weedkillers.
      <br/>
      By weeds in the broadest sense, there are to be understood all plants which grow in locations where they are undesirable.
      <br/>
      Whether the substances according to the invention act as total or selective herbicides depends essentially on the amount used.
      <br/>
      The active compounds according to the invention can be used, for example, in connection with the following plants:
    </p>
    <p num="50">Dicotyledonous weeds of the genera: Sinapis, Lepidium, Galium, Stellaria, Matricaria, Anthemis, Galinsoga, Chenopodium, Urtica, Senecio, Amaranthus, Portulaca, Xanthium, Convolvulus, Ipomoea, Polygonum, Sesbania, Ambrosia, Cirsium, Carduus, Sonchus, Solanum, Rorippa, Rotala, Lindernia, Lamium, Veronica, Abutilon, Emex, Datura, Viola, Galeopsis, Papaver, Centaurea, Trifolium, Ranunculus, Taraxacum.</p>

    <p num="54">However, the use of the active compounds according to the invention is in no way restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.</p>
    <p num="55">
      The compounds are suitable, depending on the concentration, for the total control of weeds, for example on industrial terrain and railway tracks, and on paths and squares with or without tree plantings.
      <br/>
      Equally, the compounds can be employed for controlling weeds in perennial cultures, for example forests, decorative tree plantings, orchards, vineyards, citrus groves, nut orchards, banana plantations, coffee plantations, tea plantations, rubber plantations, oil palm plantations, cocoa plantations, soft fruit plantings and hopfields, on lawns, turf and pasture-land, and for the selective control of weeds in annual cultures.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention are suitable in particular for selectively controlling monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds in monocotyledonous crops, both pre-emergence and post-emergence.
      <br/>
      They are also tolerated well by important crop plants such as maize and wheat.
    </p>
    <p num="57">The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusting agents, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspo-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and also very fine capsules in polymeric substances.</p>
    <p num="58">These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersing agents and/or foam-forming agents.</p>
    <p num="59">
      If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ for example organic solvents as auxiliary solvents.
      <br/>
      Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol and also their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and also water.
    </p>
    <p num="60">Suitable solid carriers are: for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and also synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam-forming agents are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and also protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersing agents are: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.</p>
    <p num="61">
      Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latexes, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations.
      <br/>
      Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.
    </p>
    <p num="62">It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyes, such as alizarin dyes, azo dyes and metal phthalocyanine dyes, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.</p>
    <p num="63">The formulations in general contain between 0.1 and 95 percent by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.</p>

      The amount of active compound used can vary within a substantial range.
      <br/>
      It depends essentially on the nature of the desired effect.

    <p num="73">a) First Step  (Chemical Structure image '17' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="74">
      At 100 (degree)  C. and under nitrogen, a mixture of 14.9 g (50 mmol) of ethyl 3-amino-4,4,4-trifluoro-crotonate, 13.8 g of potassium carbonate and 100 ml of N-methyl-pyrrolidone is stirred for one hour. 10.0 g (50 mmol) of O-ethyl N-(2-chloro-pyridin-5-yl)-carbamate are then added, and the reaction mixture is heated at approximately 130 (degree)  C. on a water separator for four hours.
      <br/>
      Under nitrogen, the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and then poured into 1 litre of water and extracted three times with 100 ml of methylene chloride each time.
      <br/>
      The mixture is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid (to pH 3) and then left standing for one hour, and the crystalline product is isolated by filtration with suction.
    </p>
    <p num="75">This gives 10.6 g (75% of theory) of 1-(2-chloro-pyridin-5-yl)-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-4-trifluoromethyl-1(2H)-pyrimidine of melting point 158 (degree)  C.</p>

      The combined organic phases are washed with water, dried with sodium sulphate and filtered through silica gel.
      <br/>
      The filtrate is concentrated under water pump vacuum, the residue is digested with ethyl acetate and the crystalline product is isolated by filtration with suction.
