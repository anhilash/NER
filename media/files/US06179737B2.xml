    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Flying discs, intended for throwing and catching are well known throughout the world.
      <br/>
      A typical example is Headrick, U.S. Pat. No. 3,359,678. The disc comprises a rim encompassing a contiguous thin central plate.
      <br/>
      The rim has substantial vertical height and which adds substantial aerodynamic drag.
      <br/>
      However the rim is required to provide at least some degree of directional stability.
      <br/>
      Without the rim the disc will veer severely sideways in flight.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Despite their popularity, prior art discs have serious limitations.
      <br/>
      The three most vexing problems are listed below:
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      First, the configuration of the rim causes many throwers to launch the disc with wobble.
      <br/>
      This very common complaint and has driven many people away from the sport.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Second, the flight direction is velocity sensitive.
      <br/>
      For a right-handed throw, the disc rolls right during the initial part of the flight and rolls left during the final part of the flight.
      <br/>
      In addition the rate of roll is highly variable due to the type of throw and the velocity and direction of the prevailing winds.
      <br/>
      This makes it very difficult to throw these discs accurately.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Third, the substantial aerodynamic drag limits flight range and/or requires a strong throw.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">The invention is a flying disc, intended for throwing and catching, which overcomes the problems of prior art flying discs.</p>
    <p num="8">
      In brief, a disc according to the invention comprises an outer rim encompassing a contiguous thin central plate.
      <br/>
      The rim has a cross-section comprising an outer surface, top and bottom edges, and fillet curves joining the top and bottom edges to the respective top and bottom surfaces of the central plate.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The shape of the disc of the invention fits the thrower's hand in a manner which allows the disc to be launched totally free of wobble.
      <br/>
      The disc of the invention has balanced aerodynamic lift, which results in a straight flight without a tendency to roll left or right in flight.
      <br/>
      The aerodynamic drag of the disc of invention is lower than that of prior art discs.
      <br/>
      This results in longer flights and easier throws.
    </p>
    <p num="10">A further understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention may be realized by reference to the remaining portions of the specification and the drawings.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="12">A Brief Note About Aerodynamic Balance</p>
    <p num="13">
      The flying disc of the invention achieves stable and accurate flight by having the center of aerodynamic lift and the center of gravity (Cg) coincident.
      <br/>
      For purposes of this disclosure, this condition of coincidence is termed aerodynamic balance.
      <br/>
      If aerodynamic balance is not present, the disc will roll to the left or right in flight.
    </p>
    <p num="14">The following discussion assumes that the disc is spinning clockwise when viewed from above. (For counterclockwise rotation, the roll directions cited below are reversed).</p>
    <p num="15">
      If the center of lift is forward of the Cg, gyroscopic precession will roll the disc to the left in flight.
      <br/>
      Conversely, if the center of lift is aft of the Cg, the disc will roll right in flight.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The location of the center of lift of most prior art discs is velocity sensitive.
      <br/>
      The center of lift is aft of the Cg during the high-speed beginning of the flight and ahead of the Cg during low-speed end of the flight.
      <br/>
      Thus these prior art discs roll right at the beginning of the flight and roll left at the end of the flight.
      <br/>
      Expert throwers compensate by launching the disc with a substantial initial left tilt.
      <br/>
      If done correctly, the disc will roll right during the beginning of the flight and become level by mid flight.
      <br/>
      However the thrower can do little to counter the left roll at the end of the flight.
      <br/>
      He must also adjust is throw for prevailing winds.
      <br/>
      When throwing into the wind the higher air speed produces greater right roll, thus more initial left tilt is demanded.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Disc Configuration and Advantages</p>
    <p num="18">
      FIG. 1 shows a flying disc 1 according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Disc 1 comprises a contiguous thin central plate 2 and an outer rim 3, encompassing said central plate.
      <br/>
      The entire disc has an outside diameter 15.
      <br/>
      The remaining figures show details of the rim region of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      FIG. 2 is a cross section of the rim region of disc 1.
      <br/>
      Rim 3 has a cross-section comprising an outer surface 4, a top edge 5, and a top fillet curve 6 which joins the top edge to the top surface 7 of the central plate.
      <br/>
      The rim also has a bottom edge 8 and a bottom fillet curve 9 which joins the bottom edge to the bottom surface 10 of the central plate.
      <br/>
      This novel rim shape contributes to the excellent aerodynamic balance, low aerodynamic drag and superior throwing ergonomics of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Top edge 5 is the highest part of rim 3.
      <br/>
      Bottom edge 8 is the lowest part of rim 3.
      <br/>
      The total height of rim 3, designated 11, is the vertical distance between the top and bottom edges.
      <br/>
      Height 12 is the vertical distance from the bottom edge to the point 13 where top fillet curve 6 becomes parallel to top surface 7 of the central plate.
      <br/>
      The location of point 13 can be easily found by drawing construction lines 6E and 7E which are extensions of curves 6 and 7, respectively.
      <br/>
      At point 13, lines 6,6E and 7,7E become parallel. (Note that in FIG. 2 these lines become both parallel and congruent at point 13.
      <br/>
      However, in the alternative embodiment of FIG. 4, these lines are simply parallel at point 13).
      <br/>
      An important feature of the invention is that height 12 should be between 55% and 80% of the total height 11.
      <br/>
      This is important to achieve balanced aerodynamic lift and thus a straight flight.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Another important feature of the invention is that the total height 11 of the rim should be at least five percent of the outside diameter 15 of the entire disc.
      <br/>
      If this condition is not met, the center of lift will be too far forward and aerodynamic balance will not be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Ergonomics are an equally important benefit of the invention.
      <br/>
      The rim shape permits the thrower to grip the disc near a plane passing through the vertical center of gravity of the disc and facilitates wobble-free throws.
      <br/>
      The thrower's thumb nestles into top fillet curve 6 in a manner which greatly facilitates accurate and wobble-free throws.
      <br/>
      Also, the thrower can achieve additional velocity and spin by flinging the disc with his thumb while pressing it against the concave surface created by top fillet curve 6.
      <br/>
      To further facilitate this benefit, this surface can be molded with a traction-enhancing texture.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The radius measured from the center of the disc to the top and bottom edges may be equal however lower aerodynamic drag is achieved when bottom edge 8 has a greater radius, measured from the center of the disc, than top edge 5.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The central plate 2 of the invention may be flat or convex.
      <br/>
      The inventor has found that its shape has less effect on flight characteristics than does the configuration of the rim.
      <br/>
      In the specific embodiment the top plate is slightly convex, being a spherical shell with the top surface having a radius of curvature of approximately 45 inches.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      A long standing prior problem with relatively low profile discs has been that the center of lift is forward of the Cg, resulting in left roll in flight.
      <br/>
      Yet despite its low profile, the invention does not suffer this problem.
      <br/>
      It is believed that top edge 5 and bottom edge 8, working in concert with their respective fillet curves 6 and 9 deflect the airflow in a manner which causes the center of aerodynamic lift to coincide with the Cg and achieve aerodynamic balance.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      FIG. 3 is a cross section illustrating alternative forms of the outer surface of the rim of the invention.
      <br/>
      Note that a cross-section line taken through this outer surface may be concave (denoted 4), straight (denoted 4A), or convex (denoted 4B).
      <br/>
      The inventor has found that greatest flight stability is achieved with a concave cross-section line defining the outer surface.
      <br/>
      However greater flight distance is achieved with either of the remaining two alternatives.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Note that in the case of the convex outer surface alternative 4B, the amount of convexity should not be not so great that it absorbs and thus eliminates top edge 5 or bottom edge 8.
      <br/>
      These edges are important to achieve aerodynamic balance.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      FIGS. 4 and 4a illustrate embodiments of the invention molded in two different materials.
      <br/>
      Central plate 2 is molded of semi-rigid plastic, such as polyethylene or polypropylene.
      <br/>
      Outer rim 3 is molded of a thermoplastic rubber.
      <br/>
      The rubber rim improves catching and throwing comfort and resists abrasion--which damages conventional polyethylene discs when they skid on paved surfaces.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4, the molding of different materials is facilitated by a slight thickening of the region 13 where the fillet curves become parallel to the central plate.
      <br/>
      Experiments have confirmed that there is no observable difference in the performance of discs having the cross sections of FIG. 4 and FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4a, central plate 2 is slightly thickened in order to achieve a smooth transition to the rubber material of outer rim 3.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4a also has traction-enhancing texture bumps 14 on the lower surface of the rim.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Texture could also be employed on other surfaces of plate 2 or rim 3.</p>
    <p num="30">Representative dimensions of a disc of the invention are listed below:</p>
    <p num="31">
      Outer Diameter (15)=10 inches
      <br/>
      Total Rim Height (11)=0.72 inches
      <br/>
      Height (12)=0.50
      <br/>
      Center plate thickness=0.05"
      <br/>
      Center plate spherical radius=45"
      <br/>
      weight=130 grams
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      These dimensions, of course, are only an example.
      <br/>
      The novel rim of the invention may be incorporated in discs of other dimensions provided that the total rim height is at least five percent of the total disc diameter.
    </p>
    <p num="33">Experimental Results</p>
    <p num="34">
      The present inventor has conducted research and development on flying toys for the past eighteen years.
      <br/>
      During that period he invented and patented several world record setting flying rings and numerous boomerangs.
      <br/>
      In addition, during that same period he conducted numerous flying disc experiments.
      <br/>
      His goal for flying discs was longer flight distance combined with satisfactory stability (freedom from excessive left or right roll).
      <br/>
      He tried scores of discs which flew farther but had excessive roll.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Tests included several discs which had rims quite similar to that of the present invention, but were unsuccessful.
      <br/>
      These discs apparently lacked the proper height for the point of joining of the central plate and the rim.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Finally the present invention was created, combining long flight with not just "satisfactory" stability, but stability far superior to the prior art.
      <br/>
      In addition, it was discovered that the ergonomics of this invention permitted wobble-free throws.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Conclusion</p>
    <p num="38">
      In conclusion, the present invention provides a flying disc characterized by exceptional stability and ease of use.
      <br/>
      A relatively unskilled thrower can consistently achieve long, accurate and wobble-free flights.
