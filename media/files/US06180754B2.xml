    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to reduced salt polyallylamine polymer compositions, a process for producing a cross-linked polyallylamine polymer from a reduced salt, aqueous solution of a polyallylamine polymer and a multifunctional cross-linking agent and to cross-linked polyallylamine polymer compositions produced thereby.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Cross-linked polyallylamine polymers have found many therapeutic applications.
      <br/>
      See for example, WO 98/57652, JP 07309766-A and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,618,530, 5,679,717, 5,693,675 and 5,607,669 for reducing blood cholesterol levels by reducing reabsorption of bile acids, U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,696 for decreasing the absorption of dietary iron from the gastrointestinal track, and WO 96/21454 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,545 for removing phosphate from the gastrointestinal track.
      <br/>
      Further, JP 05244915 discloses the use of cross-linked polyamine polymers as a food preservative.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Methods to produce cross-linked polyamine polymers are known.
      <br/>
      See for example, the references cited hereinabove and U.S. Pat. No. 4,605,701, DE 4227019 A1 and EP 732352 A1.
      <br/>
      These references disclose cross-linking the polyallylamine polymer by reacting the polymer with a suitable cross-linking agent in aqueous caustic solution or an aqueous caustic solution and immiscible solvent mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The existing methods to produce cross-linked polyamine polymers create difficult and costly handling and cleanup procedures, especially in an industrial production process.
      <br/>
      For example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,618,530, 5,679,717, 5,693,675, 5,702,696 and 5,607,669 the cross-linked polyallylamine forms a continuous mass within the reaction vessel after it congeals which is impractical on a large scale.
      <br/>
      Further, when the cross-linking reaction occurs in a basic aqueous solution the removal of undesirable impurities, such as salts, e.g., sodium chloride, as well as unreacted allylamine monomer, low molecular weight polyallylamine polymer, low molecular weight compounds from initiator degradation during and after the free-radical polymerization of the allylamine monomer, solvents, etc., is very complicated as it must be performed on the solid, insoluble, cross-linked polyallylamine polymer.
      <br/>
      Moreover, when using a basic aqueous solution and dispersion solvent mixture, such as disclosed in WO 98/57652, the solvent, e.g., acetonitrile, must be reclaimed or disposed of.
      <br/>
      The present invention addresses these problems and gives a more practical solution to them.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a process for producing a cross-linked polyallylamine polymer comprising the steps of reacting a reduced salt, aqueous solution of a polyallylamine polymer with a multifunctional cross-linking agent, preferably epichlorohydrin, to give a cross-linked polyallylamine polymer.</p>
    <p num="6">One embodiment of the present invention comprises the step of neutralizing an aqueous solution of a polyallylamine acid salt polymer, preferably polyallylamine hydrochloride polymer, by ion exchange or electrodeionization, to give a reduced salt, aqueous solution of polyallylamine polymer.</p>
    <p num="7">In a further embodiment, the present invention comprises the step of nanofiltering or ultrafiltering a neutralized, aqueous solution of a polyallylamine polymer to yield a reduced salt, aqueous solution of polyallylamine polymer.</p>
    <p num="8">In yet a further embodiment, the present invention involves the composition of a reduced salt, aqueous solution of polyallylamine polymer produced by the foregoing steps.</p>
    <p num="9">In yet a further embodiment, the present invention comprises the step of concentrating a reduced salt, aqueous solution of polyallylamine polymer prior to cross-linking.</p>
    <p num="10">In yet a further embodiment, the present invention comprises the step of washing the cross-linked polyallylamine polymer with an alcohol or alcohol/water solution.</p>
    <p num="11">In yet a further embodiment, the present invention comprises the step of drying the cross-linked polyallylamine polymer.</p>
    <p num="12">In yet a further embodiment, the present invention involves the use of a reactor designed for high viscosity processing, preferably a LIST reactor, in the cross-linking and/or drying steps.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The present invention provides a process for producing a cross-linked, water-insoluble but swellable polyallylamine polymer.
      <br/>
      The process comprises subjecting a portion of the amino groups present in a reduced salt, aqueous solution of polyallylamine polymer to a cross-linking reaction with a compound having, in its molecule, at least two functional groups reactive with primary amino groups, as well as providing said cross-linked polyallylamine polymers.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The polyallylamine acid salt polymer used in the present invention is well known from references cited hereinabove and U.S. Pat. No. 4,528,347, which is incorporated by reference herein.
      <br/>
      Generally, monoallylamine is polymerized as a monomer inorganic acid salt (e.g., hydrochloride, sulfate, etc.) of monoallylamine in the presence of an azo type radical initiator.
      <br/>
      The polyallylamine acid salt polymer used in the invention typically has a molecular weight ("Mw ") greater than about 2,000 and more preferably greater than about 20,000.
      <br/>
      The polyallylamine polymer used in the invention typically has a molecular weight less than or equal to about 200,000 and more preferably less than or equal to about 100,000.
      <br/>
      Polyallylamine hydrochloride polymer, the polymerization product from the hydrochloric acid salt of monoallylamine, is a preferred polyallylamine acid salt polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Preferably, the polyallylamine acid salt polymer is neutralized prior to cross-linking.
      <br/>
      The neutralized polyallylamine polymer is sometimes referred to as polyallylamine polymer.
      <br/>
      The aqueous solution of polyallylamine polymer used in the invention is prepared by dissolving a polyallylamine acid salt polymer obtained by a process mentioned hereinabove into water or other suitable solvent.
      <br/>
      Neutralization can be accomplished with any suitable base such as ammonium hydroxide, preferably sodium hydroxide, by ion exchange, electrodeionization or by other suitable methods.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      A complete neutralization of the polyallylamine acid salt polymer prior to cross-linking is not always necessary.
      <br/>
      Depending on its intended use, a partial neutralization is also allowable and often desirable to give the desired level of cross-linking, pH, properties and efficacy for the cross-linked polyallylamine polymer.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the polyallylamine acid salt polymer is neutralized whereby at least about 50 percent, more preferably at least about 60 percent, even more preferably at least about 65 percent, even more preferably at least about 70 percent, and most preferably at least about 71 percent of the amino groups in the polyallylamine acid salt polymer are neutralized.

      Neutralization of a polyallylamine acid salt polymer with a base, e.g., polyallylamine hydrochloride with sodium hydroxide, especially on a commercial scale, results in formation of copious quantities of the inorganic acid salt, e.g., sodium chloride.

      Salt, such as sodium chloride, is undesirable in the final cross-linked polyallylamine, especially polyallylamine for use in therapeutic applications.

      In the present invention, removal of salt, such as sodium chloride, prior to cross-linking eliminates the arduous and costly process of removing the salt from the cross-linked polyallylamine.

      The aqueous solution of polyallylamine polymer cross-linked in the present invention, is a reduced salt, aqueous solution of polyallylamine polymer.

      Neutralization of an aqueous solution of polyallylamine acid salt by ion exchange or electrodeionization provides a reduced salt, aqueous solution of polyallylamine polymer directly from the polyallylamine hydrochloride.

      Neutralization by ion exchange is well known.

      Preferably, neutralization is accomplished by electrodeionization ("EDI") sometimes called electrodialysis.
      <br/>
      Electrodeionization can be performed as a batchwise operation or as a continuous process.
      <br/>
      Electrodeionization comprises the use of an electromotive force ("EMF") to cause the migration of ions through ion selective membranes in order to neutralize (or desalt) a desired solution.
      <br/>
      For example, desalination of water and the concomitant production of salt are well-known applications of electrodeionization.
      <br/>
      Another application is the deacidification (sweetening) of citrus juices like orange juice (Voss, J. Membrane Sci., 27, 165-171 (1986) and Hwang and Kammermeyer, Techniques of Chemistry, Wiley, vol VII, 494 (1975)).
      <br/>
      Another application of electrodeionization is the conversion of polyammonium salts into amines as demonstrated for ethylenediamine dihydrochloride to ethylenediamine (Chang, J. App. Electrochem., 9, 731-736 (1979)).
      <br/>
      Yet another example of organic separation technology is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,885,247 for the recovery and purification of lactic acid from lactate in fermentation broth.
      <br/>
      In the deacidification of citrus juices, production of amines, and purification of lactic acid, the organic anion traverses the membrane degrading the current efficiency at which the process runs.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the electrodeionization process of the present invention retains the polymeric amine between two anion exchange membranes.
      <br/>
      The EMF causes migration of chloride ions out of one of the membranes and hydroxide ion in through the other membrane to give a net neutralization of the polyallylamine hydrochloride (cell configuration exemplified in FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      Other cell configurations (e.g., Chang) with water splitting membranes are possible in which acid would be produced instead of consumption of sodium hydroxide.
      <br/>
      In either configuration, electrodeionization provides a high pH, polyallylamine polymer solution with a reduced salt concentration.

    <p num="23">
      Neutralization of an aqueous solution of polyallylamine hydrochloride polymer by a suitable base (e.g., lithium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, etc.) provides an aqueous solution of polyallylamine polymer with high levels of salt (e.g., sodium chloride).
      <br/>
      However, means to remove salt, for example, ion exchange, dialysis, nanofiltration or ultrafiltration may be used to provide the reduced salt, aqueous solution of polyallylamine polymer of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Preferably, reducing the level of salt in polyallylamine polymer to provide a reduced salt polyallylamine polymer is done by ultrafiltration.
      <br/>
      Ultrafiltration is a pressure driven filtration separation occurring on a molecular scale and is well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Typically, a process fluid containing dissolved and/or suspended material contacts one side of a porous membrane.
      <br/>
      A pressure gradient is applied across the membrane.
      <br/>
      The liquid, including small dissolved molecules (e.g., unreacted allylamine and low molecular weight polyallylamine polymer) and ions (e.g., the salt) are forced through the pores.
      <br/>
      Colloids, suspended solids, and large dissolved molecules (e.g., the polyallylamine polymer) are retained by sieving.
      <br/>
      A good discussion of ultrafiltration is contained in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, 1988, Volume 17, pp. 75-107, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

    <p num="25">
      Salt content can be determined experimentally for the polyallylamine polymer and/or aqueous solution by any known analytical procedure, such as neutron activation or ion selective electrochemistry.
      <br/>
      Further, salt content can be determined by theoretical calculations based on the mass balance of reactants and products.
      <br/>
      Further, when neutralized by electrodeionization and/or ultrafiltration salt content can be determined by known operating conditions of the electrodeionization and ultrafiltration processes.
      <br/>
      For example, for electrodeionization the salt concentration is determined by the ion selectivity of the membrane as stated by the manufacturer; for ultrafiltration in a con-add mode, the concentration of the salt is a decreasing exponential function proportional to the number of reactor volumes used to elute the system (see Encyclopedia of Polymer Science, Vol. 17, page 97, equation (13)).
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      If salt is present in the reduced salt, aqueous solution of polyallylamine polymer of the present invention it is preferably present in an amount less than the theoretical amount produced from the (partial) neutralization of the amino groups in the polyallylamine acid salt polymer, for example 100 percent neutralization of polyallylamine hydrochloride with sodium hydroxide would yield about 51 percent sodium chloride based on the weight of the neutralized polyallylamine polymer.
      <br/>
      Following neutralization, but prior to cross-linking, the amount of salt in the aqueous solution of polyallylamine polymer is less than or equal to about 51 percent based on the weight of the (partially) neutralized polyallylamine polymer, preferably less than or equal to about 45 percent, more preferably less than or equal to about 35 percent, more preferably less than or equal to about 25 percent, more preferably less than or equal to about 15 percent, more preferably less than or equal to about 10 percent, more preferably less than or equal to about 5 percent, even more preferably less than or equal to about 3 percent, even more preferably less than or equal to about 1 percent, even more preferably less than or equal to about 0.5 percent, even more preferably less than or equal to about 0.3 percent, and most preferably less than or equal to about 0.1 percent based on the weight of the (partially) neutralized polyallylamine polymer.

      Further, based on the operating conditions of the electrodeionizing device, such as the membrane permeability and/or the ultrafiltration device, such as the molecular weight cutoff of the membrane, electrodeionization and/or ultrafiltration can further remove low molecular weight impurities from aqueous solutions of polyallylamine polymer.
      <br/>
      Examples of low molecular weight impurities are allylamine monomer, initiator degradation products, such as tetramethylsuccinamide ("TMS"), and low molecular weight fractions of the polyallylamine polymer which are statistically less likely to cross-link to form the desirable water insoluble product.

      The cross-linking agent and reduced salt, aqueous solution of the polyallylamine, preferably concentrated, reduced salt, aqueous solution of the polyallylamine are mixed together, preferably at about room temperature and allowed to react.

      Examples of suitable cross-linking agents include acrylol chloride, epichlorohydrin, butanedioldiglycidyl ether, preferably 1,4 butanedioldiglycidyl ether, ethanedioldiglycidyl ether preferably 1,2 ethanedioldiglycidyl ether, 1,3-dichloropropane, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,3-dibromopropane, 1,2-dibromoethane, succinyl dichloride, dimethylsuccinate, toluene diisocyanate, and pyromellitic dianhydride.
      <br/>
      A preferred cross-linking agent is epichlorohydrin because of its low cost.
      <br/>
      Epichlorohydrin is also advantageous because of its low molecular weight and hydrophilic nature, maintaining the water swellability and phosphate-binding efficacy of the polyallylamine polymer gel.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      When used in therapeutic applications, such as sequestration of bile acids or the binding of phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract, the level of cross-linking makes the polymer insoluble and substantially resistant to absorption and degradation.

    <p num="31">
      The cross-linking reaction can be run in any suitable vessel or reactor.
      <br/>
      A preferred reactor is one in which the reaction can be run batch-wise or in a continuous fashion.
      <br/>
      More preferred is a reactor designed for high viscosity processing which has agitation means capable of mixing the reactants prior to gelation and breaking the gel into small pieces or crumb after gelation.
      <br/>
      An example of a preferred reactor designed for high viscosity processing is a LIST-DISCOTHERM B manufactured by LIST Inc.
      <br/>
      The LIST-DISCOTHERM B can be supplied for batch or continuous operation.
      <br/>
      It is particularly useful for thermal processes such as drying or reactions, where mixing or kneading is necessary to process viscous, pasty, crusting or gelatinous materials such as cross-linked polyallylamine polymer.
      <br/>
      The basic unit consists of a horizontal, cylindrical housing, and a concentric agitator shaft with disc elements perpendicular to the axis carrying peripheral mixing/kneading bars.
      <br/>
      Stationary hook-shaped bars set in the shell interact with, and clean, the shaft and disk elements as they rotate.
      <br/>
      Shell, shaft, and disc elements, all of which contribute to heat transfer can be heated or cooled.
      <br/>
      The unit generally operates with a fill level of 60 to 75 percent reactor capacity.
      <br/>
      Typical shaft speeds range from 5 to 100 rotations per minute ("rpm") with high installed torque.
      <br/>
      The combined effect of the intensive mixing and kneading action and the self cleaning of the heat exchange surfaces results in high heat and mass transfer rates.
      <br/>
      In batch units the mixing bars are arranged to perform optional mixing.
      <br/>
      For continuous operation, the arrangement of the internal geometry provides a forward plug flow movement of the material.
      <br/>
      However, the axial conveying rate is nearly independent of agitator rotation speed, making it possible to operate at high agitator rotation speeds optimizing heat and mass transfer.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the positioning of the disc elements enables the processing of liquid feed stocks directly through to a solid free flowing material without recycling of dry product.
      <br/>
      The unique design of the LIST reactor eliminates the formation of a single, continuous, congealed mass.
      <br/>
      As gelation occurs, the self-wiping concentric agitator shaft and disc elements create easy to handle clumps of gel.

      Once the mixture has gelled, the reaction is allowed to continue or sometimes referred to as cure.
      <br/>
      During curing, the rate of agitation is decreased, intermittent or discontinued to minimize shear degradation of the cross-linked polymer, preferably agitation is continuous and/or intermittent (on/off) at about 20 rpm.

      250 g of polyallylamine hydrochloride polymer solution was diluted with 337 g of water added in a 2 l, water-jacketed vessel fitted with a 45 (degree)  pitched-blade turbine agitator and blanketed with nitrogen.
      <br/>
      The mixture was stirred at 200 rpm and the pH adjusted by the addition of 76.5 g of a 50 weight percent aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide to convert about 72 weight percent of the amine hydrochlorides to free amines.
      <br/>
      The resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature and the pH of the solution was determined to be 10.1. 600 g acetonitrile was added followed by addition of 11.8 g epichlorohydrin all at once.
      <br/>
      The agitation rate was increased to 500 rpm and the temperature controlled at 25 (degree)  C. After 2 hours, the biphasic, liquid/liquid reaction dispersion changed into a gel/liquid dispersion.
      <br/>
      The reaction was allowed to continue for a total of 21 hours at room temperature after which time, the vessel was disassembled and the contents poured into a 3L, coarse-fritted filter funnel and vacuum filtered. 540 g of mother liquor was recovered having a conductivity of 2.3 mS/cm which was about 84% acetonitrile (75% recovery of acetonitrile) containing about 30 ppm epichlorohydrin and a large percentage of the allylamine.
      <br/>
      The resulting cross-linked PAA (680 g) isolated by filtration contained high levels of impurities (e.g., about 56 g sodium chloride, residual acetonitrile, unreacted allylamine, uncross-linked polyallylamine, etc.).
      <br/>
      To remove the impurities, the cross-linked PAA was washed 5 times by suspension in 5 of water, stirring magnetically for 30 minutes followed by filtering through a coarse-glass fritted, 3L funnel.
      <br/>
      The five, 5 l water washes yielded filtrates with conductivities of 16, 2.6, 0.4, 0.03 and 0.01 mS/cm, respectively.
      <br/>
      The washed polyallylamine (2250 g) was dried under vacuum at 60 (degree)  C. yielding 105.5 g cross-linked polyallylamine.

      "EDI2 " is an electrodeionization process used to neutralize the polyallylamine hydrochloride polymer in an EDI apparatus built from a commercially available cell stack (ElectroSyn-A/B Cell, from Electrosynthesis Co.).
      <br/>
      This plate and frame cell was operated with a 30 amp, 80 volt rectifier in a bipolar setup.
      <br/>
      The active electrode (and single membrane) area was 100 cm2.
      <br/>
      The cell configuration is illustrated in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      A stainless steel cathode and a nickel anode were used.
      <br/>
      Nafion cation exchange membranes (+) and Ionac MA3475 anion exchange membranes (-) were used.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Solutions from three 18.9 l vessels, each fitted with a centrifugal pump, were recirculated through the EDI cell.
      <br/>
      The anolyte, catholyte and NaOH were contained in one 18.9 l vessel ("V-1") and circulated concurrently through cell compartments 1, 4 and 7 (see FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      PAAHCl was in a different 18.9 l vessel ("V-2") and circulated concurrently through compartments 3 and 6.
      <br/>
      NaCl effluent was contained in the third 18.9 l vessel ("V-3") and circulated concurrently through compartments 2 and 5.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      NaCl levels for the EDI2 neutralized PAA were derived from the sodium content in the reduced salt, aqueous solutions of PAA (NaClPPA) as determined by ion selective electrode.
      <br/>
      NaCl levels are expressed as weight percent based on the weight of the partially neutralized polyallylamine polymer.

      "UF2 " is an ultrafiltration process performed with a spiral-wound 2540, PW ultrafiltration element with a nominal 10,000 Mw -cutoff which was obtained from Osmonics.
      <br/>
      A 114 polypropylene reservoir was utilized with a Wilden pneumatic pump.
      <br/>
      A backpressure regulator was utilized on the feed-flow stream, after the element to regulate the feed pressure.
      <br/>
      A valve in the permeate output was used to regulate the permeate flow rate ("flux").
      <br/>
      Operating conditions were set so the feed flow was 18.9 liters per minute ("lpm").
      <br/>
      During ultrafiltration, the concentration of PAA was either (1) kept approximately constant (except for the small amount of low Mw material passing through the membrane) by addition of water to the reservoir to make-up for the permeate loss ("con-add"), and/or (2) concentrated by not replenishing the permeate water loss ("concentrated").
      <br/>
      For the examples where ultrafiltration is used, the amount of water added in the con-add mode is reported as kg water/kg PAA.
      <br/>
      The concentration of PAA in meq/g for the aqueous solution before (PAAinitial) and after (PAAfinal) ultrafiltration are reported.
