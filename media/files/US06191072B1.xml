      A cutting line for a rotating-line trimmer that simultaneously applies herbicide as vegetation is cut.
      <br/>
      The herbicidal cutting line comprises a flexible cutting-line core (13) herbicidal coating (15) that covers all or part of the line core and a thin protective shield (17) covering all or part of the herbicidal coating.
      <br/>
      As vegetation is cut, protective shield (17) ruptures exposing herbicidal coating (15) to vegetation.
      <br/>
      The cutting line is used with existing line trimmers in applications in which vegetation regrowth is objectionable.

    <heading>BACKGROUND--FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to rotating-flexible-line trimmers specifically to a cutting line that simultaneously applies herbicide as vegetation is cut.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND--DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Rotating line trimmers have gained widespread popularity for trimming vegetation in hard-to-reach places such as next to buildings, fences, trees, and shrubs.
      <br/>
      Such trimmers typically include a rotating hub from which a cutting line is radially dispensed.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the line is flexible to increase the safety of the trimmer.
      <br/>
      As the hub is rotated, the resulting centrifugal force causes the line to extend substantially straight out from the hub.
      <br/>
      The line, being rotated at high speeds serves as a cutting surface similar to a blade.
      <br/>
      Applications can be divided into two basic categories:
    </p>
    <p num="3">(1) removal of unwanted vegetation and</p>
    <p num="4">(2) trimming of desired vegetation.</p>
    <p num="5">
      The present invention addresses the first category, removal of unwanted vegetation.
      <br/>
      Examples include weeds in walkways, driveways, between pavers, and on other paved surfaces.
      <br/>
      In these situations complete and permanent removal is desired.
      <br/>
      For this reason, unwanted vegetation is trimmed as close to the root as possible.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, weed roots remain intact and regrowth may occur.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Currently, the options for clearing unwanted vegetation are limited.
      <br/>
      Vegetation may be sprayed with herbicide; however, the kill process may take considerable time, from days to weeks.
      <br/>
      After vegetation has expired, dead vegetation must be removed.
      <br/>
      A further disadvantage of herbicide spraying is that overspray and dripping may cause unnecessary environmental impact.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The line trimmer provides a second option, severing unwanted vegetation from the root.
      <br/>
      The advantage of this approach is that cut vegetation can be removed immediately by sweeping with a push brush or a broom.
      <br/>
      The disadvantage is that vegetation roots remain intact and may regrow.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the trimming job must be repeated frequently due to vegetation regrowth.
    </p>
    <p num="8">As such, there is need for a device that simultaneously trims vegetation and applies herbicide.</p>

    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="13">In accordance with the present invention a herbicidal cutting line comprises a flexible-line core coated with a herbicidal composition whereby herbicide is applied as vegetation is trimmed.</p>
    <p num="14">Description--FIGS. 1 to 3</p>
    <p num="15">
      A cutting line with a herbicidal coating is illustrated in FIGS. 1A and 1B. FIG. 1A shows a side view of a herbicidal cutting line.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1B shows a sectional view of cutting line 11.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, cutting line 11 comprises a flexible-cutting-line core 13, a herbicidal coating 15 covering all or part of cutting-line core 13, and a protective shield 17 covering herbicidal coating 15.
      <br/>
      In use, the cutting line is dispensed from a rotating hub 19.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Cutting-line core 13 consists of a flexible line, not unlike conventional cutting line.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment core 13 is a monofilament of extruded polymeric material, such as nylon, polyethylene, or polypropylene.
      <br/>
      The surface of core 13 may be scored or otherwise textured to promote adhesion of herbicidal coating 15.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      A number of possibilities exist for herbicidal coating 15 including:
      <br/>
      (a) a viscous liquid substance containing herbicide;
      <br/>
      (b) a composition with a waxy consistency containing herbicide whereby herbicide residue remains on vegetation after contact; and
      <br/>
      (c) a water soluble herbicide composition in which moisture from cut vegetation dissolves herbicide.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Herbicidal material 15 is covered with a protective shield 17 to prevent transmission of herbicide to line trimmer components, and hands during line replacement.
      <br/>
      Protective shield 17 comprises a soft, flexible, material that is impermeable to herbicidal coating 15.
      <br/>
      Protective shield 17 is sufficiently thin and soft such that it ruptures as cutting line 11 cuts vegetation, thereby exposing herbicidal coating 15.
      <br/>
      Protective shield 17 comprises a thin layer of polymeric material such as wax, polyethylene or polypropylene.

      <br/>
      Fibrous material 23 consists of cotton, rayon, nylon, dacron, kevlar, or polypropylene.
      <br/>
      Herbicide composition 25 has a consistency that is soft enough to leave a residue on cut vegetation and to maintain line flexibility.

    <p num="23">
      Not all types of herbicide are effective for use in herbicidal cutting lines.
      <br/>
      For example, some contact herbicides do not have the mobility required to move from the application site (the cut) to the roots.
      <br/>
      Herbicides that work by disrupting cell membranes such as Bipyridyliums are poor choices for herbicidal cutting line.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Systemic herbicides that move within the plant via the phloem are generally effective for use in herbicidal cutting lines.
      <br/>
      Some examples include growth regulators (Phenoxy Acetic Acids, Benzoic Acids, and Pyridines) and Amino Acid Synthesis Inhibitors (Imidazolinones, Sulfonylureas, Sulfonamides, and glyphosate.)
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Herbicidal cutting line should not be used in applications where the vegetation is desirable, such as lawns.
      <br/>
      Inadvertent use of the herbicidal cutting line will damage treated sections of lawn.
      <br/>
      To prevent inappropriate use, herbicidal cutting line is color-coded to distinguish conventional cutting line from herbicidal cutting line.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Herbicidal cutting line is not suitable for trimming desired plants and in this application should be replaced with conventional cutting line.
      <br/>
      To facilitate cutting line exchange, herbicidal cutting line is stored on a separate spool.
      <br/>
      To change cutting line, spools are exchanged.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Herbicidal cutting line provides an effective means for permanent removal of unwanted vegetation.
      <br/>
      Herbicidal cutting line can be used with the same ease as conventional cutting line but the simultaneous herbicide application reduces vegetation regrowth.
      <br/>
      Trimmed areas remain vegetation-free for extended periods due to herbicide activity.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Herbicidal cutting line provides a practical alternative to herbicide spraying.
      <br/>
      Cut vegetation remnants can be swept away.
      <br/>
      The simultaneous herbicide application reduces vegetation regrowth.
      <br/>
      The present invention eliminates spills, overfills, and drips associated with herbicide spraying and can be used with existing line trimmers.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Operation</p>
    <p num="30">
      The herbicidal cutting line is used with line trimmers in the same manner as conventional cutting line, however, care must be taken to trim only plants that are to be removed permanently.
      <br/>
      As vegetation is cut, herbicide residue remains on the rooted plant remnant, preventing regrowth.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Typical applications include clearing vegetation in drive ways, in sidewalks, against buildings, between pavers, and against retainer walls.
      <br/>
      The simultaneous herbicide application prevents weed regrowth.
      <br/>
      The cutting action allows for immediate removal by sweeping with a brush.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In some situations, herbicidal cutting line can be used to remove weeds growing among desirable vegetation.
      <br/>
      Weeds often grow higher than desirable vegetation such as ivy, lawn grass, and flowers.
      <br/>
      The trimmer can be used to cut unwanted vegetation at a height above the desirable vegetation.
      <br/>
      Since herbicide is applied only to cut vegetation, tall growing weeds are herbicide treated while shorter desirable plants remain untreated.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In each of the foregoing applications, herbicidal cutting line requires less herbicide than spraying since herbicide goes directly to the plant.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since the present invention eliminates herbicide drips and spills, inadvertent effects on the environment are minimized.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Conclusions, Ramifications, and Scope</p>
    <p num="35">
      Accordingly, the reader will see that herbicidal cutting line provides an easy means of vegetation removal.
      <br/>
      The preferred embodiment comprises a cutting-line core 13, a herbicidal coating 15 and a protective shield 17.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The ease of use and simplicity of the herbicidal cutting line make it attractive for small-scale residential applications.
      <br/>
      The cutting line can be used with existing line trimmers.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Herbicidal cutting line provides a sensible approach for vegetation removal that is both environmentally sound and practical.</p>
    <p num="38">
      Although the description above contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but as merely providing illustrations of some of the presently preferred embodiments of this invention.
      <br/>
      For example, the cutting line may contain a herbicidal core rather than a herbicidal coating.
