    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to an angioplasty catheter and more particularly to an imbedded marker band creating a flexible guide wire shaft.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is used to increase the lumen diameter of a coronary artery partially or totally obstructed by a build-up of cholesterol fats or atherosclerotic plaque.
      <br/>
      Typically a first guide wire of about 0.038 inches in diameter is steered through the vascular system to the site of therapy.
      <br/>
      A guiding catheter, for example, can then be advanced over the first guide wire to a point just proximal of the stenosis.
      <br/>
      The first guide wire is then removed.
      <br/>
      A balloon catheter on a smaller 0.014 inch diameter second guide wire is advanced within the guiding catheter to a point just proximal of the stenosis.
      <br/>
      The second guide wire is advanced into the stenosis, followed by the balloon on the distal end of the catheter.
      <br/>
      The balloon is inflated causing the site of the stenosis to widen.
      <br/>
      The dilatation of the occlusion, however, can form flaps, fissures and dissections which threaten reclosure of the dilated vessel or even perforations in the vessel wall.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Although the dimensions in the above example are suited to the coronary arteries, any body lumen can be treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), including the vas deferens, ducts of the gallbladder, prostate gland, trachea, bronchus and liver.
      <br/>
      The body lumens range in diameter from small coronary vessels of 3 mm or less to 28 mm in the aortic vessel.
      <br/>
      The invention applies to acute and chronic closure or reclosure of body lumens.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      It is advantageous for a catheter to have visible marker bands on the catheter shaft that can be viewed using a fluoroscope machine to position the catheter in relation to the lesions.
      <br/>
      It is also advantageous for a catheter shaft to have a smooth outer surface with minimal bumps from the marker bands.
      <br/>
      What is needed is marker bands which can be visible using a fluoroscope and also which do not create a significant increase in diameter so that the catheter can slide easily through the lesion.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="9">
      Referring to FIGS. 1 &amp; 2, Applicant's catheter 10 is comprised of a balloon 15, shaft 20, and manifold 25.
      <br/>
      Marker bands 30 are located inside of the balloon 15.
      <br/>
      The marker bands 30 are required to position the balloon 15 using fluoroscopy during an angioplasty procedure.
      <br/>
      The intent behind the invention is to minimize the increase in diameter over the marker band 30, while enabling it to be viewed using standard fluoroscope equipment.
      <br/>
      Fluoroscope evaluations conducted using platinum/iridium marker bands 30 indicate that a wall thickness of 0.0010" is not sufficient to ensure adequate visibility, while a wall thickness of 0.0018" will enable good visibility.
      <br/>
      Traditionally, marker bands are placed on the outside of the guidewire lumen using adhesive (cyanoacrylate).
      <br/>
      This requires the inner diameter of the marker band to be large enough to enable it to be positioned onto the guide wire shaft with a sufficient gap to enable the adhesive to wick between the guide wire shaft and marker band for bonding purposes.
      <br/>
      Imbedding the marker bands 30 using the present invention creates an increase in diameter of approximately 0.005" when compared to the diameter of the guide wire shaft 35.
      <br/>
      Typical dimensions for this configuration are 0.023" over the guide wire shaft 35 and 0.028" over the marker band 30.
      <br/>
      A conventional over-the-wire design consists of a guide wire shaft 35 which defines a guide wire lumen 40 running the length of the catheter 10 inside of the shaft 20.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Imbedding the marker band 30 using the method described in this patent allows the wall thickness to be maintained to enable sufficient visibility without resulting in a significant increase in outer diameter.
      <br/>
      Samples prepared using platinum/iridium marker bands 30 with the following dimensions: 0.01675" inner diameter, 0.0018" wall, 0.051" length resulted in an increase in diameter over the marker band 30 of 0.002" when compared to the diameter of the guide wire shaft 35.
      <br/>
      Typical dimensions for this configuration were 0.0225" over the guide wire shaft 35 and 0.0245" over the marker band 30.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      FIG. 2 shows the present invention.
      <br/>
      The proximal end of the balloon 15 is affixed to the distal end of the shaft 20.
      <br/>
      The guide wire shaft 35 is coaxially disposed within the shaft 20, extending through the balloon 15 with the distal end of balloon 15 being bonded to the distal end of the guide wire shaft 35.
      <br/>
      For the Balloon 15 any conventional material may be used such as Nylon, polyethylene (PE) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET).
      <br/>
      The balloon typically has one or more marker bands 30 made of a material such as platinum/iridium for visualization under fluoroscopy.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art would recognize that any conventional balloon design would be suitable.
      <br/>
      The balloon 15 is in fluid communication with the inflation lumen 75.
      <br/>
      The bonding of the balloon can be any conventional means such as adhesive 80, heat bonding or welding.
      <br/>
      The preferred means is to place a ring of U.V. adhesive, as for example -3311 Loctite.RTM. (manufactured by Loctite Corp. in Hartford Conn.).
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The outer diameter of the shaft 20 is approximately 0.038 inches (0.96 mm) with an inner diameter of 0.0280 inches, forming an inflation lumen 75.
      <br/>
      The shaft 20 may be formed of either a stiff material for pushability (such as polyimide or poly ether ether ketone (PEEK)) or more flexible material for better tracking (such as Polyethylene (PE) or Nylon).
      <br/>
      The shaft 20 may also be made of a combination of stiff and flexible materials such that the proximal end is stiffer than the distal end.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art would recognize that any material which has high column strength in a thin walled configuration of the appropriate size would be suitable.
      <br/>
      The shaft 20 may have several visual marker bands 85 to indicate the various approaches, as for example, the brachial approach.

    <p num="13">
      The guide wire shaft 35 is constructed from both High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and crosslinked and expanded Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE).
      <br/>
      The guide wire shaft 35 has an inner diameter of 0.016 inches (0.41 mm) suitable for passing standard 0.014 inch (0.36 mm) guide wires.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art would recognize that the dimension varies depending on the application and the size of device being passed.
      <br/>
      The outer diameter of the guide wire shaft 35 is 0.023 inches.
      <br/>
      The distal end of the guide wire shaft 35 forms the catheter tip 55.

      <br/>
      The imbedded marker bands 30 are located on a mandrel 70.

      The proximal portion 45 of the guide wire shaft 35 is constructed from HDPE and extends from inside of the proximal end of the balloon 15 to the manifold 25.
      <br/>
      The distal portion 50 of guide wire shaft 35 is constructed from both HDPE and LDPE and extends from the distal end of proximal portion 45 to the distal end of the catheter 10 forming the catheter tip 55.
      <br/>
      The distal portion 50 is formed with an inner layer 60 and an outer layer 65.
      <br/>
      The distal end of the proximal portion 45 is slid on the mandrel 70.
      <br/>
      The inner layer 60 is made from HDPE and is positioned over the marker bands 30 and the proximal end of the inner layer 60 overlaps the distal end of the proximal portion 45 by 0.039 inches (1.0 mm).
      <br/>
      The outer layer 65 is made from LDPE and is positioned over the inner layer 60 and the proximal end of the outer layer 65, covering the distal end of the proximal portion 45 approximately 0.197 inches (5 mm).
      <br/>
      The distal end of the proximal portion 45, the inner layer 60 and the outer layer 65 are then heated to 300-320 (degree)  F., melting the inner layer 60 and the outer layer 65 onto the mandrel, covering and imbedding the marker bands 30 and bonding the inner layer 60 and the outer layer 65 to the proximal portion 45, forming the guide wire shaft 35.
