      <br/>
      A fastening device for holding a golf implement set is described.
      <br/>
      The fastening device includes a fastening stand having a clip attached to one side thereof for attachment to a person's belt.
      <br/>
      A plurality of embedded channels is attached to the other side of the fastening stand.
      <br/>
      The embedded channels are formed by ribbed strips and are adapted to hold ball location markers, mending tools, a brush, etc.
      <br/>
      A plurality of openings are provided along a top surface of the fastening stand.
      <br/>
      The openings are sized to permit insertion of different sized golf tees into the fastening stand.
      <br/>
      In addition, the openings include resilient clip members for resiliently holding the golf tees.
      <br/>
      The fastening device firmly holds the golf implement set in place so that they do not drop when a golfer is using the fastening device while playing golf.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a fastening device for golf implement set, and more particularly to a fastening device facilitating golfers to use the implements and being not apt to be dropped.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Since golf trolleys are not allowed to get into the teeing ground and putting green in most of the golf fields, and these golf fields with 18 holes having quite a long distance apart are very vast in their ranges, golf implements such as tees, ball location markers, mending tools (implements for repairing indentation on the putting green), brushes etc. which are necessity for the golfer are not convenient to keep in golfers' pocket as these implements might not only pierce through golfers' pocket and even hurt their body but also cause disturbance during the course of golf playing.
      <br/>
      Besides, it is very inconvenient to search for the very implement the golfer intending to use in the pocket where all kinds of implements are contained in a mess in their pocket.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Referring to a prior art as shown in FIG. 1, a connecting strip is set up fixing to the buckled clip which can clip to the golfers' waist-belt to be taken along with, and four snap holders are set up on the connecting strip for the tees of all sizes to be inserted in order to be available for the use of golfers.
      <br/>
      But the tees are apt to drop through the opennings of snap holders since the lower portion of the tees have an inclination and the size of tees are all different, besides, those snap holders are only for holding tees, and the rest of implements are still contained in golfers' pockets.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Referring to another prior art which is an integral forming fastener stand as shown in FIG. 2, a plurality of embedded holes are set up at the circumferential flange of the fastening stand on one side while a buckled clip which can be clipped at the golfers' waist-belt is set up on the other side just like that of the prior art shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Although this kind of fastening stand can hold all of the implements such as tees, ball location markers, mending tools, brushes etc., the size of the fastening stand is quite bulky such that it is not possible to clip it at the golfers' waist in any direction.
      <br/>
      If the fastening stand were held in the front or on the back of the golfers, not only that it will interfere the driving and putting of the golfers but also that it will be inconvenient for the golfers to access those implements.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since the surrounding of those embedded hole is very thin without any resilient clips nor any relatively large space available for fastening, any activities of the golfers such as twisting their bodies for driving, jogging, jumping, crouching, sitting or even walking around will cause the dropping of the implements.
    </p>
    <p num="5">In view of the above-mentioned disadvantages of the prior art, the present invention provides a fastening device that not only can tightly hold all kinds of implements such as tees, ball location markers, mending tools, brushes etc., but also can facilitate the access of those implement set.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">Therefore, the primary objective of the present invention is to provide a fastening device which can tightly hold all kind of implements such as tees, ball location markers, mending tools, brushes etc. and can facilitate the access of those implements as the fastening device of the present invention is small in size, thereby, can be attached at any appropriate location around the waist without interfering the driving and putting of the golfers.</p>
    <p num="7">The secondary objective of the present invention is to provide a fastening device which uses resilient clipping pieces to clip tees, and uses relatively large space to contain ball location markers, mending tools, brushes etc. in order to be taken along with golfers without dropping whenever golfers twist their bodies to perform driving, walking around, jumping, jogging, crouching or sitting</p>
    <p num="8">Another objective of the present invention is to provide a fastening device which can vary the disposition of each portion of the device, for instance, to remove all the embedded channels and ribbed strips on the opposite side of the buckled clip of the fastener stand to become a smooth surface in order to let golfers carry different sizes of tees with relatively light burden, or leave only an embedded channel and its corresponding ribbed strip as well as penetration hole which make the tips of tees be inserted in so as to avoid the tees being dropping and to avoid those sharp tips of tees being exposed to cause hazard.</p>
    <p num="9">To sum up, in order to achieve the foregoing objectives, the implemented technology of the present invention is as follows:</p>
    <p num="10">
