    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to storage containers for cosmetic materials and utensils and more particularly to storage containers for cosmetics having multiple pockets for sorting and storing cosmetics and personal articles.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Brief Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Holders for organized storage of tools and equipment for ready access have been devised for the convenience of craftsmen.
      <br/>
      A number of such tool holders have been designed in the form of attachments to be mounted on a bucket or the like for convenient transportation.
    </p>
    <p num="5">U.S. Pat. No. 4,993,551, to Lindsay, discloses a tool holder and storage device comprising a tubular cloth panel that drapes and conforms over the inside and outside surfaces of a bucket, with pockets sewn onto the inner and outer flaps of the panel.</p>
    <p num="6">U.S. Pat. No. 4,765,472, to Dent, discloses a tool holder comprising a cloth panel arranged to surround a bucket, having pockets sewn to the outside of the panel, and provided with snap hooks for suspending the tool holder from the handle of the bucket.</p>
    <p num="7">U.S. Pat. No. 5,174,447, to Fleming, discloses a tool holder to be supported on a bucket, the tool holder having an interior leaf and an exterior leaf, both leaves being provided with pockets for holding tools and the like.</p>
    <p num="8">
      U.S. Design Pat.
      <br/>
      Nos. 388,919 and 396,912, both to Maire, and U.S. Design Pat.
      <br/>
      No. 345,237, to Stein, show tool carriers containing pouches for holding tools and articles designed to be draped over a bucket.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Such tool carriers are generally held in place on the bucket or the like by the weight of the tools contained in their pockets or pouches and do not require separate fastening elements to secure them on the supporting structure.</p>
    <p num="10">U.S. Pat. No. 5,117,724, to Gardner, discloses a container for holding drumsticks comprising a cloth cover for a drummer's stool having a depending skirt with pockets sewn onto the outside of the skirt.</p>
    <p num="11">A number of containers have also been devised for holding cosmetics, toilet articles, and game articles for convenient transportation and use.</p>
    <p num="12">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,002,401, to Blackman, discloses a foldable container comprising a dual layer of cloth with panels of stiffening and/or shock absorbing material positioned between the layers and pockets sewn onto one of the cloth layers.
      <br/>
      The container is designed to fold up with the pockets on the inside and is provided with a drawstring and/or hook and loop fastener to hold the container in a closed configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,315, to Berry et al., discloses a roll-up carrying case for cosmetic articles and the like comprised of a cloth panel having one or more pockets sewn to the panel and extending the entire length of the panel.
      <br/>
      Holes are provided at intervals along the panel for inserting clips to divide the single pocket into two or more separate pockets for holding articles.
    </p>
    <p num="14">U.S. Pat. No. 1,125,396, to Rabinowitz, discloses a holder and carrier for toilet articles having a flexible band that can be formed into a circular, self-supporting shape with pockets on both sides thereof for holding toilet articles.</p>
    <p num="15">U.S. Pat. No. 4,977,941, to Henderson, discloses a bingo bag, made of quilted material to be self-supporting, provided with interior pockets for holding implements useful in playing bingo and a drawstring closure at the top.</p>
    <p num="16">
      However, the containers described in the prior art do not provide a self-supporting unit that has pockets for conveniently holding personal articles such as cosmetics and the like on a vanity table or bathroom counter.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a need has continued to exist for such a self-supporting container for cosmetic articles and the like.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="25">
      The cosmetic container of the invention is designed to hold personal articles such as cosmetics, applicators, shaving supplies, and the like, conveniently on a vanity table or bathroom counter.
      <br/>
      It provides a place wherein such personal articles can be placed to prevent cluttering the table or counter surface and misplacing the articles.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The container is provided with a rigid shell that gives internal support and shape to the container.
      <br/>
      The shell is a hollow, generally cylindrical or prismatic structure made of a rigid material such as plastic, metal, or the like.
      <br/>
      The shell includes an upstanding wall that determines the general shape of the container.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment the circumference of the shell wall has a circular shape, i.e., a circular horizontal cross-section.
      <br/>
      However, the shell wall may alternatively have a polygonal, e.g., hexagonal, or elliptical horizontal cross-section.
      <br/>
      The shell wall need not be a completely closed structure, but the shell must have a wall that extends over a sufficient portion of the circumference of the container to provide support for the flexible cover with attached pockets.
      <br/>
      The shell may be formed by the wall alone.
      <br/>
      However, preferably the shell has a base or bottom that supports the wall.
      <br/>
      The base or bottom may be flat or downwardly concave so that it will rest on its bottom surface or the rim or periphery thereof.
      <br/>
      The wall is attached at its lower edge to the periphery of the base of the shell and extends upward to support the cover with its upper edge.
      <br/>
      The wall need not be continuous, but should extend over enough of the periphery of the base to provide sufficient support and rigidity for the cover to hold and contain the articles it is intended to store.
      <br/>
      The wall of the shell need not be exactly vertical, but it is preferable that the wall should not deviate from the vertical to the extent that the container will be distorted.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is preferred that the wall of the shell should be approximately vertical.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The shell may be made of any material that provides sufficient rigidity to provide firm support for the cover.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the shell may be made of metal, plastic, ceramic, wood, or the like.
      <br/>
      It may be made of continuous sheet of material, optionally perforated to reduce its weight, or it may be woven as a basket or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The cover is formed from a flexible material such as woven cloth, plastic sheet material, nonwoven web, or the like.
      <br/>
      It is preferred to make the cover from a cloth web that may be dyed, printed, trimmed, or otherwise decorated to provide a decorative and pleasing appearance to the container.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The cover is shaped to fit over the wall of the shell.
      <br/>
      It has a central pocket with a closed bottom and a sidewall generally conforming to the interior of the wall of the shell.
      <br/>
      An exterior panel covers the outside of the shell.
      <br/>
      The central pocket is closed at the bottom and may extend to the bottom of the shell or to a lesser depth within the shell.
      <br/>
      One or more peripheral pockets are preferably formed on the inside of the sidewall of the central pocket.
      <br/>
      These peripheral pockets may be of various sizes as needed to accommodate the various cosmetic articles and supplies intended to be contained therein.
      <br/>
      The peripheral pockets may be attached to the sidewall of the central pocket by any conventional means, such as sewing, adhesive, hook and loop fasteners, or the like.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the cover be formed of woven cloth, and that the pockets be attached thereto by sewing.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The exterior panel of the cover may be made of any of the materials usable for the sidewall and bottom of the central pocket.
      <br/>
      It may be made of the same material as the central pocket or of a different material.
      <br/>
      Preferably the exterior panel will be made of the same material as the central pocket.
      <br/>
      The exterior panel is also provided with one or more peripheral pockets, of a size appropriate for containing personal and cosmetic articles.
      <br/>
      These peripheral pockets are attached to the exterior panel by any conventional procedure as discussed above for the peripheral pockets of the central pocket.
      <br/>
      Preferably the exterior panel is made of cloth and the pockets are attached thereto by sewing.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The cover is removably secured to the shell or about the shell, in order to hold the cover securely in place, yet permit it to be removed for cleaning or to substitute a different cover.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the cover is provided with a fastening element generally attached to the lower edge of the exterior panel.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The fastening element may comprise a pressure sensitive adhesive applied to the one or both of the exterior panel or the shell wall at a location generally adjacent to the bottom of the shell.
      <br/>
      The fastening element may also be a conventional snap fastener or hook and loop fastener, with mating parts of the fastener mounted on the shell and the exterior panel of the cover generally adjacent to the bottom of the shell.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The fastening element may also be a flexible flap of cloth or the like attached to the lower edge of the exterior panel and extending below the lower edge of the panel so as to be adapted to be folded under the shell.
      <br/>
      The flap may be provided with an adhesive area or fasteners as discussed above to fasten the flap to the base or bottom of the shell, if the shell has a closed base, or to the bottom of the central pocket if the bottom of the shell is open.
      <br/>
      The fastening element may also be a pair of flaps that fold under the shell and are provided with adhesive areas or fasteners to secure the flaps to one another.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment the fastening element is a flexible skirt, extending downward from the lower edge of the exterior panel, that can be folded under the shell.
      <br/>
      The skirt is provided with adhesive areas, snap fasteners, hook and loop fasteners, or the like, to fasten opposite portions of the skirt together when the skirt is folded under the shell.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the skirt is provided with hook and loop fasteners (Velcro.RTM.).
    </p>
    <p num="34">The bottom of the central pocket and the inside of the base of the shell (or the skirt if the bottom of the shell is open) may also be provided with complementary fasteners, e.g., hook and loop fasteners, in order to secure the central pocket to the base of the shell or to the folded skirt.</p>
    <p num="35">A preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein the reference numerals refer to the same elements in each figure.</p>
    <p num="36">
      The illustrated cosmetic container 100 of the invention comprises a shell 200, best seen in FIG. 2, and a cover 300 designed to fit over the shell 200.
      <br/>
      The shell 200, in the illustrated embodiment, has a bottom or base 202 and generally cylindrical wall 204 having a rim 206.
      <br/>
      The wall 204 is preferably of circular cross section, as shown.
      <br/>
      However it is not excluded that the wall 204 may have other cross-sections, such as elliptical, polygonal, e.g., hexagonal, or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The cover 300 is comprised of a central or interior pocket 302 having a sidewall 304 which is sewn in a generally cylindrical form with a closed bottom 306.
      <br/>
      An exterior panel 308 of the cover 300 surrounds the wall 204 of the shell 200.
      <br/>
      The exterior panel 308 is generally of a height to match the height of the wall 204 of the shell 200.
      <br/>
      A skirt 310 depends from the bottom of the exterior panel 308.
      <br/>
      One or more interior peripheral pockets 312 may be sewn or otherwise fastened to the sidewall 304 of the central pocket 302, and one or more exterior peripheral pockets 314 may be arranged around the exterior panel 308 of the cover 300.
      <br/>
      The number and arrangement of the interior pockets 312 and exterior pockets 314 may be varied as convenient to provide a useful container for cosmetic articles and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In order to secure the cover 300 about the shell 200, the skirt 310 is provided with fasteners 318 that mate with one another when the skirt is folded under the bottom 202 of the shell 300.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the fasteners 318 are of the hook and loop type (Velcro.RTM.), sewn to the skirt 310 in mating pairs generally opposite one another.
      <br/>
      Two pairs of fasteners are illustrated, but more or fewer pairs can be used.
      <br/>
      The opposite members of a pair will mate when the opposite portions of the skirt 310 are folded over the bottom 202 of the shell 200, as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      If desired, a fastener 316 may be fixed to the bottom 306 of pocket 302.
      <br/>
      A complementary fastener 208 is mounted on the inside of the bottom 202 of the shell 200 in order to fasten the bottom 306 of the pocket 302 to the bottom 202 of the shell 200.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The manner of assembling the container 100 of the invention is illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      The cover 300 is fitted over the shell 200 and the skirt 310 of the cover 300 is folded over the bottom 202 of the shell 200 so that the fasteners 318 meet and secure the cover 300 about the shell 200.
      <br/>
      The assembled container is shown in inverted position in FIG. 3.
