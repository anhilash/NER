    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to an image forming apparatus such as a digital copying machine for creating an image signal by reading an image of a document or the like by use of a scanner, for example, and then forming an image on paper according to the image signal by use of a laser printer.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Generally, in a digital copying machine or the like dealing with image information, an image signal read by use of reading means such as a scanner is converted into a proper form, for example, multi-density form depending on the service objective.
      <br/>
      At this time, if the entire portion or part of the read image is too light or too dark, an input image is subjected to a process for adjusting the density characteristic and then output by use of a laser printer.
      <br/>
      Conventionally, the adjustment of the density characteristic is generally made by use of a conversion table in which the relation between the density of the input image signal and the corresponding density of the output image signal is set.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The adjustment method using the conversion table necessitates a memory of a large capacity as a memory for storing conversion tables as the number of types of the conversion tables increases and the number of multi-density levels of the image increases.
      <br/>
      If the multi-density data is expressed by eight bits, it is necessary to store 8-bit values obtained after conversion and used for the adjustment for each of 256 densities which can be represented by eight bits in order to adjust the density characteristic of the image signal.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Therefore, one conversion table necessitates a capacity of 8 bits * 256, and if a plurality of conversion tables are used, a memory of extremely large storage capacity is required.
      <br/>
      For example, when the density adjustment is made by use of a manual density setting button for each mode such as a photographic mode or character mode, a memory of extremely large storage capacity is required.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Further, a method using a circuit for deriving values to be stored into the conversion table on the real time basis instead of previously storing the conversion tables in the memory is provided.
      <br/>
      When the linear conversion is made, a table value deriving circuit used for this purpose can be made relatively small in scale and simple in construction, but if the conversion is made according to a complicated curved line or a curved line which cannot be expressed by an equation, a circuit complicated in construction and large in scale is necessary or the conversion cannot be attained by use of a circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Further, generally, values actually converted by use of the conversion table are not values which are linearly changed before and after the conversion, and they vary along a curved line expressed by a complicated equation or cannot be expressed by an equation in most cases.</p>
    <p num="8">In addition, when the density adjustment is made by use of values stored in the conversion table, the content of the adjustment is limited to a range defined by the values in the conversion table and the degree of freedom of the density adjustment becomes low.</p>
    <p num="9">An object of this invention is to provide an image forming apparatus in which the storage capacity of a memory for storing density adjustment tables can be reduced and the density adjustment can be performed with a relatively high degree of freedom.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="18">There will now be described an embodiment of this invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="19">An embodiment in which this invention is applied to a multifunctional digital image forming apparatus having three functions of a copying machine (PPC), facsimile (FAX) and printer (PRT) is explained.</p>
    <p num="20">FIG. 1 is a cross sectional view showing the internal structure of a digital copying machine as one embodiment of the image forming apparatus of this invention.</p>
    <p num="21">As shown in FIG. 1, the digital copying machine includes a main body 10 of the apparatus, and a scanner section 4 functioning as reading means as will be described later and a printer section 6 functioning as image forming means are provided in the main body 10.</p>
    <p num="22">
      A document table 12 on which an object to be read, that is, a document D is placed is provided on the upper surface of the main body 10.
      <br/>
      Further, an automatic document feeder (which is hereinafter referred to as ADF) 7 for feeding a document onto the document table 12 is arranged on the upper surface of the main body 10.
      <br/>
      The ADF 7 also functions as a document cover movably disposed to open or close the document table 12 and put the document D placed on the document table 12 closely in contact with the document table 12 made of glass, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The ADF 7 includes a document tray 8, an empty sensor 9 for detecting the presence or absence of the document, a pickup roller 14 for taking out documents one at a time from the document tray 8, a paper feeding roller 15 for feeding the taken-out document, an aligning roller pair 16 for aligning the front end portion of the document, and a feeding belt 18 arranged to cover substantially the whole portion of the document table 12.
      <br/>
      A plurality of documents set in the document tray 8 with the upper surfaces thereof facing up are sequentially taken from the bottom one, that is, the last page, aligned by the aligning roller pair 16 and then fed to a preset position of the document table 12 by the feeding belt 18.
    </p>
    <p num="24">In the ADF 7, a reversing roller 20, non-reverse sensor 21, flapper 22 and paper discharging roller 23 are disposed on an end portion opposite to the aligning roller pair 16 with the feeding belt 18 set therebetween.</p>
    <p num="25">
      The document D whose image information is read by the scanner 4 which will be described later is fed out from the document table 12 and discharged onto a document discharging section 24 on the upper surface of the ADF 7 via the reversing roller 20, flapper 22 and paper discharging roller 23.
      <br/>
      When the undersurface of the document D is read, the document D fed by the feeding belt 18 by switching the position of the flapper 22 is reversed by the reversing roller 20 and then fed to a preset position on the document table 12 by the feeding belt 18.
    </p>
    <p num="26">The scanner section 4 disposed in the main body 10 includes an exposure lamp 25 used as a light source for illuminating the document D placed on the document table 12 from the underside and a first mirror 26 for deflecting light reflected from the document D in a preset direction, and the exposure lamp 25 and first mirror 26 are mounted on a first carriage 27 disposed below the document table 12.</p>
    <p num="27">The first carriage 27 is disposed so as to move in parallel to the document table 12 and is moved back and forth beneath the document table 12 by a driving motor via a toothed belt (not shown) or the like.</p>
    <p num="28">
      Further, a second carriage 28 which can move in parallel to the document table 12 is disposed below the document table 12.
      <br/>
      Second and third mirrors 30, 31 which sequentially deflect the light reflected from the document D and deflected by the first mirror 26 are disposed at right angles on the second carriage 28.
      <br/>
      The second carriage 28 is driven by the toothed belt which drives the first carriage 27 to follow the first carriage 27 and is moved in parallel to the document table 12 at a speed half that of the first carriage 27.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In addition, an image forming lens 32 for converging the light reflected from the mirror 31 on the second carriage 28 and a CCD sensor 34 for receiving the light converged by the image forming lens 32 and subjecting the received light to photoelectric conversion are disposed below the document table 12.
      <br/>
      The image forming lens 32 is disposed to be moved via a driving mechanism in a plane containing the optical axis of the light deflected by the third mirror 31 and it forms an image based on the reflected light with a desired magnification according to the movement thereof.
      <br/>
      Then, the CCD sensor 34 subjects the received reflected light to photoelectric conversion and outputs an electric signal corresponding to the read image of the document D.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The printer section 6 includes a laser exposure device 40 acting as electrostatic latent image forming means.

    </p>
    <p num="31">The laser exposure device 40 with the above construction is fixedly supported on a supporting frame (not shown) of the main body 10 of the apparatus.</p>
    <p num="32">The semiconductor laser 41 is controlled into the ON or OFF state to emit laser light according to image information of the document D read by the scanner section 4 or document information for facsimile transmission/reception, and the laser light is supplied to the photosensitive drum 44 via the polygon mirror 36 and optical system 42 and scans the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 44 so as to form an electrostatic latent image on the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 44.</p>
    <p num="33">
      Further, the rotatable photosensitive drum 44 acts as an image carrier and is disposed at substantially the central portion of the main body 10.
      <br/>
      The peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 44 is exposed to the laser light from the laser exposure device 40 and a desired electrostatic latent image is formed thereon.
      <br/>
      An electric charger 45 for charging the peripheral surface of the drum 44 to a preset potential, a developer 46 for supplying toner as developing powder to the electrostatic latent image formed on the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 44 to develop the latent image with a desired image density, a transfer charger 48 integrally having a separation charger 47 for separating an image recording medium, that is, copy paper P supplied from a paper cassette which will be described later from the photosensitive drum 44 and acting to transfer a toner image formed on the photosensitive drum 44 to the paper P, a separation claw 49 for separating the paper P from the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 44, a cleaning device 50 for cleaning toner remaining on the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 44 and a discharging unit 51 for discharging the remaining charges on the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 44 are sequentially disposed around the photosensitive drum 44.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      On the lower portion in the main body 10, an upper-stage cassette 52, middle-stage cassette 53 and lower-stage cassette 54 which can be drawn from the main body of the apparatus are arranged in a stacked form and sheets of copy paper P with different sizes, for example, B5-size, B4-size and A4-size are received in the respective cassettes.
      <br/>
      A large-capacity feeder 55 is disposed on the side portion of the cassettes and approx. 3000 sheets of copy paper P of a size which is frequently used, for example, copy paper P of A4-size are stored in the large-capacity feeder 55.
      <br/>
      A paper feeding cassette 57 which is also used as a manual paper-feeding tray 56 is removably mounted above the large-capacity feeder 55.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In the main body 10, a feeding path 58 which extends from the cassettes 52, 53, 54 and large-capacity feeder 55 through a transferring section lying between the photosensitive drum 44 and the transfer charger 48 is formed and a fixing device 60 having a fixing lamp 60a is disposed at the end portion of the feeding path 58.
      <br/>
      A paper discharging port 61 is formed in the side wall of the main body 10 in position opposite to the fixing device 60 and a finisher 150 of single tray is disposed at the paper discharging port 61.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Pickup rollers 63 each for taking out the copy paper P one sheet at a time from a corresponding one of the cassettes 52-54 or the large-capacity feeder 55 are provided near the upper-stage cassette 52, middle-stage cassette 53, lower-stage cassette 54, paper feeding cassette 57 and large-capacity feeder 55.
      <br/>
      Further, a large number of paper feeding roller pairs 64 for feeding the copy paper P taken out by the pickup roller 63 along the feeding path 58 are disposed on the feeding path 58.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      A register roller pair 65 is disposed on the feeding path 58 on the upstream side of the photosensitive drum 44.
      <br/>
      The register roller pair 65 corrects the inclination of the taken-out copy paper P, aligns the front end of the toner image on the photosensitive drum 44 with the front end of the copy paper P and feeds the copy paper P to the transferring section at the same speed as the circumferential speed of the photosensitive drum 44.
      <br/>
      On the front side of the register roller pair 65, that is, on the side of the paper feeding roller 64, an unaligned state sensor 66 for detecting arrival of the copy paper P is disposed.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The copy paper P taken out one sheet at a time from the cassettes 52, 53, 54 or the large-capacity feeder 55 by the pickup roller 63 is fed to the register roller pair 65 by the paper feeding roller pairs 64.
      <br/>
      Then, the front end of the copy paper P is aligned by the register roller pair 65 and the copy paper is fed to the transferring section.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In the transferring section, a developer image or a toner image formed on the photosensitive drum 44 is transferred on the paper P by the transfer charger 48.
      <br/>
      The copy paper P having the toner image transferred thereon is separated from the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 44 by the action of the separation charger 47 and the separation claw 49 and then fed to the fixing device 60 via the feeding belt 67 constructing apart of the feeding path 58.
      <br/>
      After the developer image is melted and fixed on the copy paper P by the fixing device 60, the copy paper P is discharged onto the finisher 150 via the discharging port 61 by the paper feeding roller pair 68 and paper discharging roller pair 69.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      An automatic double face setting device 70 for reversing the copy paper P which has passed the fixing device 60 and feeding the copy paper to the register roller pair 65 again is disposed below the feeding path 58.
      <br/>
      The automatic double face setting device 70 includes a temporary storing section 71 for temporarily storing the copy paper P, a reversing path 72 for reversing the copy paper P which has been separated from the feeding path 58 and passed through the fixing device 60 and then supplying the copy paper to the temporary storing section 71, a pickup roller 73 for taking out the copy paper P one sheet at a time from the temporary storing section 71, and a paper feeding roller 75 for feeding the taken-out paper to the register roller pair 65 via a feeding path 74.
      <br/>
      In the branching portion of the feeding path 58 and the reversing path 72, a distributing gate 76 for selectively distributing the copy paper P to the paper discharging port 61 or reversing path 72 is disposed.
    </p>
    <p num="41">In order to make copies on both sides of the copy paper, the copy paper P which has passed through the fixing device 60 is supplied to the reversing path 72 by the distributing gate 76, temporarily stored in the temporary storing section 71 in the reversed state, and then fed to the register roller pair 65 via the feeding path 74 by the pickup roller 73 and paper feeding roller 75, After this, the copy paper P is aligned by the register roller 65 and fed to the transferring section again, and a toner image is transferred onto the undersurface of the copy paper P. Then, the copy paper P is discharged to the finisher 150 via the feeding path 58, fixing device 60 and paper discharging roller 69.</p>
    <p num="42">
      The finisher 150 staples documents discharged and constructing one copy together for each copy unit and store them.
      <br/>
      Each time one sheet of copy paper P to be stapled is discharged from the discharging port 61, the finisher pushes the copy paper towards the side on which it is to be stapled by use of a guide bar 151 and aligns the same.
      <br/>
      When all of the sheets of copy paper are discharged, the sheets of copy paper P of one copy unit discharged are pressed down by a paper pressing arm 152 and a stapler unit (not shown) staples them together.
      <br/>
      After this, the guide bar 151 is lowered and the sheets of copy paper P which are stapled are discharged to the finisher discharging tray 154 by the finisher discharging roller 155 for each copy unit.
      <br/>
      The distance of the finisher discharging tray 154 to be lowered is approximately determined by the number of sheets of copy paper P to be discharged and the tray is lowered in a stepwise fashion each time the documents of one copy unit is discharged.
      <br/>
      The guide bar 151 for aligning the copy paper P to be discharged is set in such a high position that it will not collide with the copy paper P which is already stapled and disposed on the finisher discharging tray 154.
    </p>
    <p num="43">The finisher discharging tray 154 is connected to a shifting mechanism (not shown) for shifting the documents of each copy unit (for example, in four directions of front, rear, right and left) in the sorting mode.</p>

    <p num="129">As a result, the storage capacity of a memory for storing the tables used for density adjustment can be reduced and the density adjustment can be changed with a relatively high degree of freedom.</p>
    <p num="130">FIG. 9 is a block diagram showing one example of a concrete circuit of the density characteristic adjusting table section 133, density characteristic adjustment value calculating section 134, and density characteristic adjusting section 135 shown in FIG. 4 and the construction and operation thereof are explained below.</p>
    <p num="131">
      In FIG. 9, a register circuit 141 is included in the density characteristic adjusting table section 133 and a total of 17 registers reg0, reg1, reg2, . . . , reg16 are provided in the register circuit 141.
      <br/>
      Also, terminals of the CPU data bus and address bus, read terminal RD, write terminal WT connected to the main CPU 91 are provided in the register circuit 141.
    </p>
    <p num="132">An 8-bit output from each of the registers reg0 to reg16 is supplied to a selector 142 and upper 4 bits Din_U of an 8-bit input image signal Din are supplied to a selection terminal of the selector 142.</p>
    <p num="133">
      As an output of the selector 142, new�d� and new�d+1� are derived, and new�d� and new�d+1� are obtained when register address data supplied to the selection terminal is Din_U, and new�d� is obtained when the register address data is Din_U. new�d� is data of a register address Din_U and new�d+1� is register address Din_U+1.
      <br/>
      The above data items are of 8 bits and supplied to an arithmetic circuit 143.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      The arithmetic circuit 143 is supplied with lower 4 bits Din_D of the input image signal and performs a preset operation.
      <br/>
      The operation is given by the following expression.
      <br/>
      (new�d+1�-new�d�)/16 * (Din_D)
    </p>
    <p num="135">The above operation is to derive a value of the second term on the right-hand side of the above expression and an output image signal T is derived by adding the thus derived value to a value new�d� of the first term on the right-hand side in an adder 144.</p>
    <p num="136">Next, the document copying operation of the image forming apparatus of this embodiment is explained with reference to FIG. 10.</p>
    <p num="137">
      First, assume that the power source switch is turned ON and it is detected in the step S11 that a preset copying mode is specified.
      <br/>
      In this state, the main CPU 91 checks in the step S12 whether or not the density adjusting operation has been effected on the operation panel 83.
    </p>
    <p num="138">If the result of the checking operation in the step S12 is "NO", the main CPU 91 directly effects the step S18 to start the copying operation.</p>
    <p num="139">If it is detected that the density adjusting operation is specified, whether the corresponding relation of the input image signal and the first density characteristic adjustment data are changed or not is checked in the step S13, and if the result is "YES", the step S14 is effected to change the corresponding relation of the first density characteristic adjustment data and the input image signal.</p>
    <p num="140">If the result in the step S13 is "NO", the step S15 is effected to read out the value of the set output image density, then, in the next step S16, a corresponding table is read out from the correction data table 130 and supplied to the table forming section 132 via the selector 131 and a density adjusting table indicating the value of the output image density in the specified copying mode is formed in the table forming section 132 and, in the step S17, the thus formed table is written into the register circuit 141 of the density characteristic adjustment table section 133.</p>
    <p num="141">In this state, the copying operation is started in the step S18.</p>
    <p num="142">First, whether the second density characteristic adjustment data written into the register circuit 141 coincides with the input image signal or not is checked, and if the result is "YES", the step S20 is effected to perform the printing operation and then the process is completed.</p>
    <p num="143">
      If the result in the step S19 is "NO", the step S21 is effected to derive a third density characteristic adjustment table by effecting the interpolation based on the upper and lower second density characteristic adjustment data items corresponding to an input image signal read by the scanner section 4 and then the printing operation is effected by use of the thus derived value in the step S20.
      <br/>
      That is, an input image signal Din is supplied for each pixel to the selector 142, and in the step S16, data obtained after the density adjustment and corresponding to the input pixel is derived by the arithmetic circuit 143 and adder 144.
    </p>
    <p num="144">The thus derived density characteristic adjustment value is supplied to the density characteristic adjusting section 135, the input image signal from the scanner section 4 is subjected to the preset density adjustment, a derived output image signal is supplied to the printer section 6, the printing operation is effected in the step S20 and the copying operation is completed.</p>
    <p num="145">In the above explanation, the density characteristic adjustment table is formed by effecting the linear interpolation by using the adjustment table containing data items of a number less than the number of data items of input multi-density data, but as the interpolation method, the Lagrange interpolation method, spline interpolation method, method of least square, Newton interpolation method, Neville interpolation method can be used in the same manner as described above instead of the linear interpolation method.</p>
    <p num="146">As described above, according to this invention, it is possible to provide an image forming apparatus in which the storage capacity of a memory used can be reduced since it is not necessary to previously provide data tables for density adjustment and necessary data can be obtained by an real-time operation and the range of adjustment can be set with a relatively high degree of freedom since data used as a reference for adjustment can be freely changed.</p>
    <p num="147">
      Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.
