    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a magnetic head for recording or reproducing information to or from a magnetic recording medium of magnetic disk apparatus or magnetic tape apparatus, and more particularly, to a head having a narrow core width for higher magnetic field intensity.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      With the realization of high recording density of a magnetic recording medium, high performance of magnetic heads is now required.
      <br/>
      In order to realize high recording density, the line recording density and track density of a magnetic recording medium must be improved, which means a magnetic head should assure high frequency recording and less recording blur.
      <br/>
      Here, a "recording blur" means the phenomenon of the recording magnetic field spreading in the track width direction at the time of data writing enough to influence adjacent tracks.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Particular attention is now focused on magneto-resistive ("MR") heads that can be used for a small size disk apparatus while assuring high output which does not depend on the velocity of the magnetic recording medium.
      <br/>
      This MR head satisfies the requirement for high recording density.
      <br/>
      As a magnetic head having a MR head, a specific magnetic head called a composite type head is well known.
      <br/>
      This composite type head is formed by stacking in the laminating direction.
      <br/>
      It has a reproducing head of multilayer structure to read magnetic information from a magnetic recording medium and a recording head of multilayer structure to write information to the magnetic recording medium.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      There is a member at the boundary of the reproducing head and the recording head.
      <br/>
      In particular, a magnetic shield layer (upper magnetic shield layer) in the side of the reproducing head is also used as the lower magnetic pole in the side of the recording head among a pair of magnetic poles of the recording head.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the surface (ABS or floating surface) of the lower magnetic pole, which is part of the recording head opposite to the magnetic recording medium, is formed wider than the width of the recording tracks of the magnetic recording medium.
      <br/>
      As a result, in the writing operation, the recording magnetic field is generated from the lower magnetic pole, which spreads widely in the track direction of the recording medium.
      <br/>
      However, it becomes difficult to narrow the track width and reduce the track pitch, both being requirements for high recording density.
      <br/>
      Both upper and lower magnetic poles of the recording head are connected at the center area of an eddy type recording coil, and a recording magnetic field is generated over the Air Bearing Surface ("ABS") between the lower magnetic pole and the upper magnetic pole.
      <br/>
      In order to improve the recording density, it is required to set the core width of the ABS of the upper magnetic pole to a small size (1  MU m or less) to reduce the recording blur.
      <br/>
      However, there are some barriers for realizing fine width of the core.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      As illustrated in FIG. 1, since a recording coil 112 is embedded in an interlayer insulating layer 111 formed between the upper and lower magnetic poles, a large difference of levels exists at the surface of the interlayer insulating layer 111.
      <br/>
      Therefore, liquid resist 115, coated on the interlayer insulating layer 111, used in the process of forming the upper magnetic pole, flows toward the lower level area.
      <br/>
      As a result, the resist 115 becomes thin at the higher level area (flat area) but becomes comparatively thick at the lower level area (bottom area).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the process of forming the upper magnetic pole, resist 115 is first formed at the surface of interlayer insulating layer 111 and is then patterned to the predetermined shape.
      <br/>
      The upper magnetic pole is formed by plating on the area of the interlayer insulating layer 111 from which the resist 115 is removed.
      <br/>
      In order to form the upper magnetic pole in the predetermined thickness, the thickness of the resist on the flat area is required to be about 6  MU m. However, due to the existence of level (or thickness) differences of the interlayer insulating layer, the thickness of the resist on the bottom area becomes about 10  MU m. Here, it is very difficult to realize a target core width of 10  MU m or less for the ABS of the upper magnetic pole when the resist is formed in the thickness of 10  MU m or more.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In order to solve this problem, the applicant of the present invention has proposed, in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. HEI 9-109845 (Apr. 25, 1997), a partial trimming technique for the upper magnetic pole using a focused ion beam (FIB).
      <br/>
      In particular, it has been proposed that the upper magnetic pole be locally trimmed by the FIB method from the ABS surface side in order to narrow the core width during composite type magnetic head manufacturing process.

    <p num="8">
      FIGS. 2(a) and 2(b) show a process of trimming the upper magnetic pole using the focused ion beam method.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2(a), the upper magnetic pole 116 covers a part of an eddy type recording coil 112.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the upper magnetic pole 116 includes a pole 116a which is elongated in the area adjacent to the recording medium.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      FIG. 2(b) is a view showing the trimming process using the focused ion beam method for the pole 116a.
      <br/>
      In the trimming process, the lower magnetic pole located at both side portions and the lower area of the pole 116a (the area in contact with the gap layer of the upper magnetic pole 116) is trimmed by irradiation of the focused ion beam.
      <br/>
      With this trimming process, the width of the pole 116a of the upper magnetic pole 116 is shaped to the desired size, and a groove (trench) or recess is formed in the upper layer of the lower magnetic pole located at both lower areas of the pole.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      As explained above, the width of the pole 116a can be finished in the fine dimension using the focused ion beam method.
      <br/>
      Spread in the track width direction of the recording magnetic field generated between the upper and lower magnetic poles can be minimized using the upper magnetic pole 116 having the pole of fine width.
      <br/>
      As a result, the writing of data in higher track density can be realized on the magnetic recording medium.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      However, trimming of the upper magnetic pole using the focused ion beam will deteriorate productivity.
      <br/>
      In the focused ion beam method, the ion beam is focused to predetermined positions in both sides of the pole to set the ion irradiation area in every head element to trim the width of the pole to 1  MU m or less.
      <br/>
      Because a plurality of head elements are formed on a wafer substrate, longer time is required since the process must be repeated for each head element.
      <br/>
      For example, even if the processing time of one head element is about 10 seconds, it will take over a day (27.7 hours) for processing only a sheet of wafer because there are about 10,000 heads in a 5-inch wafer, which is still comparatively small in size.
      <br/>
      It is simply not practical to use focused ion beam equipment for actual production.
    </p>
    <p num="12">The applicant of the present invention has proposed to replace the use of the focused ion beam method disclosed in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. HEI 10-184780 (Jun. 25, 1998) for trimming the upper magnetic pole with the ion milling method.</p>
    <p num="13">
      FIGS. 3(a) and 3(b) illustrate the trimming of the upper magnetic pole using the ion milling method.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3(a) is a plan view of the upper magnetic pole, and FIG. 3(b) is a cross-sectional view along the line B--B of FIG. 3(a).
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      First, as illustrated in FIG. 3(a), resist 26 is coated to the area, except for the object area of trimming when the upper magnetic pole 116 is formed.
      <br/>
      In practice, the pole 116a of the upper magnetic pole and the area, except for the lower magnetic pole 114 located at the lower area of the pole, are covered with resist.
      <br/>
      The trimming is performed by radiating the side surface of an elongated pole of the upper magnetic pole and the upper layer of the lower magnetic pole with the ion beam as shown in FIG. 3(b) as the substrate is rotated.
      <br/>
      In the initial stage of trimming, the incident angle of the ion beam to the side surface of the pole is ranged from 10 (degree)  to 40 (degree) , and the upper layer of the lower magnetic pole 114 is mainly trimmed.
      <br/>
      After the upper layer of the lower magnetic pole 114 is trimmed up to the predetermined depth, the trimming is executed to the side surface of the pole 116a at an incident angle of the ion beam  THETA  being set to 50 (degree)  to 80 (degree) .
    </p>
    <p num="15">Trimming by this ion milling method makes it possible to shape many head elements formed on the wafer at one time, and therefore the trimming time is reduced to a large extent in comparison to the focused ion beam method.</p>
    <p num="16">
      In Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. HEI 10-184780, the ion beam is irradiated under the condition that the substrate is rotated about an axis and is irradiated at an angle with respect to the axis.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the head elements formed on the wafer receive the ion beam in various directions.
      <br/>
      During the period of the ion beam irradiating from the pole side of the upper magnetic pole, the trimming is performed effectively.
      <br/>
      However, while the period of the ion beam irradiating from the flat area side of the upper magnetic pole, the ion beam is shielded by the flat area of the upper magnetic pole in the higher stacking height.
      <br/>
      Thus, the target area of trimming is not hit by the ion beam, specifically the upper layer area of the lower magnetic pole.
      <br/>
      A longer time is then required to finish the head element to the predetermined shape even when using the technique disclosed in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. HEI 10-184780.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Moreover, in trimming by the ion milling method, the ion beam is radiated not only to the side surface of the pole but also to the upper surface thereof.
      <br/>
      Since the upper surface of the pole is located at a comparatively high position, it is always irradiated with the ion beam without relation to the irradiating direction of ion beam.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the trimming time becomes longer, the reduction in height of pole (pole length) is also increased.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Since the pole length influences the intensity of the magnetic field generated by the recording head, the shorter the pole length becomes the weaker the intensity of the magnetic field becomes.
      <br/>
      In the recording operation to the recording medium, an adequate intensity of magnetic field to be given to the recording medium is two times the reactive magnetic force of the medium.
      <br/>
      Since the reactive magnetic force of the recent recording medium is about 2500 (Oe), the magnetic field intensity of about 5000 (Oe) is required.
      <br/>
      To satisfy this requirement, reduction in pole length due to the ion milling method must be minimized.

    <heading>OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a magnetic head manufacturing method which is suitable for high recording density.</p>
    <p num="20">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method to manufacture a magnetic head having narrow core width.</p>
    <p num="21">A further object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a magnetic head having higher magnetic field intensity.</p>
    <p num="22">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a magnetic head which can reduce the adjusting time of core width.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="23">
      In the magnetic head manufacturing method of the present invention, the core width of the elongated pole of the upper magnetic pole is adjusted by using the ion milling method in the condition such that the substrate is not rotated.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the ion beam irradiating direction is fixed by performing the trimming such that the substrate is not rotated, and thereby the ion beam can be applied only to the targeted trimming object.
      <br/>
      As a result, the trimming time is then shortened, and reduction of pole length can also be controlled.
      <br/>
      It follows that the magnetic field intensity generated by the magnetic head is enhanced.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the trimming process is conducted by setting a plurality of combinations of the rotating angle of substrate and tilting angle.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the ion beam irradiating direction can be changed depending on the trimming object portion and the trimming time can be further reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Here, the trimming to the upper layer of the lower magnetic pole and the side surface of the elongated pole of the upper magnetic pole can be performed effectively by changing the tilting angle in two steps.
      <br/>
      For example, when the upper layer of the lower magnetic pole is considered as the target, the ion beam is preferably incident in the angle of 10 (degree)  to 40 (degree)  to the rotating shaft.
      <br/>
      When the side surface of the elongated pole of the upper magnetic pole is considered as the target, the ion beam is preferably incident in the angle of 50 (degree)  to 80 (degree)  to the rotating shaft.
      <br/>
      Since the tilting angle of the substrate is set to the above angles, the ion beam can be applied effectively to the trimming object.
      <br/>
      Thus, reduction of the thickness of the area outside the trimming object, such as the pole length can be controlled.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The trimming can also be conducted to the right side area and left side area of the head element by changing the rotating angle in two steps.
      <br/>
      For example, when the right side viewed from the ABS surface is set as the target, the ion beam is incident in the counterclockwise angle of 20 (degree)  to 90 (degree)  from normal to the ABS.
      <br/>
      However, when the left side is set as the target, the ion beam is incident in the clockwise angle of 20 (degree)  to 90 (degree)  from normal to the ABS.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, recording blur can be eased by making the core width of the recording gap layer equal to the core width of the upper layer of the lower magnetic pole in order to realize high recording density.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="27">
      FIG. 4 is an exploded view of the preferred embodiment of the composite type magnetic head.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4, a protection layer at the upper most layer is omitted in order to show the internal side of the magnetic head.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, half of the recording head is also omitted for clarity.
      <br/>
      The composite type magnetic head is provided with a substrate 1, a substrate protection film 2 formed on the substrate, a reproducing head RE formed on this substrate protection film, a recording head WR formed on this reproducing head and a protection layer 17 (not shown)formed on this recording head.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The reproducing head RE includes a lower side magnetic shield layer 3, the first non-magnetic insulating layer (reproducing lower side gap layer) 4 formed on this lower side magnetic shield layer 3, a magnetic transducer 5 formed on the reproducing lower side gap layer 4, a pair of terminals 6a, 6b (only one is shown) formed on both ends of the magnetic transducer 5, a second non-magnetic insulating layer (reproducing upper side gap layer) 7 formed on a pair of terminals 6a, 6b and an upper side magnetic shield layer 8 formed on the reproducing upper side gap layer 7.
      <br/>
      Namely, the reproducing head RE covers both surfaces in the Z direction of the magnetic transducer 5 and terminals 6a, 6b (FIG. 5(a)') with the upper and lower gap layers 4, 7.
      <br/>
      In addition, the upper and lower gap layers 4,7 are covered by a lower side magnetic shield layer 3 and an upper side magnetic shield layer 8.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The upper side magnetic shield layer 8 is a merge type layer working also as the lower magnetic pole of the recording head WR which will be explained later.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the specification, the upper side magnetic shield/recording lower magnetic pole 8 is expressed as the upper side magnetic shield layer 8 or lower magnetic pole 8.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The recording head WR includes a lower magnetic pole 8, a recording gap layer 9, an eddy type recording coil 12 arranged on the recording gap layer 9, third and fourth non-magnetic insulating layers 10, 11 covering the recording coil 12 and an upper magnetic pole 16 formed on the third and fourth non-magnetic insulating layers.
      <br/>
      Namely, the recording head WR covers both surfaces of the gap layer 9 and the third and fourth non-magnetic insulating layers 10, 11 sandwich the recording coil 12 with the lower magnetic pole 8 and upper magnetic pole 16.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      However, the recording coil does not exist at the eddy type center area 13 of the recording coil 12.
      <br/>
      In this eddy type center area, the upper magnetic pole 16 drops so it is in contact with the lower magnetic pole 8.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the upper magnetic pole 16 becomes narrower toward the recording medium 20, and this portion is the pole 16a.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As explained above, the composite type magnetic head illustrated in FIG. 4 has a piggy-back structure in that the recording head WR is added to the rear side of the reproducing head RE.
      <br/>
      In view of making clear the positional relationship of the elements of the magnetic head, as shown in FIG. 4, the direction along the ABS surface of upper magnetic pole 16 is defined as the X direction, the direction vertical to the ABS surface is the Y direction and the stacking direction of the magnetic head is the Z direction.
      <br/>
      Each element of the composite type magnetic head will be explained.

      The gap layer 9 has a thickness of about 0.2 to 0.6  MU m. The recording magnetic field is generated at the pole 16a of the upper magnetic pole and the ABS surface of the lower magnetic pole 8 located at both sides of the gap layer 9.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The lower magnetic shield layer 3, the upper magnetic shield layer 8 and the upper magnetic pole 16 are composed, for example, of NiFe alloy.
      <br/>
      This alloy may also be replaced with the Co-based alloy (i.e., CoNiFe and CoZr) and Fe-based alloy (i.e., FeN and FeNZr).
      <br/>
      The thickness of upper magnetic pole 16 is about several  MU m.

      The magnetic transducer 5 is composed, for example, of anisotropic magneto-resistive effect element(MR element) or typically a gigantic magneto-resistive effect element (GMR element) such as spin bulb magneto-resistive element.
      <br/>
      At both ends of the magnetic transducer 5, a pair of terminals 6a, 6b are connected.
      <br/>
      In the data reading operation, a constant current (sense current) flows into the magnetic transducer 6 through these terminals.

      The composite type magnetic head reads information recorded from a magnetic recording medium 20 with a reproducing head RE while moving relatively along the longitudinal direction of the track on the recording medium 20 such that it is isolated by a small distance (floating amount) from the recording medium 20 such as a magnetic disk.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it writes magnetic information to the recording medium 20 with the recording head WR.
      <br/>
      The surface opposite to the magnetic recording medium 20 of the magnetic head is called the ABS or floating surface.

      <br/>
      Here, as illustrated in the partial enlarged view FIG. 5(a)'), the magnetic transducer 5 is sandwiched between the first non-magnetic insulating layer 4 and the second non-magnetic insulating layer 7, and both ends of the magnetic transducer 5 are respectively connected to the pair of terminals 6a, 6b.
      <br/>
      In addition, the upper layer of the lower magnetic pole 8 allows formation of a trench or a pair of recesses 8a, 8b at both sides of the base area of the pole 16a.

      For step S20, the first non-magnetic insulating layer (reproducing lower side gap layer) 4 is formed on the lower side magnetic shield layer 3.

    <p num="41">The magnetic transducer 5 and the pair of terminals 6a, 6b are formed in step S30, specifically the MR film, GMR film etc. are formed on the first nonmagnetic insulating layer 4 and the magnetic transducer 5 is formed by patterning.</p>
    <p num="42">Next, the pair of terminals 6a, 6b are formed respectively at both ends of the magnetic transducer 5.</p>

      In step S40, the second non-magnetic insulating layer (upper side gap layer) 7 is formed on the first non-magnetic insulating layer 4 to cover the magnetic transducer 5 and the pair of terminals 6a, 6b.
      <br/>
      The upper side magnetic shield layer/recording lower side magnetic pole 8 is next formed on the second non-magnetic insulating layer 7, as referred to by step S50.
      <br/>
      The lower magnetic pole 8 is formed by either the plating method or sputtering method.
      <br/>
      When the lower magnetic pole 8 is formed by the plating method, a Co-based alloy such as NiFe alloy or CoNiFe is used.
      <br/>
      After the plating base layer 14 is formed by the sputtering or the vacuum evaporation method, it will increase to a thickness of about several  MU m larger than that formed by the electrolytic method.
      <br/>
      In contrast, when the lower side magnetic pole 8 is formed by the sputtering method, the Fe-based alloy (i.e.,FeN, and FeNZr) or Co-based alloy (i.e., CoZr) is used as the target.
      <br/>
      If a film is formed using the sputtering method, the plating base layer is then not required.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Next, step S60 refers to the forming the recording gap layer 9 on the lower side magnetic pole 8.
      <br/>
      The gap layer 9 may be formed, for example, by Al2 O3, SiO2, etc.
      <br/>
      However, when a film with a higher etching rate such as SiO2 is used solely as the recording gap layer 9, the thickness of the recording gap layer 9 is sometimes reduced in the later process to form the third non-magnetic insulating layer (thermosetting (hard cure) layer of resist), the recording coil and the fourth nonmagnetic insulating layer (thermosetting (hard cure) layer of resist).
      <br/>
      In order to avoid such reduction of the film thickness of the recording gap layer 9, a gap protection layer 9a (FIG. 9(b)) can also be provided on the recording gap layer.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      FIG. 9(a) shows the magnetic head without the gap protection layer.

      In contrast, FIG. 9(b) is a view showing the magnetic head with the gap protection layer.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 9(b), the SiO2 layer is stacked first as the recording gap layer 9 and the gap protection layer 9a such as Al2 O3, SiN, AlN having a comparatively lower etching rate is stacked on the SiO2 film.
      <br/>
      The gap protection layer 9a is removed before the process of forming the plating base layer (indicated as step S100 in FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      This gap protection layer 9a is removed by chemical etching.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In step S70, the third non-magnetic insulating layer 10 is formed on the gap layer 9 (or gap protection layer 9a).
      <br/>
      In this step, the processes are all sequentially performed, for example, the coating of the photosensitive liquid photoresist by the spin coating method, the patterning, the removal of the part corresponding to the center area of the eddy coil 12 and the process of thermosetting (hard cure).
      <br/>
      The recording coil 12 is next formed in step S80.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      In step S90, the fourth non-magnetic insulating layer 11 is formed on the third non-magnetic insulating layer to cover the recording coil 12.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7(a) and FIG. 8(a) illustrate the shape of the magnetic head in this process.
      <br/>
      Similar to the formation of the third non-manetic insulating layer, the processes are again performed sequentially, for example, the coating of photosensitive liquid photoresist, the patterning, the removal of the part corresponding to the center area of eddy coil 12 and the thermosetting (hard cure).
      <br/>
      As explained above, because a hole 13 (FIG. 4) reaching the lower magnetic pole 8 is formed at the center area of eddy coil 12, the hole 13 may be made after the formation of the third and fourth non-magnetic insulating layers.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In step S100, also shown in FIG. 7(b)and FIG. 8(b), a plating base layer 14 is formed.
      <br/>
      Particularly, the plating base layer 14 consisting of NiFe is formed thin, including the internal surface of hole 13 formed on the fourth non-magnetic insulating layer 11 and the gap layer 9 by using the sputtering method, evaporation method, or other similar methods.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Next, at step S110, the upper magnetic pole 16 is formed.
      <br/>
      In this step, a window 15a of the photoresist 15 is formed in the area in which the upper magnetic pole should be formed through the coating of photoresist 15 on the plating base layer 14, exposing and developing the photoresist 15.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 7(c) and FIG. 8(c), the upper magnetic pole 16 consisting of NiFe is next formed in the thickness of several  MU m by using the electrolytic plating method within the window 15a.
      <br/>
      The upper magnetic pole 16 becomes narrower toward the ABS, thus, it becomes the narrow pole 16a in the area opposite to the recording medium.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the upper magnetic pole 16 is connected with the lower magnetic pole 8 through the hole 13 located at the center area of the eddy coil 12.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      In step S120, the plating base layer 14 is first removed by using the ion milling method as illustrated in FIG. 7(d) and FIG. 8(d).
      <br/>
      In this case, the upper magnetic pole 16 is also reduced in the thickness corresponding to the plating base layer 14.
      <br/>
      But since the plating base layer 14 and the upper magnetic pole 16 are formed with the identical material, the upper magnetic pole 16 is reformed substantially to its original thickness after the thickness of the layer 14 is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Next, as illustrated in FIG. 7(e) and FIG. 8(e), the pole 16a of the upper magnetic pole 16 and upper layer of the lower magnetic pole 8 are partially milled by using the ion milling method such that the substrate is at a stationary condition and then shaped to the predetermined shape.
      <br/>
      Before dividing the substrate 1, both sides of the pole 16a are trimmed by the ion milling method, and the pole 16a is narrowed as a result.
      <br/>
      Simultaneously, the lower magnetic pole 8 located at the lower peripheral area of the pole 16a is partially trimmed and a trench or recess 8a of the predetermined shape is formed in the upper layer of the lower magnetic pole 8.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, an electrode pad (not illustrated) is connected to the terminals at both ends of the transducer, and the electrode pads (not illustrated) connected to both ends of the recording coil 12 are formed.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      This trimming process may be performed at any desired period of time before the formation of the protection film and after the formation of the upper magnetic pole.
      <br/>
      In regard to the partial trimming process of the pole 16a and the lower magnetic pole 8, the work time can be greatly shortened in comparison to the trimming method under the condition of the substrate rotating.
      <br/>
      Since the manufacturing time of the magnetic head is shortened, the manufacturing cost is also reduced.
      <br/>
      The reason is that there is wasted time for irradiating the ion beam from the direction where the trimming effect cannot be attained using the substrate rotating method, whereas the ion milling is conducted only for the trimming object in the method of the present embodiment since the ion beam irradiating direction is fixed.

      A part of the wafer edge has a linear shape called orifla (orientation flat area).

      In order to identify the shape of the upper magnetic pole 16 after the trimming process, the width size of the pole in the X axis direction is called the core width "Cw", the length size in the film thickness direction is pole length Pl, the length from the position generating level difference of upper magnetic pole 16 (namely, size in the Y direction for the trimming process) up to ABS is "level difference height Dh", the depth of level difference measured in the upper magnetic pole thickness is "film thickness level difference Dt" and the length from the ABS up to the upper part of the sector shape 16b is the "neck length (Nh)", shown in FIG. 12(a) to FIG. 12(c).

      <br/>
      If the recording gap layer 9 is removed by the ion milling method, the thickness (pole length) of the upper magnetic pole 16 is reduced greatly to lower the recording capability.

      <br/>
      The first event in step S124 is that the trimming is conducted to the lower magnetic pole 8 in the right side seen from the ABS surface, as illustrated in FIG. 17(a).

      In the first routine in step S124, sufficient trimming is not performed to the left side area seen from the ABS surface, resulting in a second routine to conduct the trimming to the lower magnetic pole 8 in the left side.

Moreover, since the ion beam is a little tilted for the rotating axis, reduction of the pole length can be controlled.

      In the second routine in step S125, the sample board 25 is rotated while the tilt angle is maintained.

      In order to avoid such a phenomenon, as shown in FIG. 15(a) and FIG. 15(b), the core width direction size of the aperture 26a of resist 26 must be in the range of 20 to 30  MU m from the end part of the pole 16a.

      Moreover, in this embodiment, the trimming process is formed by the four steps and each step may be done in the selected sequence.
      <br/>
      For example, it is possible that each routine of step S125 is executed first, and thereafter each routine of step S124 is executed.

      FIG. 19 shows the effect of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Here, the present invention in which the trimming is conducted while the substrate is in stationary condition is compared with the reference HEI 10-184780 in which the trimming is conducted while the substrate is rotated, indicated by the two points of the total time of the trimming process and the reduction amount of the pole length.
      <br/>
      The target value of trimming depth of the lower magnetic pole is set to 0.3  MU m, and the target value of the trimming amount of the core width is set to 0.3  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      As shown in FIG. 19, the trimming time of the present invention is shortened by 30 minutes per wafer than that of the reference HEI 10-184780.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a reduction of 0.5  MU m in the pole length is also attained.
    </p>
    <p num="87">As explained above, the present invention has attained a reduction in the core width of the upper magnetic pole and still achieves high recording density in trimming the upper magnetic pole.</p>
    <p num="88">
      Moreover, since the trimming is conducted while the substrate is stationary, the ion beam can be irradiated selectively only to the trimming object, resulting in a shorter core width adjusting time.
      <br/>
      As a result, productivity is improved and cost reduction can also be attained.
      <br/>
      Because of the shorter adjusting time, the reduction of pole length from the trimming can be controlled, causing the magnetic head to be resistive to the magnetic field intensity.
