    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a soft magnetic thin film having high saturation magnetic flux density and magnetic permeability at higher frequencies and advantageously employed, e.g., as a core material for a magnetic head adapted for high density recording and/or reproduction, a method for producing the same, and a magnetic head for high density recording and/or reproduction wherein use is made of soft magnetic layers exhibiting a high saturation magnetic flux density and a high frequency magnetic permeability as the core material for the magnetic head.</p>
    <p num="3">The present invention further relates to a magnetic head for high density recording and/or reproduction having a diffusion inhibiting layer between a ferrite core and a particular soft magnetic layer.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      In the field of magnetic recording and/or reproducing apparatus, such as audio tape recorder or a video tape recorder (VTR), for example, the general tendency is towards a higher recording density and a higher quality of recording signals.
      <br/>
      In keeping with this tendency towards the higher recording density, a so-called metal tape in which powders of metals such as Fe, Co or Ni, or alloys thereof, are used as the magnetic powders, or a so-called vacuum-deposited tape in which a magnetic metal material is directly deposited on a base film by the thin film forming vacuum technique, has been developed and put to practical use in many technical fields.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Prior Art and Problem to be Solved</p>
    <p num="6">
      Meanwhile, if the characteristics of the magnetic recording medium having a predetermined coercive force is to be displayed fully, it is required of the core material for the magnetic head to exhibit a higher saturation magnetic flux density as its magnetic properties or characteristics.
      <br/>
      In addition, if reproduction is to be achieved with the same magnetic head as that used for recording, it is also required of the core material to exhibit a higher magnetic permeability.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Although the Sendust alloy (Fe--Si--Al, Bs about equal to 10 KG) or a Co-base amorphous alloy has so far been used, it is difficult with the Sendust alloy to increase the film thickness because of the larger inner stress imposed on the film and the difficulty in making a thick film due to the susceptibility of the film to growth of the crystal grains.
      <br/>
      Also the Sendust alloy has the saturation magnetic flux density Bs of about 10 KG, which however falls short in view of the tendency towards an increasing higher recording density.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, while the Co-base amorphous alloy has satisfactory magnetic properties and may be fabricated with a high saturation magnetic flux density Bs, it has a drawback that, since it is crystallized at 450 (degree)  C. or thereabouts, it cannot be glass bonded at elevated temperatures for preparing the magnetic head, such that it is not possible to develop a high enough bonding strength.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Among other soft magnetic materials is iron nitride, which is usually formed into a thin film by ion beam vacuum deposition or sputtering in a nitrogen-containing atomosphere, using iron as the target.
      <br/>
      However, the soft magnetic thin film of iron nitride has a drawback that the coercive force is markedly increased due to heating upon glass bonding and the magnetic properties thereof are inferior in stability.
    </p>
    <p num="9">In the JP Patent KOKAI 63-299219 (1988), there is disclosed a soft magnetic thin film which is aimed at obtaining the above mentioned drawback and which is represented by the formula Fex Ny Az wherein x, y and z each denote the compositional ratios in atomic percent and A denotes at least one of Si, Al, Ta, B, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Cr, Mn, Zr, Nb, Ti, Mo, V, W, Hf, Ga, Ge and rare earth elements, and wherein the compositional ratios are such that</p>
    <p num="10">
      0.5 &lt;= y &lt;= 5.0
      <br/>
      0.5 &lt;= z &lt;= 7.5 and
      <br/>
      x+y+z=100.
    </p>
    <p num="11">However, it is not preferred to use the soft magnetic thin film described in the JP Patent KOKAI 63-299219 (1988) in preparing a magnetic head by a process including the heating step, such as a glass bonding step, because its coercive force is inevitably increased on heating.</p>
    <p num="12">The above film has also a drawback that, because it does not assure uniaxial anisotropy, its magnetic permeability cannot be increased at higher frequencies.</p>
    <p num="13">
      Also, the crystal materials in general tend to be turned into columnar crystals, during the film depositing process, due to the self-shadowing effect, depending on the film forming conditions, so that voids tend to be formed in the grain boundary region resulting in magnetic discontinuity and inferior soft magnetic properties.
      <br/>
      These self-shadowing effect becomes particularly outstanding when there is a step-like surface irregularity on the underlayer or substrate as in the case of preparation of the magnetic head, or when a thicker film is to be produced, so that sufficient magnetic properties cannot be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="14">The soft magnetic thin film disclosed in the above prior art publication is not desirable as the magnetic head core material in view of the above mentioned drawbacks.</p>
    <p num="15">It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel soft magnetic thin film, a novel method for preparing a soft magnetic thin film and a novel magnetic head, which are free from the above-mentioned problems of the conventional art.</p>
    <p num="16">According to the present invention, the above object may be accomplished by a soft magnetic film, a method for producing the soft magnetic film and a magnetic head, which may be summarized in the following manner.</p>
    <p num="17">First Aspect:</p>
    <p num="18">
      There is provided a soft magnetic thin film represented by the compositional formula Fea Tb Nc wherein the a, b and c each stand for atomic percent and T stands for at least one of Zr, Hf, Ti, Nb, Ta, V, Mo or W and wherein the composition is in the range of
      <br/>
      0&lt;b &lt;= 20 and
      <br/>
      0&lt;c &lt;= 22
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      with the exclusion of the range defined by b &lt;= 7.5 and c &lt;= 5.
      <br/>
      Such compositional range is defined by a line conecting points E, F, G, H, I and J in FIG. 1 (referred to as "EFGHIJ composition" hereinafter).
    </p>
    <p num="20">As will become clear hereinafter, this soft magnetic thin film has a saturation magnetic flux density markedly higher than that of the Sendust alloy or the amorphous soft magnetic alloys and can provide a preferred embodiment with a zero magnetostriction to enable excellent soft magnetic properties such as the low coercive force and high magnetic permeability.</p>
    <p num="21">
      On the other hand, the soft magnetic thin film of the present Aspect has an electrical resistivity as high as that of Sendust and may be subjected to heat treatment in the magnetic field to develop uniaxial anisotropy, the magnitude of which can be controlled depending on the composition of the thin film and the duration of heat treatment to realize the high magnetic permeability at higher frequencies meeting requirements of the intended use and application.
      <br/>
      The thin film of the present Aspect has superior thermal resistance against the glass bonding since its characteristics are not deteriorated by heat treatment up to 650 (degree)  C. The thin film of the present Aspect also has high hardness and corrosion resistance and hence a high abrasion resistance, in the all, turning out to be a highly reliable material.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The soft magnetic thin film of the present invention exhibits satisfactory step coverage in film formation since the film material can be formed as an amorphous alloy for preparaing a film and can be subsequently heat-treated so as to be turned into a microcrystalline state.
      <br/>
      In addition, a mirror surface can be easily developed, while the crystal grains can be inhibited from coarsening (excessive grain growth) without the necessity of resorting to a multilayered structure so that a film of a larger thickness (thick film) may be produced.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Thus the soft magnetic thin film of the present Aspect may be employed as the core material for a magnetic head to cope with the high coercivity magnetic recording medium to realize high quality and bandwidth as well as high recording density.</p>
    <p num="24">Second Aspect:</p>
    <p num="25">There is provided a method for producing a soft magnetic thin film comprising the steps:</p>
    <p num="26">
      forming an amorphous alloy film of the EFGHIJ composition represented by the compositional formula Fea Tb Nc wherein a, b and c each stand for atomic percent and T stands for at least one of Zr, Hf, Ti, Nb, Ta, V, Mo or W and wherein the composition is in the range of
      <br/>
      0&lt;b &lt;= 20 and
      <br/>
      0&lt;c &lt;= 22
    </p>
    <p num="27">with the exclusion of the ranges of b &lt;= 7.5 and c &lt;= 5, and</p>
    <p num="28">crystallizing the resultant amorphous alloy film by heat treatment.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Although the amorphous alloy film of the above composition exhibits satisfactory step coverage when formed on a substrate having step differences, it fails to exhibit satisfactory soft magnetic properties.
      <br/>
      The present inventors have found that a thin film exhibiting satisfactory soft magnetic may be obtained by crystallizing the amorphous alloy film by heat treatment to a microcrystalline state, and that a soft magnetic thin film exhibiting uniaxial anisotropy may be obtained when the heat treatment is carried out in a magnetic field.
      <br/>
      These findings have led to completion of the present invention. (Note here, the term "crystallize" denotes to provide a microcrystalline state.)
    </p>
    <p num="30">As will become clear hereinafter, the soft magnetic thin film produced by the method of the present invention has a saturation magnetic flux density markedly higher than that of the Sendust alloy or the amorphous soft magnetic alloy and can provide a preferred embodiment with a zero magnetostriction to realize excellent soft magnetic properties such as the low coercive force and high magnetic permeability.</p>
    <p num="31">
      On the other hand, the soft magnetic thin film of the present invention has an electrical resistivity as high as that of Sendust and may be subjected to heat treatment in the magnetic field to develop uniaxial anisotropy, the magnitude of which can be controlled depending on the composition of the thin film and the duration of heat treatment to realize the high magnetic permeability at higher frequencies meeting requirements of the intended use and application.
      <br/>
      The thin film of the present invention has superior thermal resistance against the glass bonding since its characteristics are not deteriorated by heat treatment up to 650 (degree)  C. Thus the resultant thin film of the present Aspect has the same advantages as those mentioned in the first Aspect.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The soft magnetic thin film of the present Aspect exhibits satisfactory step coverage in film formation since the film material can be formed as amorphous alloy for preparaing a film and can be subsequently heat-treated so as to be turned into the microcrystalline state.
      <br/>
      In addition, a mirror surface can be easily developed, while the crystal grains can be inhibited from becoming coarse without the necessity of resorting to a multilayered structure so that a film of a larger thickness may be produced. (These advantages are the same as mentioned in the first Aspect).
    </p>
    <p num="33">Thus the soft magnetic thin film produced by the method of the present Aspect may be employed as the core material for a magnetic head to cope with the high coercivity magnetic recording medium to realize high quality and bandwidth as well as high recording density as is the case with the first Aspect.</p>

    <p num="61">
      The composite magnetic head having the diffusion preventing layer according to the 5th and 6th Aspects includes a ferrite core having each other opposing end faces and recesses receded from these end faces, soft magnetic layers of the above mentioned specified compositons which are provided between the opposing end faces of the core for defining a gap, and an diffusion preventive SiO2 layer provided at the interface between the core and the soft magnetic layer, so that it becomes possible to prevent the formation and growth of a diffusion layer with deteriorated magnetic properties between the ferrite core and the soft magnetic layers of the above mentioned specified compositions.
      <br/>
      Thus it is possible with the composite magnetic head of the present invention to suppress periodic fluctuations (so called beat) of the frequency characteristics of the reproduced signal during reproduciton to 1 dB or less.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to make use of the soft magnetic thin film of the above mentioned specified composition, which is freed of the inconveniences of the prior art soft magnetic thin film, as one of the constituent material of the composite magnetic head.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The present inventors arrived at a soft magnetic thin film which is freed of the previously mentioned disadvantages of the prior art soft magnetic thin film, and which is represented by the compositional formula Fea Zrb Nc or Fea Xb Nc, wherein a, b and c each denote atomic percent and x denotes at least one of Hf, Ti, Nb, Ta, V, Mo or W, and the compositional ranges are such that
      <br/>

    <p num="63">with the exclusion of b &lt;= 7.5 and c &lt;= 5 (generally, Fea Bb Nc compositon).</p>
    <p num="64">
      However, it has been found that a composite magnetic head utilizing the above mentioned soft magnetic thin film suffers from periodic fluctuations (beat) of frequency characteristics of the reproduced signals during reproduction and hence is insufficient as the magnetic head.
      <br/>
      The term "composite magnetic head" used herein means a magnetic head having a magnetic head core having each other opposing end faces and recesses receded from said end faces, soft magnetic layers exposed to at least said end faces and defining a gap, and glasses filling said recesses.
      <br/>
      It has also been found that the above mentioned periodic fluctuations are observed when the ferrite is used as the magnetic head core but are not observed when the nonmagnetic material is used as the magnetic head core.
    </p>
    <p num="65">The present inventors have now found following facts:</p>
    <p num="66">(i) a diffusion layer with markedly deteriorated magnetic properties is formed at an interface between the ferrite core and the soft magnetic layer of the above mentioned specific composition as a result of inevitable heating at the time of preparing the composite magnetic head, such as during or after formation of the soft magnetic layer of the specified composition on the ferrite core surface:</p>
    <p num="67">(ii) this diffusion layer is formed substantially parallel to the gap and hence acts as a pseudo-gap to affect the reproduced output of the head, such as by the above mentioned periodic fluctuations, and</p>
    <p num="68">
      (iii) formation of such diffusion layer may be prevented from occurring by providing an SiO2 diffusion preventive layer on the surface of the ferrite core on which the soft magnetic layers of the above mentioned compositon are to be formed.
      <br/>
      These findings have led to completion of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="69">Meanwhile, it is described in the JP Patent KOKAI Publication 63-298806 and 1-100714 to provide a thin film of nonmagnetic nitride film or a thin film of an oxide of Si or the like, respectively, at the interface between the magnetic metal thin film and the magnetic oxide material constituting the core of the composite magnetic head to suppress reactions between the magnetic oxide material and the magnetic metal thin film to prevent formation of the pseudo-gap.</p>
    <p num="70">However, there is no teaching in these KOKAI Publications as to the problem which has been newly found by the present inventors and which occurs when the soft magnetic thin film of the aforementioned composition found by the present inventors is used in the composite magnetic head.</p>
    <p num="71">The composite magnetic head of the present Aspect includes a ferrite core having the opposing end faces and the recesses receded from said end faces, soft magnetic layers of the above mentioned composition provided between the opposing end faces of the core for defining the gap, and the diffusion preventive SiO2 layer provided at the interface between the ferrite core and the soft magnetic layer.</p>
    <p num="72">
      It is possible in this manner to prevent the formation and growth of the diffusion layer of deteriorated magnetic properties between the ferrite core and the soft magnetic layer of the above mentioned composition due to heating which inevitably occurs in the course of the preparation of the composite magnetic head of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the following, the description will be made on the case where the soft magnetic layer is an Fe--Zr--N soft magnetic layer having the above composition, but the same applies for the Fea Tb Nc system.
    </p>
    <p num="73">For example, the Fe--Zr--N soft magnetic layer of the above composition is formed in general by heat-treating a non-soft-magnetic Fe--Zr--N amorphous alloy film at, e.g., 550 (degree)  C. However, when the Fe--Zr--N amorphous alloy film is directly formed on the ferrite core surface and subjected to heat treatment, the Fe--Zr--N amorphous alloy film is changed into the Fe--Zr--N soft magnetic layer of the above composition, while a diffused layer with deteriorated magnetic properties is formed and caused to grow at the interface between the ferrite core and the Fe--Zr--N soft magnetic layer.</p>
    <p num="74">
      In contrast, when preparing the composite magnetic head of the present Aspect, the diffusion preventive SiO2 layers are provided at the interface of the Fe--Zr--N amorphous alloy film to prevent the formation of the diffusion layer with deteriorated magnetic properties.
      <br/>
      In producing a ferrite core composite magnetic head, a set of multilayerd composite magnetic head halves, in each of which a soft magnetic layer and a gap layer are sequentially formed on the opposing end faces and recesses receded from said end faces, are abutted to each other in a predetermined direction, and fused glass is filled and allowed to cool in the recesses of the ferrite core halves.
      <br/>
      However, when the Fe--Zr--N soft magnetic layers of the above composition are directly formed on the ferrite core halves to produce the composite magnetic head in accordance with the above mentioned method, the diffused layer with deteriorated magnetic properties is formed and allowed to grow at the interface between the ferrite core half and the Fe--Zr--N soft magnetic layer of the above composition.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      In the above mentioned method for preparing the inventive composite magnetic head of the 5th or 6th Aspect, distortion or strain of the multi-layered composite magnetic head halves may be relieved by heating.
      <br/>
      In preparing the composite magnetic head of the Sixth Aspect, since the diffusion preventive SiO2 layers are provided at the interface between the ferrite core halves of the multi-layered composite magnetic head and the Fe--Zr--N soft magnetic layers of the above composition, distortion or strain of the composite magnetic head halves may be relieved by heating without allowing the formation of the diffusion layer with deteriorated magnetic properties.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 23 and 24 exhibit the effect of the diffusion preventive SiO2 layer which will be discussed in detail later.

      <br/>
      It is seen from FIGS. 23(a), (b) and (c) that, when the Fe--Zr--N amorphous alloy thin film is directly formed and heated in situ on the ferrite substrate, a diffusion layer is formed on the substrate-thin film interface.
      <br/>
      Thus it is seen that oxygen O in the ferrite substrate is diffused by heating into the Fe--Zr--N soft magnetic thin film, that is, the thin film produced by heating the non-soft-magnetic Fe--Zr--N amorphous alloy thin film, and that the iron Fe in the Fe--Zr--N amorphous alloy thin film is diffused into the ferrite substrate to form an interdiffused layer on the interface between the ferrite substrate and the Fe--Zr--N soft magnetic thin film.

      <br/>
      Thus it is shown that, even upon heating, the oxygen O in the ferrite substrate is not diffused into the Fe--Zr--N soft magnetic thin film (i.e., the thin film formed by heating the non-soft-magnetic Fe--Zr--N amorphous alloy thin film), while the iron Fe in the Fe--Zr--N amorphous alloy thin film is not diffused into the ferrite substrate, so that the interdiffused layer is not produced at the interface between the ferrite substrate and the Fe--Zr--N soft magnetic thin film.

The "reverse" sputtering is a so-called sputter-cleaning process which is performed for removing contaminants, such as air or water vapor, adsorbed on the ferrite surface, or amorphous surface layers with poor magnetic properties formed on the ferrite surface during its grinding or polishing.

      Such sputter cleaning process results in a roughened ferrite surface to improve the bonding properties between the ferrite surface and the layers formed thereon.

    <heading>EXAMPLES</heading>
    <p num="138">A preparation example and properties of the soft magnetic thin film of the present invention, are first explained in detail.</p>
    <p num="139">Example 1</p>
    <p num="140">
      Alloy targets having a compositon of Fe100-y Zry, where y=5.0, 10.0 and 15.0 atomic percent, were prepared, and subjected to a radio frequency sputtering deposition under the conditions of the gas pressure of 0.6 Pa and applied power of 200 W, each in a nitrogen-containing argon gas atmosphere containing 2.5 to 12.5 mole percent of nitrogen to produce amorphous alloy films of various compositions.
      <br/>
      The resulting thin films were heat-treated in the magnetic field to produce soft magnetic thin films, and the saturation magnetic flux density Bs and the coercive force Hc thereof were measured using an A.C. BH tracer under an applied magnetic field of 25 Oe at a frequency of 50 Hz. (Magnetic field of 90 Oe was used with Hc&gt;25, hereinafter the same.) Crystallized glass substrates (PEG 3130C prepared by HOYA) and single crystal sapphire substrates were employed as the substrates (`r` plane, +1T02 plane}).
      <br/>
      The film thicknesses were set so as to be about 0.6  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      The results are shown in Table 1-A, wherein the coercive force Hc indicates the value as measured along the axis of easy magnetization.
      <br/>
      For certain soft magnetic thin films, magnetic permeability A at 5 MHz and magnetostriction were measured.
      <br/>
      The sign of magnetostriction was determined from the changes in BH characteristics when the stress is applied to the film.
      <br/>
      The results are also shown in Table 1-A.
    </p>
    <p num="142">On the other hand, shown in Table 1-B are measured results of the composition, saturation magnetic flux density Bs and the coercive force Hc of three heat-treated thin films (Samples C11, C12 and C13 of Comparative Example C1) obtained on a crystallized glass substrate in the same way as in Example 1 except using the sputtering atmosphere free of nitrogen.</p>
    <p num="143">The relation between the compositions of the soft magnetic thin films prepared by the method of Example 1 and the coercive force Hc and the results of determination of the sign of the magnetostriction, are shown in FIG. 2, for the case in which a crystallized glass substrate was used as the substrate and heat treatment was performed at 550 (degree)  C. The relation between the conditions of preparation of the soft magnetic thin film, i.e. the Fe content in the Fe--Zr alloy target and the N2 content in the sputtering gas, the coercive force Hc and saturation magnetostriction  LAMBDA s, is shown in FIG. 3, for the case in which a crystal glass substrate was used as the substrate and the heat treatment was carried out at 550 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="144">X-Ray Diffraction and Electrical Resistivity</p>
    <p num="145">
      For thin films not heat-treated, that is as deposited thin films, and for thin films heat-treated at 250 (degree) , 350 (degree) , 450 (degree)  or 550 (degree)  C., these thin films being among those prepared in accordance with above Example 1 so as to have the composition of Fe80.9 Zr6.5 N12.6, the results of the X-ray analyses and the results of the measurement of the electrical resistivity, are shown in FIG. 4 and Table 2, respectively.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 4, the crystal grain size of the thin film heat-treated at 550 (degree)  C. is found from the half value width to be approximately 13 nm (130  Angstrom ).
      <br/>
      It is also seen that the as deposited film and the thin film heat-treated at 250 (degree)  C. are amorphous, whereas the thin films heat-treated at 350 (degree)  C. and 450 (degree)  C. are formed by micro-crystallites and the thin film heat-treated at 550 (degree)  C. is formed by micro-crystallites which are further grown in the grain size.
      <br/>
      These micro-crystallites are thought to contribute to the soft magnetism of the thin films, while the formation of the micro-crystallites is thought to be ascribable to the presence of N and Zr.
      <br/>
      It is seen from Table 2 that, while the resistivity of the thin films is lowered with increase in the heat treatment temperature, the resistivity remains much higher than that of pure iron or permalloy and about equal to that of the Fe--Si alloy or Sendust.
      <br/>
      Thus, when used as the core of the magnetic head, the thin film conveniently exhibits lower eady current loss.
    </p>
    <p num="146">Vickers Hardness</p>
    <p num="147">The Vickers hardness Hv of the thin film having the composition of the Fe80.9 Zr6.5 N12.6 was found to be 1000 kgf/mm2 under a load of 10 g. This value is markedly higher than the value of 500 to 650 of the Sendust or Co base amorphous metal which has been hitherto used as the magnetic head material, so that the wear resistance can be increased markedly as compared with the conventional thin film.</p>
    <p num="148">BH Curve</p>
    <p num="149">FIG. 5 shows BH curves, as measured with an A.C. BH tracer, for several thin films prepared in the similar manner to the above Example 1 of the soft magnetic thin films.</p>
    <p num="150">
      The samples shown in FIG. 5 were heat-treated, after film formation, at 550 (degree)  C. for 60 minutes in a magnetic field of 1 kOe and an N2 atmosphere at 10 Torr.
      <br/>
      As may be seen from this figure, a definite in-plane uniaxial anisotropy is provided in the thin film by the heat treatment in the magnetic field.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the direction of the axis of difficult magnetization of the thin film samples is aligned with the direction of magnetization, the magnetic permeability at the frequency higher than 1 MHz may be sufficiently high, which renders the thin film samples particularly suitable as the magnetic head material.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, since the anisotropic magnetic field Hk is changed in the range of from 3 to 18 Oe with particular variation of the composition, the materials can be selected in accordance to the target value of magnetic permeability and the working frequency range.
      <br/>
      For example, when it is desired to obtain higher magnetic permeability at a frequency of 10 MHz or less, a composition which will give Hk=3 to 5 Oe can be employed, whereas, if it is desired not to lower the magnetic permeability at higher than 10 MHz, a composition which will give a higher value of Hk can be employed.
    </p>
    <p num="151">MH Curve</p>
    <p num="152">
      FIG. 6 shows the results of measurement by VSM of the MH curves of the thin films having the composition of Fe80.9 Zr6.5 N12.6, among the thin films obtained in the above Example 1.
      <br/>
      In this figure, the MH curve for the as-deposited thin film is shown at (a), whereas the curve for the thin film after heat treatment in the magnetic field at 550 (degree)  C. is shown at (b).
      <br/>
      It is noted that the correction for the demagnetizing field was not made and the film sample was 5 mm in diameter and 0.63  MU m in thickness.
      <br/>
      The coercive force, as measured with the VSM, was smaller by at least one digit place than the value measured by the A.C. BH tracer, and was determined from the curve (b) to be approximately 50 mOe.
      <br/>
      This value is approximately equal to that of the Sendust or Co base amorphous alloys, which demonstrates the superior soft magnetic properties of the film sample.
      <br/>
      The coercive force is also found from the curve (b) to be 4 PI Ms=14.5 KG, which is markedly higher as compared with the Sendust or Co base amorphous alloys, thus indicating that the film sample may be used advantageously as the magnetic head material for recording on a high coercive force recording medium.
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      The value of 4 PI Ms of the thin film before heat treatment is 13.0 KG, which is slightly smaller than the value after heat treatment.
      <br/>
      This thin film also exhibits vertical anisotropy (Hk about 400 Oe), a high coercive force Hc and poor soft magnetic properties.
    </p>
    <p num="154">Corrosion Resistance</p>
    <p num="155">
      The corrosion resistance of the thin film sample prepared in accordance with the above Example 1 so as to have to composition Fe80.9 Zr6.5 N12.6 was evaluated from the change in the surface state after the sample was dipped in city water for about one week.
      <br/>
      It was found that the surface state of the present sample was not changed and remained to be the mirror surface.
      <br/>
      For comparison, similar tests were conducted on the Co88.4 Nb8.0 Zr3.6 amorphous alloy films and Fe--Si alloy (magnetic steel plate).
      <br/>
      It was found that, while the Co--Nb--Zr alloy was also not changed in its surface state, the Fe--Si alloy was rusted on its overall surface.
      <br/>
      Thus it could be seen from above that the soft magnetic thin film employed as the soft magnetic thin film for the magnetic head of the present invention was also superior in corrosion resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="156">The following description refers to the soft magnetic thin film having a composition which is outside of that of the soft magnetic thin film of the present invention.</p>

      <br/>
      The BH curves, as measured with the A.C. BH tracer, for the above mentioned amorphous alloy film (as-deposited film), a film obtained after heat-treating the as-deposited film at 350 (degree)  C. and a film obtained after heat-treateing the as-deposited film at 550 (degree)  C., are shown at (a) to (c) in FIG. 7, respectively.
      <br/>
      The as-deposited film exhibits no soft magnetism, as shown at (a) in FIG. 7, whereas the film obtained after heat treatement of the as-deposited film at 550 (degree)  C. exhibits uniaxial anisotropy, as shown at (b) in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      However, the film obtained after heat treatment at 550 (degree)  C. is worsened in its properties, as shown at (c) in FIG. 7.
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      During the preparation of the magnetic head, bonding with fused glass, or so-called glass bonding, is frequently performed.
      <br/>
      This glass bonding is usually performed with heating to about 550 (degree)  C. The film sample having the above mentioned compositional range does not exhibit satisfactory soft magnetic properties, when applied to the ultimate magnetic head, on account of the heating at the time of glass bonding.
      <br/>
      That is, with the above mentioned compositional range, only thermally unstable soft magnetic thin films can be obtained.

    <p num="172">
      The amorphous thin film thus formed on the substrate was heat-treated in an isothermal magnetic field (1.1 kOe applied in the �0010� direction) at 250 (degree)  C., 350 (degree)  C., 450 (degree)  C., 500 (degree)  C. or 550 (degree)  C. for 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 180 minutes, 240 minutes, 540 minutes, 1140 minutes, 2400 minutes or 4800 minutes, to produce soft magnetic thin films.

      FIG. 15 shows (a) the relation between the heat treatment time t (min), the heat treatment temperature and the coercive force Hc, and (b) the relation between the heat treatment time t (min), the heat treatment temperature and the anisotropic magnetic field Hk.

    <p num="174">It is seen from these figures that different changes in the BH characteristics (curves) with the heat treatment temperature are observed in the temperature ranges of 350 to 500 (degree)  C., over 500 (degree)  C. and lower than 350 (degree)  C.</p>

    <p num="188">Using a target having a composition of Fe90 Zr10 (atomic percent), radio frequency sputtering deposition was performed in a nitrogen-containing atmosphere containing 5 mole percent of nitrogen under conditions of the gas pressure of 0.6 Pa and an applied power of 200 W, to form an Fe--Zr--N amorphous thin film on a sapphire substrate (`r` plane).</p>
    <p num="189">
      The temperature-depending changes of magnetization (normalized with respect to the magnetization at room temperature) of an amorphous thin film (about 0.6  MU m thick) formed on the substrate, were measured by a VSM.
      <br/>
      The results are shown in FIG. 17. Measurement was made under elevating the temperature at the rate of temperature increase of about 3 (degree)  C./min, starting from room temperature.
      <br/>
      Thus the samples B, D, E, G and F were maintained at 340 (degree)  C. for 120 minutes, at 450 (degree)  C. for 60 minutes, at 500 (degree)  C. for 60 minutes, at 520 (degree)  C. for 180 minutes and at 550 (degree)  C. for 120 minutes.
      <br/>
      Measurement was then made under lowering the temperature to room temperature at the rate of -3 (degree)  C./min. It is seen from FIG. 17 that the Curie temperature of the Fe--Zr--N amorphous as-deposited thin film before heat treatment is about 250 (degree)  C. and that, when the temperature is maintained at least at 340 (degree)  C., the value of magnetization increases and the Curie temperature also increases.
      <br/>
      It is seen that, when the temperature of 550 (degree)  C. is maintained for 120 minutes, the Curie temperature is raised to 700 (degree)  C. or higher and thus the Curie temperature 770 (degree)  C. of  ALPHA Fe is approached by heat treatment.
      <br/>
      The magnetization at room temperature is higher in any cases than that of the as-deposited amorphous thin film and substantially saturated when the temperature of 520 (degree)  C. to 550 (degree)  C. is maintained, amounting to 1.12 to 1.14 times the magnetization of the as-deposited amorphous thin film.
    </p>
    <p num="190">The following has become evident from the Examples 3 and 4.</p>
    <p num="191">(a) Before Heat Treatment (as-deposited)</p>
    <p num="192">
      The film is structurally amorphous.
      <br/>
      Soft magnetism is not achieved, and the Curie temperature is rather low as compared with  ALPHA Fe while the magnetic moment is markedly lower than the value after heat treatment.
      <br/>
      The magnetic moment is lower than that after heat treatment.
      <br/>
      These are the properties expected of the Fe base amorphous alloys.
      <br/>
      The N content is as high as 16.8% while N/Zr=2.3.
    </p>
    <p num="193">(b) Heat Treatment at 250 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="194">
      The BH characteristics are improved slightly as compared with those of the as-deposited film, with Hc amounting to 5 to 7 Oe.
      <br/>
      By prolonging the heat treatment, crystallization could be recognized by X-rays after 4800 minutes, and an uniaxial anisotropic film (Hc=1.4 Oe) was produced.
      <br/>
      The main peak position corresponds to the Fe3 Zr (440) peak.
      <br/>
      The N content after heat treatment is not changed from that of the as-deposited film.
    </p>
    <p num="195">(c) Heat Treatment at 350 (degree)  C. to 500 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="196">
      The main peak is at the intermediate between the  ALPHA Fe (110) peak and the Fe3 Zr (440), however, a broad rise is observed at near ZrN (200) demonstrating a complex state.
      <br/>
      As regards BH characteristics, the value of Hk tends to increase with increase in the product of heat treatment time * temperature under the conditions of Hc.+- 0 (slashed zero) 7 to 0.9 Oe and Hk=9 to 12 Oe.
      <br/>
      The Curie temperature varies continuously within this range, however, the magnetization at room temperature remains constant at 1.06 to 1.08 times that before heat treatment.
      <br/>
      The N content after heat treatment is slightly lowered at 500 (degree)  C. from the value before heat treatment, while the ratio N/Zr is in the range approximately equal to 2.
    </p>
    <p num="197">(d) Heat Treatment at 550 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="198">
      The main peak clearly corresponds to an  ALPHA Fe (110) peak and new peaks presumably ascribable to Fe3 Zr and ZrN are just appearing.
      <br/>
      It may be assumed from this that, after heat treatment at 550 (degree)  C., micro-crystalline  ALPHA Fe grains (order of 10 to 20 nm) oriented in the (110) direction and Fe3 Zr or ZrN micro-crystalline grains are precipitated after heat treatment at 550 (degree)  C. However, the Curie temperature is lower than 770 (degree)  C. which is the Curie temperature of  ALPHA Fe, presumably in association with the finer crystal grain size.
    </p>
    <p num="199">
      On prolonged heat treatment, Hc is lowered and reaches a local minimum after about 400 minutes, after which it is increased slightly.
      <br/>
      Hk is lowered with lapse of time and becomes substantially isotropic after about 250 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="200">
      The N content after heat treatment depends on the heat treatment time such that N/Zr is lowered to about 1.8 after heat treatment of 60 minutes and to about 1.1 after heat treatment of 1140 minutes.
      <br/>
      After heat treatment at 550 (degree)  C., part of nitrogen is presumably discharged out of the sample as the N2 gas.
    </p>
    <p num="201">When the Fe--Zr--N amorphous thin film is heat-treated in this manner, the produced soft magnetic thin films differ in structure and properties depending on the heat treatment temperature, in agreement with Table 2 showing the electrical resistivity of the Example 1.</p>
    <p num="202">The summary of the above analyses is shown diagrammatically in FIG. 18.</p>
    <p num="203">Example 5</p>
    <p num="204">
      Using an alloy target of the Fe90 Zr10 composition, radio frequency sputtering deposition was performed in a nitrogen-containing argon gas containing 6.0 mole percent nitrogen to form an Fe76.9 Zr7.3 N16.5 amorphous thin film and an Fe75.9 Zr7.3 N16.8 amorphous thin film on a sapphire substrate (`r` plane).
      <br/>
      The sputtering was performed at a total pressure of 0.15 Pa and an applied power of 1 kW, using a target of 6 inch in diameter, for preparing the former film, and at a total pressure of 0.6 Pa and an applied power of 400 W, using a target of 4 inch in diameter, for preparing the latter film.

    <p num="205">
      The Fe76.2 Zr7.3 N16.5 amorphous thin film formed on the substrate was heat-treated in a magnetic field at 550 (degree)  C. for 60 minutes to produce an Fe77.8 Zr7.6 N14.6 soft magnetic thin film having a film thickness of about 1  MU m. The Fe75.9 Zr7.3 N16.8 amorphous thin film formed on the substrate was heat-treated at 550 (degree)  C. in the magnetic field to produce a soft magnetic thin film.
      <br/>
      The composition of the soft magnetic thin film for the heat treatment time of 60 minutes and that for the heat treatment time of 1140 minutes were Fe79.2 Zr7.5 N13.3 and Fe83.2 Zr8.0 N8.8, respectively.

      The lower soft magnetic layer 11 is formed on the ferrite base plate 10 to a thickness of 10  MU m. The lower soft magnetic film 11 is formed by the aforementioned preparation example for soft magnetic thin films or by the similar method.
      <br/>
      After the non-magnetic insulating layer 12 of, e.g., SiO2 and the coil conductor layer 13 of, e.g., Cu or Al are formed at prescribed positions on the lower soft magnetic layer 11, the non-magnetic insulating layer 12, inclusive of the coil conductor layer 13, is etched to a substantially trapezoidal cross-section by ion milling or the similar method.
      <br/>
      The gap layer 14 is then formed and removed beyond a predetermined point towards the lower part of FIG. 10, not shown, at which the lower soft magnetic layer is to be directly combined with the upper magnetic layer 15, which is subsequently formed to a thickness of 10  MU m by the method similar to that for forming the lower magnetic layer 11 so as to be unified at the above mentioned predetermined point (not shown) with the lower soft magnetic layer 11.
    </p>
    <p num="259">The protective layer 16 is then formed on the upper soft magnetic layer 15.</p>
    <p num="260">
      The protective layer 16 thus formed is flattened and bonded to the protective plate 19 by means of a bonding glass layer 18 formed of a SiO2 --PbO--B2 O3 type glass.
      <br/>
      The head surface 20 directed to the recording medium is then flattened to complete the thin film magnetic head according to an embodiment of the present invention.

      A magnetic head core 33 is formed by alternately laminating soft magnetic layers 31 and insulating layers 32 of, e.g., SiO2, and is provided with opposing end faces 33a, 33a' and recesses 33b, 33b' set back from these opposing end faces on which end faces of the soft magnetic layers are exposed.
      <br/>
      Thus the major portion of the opposing surfaces are formed by the end faces of the soft magnetic layers.
      <br/>
      A gap layer G formed of SiO2 is formed between the opposing surfaces.
      <br/>
      The lateral sides of the magnetic head core 33 are connected to non-magnetic substrate portions 34-37.
      <br/>
      Glass-fill sections 38 are disposed (and filled with glass) between the non-magnetic substrate portions 34, 36 to enhance the bonding strength of the overall magnetic head.
    </p>
    <p num="264">The magnetic head of the present embodiment has the soft magnetic layer of a higher hardness as compared with the conventional magnetic head, so that, even with the above mentioned composite magnetic head, its surface facing the recording medium exhibits a higher wear resistance, i.e., higher durability.</p>
    <p num="265">As the soft magnetic layers, the three soft magnetic layers aforementioned in Example 12 are employed.</p>

      A ferrite core 1 is provided with opposing end faces 1a, 1a' and recesses 1b, 1b' set back from the opposing end faces, and is formed as a unitary structure by bonding at a predetermined position, not shown.
      <br/>
      The opposing end faces 1a, 1a' and the recesses 1b, 1b' receded from the opposing end faces are sequentially provided with diffusion preventive SiO2 layers 3a, 3a', each 5 nm (50  Angstrom ) thick, and soft magnetic layers 2, 2' having the composition specified by the present invention.
      <br/>
      Here, the diffusion preventive layers 3a, 3a' are very thin such that the soft magnetic layers 2, 2' form a part of the magnetic head core.
      <br/>
      The portions of the soft magnetic layers existing between the opposing end faces 1a, 1a' of the ferrite core 1 opposite to each other and an SiO2 gap G 200 nm (2000  Angstrom ) thick is formed between the opposing end faces of the soft magnetic layers.
      <br/>
      The portions of the soft magnetic layers provided at the opposing end faces (or additionally recesses of the ferrite core by the interposition of the SiO2 diffusion preventive layer are unified with glasses 5, 5'. M denotes a groove for winding a coil, not shown.

    <p num="270">A typical method for preparing the composite magnetic head shown in FIG. 22 will be hereinafter explained.</p>
    <p num="271">An SiO2 layer 3a, serving as the diffusion preventive layer, is formed by a vapor deposition method, such as sputtering, on the end faces 1a and the recesses 1b receded from the end faces 1a of the ferrite core halves, and soft magnetic layers 2 are formed on the surfaces of the SiO2 layers 3a by a method shown in the preparation example of the soft magnetic thin film or similar methods.</p>
    <p num="272">
      These soft magnetic layers 2 were formed by providing non-soft-magnetic amorphous alloy films on the ferrite core halves, by the interposition of SiO2 diffusion preventive layers 3a, and heat-treating the alloy films at about 550 (degree)  C. for one hour.
      <br/>
      No diffusion layers were formed between the ferrite core halves and the soft magnetic layer 2.
      <br/>
      Then, SiO2 layers each having a thickness about half that of the gap G were formed on the surfaces of the soft magnetic layers formed on the end faces la of the ferrite core halves by the interposition of the SiO2 layers 3a.
      <br/>
      In this manner, a multi-layered composite magnetic head half is provided consisting of the aforementioned three kinds of soft magnetic layers formed on the ferrite core half.
      <br/>
      A counterpart multilayered composite magnetic head half may also be produced in the similar manner.
    </p>
    <p num="273">The multilayered composite magnetic head halves are abutted in a predetermined direction and fused glasses are filled in the recesses of the head halves and cooled in situ to unify the head halves to produce the composite magnetic head.</p>
    <p num="274">Comparison of Periodic Fluctuation of Playback Characteristics</p>
    <p num="275">
      Similarly to the above described method for preparing the composite magnetic head of the present invention, a magnetic head having SiO2 diffusion preventive layers 5 nm (50  Angstrom ) in thickness, provided at an interface between the ferrite core and the Fe80.9 Zr6.5 N12.6 soft magnetic layers, was produced.
      <br/>
      FIG. 25 shows the frequency characteristics of playback (reproducing) signals of the composite magnetic head.
      <br/>
      It is seen from FIG. 25 that the fluctuations of the frequency characteristics (beat) of the playback signals are suppressed to 1 dB or less.
    </p>
    <p num="276">
      Another composite magnetic head was produced in the same way as the aforementioned preparation example except that no diffusion preventive layers are interposed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, an interdiffusion layer having deteriorated magnetic properties was formed at the interface between the ferrite core and the soft magnetic layer.
      <br/>
      FIG. 26 shows the frequency characteristics of the playback signals of the composite magnetic head.
      <br/>
      It is seen from FIG. 26 that the fluctuations of the frequency characteristics of the reproduced signals are as high as about 20 dB.

    <p num="277">In measuring the frequency characteristics of the playback signals of the composite magnetic heads, the relative speed was set to 6.7 m/s, and the recording medium coated with metal magnetic powders (trade name: FUJIX VIDEOFLOPPY HR) was used as the recording medium.</p>
