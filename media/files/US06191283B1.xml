    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      There has been an increasing interest in optically active  BETA -amino acids and peptides derived from them.
      <br/>
      Optically active  BETA -amino acids include a number of naturally occurring substances in the free form with an interesting pharmacological profile.
      <br/>
      Functionalized  BETA -amino acids are important segments of bioactive molecules.
      <br/>
      For example, Taxol (tm)  contains the phenylisoserine side chain as its key pharmacophore, and compounds of cyclic  BETA -amino acids make up the class of  BETA -lactam antibiotics.
      <br/>
      Additionally,  BETA -amino acids are components of peptidic natural products with a wide range of biological activity.
      <br/>
      Peptides consisting of  BETA -amino acids have promising pharmaceutical use as orally active drugs since they are hydrolytically stable.
      <br/>
      Given the significance of the  BETA -amino acids, development of new methodologies for their synthesis, especially for the stereoselective synthesis of chiral  BETA -amino acids, is important.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Among the strategies for the synthesis of racemic  BETA -amino acids is the conjugate addition of nitrogen nucleophiles to enoates.
      <br/>
      Other common approaches include diastereoselective additions in which the nitrogen nucleophile or the  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated substrate is chiral.
      <br/>
      Typical examples include the Michael type addition of optically active lithium amides to  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated esters, or additions of amines to chiral  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated esters.
      <br/>
      These approaches however, require the use of stoichiometric amounts of expensive optically active reagents which limits their utility.
      <br/>
      A single example of chiral Lewis acid catalysis in the conjugate addition of amines to enoates has been reported, however, this method proceeds with only low to moderate selectivity (highest ee of 42%).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The current methods for the synthesis of chiral  BETA -amino acids suffer from one or more of a number of disadvantages such as low yields, use of costly reagents, intricate purification steps or low enantiomeric excesses.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in view of the potential pharmaceutical utility of  BETA -amino acids and  BETA -peptides there is a continuing need for methods which would permit the efficient, large scale preparation  BETA -amino acids, especially in optically active form.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      The present invention provides a method for the preparation of  BETA -amino acid compounds through the conjugate addition of an amine nucleophile to an  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compound in the presence of a chiral Lewis acid complex.
      <br/>
      The chiral Lewis acid complex can be prepared from an azophilic metal salt and a chiral bisoxazolinylmethane ligand.
      <br/>
      The method provides a high yielding syntheses of  BETA -amino acids and related derivatives from readily available starting materials and is amenable to large scale synthesis.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the present method yields these  BETA -amino acid compounds in high enantiomeric excesses.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The method includes contacting the  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compound with an amine nucleophile in the presence of the chiral Lewis acid complex to form a chiral  BETA -aminoamide.
      <br/>
      The method is typically carried out at room temperature or below in an organic solvent using catalytic or stoichiometric amounts of the chiral Lewis acid with respect to the  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compound.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The high enantiomeric excesses of the present method are believed in part to be related to a selective amidolysis of the minor enantiomer produced.
      <br/>
      The unique catalytic nature of the present method is based at least in part on the fact that the  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compound substrate is a better Lewis base than the  BETA -amino acid compound product.
      <br/>
      Once a majority of the of the  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compound substrate is consumed, the minor enantiomer of the initially formed chiral  BETA -aminoamide undergoes a faster rate of amidolysis with residual amine nucleophile to form a second  BETA -aminoamide, thereby increasing the enantiomeric excess of the initially formed chiral  BETA -aminoamide product.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The present invention provides a method for the preparation of  BETA -amino acids from  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compounds.
      <br/>
      The method involves contacting the  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compound with an amine nucleophile in the presence of an organic solvent and a chiral Lewis acid complex.
      <br/>
      The method is typically carried out at about room temperature (roughly 25 (degree)  C.) or below.
      <br/>
      Temperatures of about -20 (degree)  C. to about -80 (degree)  C. are preferably employed in order to maintain a convenient reaction rate without substantially decreasing the yield or enantioselectivity.
      <br/>
      The reaction is typically carried out in an organic solvent which does not coordinate too strongly to the Lewis acid complex, e.g. a chlorinated organic solvent.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable chlorinated organic solvents are methylene chloride, chloroform, or dichloroethane.
      <br/>
      Examples of other suitable organic solvents include ethers, such as methyl tert-butyl ether, aromatics, such as toluene, or acetonitrile.
      <br/>
      Preferably the organic solvent has a freezing point no more than about -100 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The reaction time necessary to carry out the present invention will vary depending on temperature, amine nucleophile, and chiral Lewis acid complex utilized.
      <br/>
      Typical reaction times range from 1.5 to 72 hours.
      <br/>
      Shorter or longer reaction times may be achieved by altering the reaction conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="10">In order to initiate amidolysis of the minor enantiomer thereby increasing the enantiomeric excess of the desired product, the present method typically employs a molar ratio of the amine nucleophile to the  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compound of about 0.5:1 to about 1.2:1. Preferably, a slight molar excess of the amine nucleophile is employed, e.g., a molar ratio to the  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compound of about 1.0:1 to about 1.2:1.</p>
    <p num="11">
      The present method is typically carried out with the chiral Lewis acid complex in a ratio of about 0.1:1 to about 1:1 with the  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compound.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the chiral Lewis acid complex is in a molar ratio with the  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compound of about 0.25:1 to about 0.40:1. The chiral Lewis acid complex typically if formed from a mixture of bisoxazolinylmethane ligand and azophilic metal salt in a molar ratio of at least about 1:1.
      <br/>
      Preferably the molar ratio of ligand to metal salt used to form the chiral Lewis acid complex is about 1:1 to about 1.1:1.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The Lewis acid complex employed in the present method typically is formed from a chiral bisoxazolinylmethane compound and a salt of an azophilic metal cation.
      <br/>
      As used herein such "azophilic metal cations" refer to those metal cations capable of coordination with nitrogen atoms of a ligand.
      <br/>
      The azophilic metal cation is preferably not too strongly azophilic to avoid selectively coordinating with the amine nucleophile in preference to the bisoxazolinylmethane compound.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable azophilic metal cations include Zn2+, Mg2+, Sn2+, Sc3+, Y3+, and lanthanide cations.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the azophilic metal cation is Mg2+, Zn2+, Yb3+, Y3+, or Eu3+, with magnesium salts being particularly suitable.
      <br/>
      Included among suitable counterions are chlorine anion, bromine anion, iodine anion, and triflate anion.
      <br/>
      For economic and efficacy reasons, chloride and/or bromide counteranions are preferably used.
      <br/>
      Examples of particularly suitable azophilic metal salts include MgCl2 and MgBr2.
      <br/>
      Another group of particularly suitable azophilic metal salts include the triflate salts of Mg2+, Zn2+, Yb3+, Y3+, and Eu3+.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The chiral Lewis acid complex employed in the present method is typically formed from a salt of an azophilic metal cation and a bisoxazolinylmethane compound.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable bisoxazolinylmethane compounds include those substituted at any combination of the 4, 4', 5, and 5' positions to afford a chiral molecule.
      <br/>
      The substitution is typically such that symmetry of the molecule is maintained so as to avoid problems associated with more than one isomer of the resulting metal complex.
      <br/>
      Typical substituents include bulky alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or arylalkyl groups and are preferably located at the 4 and 4' positions.
      <br/>
      Other typical substituents include cycloalkyl, aryl or arylalkyl systems which individually bridge the 4, 5 and 4', 5' positions.
      <br/>
      Suitable bisxazolinylmethane ligands are represented by the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Typically, R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen, alkyl, arylalkyl, or R1 and R2 together are --(CH2)n --, where n=2-6.
      <br/>
      Preferably, R1 and R2 are identical and chosen from the group of hydrogen, lower alkyl (e.g., methyl), or benzyl.
      <br/>
      In another preferred embodiment of the present method, R1 and R2 together form a spiro alkyl ring group, such as a cyclopropyl group, which optionally may be substituted with one or more alkyl groups.
      <br/>
      The Z4, Z4', Z5, and Z5' groups are typically alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or arylalkyl groups.
      <br/>
      Preferably, Z4, Z4', Z5, and Z5' are iso-propyl, tert-butyl, benzyl, phenyl, or diphenylmethyl.
      <br/>
      In one particularly suitable embodiment of the invention, Z4, Z4', Z5, and Z5' form an indan groups with the oxazoline rings affording a ligand represented by the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)

    <p num="15">
      where R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen, alkyl, arylalkyl, or R1 and R2 together are --(CH2)n --, where n=2-6.
      <br/>
      Preferably, R1 and R2 are identical and are selected from hydrogen, lower alkyl (i.e. C1 -C6 alkyl), or benzyl.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, R1 and R2 together form a cyclopropyl group.
      <br/>
      X1 and X2 are preferably identical and are selected from hydrogen, akl, alkoxy, halo, haloalkyl, cyano, nitro, or CO2 R', wherein R' is alkyl, cycloalkyl, or arylalkyl.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The amine nucleophiles employed in the present invention are typically sterically bulky and preferably include substituents which are easily removed in a subsequent reaction to produce the free amine or amine salt.
      <br/>
      Amine nucleophiles typically employed in the present method are O-substituted amines or amines with bulky alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or arylalkyl substituents.
      <br/>
      The amine nucleophiles preferably are substituted with alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or arylalkyl groups having no more than about 20 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable amine nucteophiles include arylmethylarnines, N-arylmethythydroxylamines, O-arylmethylhydroxylamines, diarylmethylamines, or O-diarylmethylhydroxylamines, or N-diarylmethylhydroxylainines.
      <br/>
      Preferred amidne nucleophiles include benzylamine, N-benzylhydroxylamine, aminodiphenylmethane.
      <br/>
      One particularly suitable amine nucleophile is O-benzylhydroxylamine.
      <br/>
      Other examples of possible amine nucleophiles include secondary amines, such as morpholine, and aromatic amines having a protonated nitrogen atom (in an uncharged form), such as 3,5-dimethylpyrazole.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The present method employs  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compounds capable of coordinating with the chiral Lewis acid complex.
      <br/>
      The  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compound is generally selected to faciliate subsequent conversion of the product to a free carboxylic acid or carboxylic acid salt.
      <br/>
      The  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compound is typically an  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated carboxylic acid which has been protected with an amide producing acid derivatizing group.
      <br/>
      The result of such protection produces a species capable of coordinating to the Lewis acid complex.
      <br/>
      Typically, the amide producing acid derivatizing group provides a second coordination site capable of coordinating to the metal cation in addition to the acyl oxygen of the amide group.
      <br/>
      Included among suitable amide producing acid derivatizing group are:  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      where R6 and R8 are typically identical and chosen from the group hydrogen or C1 -C6 alkyl.
      <br/>
      R7 is typically hydrogen, alkyl, arylalkyl, or aryl, and R9 and R10 are generally independently chosen from hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or arylalkyl.
      <br/>
      Examples of preferred  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compounds include isoxazolidinone, 2-pyrrolidinone, and benzotriazole protected crotonates.
      <br/>
      A particularly suitable  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compound is 3,5-dimethyl pyrazole protected crotonate.
      <br/>
      The  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide compound may optionally be an  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide substituted or disubstituted at the  BETA -position by an aryl, alkyl, or cycloalkyl substituent.
      <br/>
      For example, the  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated amide may be a compound having the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      wherein P1 is an amide producing acid derivatizing group such as those described above, and R3, R4 and R5 are independently hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or arylalkyl.
      <br/>
      At least one of R3 and R4 is not hydrogen, and R3 and R4 are not the same.
      <br/>
      Typical substituents at the  BETA -position include lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, phenyl and phenylalkyl, optionally substituted with one or more common organic substituent groups.
      <br/>
      Preferably, R3 and R5 are hydrogen and R4 is an group having up to about 20 carbon atoms selected from alkyl, cycloalkyl, phenyl and phenylalkyl (e.g., benzyl or phenethyl).
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The present method is generally characterized by high enantiomeric excesses which may be enhanced by selective amidolysis of one enantiomer of the product of the nucleophilic addition, in the presence of a chiral Lewis acid complex.
      <br/>
      Typically, reaction times are extended so as to allow selective amidolysis of the initial product of the nucleophilic addition to produce a second  BETA -aminoamide.
      <br/>
      Included as typical products of selective amidolysis are those with the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      where R3, R4, and R5 are individually selected from the group hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or arylalkyl, and at least one of R3 and R4 is not hydrogen, A1 is --NHR16, --N(OH)R16, --N(OR16)H, and R16 is an alkyl, arylalkyl, or cycloalkyl group.
      <br/>
      In a typical embodiment of the method, the resulting product from the conjugate addition of O-benzylhydroxylamine to 3,5-dimethyl pyrazole protected crotonate, in the presence of a chiral Lewis acid complex proceeds through re face amine addition to an s-cis-substrate/Lewis acid/ligand complex with a tetrahedral or a cis octahedral arrangement.
      <br/>
      The catalytic nature of the addition shows that the substrate is a better Lewis base than the product.
      <br/>
      Once a majority of the starting material is consumed (.about.80%), the minor enantiomer undergoes faster amidolysis thereby increasing the enantiomeric excess of the desired product, as well as to reduce its chemical yield somewhat.
      <br/>
      This combination of efficient conjugate addition followed by selective destruction of the minor enantiomer disclosed in the present method provides for high enantiomeric excesses of the highly desirable  BETA -aminoamide compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The present invention also includes the selective amidolysis, in the presence of the chiral Lewis acid complex, of a  BETA -aminoamide to produce a second  BETA -aminoamide.

    <p num="26">
      The present method may also include cleaving the initially formed chiral  BETA -aminoamide to form a chiral  BETA NH2 -carboxamide.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished, for example, by reductive cleavage of the substituent of the  BETA -amino group to afford the free amine or salt thereof at the  BETA -position.
      <br/>
      If desired, this cleavage reaction may be carried out after hydrolysis of the initially formed  BETA -aminoamide to the corresponding  BETA -aminocarboxylic acid.
      <br/>
      Suitable  BETA -aminoamides and  BETA -aminocarboxylic acids include those whose amino groups have substituents which are readily cleaved under reductive conditions.
      <br/>
      For example, the substituent of  BETA -aminoamides and  BETA -amoniocarboxylic acids with a  BETA -amino group, such as an arylmethylamine, N-arylmethylhydroxylamine, O-arylmethyl-hydroxylamine, diarylmethylamine, O-diarylmethylhydroxylamine, or N-diarylmethyl-hydroxylamine, are readily cleaved under reductive conditions.
      <br/>
      Typical methods for such reductive cleavage involve the use of a source of hydrogen (e.g., gaseous hydrogen (H2) or in situ hydrogen sources such as cyclohexene, ammonium formate and the like) and a metal catalyst such as palladium or platinum.
      <br/>
      Suitable methods for such conversions are described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene, ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1981) and Protecting Groups, Koeienski, Thieme, Stuttgart (1994), the disclosure of which are incorporated herein by reference.
