      A water sport belt that includes an inflatable bladder that is be secured around the waist of a user to provide a flotation mechanism in an emergency.
      <br/>
      The inflatable bladder has a number of accordion fold sections that are inflated with an initial amount of air sufficient to provide buoyancy without the need for the user to blow with sufficient force to overcome the elastic walls of the bladder.
      <br/>
      The water sport belt also includes a water-tight compartment within which a user may safely position items to be kept safe and dry.
      <br/>
      A card holding structure is provided within the water-tight compartment to prevent damage to credit cards and the like by items such as coins and keys.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to water sport accessories and more particularly to a water sport belt that includes an accordion fold resilient bladder member, a snap-open bladder cover assembly, and a two-part fastener assembly; the two-part fastener assembly including a first fastener portion secured to a first bladder end and a first cover assembly end and a second fastener portion secured to a second bladder end and a second cover assembly end; the accordion fold resilient bladder member being constructed from a resilient air impermeable material to have a number of accordion folds to allow for easy inflation through a flexible inflation tube having a one-way air inlet valve provided therein such that air blown into the accordion fold resilient bladder member through the flexible inflation tube is trapped therein; the snap-open bladder cover assembly having a cover member back side secured to a bladder member backside of the accordion fold resilient bladder member and a forward portion securable over the accordion fold resilient bladder member with a number of securing assemblies; the snap-open bladder cover assembly including a water-tight sealable pocket having a rigid, open-topped card holding structure provided therein for holding credit cards, driver's licenses, etc, an attachment loop for attaching water proof pagers, telephones, etc., a sealable pocket having a fastener securable closing flap, and a faster securable inflation tube access flap provided therethrough that includes a grasping tab extending from a side edge thereof.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      People engaging in activities in and around the water often need a place to safely store items from theft and water damage.
      <br/>
      In addition, people engaged in activities in and around the water have a higher risk of injuries such as drowning.
      <br/>
      It would be a benefit, therefore, to have a water sport belt that included an inflatable bladder that could be secured around the waist of a user to provide a flotation mechanism in an emergency.
      <br/>
      Because it may be difficult for a person to inflate a resilient bladder such as a balloon while thrashing around in the water, it would be a benefit to have a water sport belt that included an inflatable bladder had a number of accordion fold sections that could be inflated with an initial amount of air sufficient to provide buoyancy without the need for the user to blow with sufficient force to overcome the elastic walls of the bladder.
      <br/>
      It would of course be a further benefit if the water sport belt included a water-tight compartment within which a user could safely position items to be kept safe and dry.
      <br/>
      Because credit cards, driver's licenses and the like can be damaged by items with sharp edges such as coins, keys and the like, it would be a further benefit if the water-tight compartment included a card holding structure therein for preventing such damage.
    </p>
    <heading>GENERAL SUMMARY DISCUSSION OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">It is thus an object of the invention to provide a water sport belt that includes an accordion fold resilient bladder member, a snap-open bladder cover assembly, and a two-part fastener assembly; the two-part fastener assembly including a first fastener portion secured to a first bladder end and a first cover assembly end and a second fastener portion secured to a second bladder end and a second cover assembly end; the accordion fold resilient bladder member being constructed from a resilient air impermeable material to have a number of accordion folds to allow for easy inflation through a flexible inflation tube having a one-way air inlet valve provided therein such that air blown into the accordion fold resilient bladder member through the flexible inflation tube is trapped therein; the snap-open bladder cover assembly having a cover member back side secured to a bladder member backside of the accordion fold resilient bladder member and a forward portion securable over the accordion fold resilient bladder member with a number of securing assemblies; the snap-open bladder cover assembly including a water-tight sealable pocket having a rigid, open-topped, card holding structure provided therein for holding credit cards, driver's licenses, etc, an attachment loop for attaching water proof pagers, telephones, etc., a sealable pocket having a fastener securable closing flap, and a faster securable inflation tube access flap provided therethrough that includes a grasping tab extending from a side edge thereof.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Accordingly, a water sport belt is provided.
      <br/>
      The water sport belt includes an accordion fold resilient bladder member, a snap-open bladder cover assembly, and a two-part fastener assembly; the two-part fastener assembly including a first fastener portion secured to a first bladder end and a first cover assembly end and a second fastener portion secured to a second bladder end and a second cover assembly end; the accordion fold resilient bladder member being constructed from a resilient air impermeable material to have a number of accordion folds to allow for easy inflation through a flexible inflation tube having a one-way air inlet valve provided therein such that air blown into the accordion fold resilient bladder member through the flexible inflation tube is trapped therein; the snap-open bladder cover assembly having a cover member back side secured to a bladder member backside of the accordion fold resilient bladder member and a forward portion securable over the accordion fold resilient bladder member with a number of securing assemblies; the snap-open bladder cover assembly including a water-tight sealable pocket having a rigid, open-topped, card holding structure provided therein for holding credit cards, driver's licenses, etc, an attachment loop for attaching water proof pagers, telephones, etc., a sealable pocket having a fastener securable closing flap, and a faster securable inflation tube access flap provided therethrough that includes a grasping tab extending from a side edge thereof.
