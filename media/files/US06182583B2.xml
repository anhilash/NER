    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Height adjustable work chairs are used in home, office, education, and industry.
      <br/>
      These height adjustable chairs typically include a seat that swivels in relation to the base of the chair.
      <br/>
      The height adjustment is typically obtained from a telescoping height adjustment mechanism which is usually a gas spring.
      <br/>
      This gas spring is a telescoping column that includes a gas cylinder which includes a pressurized gas such as nitrogen; a piston extending downwardly from the cylinder which supports the cylinder in an elevated position and includes an end which secures the gas spring to the chair base; and a valve located within the cylinder which allows the movement of gas within the cylinder.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The top of the cylinder is secured within the seat support mechanism which is the mechanism that supports the chair seat and chair back.
      <br/>
      The seat support mechanism is also known as the chair tilt mechanism, particularly on chairs with adjustable backrests or chairs having a tilting chair seat.
      <br/>
      Also included in the seat support mechanism is a lever that actuates the valve located in the gas spring.
      <br/>
      The valve typically includes a pin extending from the top of the cylinder which when depressed by the lever allows gas to move through the valve and lower the cylinder if a force exceeding gas pressure is applied on the spring or raise the cylinder if no force is applied on the spring.
      <br/>
      The gas spring may additionally include an air or oil damping mechanism which slows the rate of compression and extension for the gas spring.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The gas spring which is responsible for height adjustment in work chairs also allows the seat to swivel in relation to the base.
      <br/>
      The gas spring cylinder which is secured to the chair seat through the seat support mechanism rotates freely in relation to the piston which supports it.
      <br/>
      It is this rotation which provides the swivel in most work chairs.
      <br/>
      Additionally the end of the piston which is attached to the chair base may also include ball bearings or other means to allow the piston to rotate in relation to the base while remaining secured to the base.
      <br/>
      In this way, the gas spring which is a very inexpensive mechanism to manufacture provides both height adjustment and swivel movement of the chair seat in relation to the base.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The gas spring is supported in a vertical position between the chair base and the chair tilt mechanism by a vertical stand tube.
      <br/>
      The stand tube includes a top opening sized so that the cylinder of the gas spring can move vertically and rotationally in relation to the stand tube, yet remain supported by the stand tube regardless of the vertical or rotational position of the cylinder.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The stand tube is typically a metal cylinder which includes top and bottom ends.
      <br/>
      An opening on the top end which is sized to accommodate a gas spring cylinder which moves vertically in relation to the stand tube.
      <br/>
      In some instances a bushing may be disposed within the opening to minimize friction between the gas spring cylinder and the stand tube.
      <br/>
      The opening serves to both guide the gas spring cylinder as well as to vertically support the gas spring which extends between the chair seat support mechanism and the chair base.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The bottom end of the stand tube cylinder typically is tapered for insertion into the chair base.
      <br/>
      The tapered bottom end is typically pressed into a tapered socket at the hub or center of the chair base.
      <br/>
      The stand tube bottom may include an opening through which the piston of the gas spring can extend so as to be secured to the chair base.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the stand tube bottom end can include an appropriate structure for securing the gas spring piston.
      <br/>
      This structure also may include an opening in the stand tube bottom end.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      An alternative to the gas spring is a metal coil type spring which includes an oil damping mechanism.
      <br/>
      The application of a spring of this type is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,078,351. An alternative to the typical stand tube arrangement is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,433,409. The inventors of both of these alternative chair components believe that their components address structural deficiencies found in existing chair component assemblies.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      These structural deficiencies are most often derived from the use of a gas spring as both the structural support for the chair as well as the mechanism which provides vertical adjustability to the chair.
      <br/>
      The dual purpose of the gas spring, as well as the manner that the gas spring is supported, and the manner that the gas spring is attached to the chair seat support mechanism and the chair base, may cause the gas spring or the supporting structure for the gas spring to fail.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Gas spring mechanisms are remarkably strong despite the light gauge metal used in their construction.
      <br/>
      The cylinder portion of the gas spring, which is typically constructed of light gauge metal, is a sealed assembly which includes an internally held compressed gas.
      <br/>
      The cylinder also comprises the structure which provides the attachment between the height adjustable chair pedestal and the chair seat.
      <br/>
      Typically, the cylinder of the gas spring is attached to the seat support or chair tilt mechanism within a tapered socket or a hole within the seat support or chair tilt mechanism.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, all of the weight on the chair seat must be transferred through the light gauge cylinder wall.
      <br/>
      The forces exerted on the cylinder may include high bending moments, if the weight of the chair user is not sitting on center of the chair seat, in addition to the compressive forces acting downward on the cylinder of the gas spring due to the users weight.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      These compressive and bending forces may result in considerable stresses exerted on the light gauge cylinder walls which can result in a catastrophic failure of the cylinder.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the concentration of stresses in each of the chair components results in shape distortions to occur in these components.
      <br/>
      These distortions result in play or looseness developing, particularly at the high stress attachment points of the components.
      <br/>
      Play is known to develop particularly early at the attachment location of the cylinder to the seat support or tilt mechanism.
      <br/>
      This play, once created, can further accentuate stress concentrations at specific locations on the cylinder wall which also can lead to a catastrophic failure of the cylinder wall.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Similar forces exist between the gas spring cylinder and the stand tube.
      <br/>
      As has been previously described, the stand tube supports the gas spring by providing a top opening through which the cylinder of the gas spring passes.
      <br/>
      The gas spring cylinder moves vertically, as well as rotationally in relation to this opening.
      <br/>
      The stand tube may include a bushing to reduce friction between the cylinder and the stand tube.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Forces exerted on the gas spring cylinder may be transferred to the stand tube at the opening location.
      <br/>
      As the opening must be made larger than the cylinder to permit both vertical and rotational movement of the cylinder, these forces may be transferred from a small segment of the thin wall of the cylinder to the stand tube along the short support surface provided by the opening.
      <br/>
      This concentration of forces can cause failure of the cylinder either by shearing the cylinder wall or by causing a small dent in the cylinder wall which could lead to the cylinder buckling at a later time.
      <br/>
      Forces that are not transferred to the stand tube are transferred first to the piston of the gas spring cylinder and then to the chair base.
      <br/>
      The forces on the piston can also cause the small diameter rod of the piston to buckle.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Other stand tubes include a honeycomb structure within the interior of the stand tube cylinder to prevent a concentration of forces on the gas spring cylinder at an opening.
      <br/>
      In this design, forces on the gas spring that are transferred to the stand tube are transferred over a large surface of the honeycomb structure within the stand tube interior.
      <br/>
      The honeycomb structure flexes in response to such forces assuring a large contact surface for force transfer and minimizing shear forces on the gas spring.
      <br/>
      The excessive flexure within this design results in a chair having a non-rigid pedestal having a great deal of play.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, chairs having this construction do not appear sturdy and durable to consumers.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the flexing of the gas spring allowed by the flexible honeycomb structure may also cause the gas spring to eventually fail.
      <br/>
      It is also likely that this excessive flexing of gas springs may contribute to gas leakage from the gas spring.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Additionally, the forces resulting from pressurized gas within the cylinder are increased by forces on the chair seat which also are transferred through the gas spring.
      <br/>
      Gas losses through the cylinder seals are affected by the forces exerted on the gas spring.
      <br/>
      Should forces be applied to the gas spring which are either too high for the gas spring or are applied at an excessive rate, the gas spring seals can also fail, resulting in the immediate loss of gas pressure and a sudden complete compression of the gas spring.
      <br/>
      Such a failure could also result from normal use of the chair over a long period of time.
      <br/>
      Gas losses resulting from a progressive loss of the high pressure gas are evident in all gas springs and are most pronounced in those having the highest initial gas pressures.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Other areas where failures can occur are at the chair base hub socket where the stand tube is attached to the chair base.
      <br/>
      This area is particularly prone to failure in chairs having a one piece molded base that includes a center hub having a tapered socket for receiving the tapered bottom end of the stand tube, and a plurality (typically 5) of spokes which radiate from the hub.
      <br/>
      The molded plastic hub socket wall supports the rigid metal stand tube in a vertical position.
      <br/>
      Forces transmitted through the stand tube are transferred to the hub at this location.
      <br/>
      The high strength, and highly rigid steel stand tube may first become loosely held within the plastic chair base hub socket due to normal use of the chair.
      <br/>
      The socket wall also may be prone to breakage due to material fatigue stresses, or as a result of the uneven application of forces on the socket, which result from play within this joint.
      <br/>
      All metal chair bases are also prone to developing play in this joint, but are understandably less likely to fail.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      All of the described modes for height adjustable chair pedestals may result in injuries to the chair user as well as property damage.
      <br/>
      Obviously, a catastrophic failure of a chair may cause the person on the chair to fall from the chair without any warning.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      All of the previously mentioned problems with height adjustable pedestals used in office type chairs have prevented the widespread use of similar height adjustable pedestals in tables.
      <br/>
      Off center forces exerted on a table top close to the perimeter of the table top are a considerable distance from the center pedestal supporting the table top.
      <br/>
      Such forces obviously result in high bending moments on a small diameter gas spring cylinder which is incorporated into the pedestal for supporting a vertically adjustable table top.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Due to the current limitations of gas spring height adjustment in table constructions, height adjustable table manufacturers have typically used either hydraulics or electric motors to provide vertical adjustability.
      <br/>
      Such mechanisms, which have been in use for decades, are typically very durable and do not have failure modes consistent with gas spring height adjustment.
      <br/>
      These mechanisms, however, are not in widespread use because of their considerable expense.
      <br/>
      Tables that incorporate these devices are, or course, very expensive which limits the use of height adjustable tables in residential, office, educational, and industrial environments.
    </p>
    <p num="20">For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for a height adjustable pedestal for use with chairs and tables commonly used in homes, offices, schools, and industry which provide the benefits of height adjustment at an economical price and are not subject to dangerous catastrophic failures.</p>
    <p num="21">In particular, there is a need for a height adjustable pedestal that allows forces to be transferred from the chair seat or table top to the floor which will not cause excessive concentrations or stresses within the elements of the height adjustable pedestal which can lead to catastrophic failure of these elements.</p>
    <p num="22">
      There is a need for a height adjustable pedestal for chairs and tables that are able to be assembled from currently available low cost components, such as gas springs, yet overcome the deficiencies of these components.
      <br/>
      There is a further need that existing low cost assembly practices can be used in the chairs and tables using these height adjustable pedestals.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      There is also a need for a height adjustable pedestal that is constructed to minimize wear in the components of the pedestal assembly.
      <br/>
      By minimizing wear, such chairs and tables would not develop excessive play within the structural joints connecting components of the pedestal assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="24">There is a need for a height adjustable pedestal that is low cost, low in weight, high in strength and durability, and high in aesthetics which will provide greater widespread use of height adjustment in both tables and chairs.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="25">The height adjustable pedestal of the present invention satisfies the previous mentioned needs for a height adjustable pedestal for chairs and tables that utilizes inexpensive gas springs for height adjustment which is high in strength and durability.</p>
    <p num="26">
      The height adjustable pedestal of the present invention comprises a base, and a height adjustment column disposed above the base and supported thereon.
      <br/>
      The height adjustment column comprises at least two spring actuated telescoping height adjustment mechanisms.
      <br/>
      The height adjustable pedestal further includes means to actuate the telescoping height adjustment mechanisms.
      <br/>
      The height adjustment column typically additionally includes at least two stand tubes each having a first and a second end.
      <br/>
      The first end includes an opening or hole through which a telescoping height adjustment mechanism passes.
      <br/>
      The second end of each stand tube is disposed proximate to the base.
      <br/>
      At least one support disposed vertically above or below the base of the pedestal for securing the stand tubes together may also be included.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Telescoping height adjustment mechanisms used in the pedestal are typically gas springs.
      <br/>
      Such gas springs comprise: a cylinder, a piston disposed within the cylinder and extending downwardly therefrom to a secured position on the chair base from where it supports the gas spring, a gas flow control valve disposed within the cylinder; and pressurized gas disposed within the cylinder.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Supports for securing the stand tubes together may comprise a platform.
      <br/>
      Such platforms may include attachment means to attach the platform to the base.
      <br/>
      Each of the stand tubes in this version extend vertically from the platform and is supported therefrom.
      <br/>
      Supports for securing the stand tubes together may also comprise at least one attachment bracket.
      <br/>
      Such attachment brackets are typically vertically separated from the base.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Typically at least one telescoping height adjustment mechanism comprises a lockable gas spring which includes a gas flow control valve extension that extends from the gas flow control valve within the gas spring cylinder.
      <br/>
      The means to actuate the height adjustment mechanisms actuates the valve of each lockable gas spring mechanisms by engaging the gas flow control valve extension of each respective lockable gas spring mechanism.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The means to actuate the height adjustment mechanisms typically comprises a lever that toggles between a first position wherein the gas flow control valve of each lockable telescoping height adjustment mechanism is not actuated and a second position wherein the gas flow control valve of each lockable telescoping height adjustment mechanism is actuated.
      <br/>
      The lever in the second position actuates the gas flow control valve to allow gas to move through the gas flow control valve which selectively lowers the cylinder if a force exceeding the gas pressure is applied on the gas spring or raises the cylinder if a force less than the gas pressure is applied on the gas spring.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The height adjustable pedestal of the present invention may additionally comprise a seat support mechanism, or a table top support mechanism.
      <br/>
      These mechanisms typically include receiving means for receiving each telescoping height adjustment mechanism.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the mechanisms typically support the means to actuate the telescoping height adjustment mechanisms.
      <br/>
      The table top or chair seat support mechanism may additionally include a controlled swivel mechanism.
    </p>
    <p num="32">The height adjustable pedestal of the present invention provides benefits which are currently unavailable to users of height adjustable chairs and tables.</p>
    <p num="33">
      The invention utilizes many existing low cost chair components which have been assembled by known low cost assembly techniques, into a new height adjustable pedestal which provides safety related benefits not currently available.
      <br/>
      The structural features of the height adjustable pedestal which provide these safety related benefits ensure that individual components of the chair or table pedestal will not fail catastrophically which can result in both injury to the user as well as to property damage.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Additionally, the structural features of the height adjustable pedestal which provide these safety related benefits also provide benefits that enhance the overall quality of construction of chairs and tables.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, chairs and tables incorporating the height adjustable pedestal of the present invention into their design are of a sturdy, high quality construction, that is typically only available at prohibitively high costs in the marketplace.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The height adjustable pedestal of the present invention uses at least two spring actuated telescoping height adjustment mechanisms, which are typically gas springs.
      <br/>
      Each gas spring is typically supported within a single stand tube or multiple gas springs may be supported in a single stand tube.
      <br/>
      The plural gas spring construction results in the even distribution of loads throughout the individual gas springs.
      <br/>
      This distribution of forces results in a decrease in the concentration of stresses within the gas springs, particularly at the points where the cylinders of the gas springs attach to a seat or table top support mechanism.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the concentration of stresses where the gas spring cylinders contact the stand tubes are minimized in the height adjustable pedestal of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As earlier described, stress concentrations within the thin wall of the gas spring cylinder are common at these areas in existing height adjustable pedestals.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The distribution of loads throughout two or more gas springs in the present invention ensures that bending moments due to loads applied away from the chair seat or table top center will be lower.
      <br/>
      The resultant stress concentrations due to these bending moments are, of course, also correspondingly decreased.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the use of two or more gas spring assemblies ensures that each of the individual gas springs will be securely held in the vertical position so that stress concentrations due to distortion are also minimized.
      <br/>
      Reducing stress concentrations also decreases the likelihood of gas spring seal failure.
      <br/>
      The distribution of loads throughout two or more gas springs in the present invention also ensures that looseness or play will not develop at the joints within the pedestal where gas springs are attached to the chair seat support or table top support.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Stress concentrations that may cause the gas spring piston or the chair base to fail are also unlikely in the pedestal of the present invention.
      <br/>
      These are both highly stressed areas in current chair designs.
      <br/>
      The present invention is constructed so that high stresses will not concentrate in these areas, as forces will be evenly distributed throughout more than one telescoping gas spring and if necessary more than one chair base socket.
      <br/>
      In the single socket base versions of the present invention, forces will be transferred vertically through the pedestal.
      <br/>
      This ensures that uneven loads which could result in failure of the chair base socket are diminished.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Here again, looseness or play is much less likely to develop between the stand tubes and chair base socket as uneven loading on this area is less likely.
      <br/>
      Play in this area, as well as at the attachment point of the gas spring cylinders to the seat support or table top mechanisms, causes chairs and tables to be much less stable.
      <br/>
      This play is significant in many current chair and table assemblies.
      <br/>
      Chairs and tables constructed with the height adjustable pedestal of the present invention will be easily identified as having a sturdier, higher quality construction due to this absence of play.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Additionally, as the pedestal incorporates the use of more than one gas spring, each gas spring will have a corresponding decrease in internal gas pressure.
      <br/>
      The lower initial gas pressure of each gas spring results in lower gas pressure losses in each gas spring.
      <br/>
      These progressive gas pressure losses are evident in all gas springs but are significantly higher in high pressure gas springs.
    </p>
    <p num="40">In short, the height adjustable pedestal of the present invention provides a low cost means to ensure that safe, sturdy chairs and tables can be used in homes, offices, schools and industry.</p>
    <p num="41">
      These and other advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon inspection of the accompanying specification, claims, and drawings.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="42">
      Briefly, FIG. 1 shows an exploded view of a height adjustable table 1 which includes a table top 80, shown in dotted lines, which is supported by a first version of the height adjustable pedestal of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The height adjustable pedestal includes a height adjustment column which comprises a single stand tube 18 which supports three gas springs 40, 44, and 46.
      <br/>
      The height adjustable pedestal further includes a base 10 and a table top support 60.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      In greater detail, FIG. 1 shows an exploded view of a height adjustable table 1 that includes a base 10 which has five spokes 14 which radiate from a center hub.
      <br/>
      The center hub includes a socket 12.
      <br/>
      A single large diameter stand tube 18 which supports three telescoping height adjustment mechanisms comprising gas springs 40, 44, and 46 is supported by the base 10.
      <br/>
      The stand tube 18 includes a first or top end 20 and a second or bottom end 22.
      <br/>
      The second end 22 includes a tapered plug 24 which is inserted into the socket 12 of the base during assembly to secure the stand tube 18 to the base 10.
      <br/>
      The first end 20 includes openings 26, 28, and 30 through which cylinder portions of gas springs 40, 44, and 46 pass.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The stand tube 18 may be a hollow rigid tube having end plates attached at each end.
      <br/>
      In this version, openings 26, 28, and 30 first allow the insertion of gas springs into the hollow stand tube.
      <br/>
      The openings additionally serve to support the cylinder portions of gas springs 40, 44, and 46 as well as to guide the gas spring cylinders as the gas spring cylinders move vertically in relation to the stand tube.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In another version, the stand tube may include an internal structure, such as honeycomb (not shown), that is disposed in the tube between the end plates.
      <br/>
      In this version gas spring passages are created within the internal structure.
      <br/>
      The openings 26, 28, and 30 allow the insertion of gas springs into the passages during assembly.
      <br/>
      However the passages serve to both support and guide the cylinder portions of guide springs 40, 44, and 46.
      <br/>
      In this way, gas springs are supported over a large surface provided by an internal passage which may be beneficial to gas spring structural integrity when compared to the hollow stand tube structure.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In either of these two versions the stand tube can be integral with the base.
      <br/>
      A single stand tube and base arrangement for supporting a single gas spring of this type is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,433,409 which is incorporated herein by this reference.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The height adjustable pedestal additionally includes a table top support 60.
      <br/>
      The table top support 60, as shown in this figure, is a channel which serves to attach the gas springs of the height adjustment column to the table top 80.
      <br/>
      The table top support 60 includes openings 62, 64 and 66 which allow the tapered ends of gas spring cylinders 40, 44, and 46 to be secured during assembly.
      <br/>
      The table top support additionally includes flanges extending from the C shaped channel of the table top support to allow the table top support to be attached to a table top bottom.
      <br/>
      Many configurations, other than the C-shaped channel, could be used for the table top support.
      <br/>
      The table top support could also include a tilt mechanism if desired.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The table top support 60 could also use socket type receivers for gas springs which are well known in the art and are often essential in single gas spring pedestals to minimize stress concentrations on the thin walls of the gas spring cylinders.
      <br/>
      The present invention, which minimizes these stress concentrations by using more than one gas spring, will typically not require the extra manufacturing expense of socket type receivers for most applications.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Supported by the table top support 60 is height adjustment lever 68.
      <br/>
      Lever 68 toggles between two positions; one which engages gas valve extension 42 of the lockable gas spring 40, and one which does not.
      <br/>
      Valve extension 42 of gas spring 40 is actuated (or unlocked) by being pushed, pulled, or twisted depending on the manufacture of the device.
      <br/>
      Once actuated, the table height is able to be adjusted.
      <br/>
      Should the downward force on the table top exceed the cumulative spring pressure when the valve is actuated, the table will lower.
      <br/>
      If the downward pressure on the table top is less than the cumulative spring pressure, the table will rise.
      <br/>
      Once the desired height is achieved, the height adjustment lever 68 is disengaged which locks the lockable gas spring 40 in that vertical position.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Both locking and non-locking gas springs include a gas spring cylinder within which compressed gas is maintained.
      <br/>
      Extending downwardly from the cylinder is a piston which is typically a small diameter rod.
      <br/>
      The distal end of the piston is attached to either the stand tube bottom (as is the case in this version) or to that which supports the stand tube, typically the chair base.
      <br/>
      The downwardly extending piston supports the cylinder in an elevated height adjustable position.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Lockable gas springs also include a valve which typically includes a valve extension extending from the distal end of the gas spring cylinder.
      <br/>
      This valve extension position is shown at 42 on gas spring 40.
      <br/>
      When actuated, the valve is unlocked so that vertical movement of the cylinder in relation to the piston is possible.
      <br/>
      The forces on the gas spring cylinder determine if the cylinder compresses onto the piston or extends therefrom.
      <br/>
      The gas spring locking mechanism may include an oil chamber through which the piston must move, or may be a valve that prohibits movement of compressed gas when the valve is shut but allows gas movement and subsequent cylinder movement when open.
      <br/>
      It is understood that locking gas springs serve to lock unlockable gas springs.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      An alternative to the gas spring is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,078,351. This reference shows a coil spring mechanism that operates similarly to a gas spring.
      <br/>
      Such coil springs could be used in place of gas springs in the present invention and accordingly, the contents of that patent are incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Gas springs having an extension that includes an integral valve actuation lever may also be used in the various versions of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The integral valve actuation levers of these gas springs work similarly to the operation of lever 68 previously described.
      <br/>
      The actuation lever in these gas springs is directly supported by the gas spring extension.
      <br/>
      Within the height adjustable pedestals of the present invention, the gas spring extension would be supported intermediate the top of the gas spring and the table top support or chair seat support, depending on the use of the pedestal.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the table top support or chair seat support would serve to indirectly support the lever, typically immediately beneath the table top support or chair seat support.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The base 10, stand tube 18, and gas springs 40, 44, and 46, along with the table top support 60 comprise a height adjustable pedestal for the table top 80.
      <br/>
      The table top support in this version further includes the means to actuate the height adjustment mechanism, lever 68,
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      FIG. 1(a) shows an alternative version of height actuation mechanism for the table.
      <br/>
      The height actuation mechanism in FIG 1(a) includes a guide sleeve 90a which is supported by the table top support 60a.
      <br/>
      Disposed within the guide sleeve 90a is a button 92a which is able to be moved vertically within the sleeve.
      <br/>
      The button is further disposed within opening 82a of table top 80a.
      <br/>
      In this version, the guide sleeve 90a and button 92a are centered above the gas springs.
      <br/>
      Depressing the button 92a will press down on the valve extension of any lockable gas springs used in the height adjustable pedestal for the table.
      <br/>
      This will actuate the internal valve within the lockable gas springs and allow the table top to move vertically.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      FIG. 2 shows a table 100 using a second version of the height adjustable pedestal of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In particular, the height adjustment column in this version comprises three stand tubes, a first stand tube 118 and two additional stand tubes 120 and 122 which are attached to stand tube 118 through attachment brackets 124 and 128.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The first stand tube 118 of the height adjustment column includes a bottom end which is secured within a socket 112 of the base 110 during assembly.
      <br/>
      Socket 112 may be tapered to receive a tapered end of the stand tube.
      <br/>
      Attached to the stand tube 118 are stand tubes 120 and 122 which are typically a similar construction to stand tubes 118.
      <br/>
      As was true of stand tube 18 in FIG. 1, stand tubes 118, 120, and 122 may be either hollow or include an internal structure such as honeycomb, both of which are well known in the art for single stand tubes that support a single gas spring.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Attachment brackets 124 and 128 are the means through which stand tube 118 supports stand tubes 120 and 122.
      <br/>
      Attachment bracket 124 includes stand tube holes 125, 126, and 127.
      <br/>
      Similarly, attachment bracket 128 includes stand tube holes 129, 130, and 131.
      <br/>
      The attachment brackets could be molded plastic members that serve to secure the stand tubes together or could be metal plates which would allow metal stand tubes to be welded together through the attachment brackets.
      <br/>
      A cover (not shown) could be included to the assembly which would extend from the attachment bracket 124 to attachment bracket 128 which could provide a desired cosmetic appearance for the height adjustable column.
      <br/>
      The cover could also provide additional structural support to the assembly if necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="59">The height adjustment column of FIG. 2 is disposed between a base 110 and a table top support 160 which are similar to that shown in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="60">
      FIG. 2 also shows the inclusion of a controlled swivel mechanism 190 which provides users of height adjustable table 100 the ability to make rotational adjustments, as well.
      <br/>
      A control mechanism serves to frictionally control the degree of swivel.
      <br/>
      Table swivel can be adjusted from free swivel to no swivel.
      <br/>
      The mechanism will be described in the description of FIG. 7.

    <p num="61">
      FIG. 2a shows a side view of the stand tube 118 in cross section supporting the gas spring cylinder 140.
      <br/>
      In particular, stand tube 118 is shown in a hollow configuration and includes an opening 129 through which the gas spring cylinder extends and within which the gas spring is supported by the stand tube 118.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2a further shows how a piston 141 extends from the bottom of the gas spring cylinder 140 and how the end of the piston can be secured to the bottom of the stand tube through a clip 143.
      <br/>
      Many other arrangements are possible for the attachment of the piston to the stand tube.
      <br/>
      The gas spring is shown in a locking version and also includes a valve (not shown) internal of the gas spring cylinder 140.
      <br/>
      A valve extension 142 is shown extending from the distal end of the gas spring cylinder opposite the piston.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Although the spring actuated telescoping height adjustment mechanism shown in FIG. 2a is identified as a gas spring, it is understood that springs other than pressurized gas could be used in the mechanism.
      <br/>
      As was previously mentioned, U.S. Pat. No. 5,078,351 shows how a metal coil spring can be used in telescoping height adjustment mechanisms.
      <br/>
      Other springs that may be used include elastomeric materials and microcellular foam materials, both of which are well known for suitability as a spring.
