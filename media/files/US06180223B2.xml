      A method for the densification of a porous structure comprises providing the structure with a body of material (13, 14) which includes a susceptor element foil (14) which is more susceptible to heating by electromagnetic radiation than the other material (13) of the body, exposing said porous structure to hydrocarbon gas and simultaneously applying an electromagnetic field to said porous structure whereby said susceptor element (14) at least in part causes heating of the porous structure to a temperature at which the gas infiltrating the porous structure deposits carbon within the porous structure.

    <heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
    <p num="1">This is the 35 USC 371 national phase of international application PCT/GB97/01683, filed on Jun. 20, 1997, which designated the United States of America.</p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a method for the densification of a porous structure, a porous structure for densification by the method of the invention and a densified structure, such as a friction element for an aircraft brake, formed by the method of the invention.</p>
    <p num="3">The invention relates generally but not exclusively to the infiltration and densification of a porous structure, such as a carbon fibre or ceramic structure, which may be shaped as a preform for a finished product or for use in providing a finished product.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      It is known that in the manufacture of a carbon--carbon composite product, such as a brake friction element, a porous preform body, which may have approximately the desired shape and dimensions of the finished product, may be densified by a method which involves chemical vapour infiltration and deposition.
      <br/>
      The carbon--carbon composite product so formed has many useful attributes, including high strength and frictional wear resistance, but the use of such structures is limited by high costs which arise because of the slowness of the manufacturing method.
      <br/>
      Similar considerations arise in relation to the manufacture and use of other, ceramic matrix composites.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Carbon--carbon composites often are manufactured by the isothermal, isobaric chemical vapour infiltration (CVI) procedure whereby a hydrocarbon gas is caused to diffuse into a porous carbon fibre preform body and deposit carbon.
      <br/>
      To obtain a high final density and a desired microstructure the diffusion and deposition process is performed in a high temperature environment at a low pressure and takes a considerable period of time, for example typically between 500 and 2000 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It is known that the rate of infiltration and deposition may be accelerated by a so-called thermal gradient technique.
      <br/>
      A temperature gradient is established within a preform and a front of deposition moves through the preform, starting at the hottest region and moving away progressively with increasing densification of the hottest region.
      <br/>
      The thermal gradient technique is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,348,774 (Golicki) which describes a method of achieving a thermal gradient by the electromagnetic heating of a graphite core provided as a close fit in the bore of a porous preform body of annular shape.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Although the thermal gradient technique can accelerate the rate of infiltration and deposition, it requires the use of special equipment and process control procedures the cost of which tends to offset savings from the reduction of processing time.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      Another prior art method and apparatus for densification of a porous body is described in EP 0 592 239 A2.
      <br/>
      In contrast to the use of a vapour for densification, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,348,774, the teaching of this publication relates to the use of a liquid for densification.
    </p>
    <p num="9">An object of the present invention is to provide an improved method for the densification of a porous structure, a porous structure for densification by the method of the invention and a densified structure formed by the method of the invention.</p>
    <p num="10">In accordance with one of its aspects the present invention provides a method for the densification of a porous structure comprising providing the structure with a body of a material which includes a susceptor element of an electrically conductive foil which is more susceptible to heating by electromagnetic radiation than the material of the body and which occupies less than 5% of the volume of the porous structure, exposing said porous structure to hydrocarbon gas and simultaneously applying an electromagnetic field to said porous structure whereby said susceptor element at least in part causes heating of the porous structure to a temperature at which the gas infiltrating the porous structure deposits carbon within the porous structure.</p>
    <p num="11">The present invention provides also a porous structure for densification by chemical vapour infiltration, said porous structure comprising a body which includes a susceptor element of an electrically conductive foil which is more susceptible to heating by electromagnetic radiation than the material of the body, said susceptor element being positioned and arranged whereby when exposed to an electromagnetic field at least in part it causes heating of the porous structure to a temperature at which the gas infiltrating the porous structure deposits carbon within the porous structure.</p>
    <p num="12">The susceptor element may be an element of good electrical conductivity, by which is meant a resistivity of less than 20 micro ohm m and greater than 0.02 micro ohm m. It may be of a material which remains in the composite porous structure following densification, or it may be a material which is removed, for example by heating and melting or evaporating, or by cutting and/or machining of the composite structure.</p>
    <p num="13">If the susceptor element is to remain in the composite structure following densification, preferably it and other materials of the structure are selected to be materials which do not degrade or react with one another.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Although the invention teaches that only a single susceptor element foil need be incorporated in the porous structure, it is envisaged that a plurality of said foil elements may be provided.
      <br/>
      The plurality may be arranged to lie co-planar and/or to lie in superimposed layers.
      <br/>
      Elements in successive layers may be directly superimposed, optionally with porous structure material therebetween, or lie offset relative to one another.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In the case of a porous structure of annular form it is taught by the present invention that the susceptor element foil may be annular and be incorporated in the porous structure such that the foil and porous structure are substantially concentric.
      <br/>
      The or at least one annular susceptor element foil may be positioned to lie substantially centrally between radially inner and outer extremities of the porous structure and/or substantially centrally between annular end faces of the porous structure.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The foil preferably has a thickness less than 1.0 mm, more preferably 0.5 mm or less.</p>
    <p num="17">It is further preferred that in the case of a porous structure formed from cloth layers, the ratio of the thickness of the foil to the thickness of each cloth layer is not greater than 2:1, preferably less than 1:1 and more preferably less than 0.5:1.</p>
    <p num="18">
      The susceptor element(s) may be arranged within the porous structure to provide a substantially uniform heating effect or the element(s) may be arranged in a non-uniform manner which results in a thermal gradient.
      <br/>
      By selecting the uniformity or otherwise of the heating effect there may be achieved a pre-selected uniformity or variation of rate of carbon deposition within the porous body.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In this specification the reference to a susceptor element of good electrical conductivity means an element of a material having a resistivity, expressed in units of micro ohm m, of less than 20, preferably less than 10, and more preferably less than 5.
      <br/>
      It is preferred also that a susceptor element of good conductivity shall have a resistivity greater than 0.02, preferably greater than 0.05 and more preferably more than 0.1 micro ohm m.
    </p>
    <p num="20">The resistivity of the susceptor element material preferably is less than, more preferably less than one half, that of the porous body material.</p>
    <p num="21">
      A susceptor element of good electrical conductivity may be of a kind which is uniformly heated when exposed to an electromagnetic field.
      <br/>
      Alternatively the element may be of a kind which attains a temperature gradient when exposed to an electromagnetic field, for example as a result of being of a non-uniform resistance.
    </p>

      The invention is advantageous for the manufacture of a product such as an aircraft carbon composite brake disc which is required to be especially strong at an edge region, such as a notched edge which can engage keyways for the transmission of braking torque.
      <br/>
      The invention provides an efficient route for achieving a high density in an edge region.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="35">
      An embodiment of the invention as applied to an aircraft brake disc is now described by way of example only, reference being made to the drawings, in which:
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a brake disc;
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a transverse section of part of a preform for the disc of FIG. 1, and
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 is a side view of a component layer of the preform of FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="36">
      An aircraft brake disc 10 as shown in FIG. 1 has an outer edge 11 provided with circumferentially spaced notches 12 for engaging with the internal splines of an aircraft wheel.
      <br/>
      The present invention teaches that in the example of this particular embodiment the edge region 11 is to be given a higher density than other parts of the disc by providing that in a preform for manufacture of the disc that region shall have a greater proportion of elements of good electrical conductivity than other parts of the disc.
      <br/>
      The higher density at the edge region 11 results in a higher strength which is needed for transmission of torque loads.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The preform for the disc 10 comprises layers of carbon fibre preform material 13 (see FIG. 2) of known kind and which conventionally has a low electrical conductivity.
      <br/>
      That material incorporates layers 14 of Sigrafoil, some layers 14a extending between inner and outer radial edges of the disc preform and alternating with other foil layers 14b which lie only at a radially outer edge.
      <br/>
      For the manufacture of a disc which is pre-formed with notches, or which has lower density regions for removal by machining to form notches, the foil layers have notched outer profiles as shown by FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Following electromagnetic heating of the foil during a carbon infiltration and densification process the resulting disc has greater strength in the notched drive regions, and that can be achieved without adversely affecting the desired physical properties of the disc friction surfaces.
      <br/>
      The use of the good electrically conductive material within the preform allows heat to be generated within the preform instead of being conducted to the preform.
      <br/>
      This results in a beneficial reduction of manufacturing time and cost.
    </p>
    <p num="39">In some applications it may be preferred to avoid a high densification at edge regions, in which case the susceptor material is positioned primarily at positions remote from the edges.</p>
    <p num="40">The invention has been illustrated in the context of a rotor disc but may be applied also to the manufacture of a stator disc.</p>
    <p num="41">The significant effect of the susceptor material provided within a preform for the purpose of generating heat is illustrated by the results of two test examples described below and conducted respectively on preforms without and with elements of good electrical conductivity.</p>
    <p num="42">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="43">A solid, non-apertured disc 50 mm in diameter and 25 mm thickness was laid up from non-woven fabric produced from oxidised acrylic fabric needle punched and carbonised by heating in an inert atmosphere at 1025 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="44">
      The preform was placed in a transparent silica tube with a flow of nitrogen gas and an induction coil placed around the tube.
      <br/>
      A generator operating at a frequency of 450 kHz passed a current around the coil and the preform was viewed with an optical pyrometer.
      <br/>
      After 5 minutes no temperature increase was measured.
    </p>
    <p num="45">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="46">
      A preform was produced as in Example 1 with an annulus of graphite foil at mid thickness.
      <br/>
      The annulus was 50 mm outside diameter and 25 mm inner diameter.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The preform was subjected to the induction coil as in Example 1 and the temperature at the edge of the graphite foil was measured at 1100 (degree)  C. in 1 minute.
      <br/>
      The remainder of the preform did not show any measurable temperature increase.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The invention allows for better control of deposition of carbon in addition to a faster deposition rate.
      <br/>
      Thus it is possible to achieve a better deposition density at the centre of a preform, and to avoid the low density problems experienced at the centre of thick preforms as seen with isothermal, isobaric carbon vapour impregnation.
    </p>
    <p num="49">The invention also allows substantial ease of flexibility in control of densification so as to achieve a desired thermal gradient deposition appropriate to a specific product requirement.</p>
