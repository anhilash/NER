      B-Cell malignancies, such as the B-cell subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, are significant contributors to cancer mortality.

      The response of B-cell malignancies to various forms of treatment is mixed.

      Traditional methods of treating B-cell malignancies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have limited utility due to toxic side effects.

      The use of antibodies that bind with the CD22 antigen, however, provides an effective means to treat B-cell malignancies such as indolent and aggressive forms of B-cell lymphomas, and acute and chronic forms of lymphatic leukemias.

      Moreover, immunotherapy with anti-CD22 antibodies requires comparatively low doses of antibody protein, and can be used effectively in multimodal therapies.

    <p num="5">
      B-Cell lymphomas, such as the B-cell subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, are significant contributors to cancer mortality.
      <br/>
      The response of B-cell malignancies to various forms of treatment is mixed.
      <br/>
      For example, in cases in which adequate clinical staging of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is possible, field radiation therapy can provide satisfactory treatment.
      <br/>
      Still, about one-half of the patients die from the disease.

      The natural history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia falls into several phases.
      <br/>
      In the early phase, chronic lymphocytic leukemia is an indolent disease, characterized by the accumulation of small mature functionally-incompetent malignant B-cells having a lengthened life span.
      <br/>
      Eventually, the doubling time of the malignant B-cells decreases and patients become increasingly symptomatic.
      <br/>
      While treatment can provide symptomatic relief, the overall survival of the patients is only minimally affected.
      <br/>
      The late stages of chronic lymphocytic leukemia are characterized by significant anemia and/or thrombocytopenia.
      <br/>
      At this point, the median survival is less than two years.

      Traditional methods of treating B-cell malignancies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have limited utility due to toxic side effects.
      <br/>
      The use of monoclonal antibodies to direct radionuclides, toxins, or other therapeutic agents offers the possibility that such agents can be delivered selectively to tumor sites, thus limiting toxicity to normal tissues.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Antibodies against the CD20 antigen have been investigated for the therapy of B-cell lymphomas.
      <br/>
      For example, a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, designated as "IDEC-C2B8," has activity against B-cell lymphomas when provided as unconjugated antibodies at repeated injections of doses exceeding 500 mg per injection.

      <br/>
      About 50 percent of non-Hodgkin's patients, having the low-grade indolent form, treated with this regimen showed responses.
      <br/>
      Therapeutic responses have also been obtained using 131 I-labeled B1 anti-CD-20 murine monoclonal antibody when provided as repeated doses exceeding 600 mg per injection.

      <br/>
      However, these antibodies, whether provided as unconjugated forms or radiolabeled forms, have not shown objective responses in patients with the more prevalent and lethal form of B-cell lymphoma, the intermediate or aggressive type.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Therefore, a need exists to develop an immunotherapy for B-cell malignancies that allows repeated administration of comparatively low doses of an antibody, and that is not limited by the necessity of adding a toxic agent for achieving a therapeutic response of significant duration.</p>

    <p num="10">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for treating B-cell malignancies using comparatively low doses of anti-CD22 antibodies.</p>
    <p num="11">It is a further object of this invention to provide multimodal methods for treatment of B-cell malignancies in which low doses of anti-CD22 antibodies are supplemented with the administration of a therapeutic protein, such as an immunoconjugate or antibody fusion protein, or by a chemotherapeutic regimen.</p>
    <p num="12">These and other objects are achieved, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, by the provision of a method of treating a B-cell malignancy, comprising the step of administering to a subject having a B-cell malignancy an anti-CD22 antibody and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      1.
      <br/>
      Overview
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      As discussed above, anti-CD20 antibodies, whether unconjugated or labeled with a therapeutic radionuclide, have failed to provide objective responses in patients with intermediate or aggressive forms of B-cell lymphoma.
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, clinical studies with patients having non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (both indolent and aggressive forms) or acute lymphatic leukemia have demonstrated that relatively low doses (i.e., 20-100 mg protein per dose) of unconjugated murine or humanized anti-CD22 antibody, designated as either "EPB-2" or "LL2," can induce partial or complete remissions lasting up to 24 months.
      <br/>
      This, despite the fact that such patients are often in relapse after multiple courses of aggressive chemotherapy, and even after bone marrow grafting.
      <br/>
      The positive results with unconjugated anti-CD22 antibody are particularly surprising in advanced patients with the aggressive (intermediate) form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and in chronic and acute lymphatic leukemia, since unconjugated or radiolabeled anti-CD20 antibodies have failed to show such effects, particularly at low protein doses.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the positive results with anti-CD22 antibodies are unexpected in view of the statement by Freedman, Hematol.
      <br/>
      Oncol. Clin. North Am. 4:405 (1990), that chronic lymphocytic leukemias of the B-cell type do not generally express CD22.
    </p>
    <p num="15">2. Definitions</p>
    <p num="16">
      In the description that follows, a number of terms are used extensively.
      <br/>
      The following definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="17">A structural gene is a DNA sequence that is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) which is then translated into a sequence of amino acids characteristic of a specific polypeptide.</p>
    <p num="18">
      A promoter is a DNA sequence that directs the transcription of a structural gene.
      <br/>
      Typically, a promoter is located in the 5' region of a gene, proximal to the transcriptional start site of a structural gene.
      <br/>
      If a promoter is an inducible promoter, then the rate of transcription increases in response to an inducing agent.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the rate of transcription is not regulated by an inducing agent if the promoter is a constitutive promoter.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      An isolated DNA molecule is a fragment of DNA that is not integrated in the genomic DNA of an organism.
      <br/>
      For example, a cloned antibody gene is a DNA fragment that has been separated from the genomic DNA of a mammalian cell.
      <br/>
      Another example of an isolated DNA molecule is a chemically-synthesized DNA molecule that is not integrated in the genomic DNA of an organism.
    </p>
    <p num="20">An enhancer is a DNA regulatory element that can increase the efficiency of transcription, regardless of the distance or orientation of the enhancer relative to the start site of transcription.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Complementary DNA (cDNA) is a single-stranded DNA molecule that is formed from an mRNA template by the enzyme reverse transcriptase.
      <br/>
      Typically, a primer complementary to portions of mRNA is employed for the initiation of reverse transcription.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art also use the term "cDNA" to refer to a double-stranded DNA molecule consisting of such a single-stranded DNA molecule and its complementary DNA strand.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The term expression refers to the biosynthesis of a gene product.
      <br/>
      For example, in the case of a structural gene, expression involves transcription of the structural gene into mRNA and the translation of mRNA into one or more polypeptides.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A cloning vector is a DNA molecule, such as a plasmid, cosmid, or bacteriophage, that has the capability of replicating autonomously in a host cell.
      <br/>
      Cloning vectors typically contain one or a small number of restriction endonuclease recognition sites at which foreign DNA sequences can be inserted in a determinable fashion without loss of an essential biological function of the vector, as well as a marker gene that is suitable for use in the identification and selection of cells transformed with the cloning vector.
      <br/>
      Marker genes typically include genes that provide tetracycline resistance or ampicillin resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      An expression vector is a DNA molecule comprising a gene that is expressed in a host cell.
      <br/>
      Typically, gene expression is placed under the control of certain regulatory elements, including constitutive or inducible promoters, tissue-specific regulatory elements, and enhancers.
      <br/>
      Such a gene is said to be "operably linked to" the regulatory elements.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      A recombinant host may be any prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell that contains either a cloning vector or expression vector.
      <br/>
      This term also includes those prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells that have been genetically engineered to contain the cloned gene(s) in the chromosome or genome of the host cell.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      An antibody fragment is a portion of an antibody such as F(ab')2, F(ab)2, Fab', Fab, and the like.
      <br/>
      Regardless of structure, an antibody fragment binds with the same antigen that is recognized by the intact antibody.
      <br/>
      For example, an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody fragment binds with an epitope of CD22.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The term "antibody fragment" also includes any synthetic or genetically engineered protein that acts like an antibody by binding to a specific antigen to form a complex.
      <br/>
      For example, antibody fragments include isolated fragments consisting of the light chain variable region, "Fv" fragments consisting of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains, recombinant single chain polypeptide molecules in which light and heavy variable regions are connected by a peptide linker ("sFv proteins"), and minimal recognition units consisting of the amino acid residues that mimic the hypervariable region.
    </p>
    <p num="28">A chimeric antibody is a recombinant protein that contains the variable domains and complementary determining regions derived from a rodent antibody, while the remainder of the antibody molecule is derived from a human antibody.</p>
    <p num="29">Humanized antibodies are recombinant proteins in which murine complementarity determining regions of a monoclonal antibody have been transferred from heavy and light variable chains of the murine immunoglobulin into a human variable domain.</p>
    <p num="30">

    <p num="36">
      Rodent monoclonal antibodies to CD22 can be obtained by methods known to those skilled in the art.

      See generally, for example, Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256:495 (1975), and Coligan et al. (eds.), CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN IMMUNOLOGY, VOL. 1, pages 2.5.1-2.6.7 (John Wiley &amp; Sons 1991) �"Coligan"�. Briefly, monoclonal antibodies can be obtained by injecting mice with a composition comprising CD22, verifying the presence of antibody production by removing a serum sample, removing the spleen to obtain B-lymphocytes, fusing the B-lymphocytes with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas, cloning the hybridomas, selecting positive clones which produce anti-CD22 antibodies, culturing the clones that produce antibodies to the antigen, and isolating the antibodies from the hybridoma cultures.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Monoclonal antibodies can be isolated and purified from hybridoma cultures by a variety of well-established techniques.
      <br/>
      Such isolation techniques include affinity chromatography with Protein-A Sepharose, size-exclusion chromatography, and ion-exchange chromatography.

      The present invention contemplates the use of fragments of anti-CD22 antibodies or other therapeutically useful antibodies.

      Antibody fragments can be prepared by proteolytic hydrolysis of an antibody or by expression in E. coli of the DNA coding for the fragment.

      Antibody fragments can be obtained by pepsin or papain digestion of whole antibodies by conventional methods.

    <p num="51">Other methods of cleaving antibodies, such as separation of heavy chains to form monovalent light-heavy chain fragments, further cleavage of fragments, or other enzymatic, chemical or genetic techniques may also be used, so long as the fragments bind to the antigen that is recognized by the intact antibody.</p>

      For example, Fv fragments comprise an association of VH and VL chains.

      This association can be noncovalent, as described in Inbar et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad.
      <br/>
      Sci. USA 69:2659 (1972).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the variable chains can be linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond or cross-linked by chemicals such as glutaraldehyde.

    <p num="53">
      Preferably, the Fv fragments comprise VH and VL chains which are connected by a peptide linker.

    <p num="55">5. Preparation of Immunoconjugates</p>
    <p num="56">
      The present invention contemplates the use of "naked" anti-CD22 antibodies, as well as the use of immunoconjugates to effect treatment of B-cell malignancies.
      <br/>
      Such immunoconjugates can be prepared by indirectly conjugating a therapeutic agent to an antibody component.
      <br/>
      General techniques are described in Shih et al., Int. J. Cancer 41:832-839 (1988); Shih et al., Int. J. Cancer 46:1101-1106 (1990); and Shih et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,057,313. The general method involves reacting an antibody component having an oxidized carbohydrate portion with a carrier polymer that has at least one free amine function and that is loaded with a plurality of drug, toxin, chelator, boron addends, or other therapeutic agent.
      <br/>
      This reaction results in an initial Schiff base (imine) linkage, which can be stabilized by reduction to a secondary amine to form the final conjugate.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The carrier polymer is preferably an aminodextran or polypeptide of at least 50 amino acid residues, although other substantially equivalent polymer carriers can also be used.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the final immunoconjugate is soluble in an aqueous solution, such as mammalian serum, for ease of administration and effective targeting for use in therapy.
      <br/>
      Thus, solubilizing functions on the carrier polymer will enhance the serum solubility of the final immunoconjugate.
      <br/>
      In particular, an aminodextran will be preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The process for preparing an immunoconjugate with an aminodextran carrier typically begins with a dextran polymer, advantageously a dextran of average molecular weight of about 10,000-100,000.
      <br/>
      The dextran is reacted with an oxidizing agent to effect a controlled oxidation of a portion of its carbohydrate rings to generate aldehyde groups.
      <br/>
      The oxidation is conveniently effected with glycolytic chemical reagents such as NaIO4, according to conventional procedures.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The oxidized dextran is then reacted with a polyamine, preferably a diamine, and more preferably, a mono- or polyhydroxy diamine.
      <br/>
      Suitable amines include ethylene diamine, propylene diamine, or other like polymethylene diamines, diethylene triamine or like polyamines, 1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane, or other like hydroxylated diamines or polyamines, and the like.
      <br/>
      An excess of the amine relative to the aldehyde groups of the dextran is used to insure substantially complete conversion of the aldehyde functions to Schiff base groups.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      A reducing agent, such as NaBH4, NaBH3 CN or the like, is used to effect reductive stabilization of the resultant Schiff base intermediate.
      <br/>
      The resultant adduct can be purified by passage through a conventional sizing column to remove cross-linked dextrans.
    </p>
    <p num="61">Other conventional methods of derivatizing a dextran to introduce amine functions can also be used, e.g., reaction with cyanogen bromide, followed by reaction with a diamine.</p>
    <p num="62">The aminodextran is then reacted with a derivative of the particular drug, toxin, chelator, immunomodulator, boron addend, or other therapeutic agent to be loaded, in an activated form, preferably, a carboxyl-activated derivative, prepared by conventional means, e.g., using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or a water soluble variant thereof, to form an intermediate adduct.</p>
    <p num="63">Alternatively, polypeptide toxins such as pokeweed antiviral protein or ricin A-chain, and the like, can be coupled to aminodextran by glutaraldehyde condensation or by reaction of activated carboxyl groups on the protein with amines on the aminodextran.</p>
    <p num="64">
      Chelators for radiometals or magnetic resonance enhancers are well-known in the art.
      <br/>
      Typical are derivatives of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA).
      <br/>
      These chelators typically have groups on the side chain by which the chelator can be attached to a carrier.
      <br/>
      Such groups include, e.g., benzylisothiocyanate, by which the DTPA or EDTA can be coupled to the amine group of a carrier.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, carboxyl groups or amine groups on a chelator can be coupled to a carrier by activation or prior derivatization and then coupling, all by well-known means.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Boron addends, such as carboranes, can be attached to antibody components by conventional methods.
      <br/>
      For example, carboranes can be prepared with carboxyl functions on pendant side chains, as is well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Attachment of such carboranes to a carrier, e.g., aminodextran, can be achieved by activation of the carboxyl groups of the carboranes and condensation with amines on the carrier to produce an intermediate conjugate.
      <br/>
      Such intermediate conjugates are then attached to antibody components to produce therapeutically useful immunoconjugates, as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      A polypeptide carrier can be used instead of aminodextran, but the polypeptide carrier must have at least 50 amino acid residues in the chain, preferably 100-5000 amino acid residues.
      <br/>
      At least some of the amino acids should be lysine residues or glutamate or aspartate residues.
      <br/>
      The pendant amines of lysine residues and pendant carboxylates of glutamine and aspartate are convenient for attaching a drug, toxin, immunomodulator, chelator, boron addend or other therapeutic agent.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable polypeptide carriers include polylysine, polyglutamic acid, polyaspartic acid, copolymers thereof, and mixed polymers of these amino acids and others, e.g., serines, to confer desirable solubility properties on the resultant loaded carrier and immunoconjugate.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      Conjugation of the intermediate conjugate with the antibody component is effected by oxidizing the carbohydrate portion of the antibody component and reacting the resulting aldehyde (and ketone) carbonyls with amine groups remaining on the carrier after loading with a drug, toxin, chelator, immunomodulator, boron addend, or other therapeutic agent.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, an intermediate conjugate can be attached to an oxidized antibody component via amine groups that have been introduced in the intermediate conjugate after loading with the therapeutic agent.
      <br/>
      Oxidation is conveniently effected either chemically, e.g., with NaIO4 or other glycolytic reagent, or enzymatically, e.g., with neuraminidase and galactose oxidase.
      <br/>
      In the case of an aminodextran carrier, not all of the amines of the aminodextran are typically used for loading a therapeutic agent.
      <br/>
      The remaining amines of aminodextran condense with the oxidized antibody component to form Schiff base adducts, which are then reductively stabilized, normally with a borohydride reducing agent.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Analogous procedures are used to produce other immunoconjugates according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Loaded polypeptide carriers preferably have free lysine residues remaining for condensation with the oxidized carbohydrate portion of an antibody component.
      <br/>
      Carboxyls on the polypeptide carrier can, if necessary, be converted to amines by, e.g., activation with DCC and reaction with an excess of a diamine.
    </p>
    <p num="69">The final immunoconjugate is purified using conventional techniques, such as sizing chromatography on Sephacryl S-300.</p>
    <p num="70">
      Alternatively, immunoconjugates can be prepared by directly conjugating an antibody component with a therapeutic agent.
      <br/>
      The general procedure is analogous to the indirect method of conjugation except that a therapeutic agent is directly attached to an oxidized antibody component.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      It will be appreciated that other therapeutic agents can be substituted for the chelators described herein.
      <br/>
      Those of skill in the art will be able to devise conjugation schemes without undue experimentation.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      As a further illustration, a therapeutic agent can be attached at the hinge region of a reduced antibody component via disulfide bond formation.
      <br/>
      For example, the tetanus toxoid peptides can be constructed with a single cysteine residue that is used to attach the peptide to an antibody component.
      <br/>
      As an alternative, such peptides can be attached to the antibody component using a heterobifunctional cross-linker, such as N-succinyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)proprionate (SPDP).
      <br/>
      Yu et al., Int. J. Cancer 56:244 (1994).
      <br/>
      General techniques for such conjugation are well-known in the art.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Wong, CHEMISTRY OF PROTEIN CONJUGATION AND CROSS-LINKING (CRC Press 1991); Upeslacis et al., "Modification of Antibodies by Chemical Methods," in MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES: PRINCIPLES AND APPLICATIONS, Birch et al. (eds.), pages 187-230 (Wiley-Liss, Inc. 1995); Price, "Production and Characterization of Synthetic Peptide-Derived Antibodies," in MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES: PRODUCTION, ENGINEERING AND CLINICAL APPLICATION, Ritter et al. (eds.), pages 60-84 (Cambridge University Press 1995).
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      As described above, carbohydrate moieties in the Fc region of an antibody can be used to conjugate a therapeutic agent.
      <br/>
      However, the Fc region is absent if an antibody fragment is used as the antibody component of the immunoconjugate.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, it is possible to introduce a carbohydrate moiety into the light chain variable region of an antibody or antibody fragment.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Leung et al., J. Immunol. 154:5919 (1995); Hansen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,443,953 (1995).
      <br/>
      The engineered carbohydrate moiety is then used to attach a therapeutic agent.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      In addition, those of skill in the art will recognize numerous possible variations of the conjugation methods.
      <br/>
      For example, the carbohydrate moiety can be used to attach polyethyleneglycol in order to extend the half-life of an intact antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, in blood, lymph, or other extracellular fluids.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it is possible to construct a "divalent immunoconjugate" by attaching therapeutic agents to a carbohydrate moiety and to a free sulfhydryl group.
      <br/>
      Such a free sulfhydryl group may be located in the hinge region of the antibody component.

      Monoclonal antibody cross-inhibition studies have identified five epitopes on CD22, designated as epitopes A-E.

      Methods for determining the binding specificity of an anti-CD22 antibody are well-known to those of skill in the art.
      <br/>
      General methods are provided, for example, by Mole, "Epitope Mapping," in METHODS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, VOLUME 10: IMMUNOCHEMICAL PROTOCOLS, Manson (ed.), pages 105-116 (The Humana Press, Inc. 1992).
      <br/>
      More specifically, competitive blocking assays to determine CD22 epitope specificity are described by Stein et al., Cancer Immunol.
      <br/>
      Immunother. 37:293 (1993), and by Tedder et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,484,892 (1996).
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The Tedder patent also describes the production of CD22 mutants which lack one or more immunoglobulin-like domains.
      <br/>
      These mutant proteins were used to determine that immunoglobulin-like domains 1, 2, 3, and 4 correspond with epitopes A, D, B, and C, respectively.
      <br/>
      Thus, CD22 epitope specificity can also be identified by binding a test antibody with a panel of CD22 proteins lacking particular immunoglobulin-like domain.

      Although naked anti-CD22 antibodies are the primary therapeutic composition for treatment of B-cell malignancies, the efficacy of such anti-CD22 antibody therapy can be enhanced by supplementing naked antibodies with immunoconjugates and other forms of supplemental therapy described herein.
      <br/>
      In such multimodal regimens, the supplemental therapeutic compositions can be administered before, concurrently or after administration of naked anti-CD22 antibodies.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      Preferred immunoconjugates include radiolabeled antibody components and conjugates of an anti-CD22 antibody component and an immunomodulator.

      The therapeutic compositions described herein are particularly useful for treatment of indolent forms of B-cell lymphomas, aggressive forms of B-cell lymphomas, chronic lymphatic leukemias, and acute lymphatic leukemias.
      <br/>
      For example, anti-CD22 antibody components and immunoconjugates can be used to treat both indolent and aggressive forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

    <p num="82">
      A radiolabeled immunoconjugate may comprise an  ALPHA -emitting radioisotope, a  BETA -emitting radioisotope, a  GAMMA -emitting radioisotope, an Auger electron emitter, a neutron capturing agent that emits  ALPHA -particles or a radioisotope that decays by electron capture.
      <br/>
      Suitable radioisotopes include 198 Au, 32 p, 125 I, 131 I, 90 Y, 186 Re, 188 Re, 67 Cu, 211 At, and the like.

    <p num="83">
      As discussed above, a radioisotope can be attached to an antibody component directly or indirectly, via a chelating agent.
      <br/>
      For example, 67 Cu, considered one of the more promising radioisotopes for radioimmunotherapy due to its 61.5 hour half-life and abundant supply of beta particles and gamma rays, can be conjugated to an antibody component using the chelating agent, p-bromoacetamido-benzyl-tetraethylaminetetraacetic acid (TETA) .

      As an illustration, interferons can inhibit cell proliferation by inducing increased expression of class I histocompatibility antigens on the surface of various cells and thus, enhance the rate of destruction of cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

      <br/>
      Three weeks later, palpation of the neck node enlargement shows a measurable decrease of about 60%, while a repeat computerized tomography scan of the chest shows a marked, 70% reduction in tumor.
      <br/>
      Follow-up measurements made at ten weeks post therapy shows no evidence of the disease in the neck or the chest.
      <br/>
      Since new disease is not detected elsewhere, the patient is considered to be in complete remission.

    <p num="113">Treatment of a Patient With Diffuse Large Cell Aggressive Lymphoma With CHOP and hLL2</p>
    <p num="114">
      A patient presents with diffuse large cell aggressive lymphoma, and is diagnosed to have a poor prognosis, having bulky disease in the abdomen, numerous other sites of extradnodal disease, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
      <br/>
      The patient is placed on CHOP, and after three cycles of therapy, a partial response is observed with resolution of numerous sites of extranodal disease outside the abdomen.
      <br/>
      However, the bulky disease in the abdomen continues to increase in volume, and the serum LDH remains elevated.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      Upon initiation of the third cycle of CHOP, the patient is infused with 50 mg of humanized LL2 monoclonal antibody on days 2, 5, 9 and 12.
      <br/>
      This therapeutic regimen of hLL2 is repeated concomitantly with four more cycles of CHOP.
      <br/>
      During therapy, the serum LDH level falls to within the normal range.
      <br/>
      One month after the third cycle of CHOP and hLL2, a computerized tomography scan of the bulky tumor in the abdomen shows over a 90% shrinkage of the mass.
      <br/>
      Follow-up studies every 10-12 weeks confirms a complete remission for over nine months post-therapy.

    <p num="118">
      A patient with diffuse large cell aggressive lymphoma responded to first line (CHOP) and second line (m-BACOD) chemotherapy, but fails third line chemotherapy (MACOPB).
      <br/>
      After completion of third line chemotherapy, the patient has diffuse disease in the bone marrow, massive splenomegaly, and numerous sites of enlarged lymph nodes that could be palpitated.
      <br/>
      The patient is then infused with 50 mg of humanized LL2 on days 2, 5, 9 and 12.
      <br/>
      This regimen is repeated every other week for four weeks.
      <br/>
      The bone marrow disease progressively responds to the hLL2 treatment, and the size of the nodes also decreases.
      <br/>
      However, many nodes can still be palpitated, and little decrease is observed in spleen size.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      While therapy with hLL2 continues every two weeks, the patient also receives 10 mg of hLL2-IL2 fusion protein.
      <br/>
      After the first treatment, there is a profound decrease in the size of the spleen, and after the second treatment with hLL2/hLL2-IL2, the nodes are not palpable, and the spleen has decreased further in size.
      <br/>
      No progression of the disease is observed for over six months.
