      <br/>
      A process for fabricating an ONO floating-gate electrode in a two-bit EEPROM device includes the formation of a first and second oxide layers using a high-temperature-oxide (HTO) deposition process in which the HTO process is carried out at a temperature of about 700 to about 800° C.
      <br/>
      The process further includes the sequential formation of a first silicon oxide layer, a silicon nitride layer, and a second silicon oxide layer using an RTCVD process in which the silicon nitride layer is not exposed to ambient atmosphere prior to the formation of the top oxide layer.
      <br/>
      The formation of the first and second oxide layers using an RTCVD process provides an improved two-bit EEPROM memory device by reducing charge leakage in the ONO floating-gate electrode.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      Non-volatile memory devices are currently in widespread use in electronic components that require the retention of information when electrical power is terminated.
      <br/>
      Non-volatile memory devices include read-only-memory (ROM), programmable-read-only memory (PROM), erasable-programmable-read-only memory (EPROM), and electrically-erasable-programmable-read-only-memory (EEPROM) devices.
      <br/>
      EEPROM devices differ from other non-volatile memory devices in that they can be electrically programmed and erased.
      <br/>
      Flash EEPROM devices are similar to EEPROM devices in that memory cells can be programmed and erased electrically.
      <br/>
      However, flash EEPROM devices enable the erasing of all memory cells in the device using a single electrical current pulse.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Typically, an EEPROM device includes a floating-gate electrode upon which electrical charge is stored.
      <br/>
      The floating-gate electrode overlies a channel region residing between source and drain regions in a semiconductor substrate.
      <br/>
      The floating-gate electrode, together with the source and drain regions, forms an enhancement transistor.
      <br/>
      By storing electrical charge on the floating-gate electrode, the threshold voltage of the enhancement transistor is brought to a relatively high value.
      <br/>
      Correspondingly, when charge is removed from the floating-gate electrode, the threshold voltage of the enhancement transistor is brought to a relatively low value.
      <br/>
      The threshold level of the enhancement transistor determines the current flow through the transistor when the transistor is turned on by the application of appropriate voltages to the gate and drain.
      <br/>
      When the threshold voltage is high, no current will flow through the transistor, which is defined as a logic 0 state.
      <br/>
      Correspondingly, when the threshold voltage is low, current will flow through the transistor, which is defined as a logic 1 state.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In a flash EEPROM device, electrons are transferred to a floating-gate electrode through a dielectric layer overlying the channel region of the enhancement transistor.
      <br/>
      The electron transfer is initiated by either hot electron injection, or by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling.
      <br/>
      In either electron transfer mechanism, a voltage potential is applied to the floating-gate by an overlying control-gate electrode.
      <br/>
      The control-gate electrode is capacitively coupled to the floating-gate electrode, such that a voltage applied on the control-gate electrode is coupled to the floating-gate electrode.
      <br/>
      The flash EEPROM device is programmed by applying a high positive voltage to the control-gate electrode, and a lower positive voltage to the drain region, which transfers electrons from the channel region to the floating-gate electrode.
      <br/>
      The flash EEPROM device is erased by grounding the control-gate electrode and applying a high positive voltage through either the source or drain region of the enhancement transistor.
      <br/>
      Under erase voltage conditions, electrons are removed from the floating-gate electrode and transferred into either the source or drain regions in the semiconductor substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Product development efforts in EEPROM device technology have focused on increasing the programming speed, lowering programming and reading voltages, increasing data retention time, reducing cell erasure times and reducing cell dimensions.
      <br/>
      Many of the foregoing research goals can be addressed through development of materials and processes for the fabrication of the floating-gate electrode.
      <br/>
      Recently, development efforts have focused on dielectric materials for fabrication of the floating-gate electrode.
      <br/>
      Silicon nitride, in combination with silicon dioxide, is known to provide satisfactory dielectric separation between the control-gate electrode and the channel region of the enhancement transistor, while possessing electrical characteristics sufficient to store electrical charge.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      One important dielectric material for the fabrication of the floating-gate electrode is an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) structure.
      <br/>
      During programming, electrical charge is transferred from the substrate to the silicon nitride layer in the ONO structure.
      <br/>
      Voltages are applied to the gate and drain creating vertical and lateral electric fields, which accelerate the electrons along the length of the channel.
      <br/>
      As the electrons move along the channel, some of them gain sufficient energy to jump over the potential barrier of the bottom silicon dioxide layer and become trapped in the silicon nitride layer.
      <br/>
      Electrons are trapped near the drain region because the electric fields are the strongest near the drain.
      <br/>
      Reversing the potentials applied to the source and drain will cause electrons to travel along the channel in the opposite direction and be injected into the silicon nitride layer near the source region.
      <br/>
      Because silicon nitride is not electrically conductive, the charge introduced into the silicon nitride layer tends to remain localized.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, depending upon the application of voltage potentials, electrical charge can be stored in discrete regions within a single continuous silicon nitride layer.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Non-volatile memory designers have taken advantage of the localized nature of electron storage within a silicon nitride layer and have designed memory circuits that utilize two regions of stored charge within an ONO layer.
      <br/>
      This type of non-volatile memory device is known as a two-bit EEPROM.
      <br/>
      The two-bit EEPROM is capable of storing twice as much information as a conventional EEPROM in a memory array of equal size.
      <br/>
      A left- and right-bit is stored in physically different areas of the silicon nitride layer, near left and right regions of each memory cell.
      <br/>
      Programming methods are then used that enable two-bits to be programmed and read simultaneously.
      <br/>
      The two-bits of the memory cell can be individually erased by applying suitable erase voltages to the gate and to either the source or drain regions.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      While the recent advances in EEPROM technology have enabled memory designers to double the memory capacity of EEPROM arrays using two-bit data storage, numerous challenges exist in the fabrication of material layers within these devices.
      <br/>
      In particular, the ONO layer must be carefully fabricated to avoid the creation of interface states that could provide charge leakage paths within the ONO layer.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, advances in ONO fabrication technology are necessary to insure proper charge isolation in ONO structures used in two-bit EEPROM devices.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      The present invention is directed towards a process for fabricating an ONO floating-gate electrode in a two-bit EEPROM device.
      <br/>
      Fabrication of a two-bit EEPROM device using an ONO floating-gate electrode requires the formation of a high quality ONO structure.
      <br/>
      This is because proper functionality of the two-bit EEPROM device requires localized charge storage within the ONO structure.
      <br/>
      In particular, the top oxide layer must have a density sufficient to minimize the formation of charge traps.
      <br/>
      The formation of charge traps in the top oxide layer can lead to undesirable charge leakage within the top oxide layer and at the interface between the top oxide layer and the underlying silicon nitride layer.
      <br/>
      In a properly formed ONO structure, all electrical charge is stored in the silicon nitride layer.
      <br/>
      By fabricating a high quality top oxide layer, stored charge in the ONO structure remains localized within predetermined regions in the silicon nitride layer.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In one form, a process for fabricating an ONO floating-gate electrode includes providing a semiconductor substrate, and using a rapid-thermal-chemical-vapor-deposition (RTCVD) apparatus to form a first silicon oxide layer overlying the semiconductor substrate.
      <br/>
      The deposition process is then continued using rapid-thermal-chemical-vapor-deposition to form a silicon nitride layer overlying the first silicon oxide layer and a second silicon oxide layer overlying the silicon nitride layer.
      <br/>
      The first and second silicon oxide layers are formed by means of a high temperature RTCVD oxide deposition process carried out at a temperature of about 700 to about 800 (degree)  C.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="20">
      Shown in FIG. 1, in cross-section, is a floating-gate transistor 10 suitable for use in a two-bit EEPROM device.
      <br/>
      Floating-gate transistor 10 includes source/drain regions 12 and 14 located in a semiconductor substrate 16 and separated by a channel region 18.
      <br/>
      First- and second-bit line oxide regions 20 and 22 overlie source/drain regions 12 and 14, respectively.
      <br/>
      A control gate electrode 24 overlies channel region 18 and is separated therefrom by an ONO structure 26.
      <br/>
      Control gate electrode 24 and ONO structure 26 form a stacked-gate structure.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      ONO structure 26 includes a first silicon oxide layer 28 overlying channel region 18.
      <br/>
      A silicon nitride layer 30 overlies first silicon oxide layer 28.
      <br/>
      A second silicon oxide layer (or top oxide layer) 32 overlies silicon nitride layer 30.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In the operation of floating-gate transistor 10, voltages are applied to control-gate electrode 24 and to source/drain regions 12 and 14 that cause electrical charge from source/drain regions 12 and 14 to propagate across channel region 18.
      <br/>
      Once the charge encounters a sufficiently strong vertical field, the charge is either injected or tunnels from channel region 18 into silicon nitride layer 30.
      <br/>
      For example, depending upon the particular voltage levels applied to control-gate electrode 24 and to source/drain regions 12 and 14, electrical charge 34 is transferred into silicon nitride layer 30 and is localized to regions in proximity to either source/drain region 12 or source/drain region 14.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Those skilled in the art will recognize that the proper functioning of a two-bit EEPROM device necessarily requires that electrical charge 34 remain isolated in the regions of silicon nitride layer 30 to which it is initially introduced.
      <br/>
      The proper maintenance of electrical charge 34 in localized regions of silicon nitride layer 30 is critical to the proper performance of a two-bit EEPROM device.
      <br/>
      In particular, the quality of ONO structure 26 must be such that charge leakage paths are minimized at the interface between the first and second silicon oxide layers 28 and 32, and silicon nitride layer.
      <br/>
      Additionally, second silicon oxide layer 32 must be of sufficient density such that charge trapping sites are minimized within the silicon oxide material.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In accordance with the invention, charge leakage within ONO structure 26 is minimized by forming high quality nitride and oxide layers.
      <br/>
      The reduced charge leakage and improved floating-gate transistor performance obtained by the present invention can be better understood following a description of an ONO fabrication process carried out in accordance with the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Referring to FIG. 2, first silicon dioxide layer 28 is formed to overlie the surface of semiconductor substrate 16.
      <br/>
      Preferably, semiconductor substrate 16 is a single crystal silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      Semiconductor substrate 16 has an upper surface 36 previously processed to remove debris and native oxides.
      <br/>
      Preferably, first silicon oxide layer 28 is formed by rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD) at an elevated temperature.
      <br/>
      The silicon oxide is formed by reacting N2 O with dichlorosilane or silane gas within the RTCVD system.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the RTCVD process is carried out at a temperature of about 700 (degree)  C. to about 800 (degree)  C. The RTCVD process forms a silicon oxide layer preferably having a thickness of about 50 to about 150 angstroms, and more preferably a thickness of about 100 angstroms.
      <br/>
      The RTCVD process can be carried out in either a batch-type RTCVD apparatus or, alternatively, in a single-wafer oxidation apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      After forming first silicon oxide layer 28, silicon nitride layer 30 is formed to overlie first silicon oxide layer 28, as illustrated in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Preferably, silicon nitride layer 30 is formed by means of an RTCVD process.
      <br/>
      The RTCVD process is carried out at a temperature of about 700 (degree)  C. to about 800 (degree)  C. The silicon nitride material is formed by reacting ammonia (NH3) with either dichlorosilane (SiCl2 H2) or silane (SiH4).
      <br/>
      The process is carried out for a period of time and at gas flow rates sufficient to form a silicon nitride layer preferably having a thickness of about 50 to about 150 angstroms, and more preferably about 100 angstroms.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment of the invention, ammonia is introduced in the RTCVD apparatus at a flow rate of about 1 standard liter per minute (slpm) and either dichlorosilane or silane is introduced at a flow rate of about 30 to about 50 standard-cubic-centimeters-per-minute (sccm).
      <br/>
      The RTCVD process is carried out in three steps including an initial temperature ramp, a deposition step, and cool-down step.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the total residence time of substrate 16 in the RTCVD apparatus is about 3 minutes.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the silicon nitride deposition step is completed in about 2 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      After forming silicon nitride layer 30, second silicon oxide layer 32 is formed to overlie silicon nitride layer 30, as illustrated in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the invention, second silicon oxide layer 32 is formed by means of a high temperature deposition process.
      <br/>
      Preferably, second silicon oxide layer 32 is formed in an RTCVD apparatus using nitrous oxide (N2 O) and dichlorosilane.
      <br/>
      The RTCVD processes preferably carried out at a temperature of about 700 (degree)  C. to about 800 (degree)  C. and for a total processing time of about 3 minutes.
      <br/>
      In similarity with the RTCVD process used to deposit first silicon oxide layer 28 and silicon nitride layer 30, a three-step deposition sequence is used including a ramp up step, a deposition step, and a cool down step.
      <br/>
      The total processing time in the RTCVD apparatus is about 3 minutes.
      <br/>
      Preferably, during the deposition step, about 1 to about 3 sipm and, more preferably, about 2 slpm of nitrous oxide is used.
      <br/>
      Additionally, about 25 to about 75 sccm and, more preferably, about 50 sccm of dichlorosilane is used.
      <br/>
      The RTCVD process forms a silicon oxide layer having a preferred thickness of about 50 to about 150 angstroms and, more preferably, about 100 angstroms.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The foregoing RTCVD process for the formation of both the first and second silicon oxide layers and the silicon nitride layer advantageously provides an in-situ process for the sequential formation of individual layers within the ONO structure.
      <br/>
      In particular, the formation of first silicon oxide layer 28, silicon nitride layer 30, and second silicon oxide layer 32 in a sequential, in-situ deposition sequence, minimizes contamination at the silicon nitride/silicon oxide interfaces.
      <br/>
      Additionally, uncontrolled native oxidation can be reduced to insure that a single, high-density silicon oxide layer is deposited over silicon nitride layer 30.
      <br/>
      An important aspect of the invention includes the sequential formation of silicon nitride layer 30 and second silicon oxide layer 32 in the absence of exposure of silicon nitride layer 30 to ambient atmosphere.
      <br/>
      Following the deposition of silicon nitride layer 30 onto first silicon oxide layer 28, substrate 16 is transferred to an oxide deposition chamber under vacuum conditions without exposing the substrate to ambient atmosphere.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a positive-pressure inert gas atmosphere can be introduced during wafer transfer.
      <br/>
      In addition to forming second silicon oxide layer 32 by a deposition process, the second silicon oxide layer can be formed by partial steam oxidation of silicon nitride layer 30.
      <br/>
      The steam oxidation process is preferably carried out at a temperature of about 900 (degree)  C. to about 1100 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Those skilled in the art will appreciate that various means exist for insuring that silicon nitride layer 30 is not exposed to ambient atmosphere prior to the deposition of second silicon oxide layer 32.
      <br/>
      For example, a cluster/tool apparatus can be used in which semiconductor substrate 16 is transferred from an oxide deposition chamber to a nitride deposition chamber, and back to an oxide deposition chamber in a continuous vacuum environment, or in a positive pressure inert gas atmosphere.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the nitride deposition and oxide deposition processes can be sequentially carried out in a single deposition chamber that is configured to receive various processing gases.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, all such variations and modifications are contemplated in the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Following the formation of ONO structure 26, the stacked-gate structure shown in FIG. 1 is completed by depositing a layer of gate forming material overlying second silicon oxide layer 32.
      <br/>
      A lithographic patterning and etching process is then carried out to define control-gate electrode 34 and an ONO floating-gate electrode.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will recognize that various gate-forming materials can be used to fabricate control-gate electrode 24.
      <br/>
      For example, control-gate electrode 24 can be formed with polycrystalline silicon, amphorous silicon, a refractory metal silicide, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Thus, there has been disclosed in accordance with the invention a process for fabricating an ONO floating-gate electrode in a two-bit EEPROM device using RTCVD that fully provides the advantages set forth above.

      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will recognize that variations and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention.
      <br/>
      For example, the thicknesses of the individual layers making up the ONO structure can be yaried from that described herein.
