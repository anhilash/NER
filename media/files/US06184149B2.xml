      The present invention provides a method for monitoring a self-aligned contact (SAC) etching process.
      <br/>
      A wafer with an oxide layer serves as an oxide control wafer.
      <br/>
      The oxide layer is formed on the substrate.
      <br/>
      The oxide control wafer and a SAC wafer with SAC structure are simultaneously treated with a SAC etching process in an etching chamber with the same etching recipe.
      <br/>
      A contact hole is formed by etching the oxide layer of the oxide control wafer after the SAC etching process.
      <br/>
      The depth of a profile transition point and the depth of etching stop for the oxide control wafer can be observed by cross-section SEM.
      <br/>
      The profile transition depth in the oxide control wafer corresponds to the etching thickness of SiN corner loss in the SAC wafer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the profile transition depth and the depth of etching stop in the oxide control wafer can be used to monitor the etching chamber condition.

      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a method of fabricating integrated circuits, and more particularly, to a method for monitoring self-aligned contact etching.</p>

      2. Description of the Prior Art With the development of the semiconductor process, the width of the metal line can be manufactured in a very narrow range.
      <br/>
      In an integrated circuit process, a contact hole provides an electrical connect for interconnections with the active region of a semiconductor device.
      <br/>
      Typically, the contact hole is formed using an etching process.
      <br/>
      The contact hole is typically generated by etching an insulator layer employing a photoresist as an etching mask.
      <br/>
      The contact hole provides a portion of active area of semiconductor device for interconnections between semiconductor devices.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 1, semiconductor devices 4 such as transistor are formed over a semiconductor substrate 2.
      <br/>
      Sidewall spacers 6 and liner layer 8 are substantially formed on the substrate 2 by using a conventional deposition and etching process.
      <br/>
      An insulator layer 10 such as oxide is then deposited on the liner layer 8.
      <br/>
      A photoresist layer 12 is coated on the insulator layer 10 and patterned as an etching mask.
      <br/>
      Afterward, a self-aligned contact (SAC) etching process is performed with high etching selectivity of spacer or liner (for example Si N) to insulator layer (for example oxide).
      <br/>
      The self-aligned contact (SAC) etching process can shrink the contact design rule.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      During SAC etching, the reaction gas of carbon-fluorine-contained compounds under plasma generates polymer which can etch oxide layer with high etching selectivity of Si N film to oxide layer.
      <br/>
      However, too much polymer deposition may cause oxide layer 10 etching stop while insufficient polymer may result in undesirable etching loss of Si N spacer or liner layer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a method to monitor the SAC etching chamber is important for mass production especially under such high polymer deposition condition.
      <br/>
      Generally, a wafer with SAC structure is etched and inspected by cross-section SEM for checking Si N loss and etching stop.
      <br/>
      However, wafers with SAC structure take a long preparation time and high cost in preparation.
      <br/>
      Generally, it spends time about three weeks to one month to finish complex steps from forming gate electrode to oxide layer.
      <br/>
      In addition, a few hundred angstrom SN loss is not easy to characterize.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a method is needed for accurately monitoring the chamber condition and the corresponding SN selectivity with low running cost.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a method for monitoring an etching process.
      <br/>
      The conventional method for monitoring self-aligned contact etching takes long wafer preparation time and involves a high cost in wafer preparation.
      <br/>
      The present inventions propose a novel method to monitor SAC etching at a low cost and with a rapid wafer preparation.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The present invention provides a method to monitor the SAC etching chamber condition.
      <br/>
      An oxide control wafer is utilized to observe the depth of etching profile transition and the depth of etching stop.
      <br/>
      By using the depth of etching profile transition and the depth of etching stop in the oxide control wafer in the present invention, the chamber condition can be monitored.
      <br/>
      The etching result for the oxide control wafer can be correlated back to the SAC etching for the SAC wafer.
      <br/>
      By changing the SAC etching recipe, the different monitoring results such as the profile transition depth and the depth of etching stop on the oxide control wafer are observed through SEM micrograph.
      <br/>
      These monitoring results are applied for detecting the shift of chamber condition using oxide control wafer instead of SAC structure wafer.
      <br/>
      The present invention is described as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Referring to FIG. 2, a semiconductor substrate 20 is used as a control wafer.
      <br/>
      A thick oxide layer 22 is then formed over the substrate 20 by using a conventional method such as CVD deposition or thermal oxidation process.
      <br/>
      An etching process is performed on the oxide control wafers with the same SAC recipe.
      <br/>
      A photoresist pattern 24 is formed on the oxide layer 22 with a window 26 of a contact hole.
      <br/>
      The width of the window 26 is the same with that of the SAC etching process.
      <br/>
      By using the photoresist pattern 24 as an etching mask, the oxide layer 22 of the oxide control wafer is etched to form a contact hole.
      <br/>
      This etching recipe such as reaction gas and the gas flow rate is the same with the SAC recipe.
      <br/>
      The etching result is shown in FIG. 3A. From the FIG. 3A, the cross section view of the contact hole 28 is with a depth of profile transition 30 and a depth of etching stop "L".
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, an etching process is performed on the oxide control wafer in HDP 5300 chamber.
      <br/>
      The reaction gases include C4 F8, Ar, and CH3 F. The gas flow rates of the reaction gases are 11 sccm for C4 F8, 50 sccm for Ar, and 8 sccm for CH3 F. The oxide layer is deposited in a thickness of about 18,000 angstroms.
      <br/>
      The dissociation power of plasma is set at approximately 1,200 watts to 1,800 watts.
      <br/>
      The energy of ion bombardment is in a range of approximately 1,200 watts to 1,800 watts.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 3B, an etching process is performed on a SAC wafer with the same etching recipe to form a contact hole 28a.
      <br/>
      The SAC wafer has polysilicon gate electrode 6a, liner layer 8a and oxide layer 10a.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      During etching the oxide control wafer process, a polymer is generated on the surface of the contact hole 28 due to the reaction of gas and the photoresist.
      <br/>
      The polymer deposition rate is slower than the polymer etching rate before the profile transition 30 is generated.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the variation of the etching rate is small such that the cross-section profile of the contact hole is steep.
      <br/>
      However, the polymer will deposit more and more with etching time.
      <br/>
      While the polymer deposition rate is sufficiently higher than the etching rate, the aspect ratio of the contact hole is increased.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the polymer deposited on the bottom of the contact hole is not easily bombarded by plasma, thus resulting in an etching stop.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 3A, the depth of the etching stop is denoted by "L" that is about 16,000 angstroms and the depth of profile transition 30 is about 8,000 angstroms.
      <br/>
      The profile transition 30 is formed at the critical point that the polymer deposition rate is faster than the etching rate.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 3B, the wafer with a SAC structure is etched via the same etching recipe of the oxide control wafer.
      <br/>
      In etching oxide layer 10a of the SAC wafer, the SiN liner layer 8a on the substrate 2a is etched to about 200 angstroms.
      <br/>
      The SiN comer loss is about 200 angstroms corresponding to profile transition at depth 8,000 angstroms for the oxide control wafer.
      <br/>
      The profile transition cannot be observed from the SAC wafer due to the fact that the corresponding profile transition point for the oxide control wafer is hidden behind the polysilicon gate electrode of the SAC wafer.
      <br/>
      This depth of profile transition in oxide control wafer can be used to monitor the SAC etching chamber.
      <br/>
      In the etching process, the amount of carbon-containing compounds is found to reach a saturation point by an optical emission spectrum analysis.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 6, in the reaction chamber ,the carbon ions generated by using plasma dissociating the carbon-fluorine-contained compounds are increasing during the reaction.
      <br/>
      The amount of carbon ions increases to a saturation amount.
      <br/>
      The amount of carbon ions represent the amount of the reaction gas correlated to the polymer deposition.
      <br/>
      By the optical emission spectrum analysis, the polymer deposition rate increases when the amount of carbon ions in the etching chamber increases.
      <br/>
      While the polymer deposition rate becomes higher than the polymer etching rate, the profile transition point will occur.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Referring to FIG. 4A, when the CH3 F flow rate lowers from 8 sccm to 6 sccm,the depth of etching profile transition of standard 8,000 angstroms increases to 10,0000 angstroms.
      <br/>
      The reason is that the amount of polymer in the chamber is decreased.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the CH3 F flow rate is increased, the depth of etching profile transition will be more shallow.
      <br/>
      The main reason for this is that decreasing the CH3 F flow rate will result in the polymer deposition reduction.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a long time is required to reach the critical point of profile transition.
      <br/>
      This change of the depth of etching profile transition from 8,000 angstroms to 10,000 angstroms is due to the decreases in the CH3 F flow rate.
      <br/>
      This result corresponds to the SAC wafer as shown in FIG. 4B. During etching of the oxide layer 10b, the etching loss of Si N 8b is about 400 angstroms using the same recipe as the oxide control wafer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the depth of etching profile transition of the oxide control wafer can be used to monitor the Si N loss of the SAC wafer.
      <br/>
      The method of the present invention for monitoring the depth of the profile transition can be correlated back to the etching selectivity of the liner layer and the sidewall spacers.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the etching chamber condition can be monitored.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Additionally, referring to FIG. 5, when the C4 F8 flow rate increases from 11 to 12 sccm, the depth of etching stop of the oxide control wafer of 16,000 angstroms decreases to 13,000 angstroms.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the C4 F8 flow rate decreases, the depth of the etching stop increases due to the decrease in the polymer deposition rate.
      <br/>
      However, this variation of etching stop cannot be detected from the regular SAC monitor wafer by SEM inspection because the depth of the etching stop is deeper than the thickness of the SAC oxide layer.
      <br/>
      However, the shift of chamber conditions can be detected in early stages by the oxide control wafer, and the recipe can be modified to suit the SAC etching process requirement.
      <br/>
      Generally, the variation of CH3 F flow rate can change the depth of profile transition in oxide layer and the variation of C4 F8 flow rate can change the depth of the etching stop.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Accordingly, a data base is generated using the method of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The data base includes the information of a set of Si N comer loss and the corresponding set of the depth of etching profile transition profile transition depth, a set of the depth of etching stop, a set of SAC chamber condition and a set of correlated SAC etching parameters.
      <br/>
      The data base is shown as follows:

    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In accordance with the data base generated from the different results of the the depth of the etching profile transition and the depth of etching stop, the etching chamber condition can be monitored and adjusted.
      <br/>
      By the monitoring result, the amount of polymer deposition and the corresponding Si N corner loss can be determined.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the present invention using the oxide control wafer without the SAC structure, the etching selectivity of the liner layer and sidewall spacers made of Si N can be monitored and adjusted.
      <br/>
      The oxide control wafer and the SAC wafer are performed with the etching process at the same time.
      <br/>
      The oxide control wafer composed of oxide film and the SAC photoresist pattern is etched by using the SAC baseline recipe.
      <br/>
      After the SAC etching, the oxide control wafer is inspected by cross-section SEM to monitor the chamber condition.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, applying an oxide control wafer without the SAC structure can reduce the cost and preparation time required for the SAC monitor wafer.
      <br/>
      The depth of etching stop cannot be observed when using the regular SAC structure to monitor the SAC chamber.
      <br/>
      The present invention method can effectively reduce the cost only by forming an oxide film on the substrate of the control wafer.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the method is very sensitive to the shift of the chamber condition and the depth of the profile transition correlated to Si N corner selectivity.

      Although specific embodiments including the preferred embodiment have been illustrated and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, which is intended to be limited solely by the appended claims.

      For example, the monitoring method in the present invention can be used to any etching process using CH3 F and C4H8 as reactants.

      In an other way, etching process using different reactants can be also monitored using similar method of inspecting transition depth and etching stop depth on a control wafer.
