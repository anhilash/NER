    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="18">As employed herein, the term "reinforcing additives" means carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, chopped graphite fibers, crushed calcined coke, crushed green coke and combinations thereof.</p>
    <p num="19">
      The present invention contemplates enhancing certain properties of a carbon foam material through the addition of selected reinforcing additives thereto.
      <br/>
      The basic process for making the carbon foam material while preferably that disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/887,556 may involve other processes for making the carbon foam.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In making an anisotropic carbon foam material, one may create a coke precursor or pitch by hydrogenating and de-ashing bituminous coal followed by dissolving the hydrogenated bituminous coal having asphaltenes and oils in a solvent, separation of the asphaltenes from the oils, coking the asphaltenes by heating to devolatilize and foam the same, and cooling the carbon foam.
      <br/>
      The material may be baked, calcined and graphitized, if desired.
      <br/>
      During the method, reinforcing additives may be introduced to enhance properties such as tensile modulus, flexural modulus, compressive strength and tensile strength of the carbon foam.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Similarly, in making an isotropic carbon foam material one may create a coke precursor or pitch by de-ashing bituminous coal, dissolving the de-ashed coal having asphaltenes and oils in a solvent, separating the asphaltenes from the oils, coking the asphaltenes by heating to devolatilize and foam and cooling the carbon foam.
      <br/>
      The foam may be baked, calcined and graphitized, if desired.
      <br/>
      During the method, a reinforcing additives may be introduced.
    </p>
    <p num="22">The reinforcing additives are preferably selected from the group consisting of carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, chopped graphite fibers, crushed green coke and crushed calcined coke as well as combinations of two or more of the these materials.</p>
    <p num="23">
      In one embodiment of the invention, the reinforcing materials are introduced when the process has the other materials in a dry state.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the reinforcing materials may be added after solvent addition.
      <br/>
      Tests have indicated that the introduction of the reinforcing additive by the wet processing technique tends to provide greater enhancement of compressive strength and retention of strength and high strain than the dry introduction process, although both produce meaningful improvements in strength characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="24">It is preferred that the reinforcing additive be employed in the range of about 2 to 8 weight percent based on the weight of coke precursor (pitch).</p>
    <p num="25">
      The carbon nanofibers and carbon nanotubes employed in the present invention preferably have a ratio of fiber length to fiber diameter of about 2 to 3000 and preferably about 100 to 300.
      <br/>
      The carbon nanofibers and carbon nanotubes may have a diameter in the range of about 10 to 200 mm.
      <br/>
      The graphite fibers also preferably have a length to diameter of about 2 to 3000 and preferably about 100 to 300.
      <br/>
      The carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes and the chopped graphite fibers are preferably ground to -200 mesh prior to use.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In making the coke, the material may be baked at a temperature of about 500 to 550 (degree)  C. to produce green coke.
      <br/>
      The baking may take place at a pressure of about 200-500 psig.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the material may be calcined at about 975 to 1025 (degree)  C. at one atmosphere in an inert gas.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the calcined coke may be graphitized at a temperature of about 2600 to 3200 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The carbon nanotubes employed in the present invention as a reinforcing additive, may be in the form of single walled nanotubes or multiwalled nanotubes, the latter of which is generally created by applying additional graphitic layers through pyrolytic deposition.
      <br/>
      It is believed that the well ordered, highly graphitic lattice is what enables the nanotube to achieve a very high strength and modulus.
      <br/>
      It has a very high surface area to volume ratio due to its submicron diameter.
      <br/>
      The highly ordered graphitic lattice also results in nearly metallic electrical conductivity.
      <br/>
      It is generally preferred to preheat the nanofibers and nanotubes to about 200 (degree)  F. for about 10 to 200 minutes to remove polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).
    </p>
    <p num="28">Carbon nanotubes may be produced from catalyzed pyrolysis reactions of coal and other fossil hydrocarbon fuels.</p>
    <p num="29">
      In producing the crushed green coke, a neat extract can be produced by grinding coal to -60 mesh and dividing the sample into two portions.
      <br/>
      If desired, one portion was used for direct extraction while the other portion was retained for extraction after mild hydrogenation.
      <br/>
      The first portion may be refluxed in N-methylpyrrolidone for one hour under a nitrogen blanket at atmospheric pressure.
      <br/>
      At this condition, about 65 percent of the carbonous material will dissolve in the solvent while the remaining material containing all the inorganic material will remain insoluble.
      <br/>
      The solution may then be separated from the residue by centrifugation at 2000 g and the N-methylpyrrolidone can be removed from the solution by evaporation leaving a dry-friable pitch.
      <br/>
      This neat pitch can be heated in 100 percent reflux coke oven to produce green coke.
      <br/>
      The pitch can be heated in two stages.
      <br/>
      In the first phase, the pitch can be heated to 450 (degree)  C. at a rate of 5 (degree)  C. per minute.
      <br/>
      It can be maintained at this temperature for about 1.5 hours and then can be heated to 580 (degree)  C. at the rate of 5 (degree)  C. per minute and maintained at that temperature for about 6 hours.
      <br/>
      After the reactor cooled, the coke can be removed and crushed to -100 mesh.
      <br/>
      The coke had the appearance of typical metallurgical coke.
      <br/>
      To convert the green coke to calcined coke, prior to crushing, the green coke is heated under an inert atmosphere at a rate of 0.1 degrees/minute to 50 degrees/minute to a final temperature of about 975-1025 C.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      One method of foam fabrication employed in the present invention involves the extraction of organic material from coal using a class of organic solvents known generically as dipolar aprotic solvents.
      <br/>
      These solvents have the ability to solubilize much of the organic carbonaceous material in coal.
      <br/>
      An advantage of this approach is that only organic material is soluble in the solvent and inorganic mineral matter is not.
      <br/>
      The solvent extraction procedure may be performed as a batch process at about 200 (degree)  C. and one atmosphere of pressure which is the normal boiling point of one of the primary solvents.
      <br/>
      After a very short treatment of the coal by the solvent, considerable amounts of organic material originally present in the coal were dissolved in the solvent.
      <br/>
      An undissolved fraction which contained essentially all of the mineral matter present in the raw coal settled to the bottom of the reactor vessel as a solid or centrifugation with filtration material.
      <br/>
      The solution was separated from the solid material by simple filtration leaving behind in the filter the solid undissolved material, i.e., the residue.
      <br/>
      Once separated, the dissolved organic material was recovered from solution by evaporating the solvent.
      <br/>
      The purified coal extract was recovered as a friable glass-like solid.
      <br/>
      The important properties of the extract are that it was composed of pure organic material derived from the original coal and contained no inorganic sulfur species and little or no mineral matter.
      <br/>
      Upon analysis of the extract, typical ash levels of less than 0.1 percent were routinely obtained and levels as low as 0.01 percent could be achieved with additional processing.
      <br/>
      Yields up to about 50 percent of the weight of the original coal can be realized.
      <br/>
      The process works particularly well with bituminous coals.
    </p>
    <p num="31">The material may have a density which is varied depending upon the pressure and temperature properties, as well as the specific process employed to manufacture the foam, but may, for example, have a density of about 0.2 gm/cc to 1.5 gm/cc.</p>
    <p num="32">If desired, two or more reinforcing additives may be combined.</p>
    <p num="33">
      It will be appreciated that the present invention may be employed to create a carbon foam product with predetermined strength.
      <br/>
      It is not always the objective to maximize strength.
      <br/>
      For example, a component designed to fail at a predetermined compressive impact load may be created by control over the method of making the carbon foam including providing an appropriate type and amount of reinforcing additives.
      <br/>
      Such a product could be usable in vehicles as well as other applications.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      It will be appreciated, therefore, that the present invention provides an improved method for enhancing or otherwise adjusting the strength properties of carbon foam material.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished through the use of specific preferred reinforcing additives which are introduced on either a dry or wet basis into the process of manufacturing the material.
      <br/>
      All of this may be accomplished in a manner which is consistent with various desired means of manufacturing carbon foam.
    </p>
    <p num="35">The enhanced strength material, on the basis of experimental evaluation, has enhanced compressive strength, compressive modulus, tensile strength, tensile modulus and flexural strength and flexural modulus.</p>
    <p num="36">
