    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      Currently the compact disc or CD is the medium of choice for recorded music as well as computer software.
      <br/>
      A compact disc has digital data forming the music or software impressed thereon as pits which are read by a laser mechanism.
      <br/>
      CD's are typically purchased in flattened, hinged cases, commonly referred to as "jewel boxes", although other protective means are sometimes employed.
      <br/>
      A typical musical CD package includes a "booklet", describing the recorded music, stored in the front half of the jewel box and the CD and a rear label in a rear half of the jewel box.
      <br/>
      The booklet often functions as a front label.
      <br/>
      The jewel box may also include edge labels in the side edges of the jewel box.
      <br/>
      Jewel boxes are usually formed of clear transparent plastic which allows the booklet and labels to be viewed through corresponding walls of the jewel boxes.
      <br/>
      Jewel boxes for computer software distributed on CD's may be arranged in a manner similar to musical CD's.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Although jewel boxes function well in protecting CD's stored therein, they are somewhat inconvenient when it comes to opening them, removing and replacing the disc, and removing and replacing the booklet.
      <br/>
      The CD is retained in place within a jewel box by a resilient "post" onto which the CD is snapped.
      <br/>
      It is advisable to avoid touching the underside of the CD, because data impressed thereon can be made unreadable by skin oils and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      There are a number of types of structures or racks for holding a plurality of CD's at a location convenient to a CD player or deck.
      <br/>
      Some types have slots sized to allow a CD within a jewel box to be placed therein.
      <br/>
      The usual problem with such a type of rack is that it must be orientationally stable; otherwise a tilt of the rack in the wrong direction will allow a number of the jewel boxes to slide out.
      <br/>
      Other types are adapted to receive only the CD itself, without the jewel box or accompanying literature.
      <br/>
      This may be appropriate for a portable CD holder, but it is often inconvenient for use in a fixed location.
      <br/>
      Additionally, separation of the CD from its jewel box and literature may result in misplacement of the jewel box and literature.
      <br/>
      With both jewel box racks and conventional CD holders, only a given number of jewel boxes or CD's may be stored therein.
      <br/>
      When the maximum number of jewel boxes or CD's have been stored in such structures, another structure must be obtained for any additional jewel boxes or CD's.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      The present invention provides a modular CD holder system which not only holds CD's but the CD booklets as well.
      <br/>
      In addition, the CD holders incorporate cleaning pads for the CD's to maintain their playability by simply removing the CD's and replacing them.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The CD holder system includes CD holders and booklet holders which are similar in configuration.
      <br/>
      Each holder is approximately the size of a conventional jewel box.
      <br/>
      The holders are internally configured to receive a compact disc and a typical type of CD booklet respectively.
      <br/>
      A CD and a booklet extends partially out of their respective holders to facilitate grasping them for removal.
      <br/>
      The CD and booklet holders of the present invention have releasable corner joiners which allow the holders to be modularly joined.
      <br/>
      Any number of CD holders and/or booklet holders can be interconnected to effectively form a CD and CD booklet holder rack.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The holder structures are approximately square with the corners mitered.
      <br/>
      Each corner has a holder tongue extending along the mitered or beveled edge.
      <br/>
      A right triangular corner joiner member has a holder groove extending along a hypotenuse surface thereof, the holder groove having a cross sectional shape compatible with that of the holder tongue.
      <br/>
      The joiner member also has a joiner tongue and a joiner groove formed along opposite faces of the joiner member.
      <br/>
      A joiner member is received on each of the holder beveled edges by engagement of the holder groove with the respective holder tongue.
      <br/>
      The joiner member tongue and groove enable the joiner members of one holder to interconnect with the joiner members of another holder, whereby various CD and booklet holders can be selectively stacked in any desired order.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms.
      <br/>
      Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed structure.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Referring to the drawings in more detail:</p>
    <p num="12">
      The reference numeral 1 generally designates a stacking, self-cleaning compact disc holder assembly which embodies the present invention.
      <br/>
      The assembly 1 generally includes a plurality of receptacle members 2 for compact discs (CD's) and booklets from compact disc packages (not shown) which are interconnected by corner connectors 3 to form the modular holder assembly 1.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The receptacles 2 are internally configured to receive compact discs 4 or booklets 5 therein.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIGS. 1, 5, and 6, the receptacles 2 include CD receptacles 6 and booklet receptacles 7.
      <br/>
      A CD 4 or a booklet 5 are generally referred to herein as a content member 8 of a compact disc package and also as recorded media.
      <br/>
      A CD 4 has musical or other data recorded thereon by a physical process, while a booklet 5 has text and graphics recorded thereon by printing.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Referring to FIGS. 1, 5, and 6, the receptacles 2 are generally square in shape with mitered or beveled corners 10.
      <br/>
      Each receptacle 2 has opposite face walls 12, side walls 14, an end wall 16, and miter walls 17.
      <br/>
      The receptacles 2 have content conforming internal walls 18 extending along the face walls 12 which conform to the CD 4 or booklet 5 intended to be carried by the particular receptacle 2.
      <br/>
      The illustrated CD receptacle 4 has a rounded, U-shaped internal wall 20, while the illustrated booklet receptacle 7 has a rectangular U-shaped internal wall 22.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, both internal walls 20 and 22 could be rectangular.
      <br/>
      Internal ribs 24 extend between the internal walls 18 and the outer walls 14, 16, and 17 on the face walls 12 and, in cooperation with the internal walls 18, reinforce the face walls 12.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The illustrated receptacles 2 are preferably formed of transparent plastic in receptacle half sets, one half 26 of each set being shown in FIGS. 5 and 6.
      <br/>
      The halves 26 are assembled as by glueing, ultrasonic welding, or the like.
      <br/>
      The opposite receptacle halves 26 may include sockets 28 and pegs 30 (FIG. 10) which properly locate the halves 26 of a receptacle 2 for assembly.
      <br/>
      The sockets 28 and pegs 30 may also function as glueing or welding locations during assembly.
      <br/>
      When assembled, the receptacle halves 26 have the opposite face walls 12 positioned in spaced relation to form a content member chamber 29 therein with an entry slot 31 at the external edges of the chamber 29.
      <br/>
      The chamber 29 is formed within the bonds of the internal walls 18.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The CD receptacle 6 includes walls 32 forming a spine label receiving channel 34 (FIGS. 5 and 10).
      <br/>
      The illustrated spine channel 34 is formed on one of the side walls 14 of the CD receptacle 6 and is provided to receive a thin spine label (not shown) identifying the CD 4 which is stored in the receptacle 6, which may be a part of the original CD package in which the CD 4 was packaged and sold.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      As shown in FIG. 1, each CD receptacle 6 has a pair of notched CD guard tabs 36 extending from the face walls 12.
      <br/>
      The tabs 36 have finger notches 38 formed therein.
      <br/>
      The tabs 36 have a truncated disc shape of approximately the same radius as the CD's 4 and are positioned at the access slots 31 of the CD receptacle 6.
      <br/>
      The tabs 36 are provided to protect the CD's 4 stored in the receptacle 6 while providing grasping access thereto by the notches 38.
      <br/>
      The booklet receptacles 7 could be provided with similar tabs, only rectangularly shaped.
      <br/>
      However, the booklets 5 do not require the same degree of protection as the CD's 4 and, for this reason, no such tabs are provided for the booklet receptacles 7 in the preferred embodiment of the assembly 1.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIG. 5, the CD receptacles are provided with cleaning pads 40 in the content member chamber 29 which conform to the combined shapes of the U-shaped wall 20 and the tabs 36.
      <br/>
      The pad 40 is adhered to an inner surface of the face wall 12 of each half 26 of the CD receptacle 6 within the chamber 29.
      <br/>
      The pads are preferably formed of a velvet-like fabric somewhat similar to the type of fabric provided in older type floppy discs and serve to clean a CD 4 as it is inserted into or withdrawn from a CD receptacle 6, by frictional contact.
      <br/>
      Frictional contact between the pads 40 and a CD 4 in the Chamber 29 also tends to retain the CD 4 within the receptacle 6, should the entry slot 31 be tilted downwardly.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Referring particularly to FIGS. 2-4 and 7-9, each of the corner connectors 3 has a triangular, prismatic shape which complements the mitered corners 10 of the receptacles 2.
      <br/>
      Each corner connector 3 has a pair of leg surfaces 44 positioned in perpendicular relation and a hypotenuse surface 46 positioned at 45 degrees to each of the leg surfaces 44.
      <br/>
      The connectors 3 have face surfaces 48 positioned at right angles to the leg surfaces 44 and the hypotenuse surface 46.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      A receptacle groove 50 is formed in the connectors 3 parallel to the hypotenuse surface 46 and opening thereonto.
      <br/>
      The receptacle groove 50 is sized and shaped to receive a receptacle tongue 52 formed on each of the walls 17 of the mitered corners 10 of a receptacle 2.
      <br/>
      The receptacle tongue 52 and groove 50 provide structure for releasably connecting the corner connectors 3 with the receptacle members 2.
      <br/>
      Each corner connector 3 also has a connector tongue 54 and connector groove 56 formed thereon.
      <br/>
      The tongue 54 is positioned on one of the face surfaces 48 of a connector member 3, while the groove 56 is formed into an opposite face surface 48 of the connector 3.
      <br/>
      The tongue 54 and groove 56 extend parallel to the hypotenuse surface 46 of the connector member 3 and provide for releasable connection of each connector member 3 to another connector 3.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The illustrated tongue 52 and groove 50 are rectangular in cross section while the connector tongue 54 and groove 56 are cylindrical in cross section.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the tongues 52 and 54 and the grooves 50 and 56 could have other cross sectional shapes.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In use of the CD holder assembly 1 of the present invention, two or more receptacles 2 are positioned with their face walls 12 in close proximity and with their entry slots 31 opening in the same direction.
      <br/>
      Any mix of CD receptacles 6 and/or booklet receptacles 7 can be used in any desired order.
      <br/>
      For each pair of receptacles 2, for corner connectors 3 are used.
      <br/>
      The four connectors 3 are positioned on the mitered corners 10 of one of the receptacles 2 by engaging the receptacle groove 50 of each connector 3 with a receptacle tongue 52 of the receptacle 2.
      <br/>
      A second set of four connectors 3 is used to connect between a second receptacle 2 and the connectors 3 of the first receptacle 2.
      <br/>
      A small degree of coordination is required to simultaneously engage the receptacle tongue and groove 52/50 of each connector 3 and the connector tongue and groove 54/56.
      <br/>
      However, in practice, this amounts to no great difficulty.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The process is repeated for each additional receptacle 2 which is joined to the assembly 1.
      <br/>
      Once the receptacles 2 are joined, the assembly 1 can be oriented with the receptacles 2 horizontal or vertical.
      <br/>
      A particularly useful arrangement is to alternate CD receptacles 6 and booklet receptacles 7, allowing the CD 4 and booklet 5 of a conventional CD package to be placed in side-by-side relation.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Although a preferred structure for connecting the receptacles 2 using the connectors 3 has been described and illustrated, it is foreseen that other equivalent structure could be employed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is to be understood that while certain forms of the present invention have been illustrated and described herein, it is not to be limited to the specific forms or arrangement of parts described and shown.
