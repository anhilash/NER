    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a photoreceptor web installing/removing apparatus for a printer, having an improved structure so that a photoreceptor web can be easily installed on a roller unit and removed therefrom.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In general, as shown in FIG. 1, a printer or copier includes a roller unit 10 installed in a main body 1 of the printer and a photoreceptor web 20 installed so as to circulate around the roller unit 10.
      <br/>
      The roller unit 10 includes a frame 13 by which a plurality of support rollers 11, for supporting the photoreceptor web 20, are supported.
      <br/>
      A mobile bracket 14 is movably installed on the frame 13 by which a bracket tension roller 12 for adjusting the tension of the photoreceptor web 20 is supported.
      <br/>
      The photoreceptor web 20 circulates on a continuous path while being supported by the rollers 11 and 12.
      <br/>
      An image formed on a surface of the photoreceptor web 20 is developed by a predetermined development device (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The photoreceptor web 20 is flexible.
      <br/>
      Therefore, to easily install the photoreceptor web 20 on the roller unit 10 or remove it therefrom, a belt installation cartridge 30 and a belt removing cartridge 40 (see FIG. 2) are used.
      <br/>
      The belt installation cartridge 30, accommodating the photoreceptor web 20 inside, is inserted in the main body 1 of the printer so as to encompass the roller unit 10 and install the photoreceptor web 20 on the roller unit 10.
      <br/>
      After the photoreceptor web 20 is installed, the belt installation cartridge 30 is pulled back.
      <br/>
      Also, to replace the photoreceptor web 20, the belt removing cartridge 40 is inserted in the main body 1 of the printer so as to encompass the roller unit 10.
      <br/>
      Next, the photoreceptor web 20 is clamped by a predetermined clamping device (not shown) provided on the belt removing cartridge 40.
      <br/>
      Then, as the belt removing cartridge 40 is removed from the main body 1 of the printer, the photoreceptor web 20 is removed from the roller unit 10.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      Referring to FIGS. 3 through 5, the photoreceptor web installation/removing apparatus, for a printer, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a roller unit 110 installed in a main body 101 of the printer and on which a photoreceptor web 102 is installed.
      <br/>
      A belt removing cartridge 120 is insertable in the main body 101 to remove the photoreceptor web 102 which is installed on the roller unit 110.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a belt installation cartridge 130 is inserted in the main body 101 to install a new photoreceptor web on the roller unit 110.
      <br/>
      Further, a locking/releasing device is provided for selectively locking or releasing the belt removing cartridge 120 and the belt installing cartridge 130 when either of the cartridges is inserted in the main body 101.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a recognition device is provided for recognizing the type of cartridge inserted in the main body 101.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The roller unit 110 includes a plurality of support rollers 111 for supporting the photoreceptor web 102 so as to enable the photoreceptor web 102 to circulate.
      <br/>
      A front frame 113 and a rear frame 115 support respective ends of the support rollers 111.
      <br/>
      A pair of mobile brackets 117, movably coupled to each of the frames 113 and 115, supports a tension roller 112 for adjusting the tension of the photoreceptor web 102.
      <br/>
      The mobile brackets 117 are elastically biased by tension springs 119--coupled to the frames 113 and 115, respectively--toward the first position A to tension the photoreceptor web 102, and are moved toward the second position B by a predetermined driving device (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The belt removing cartridge 120 is a box-shaped case having a front side-wall 121, an outer circumferential wall 123 connected to the front side-wall 121, and a rear-side wall which is open so that the roller unit 110 can be inserted therein when the belt removing cartridge 120 is inserted in the main body 101 of the printer.
      <br/>
      Also, a predetermined clamping unit 125, for clamping the photoreceptor web 102 installed on the roller unit 110, is provided in the belt removing cartridge 120.
      <br/>
      Further, a first locking hole 121a, by which a hook member 141 (described later) is locked, is formed in the front-side wall 121.
      <br/>
      A first groove 123a is formed in the outer circumferential wall 123 and is indented toward the front side wall 121.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The belt installation cartridge 130, in which a new photoreceptor web to be installed at the roller unit 110 is accommodated, is a box-shaped case, similar to the belt removing cartridge 120.
      <br/>
      The belt installation cartridge has a front side-wall 131, an outer circumferential wall 133 connected to the front side-wall 131, and a rear-side wall which is open so that the belt installation cartridge 130 can encompass the roller unit 110 as it is inserted in the main body 101 of the printer.
      <br/>
      A second locking hole 131a, by which the hook member 141 is hooked, is formed in the front side wall 131.
      <br/>
      The second locking hole 131a is formed so as to be offset a predetermined distance G from the first locking hole 121a toward the first position A with respect to a reference line L1, as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The second locking hole 131a is thus able to be hooked by the hook member 141 when the hook member 141 is positioned to be released from the second locking hole 121a.
      <br/>
      Also, a second groove 133a is formed indented toward the front-side wall 131 in the outer circumferential wall 133 and is offset from the first groove 123a with respect to a reference line L2 so that the belt installation cartridge 130 can easily be distinguished from the belt removing cartridge 120.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The locking/releasing device includes a hook member 141 installed on the front frame 113 so as to be movable between the first position A where the hook member 141 is locked to the belt removing cartridge 120, and the second position B where the hook member 141 is released from the belt removing cartridge 120 and is positioned to be locked to the belt installation cartridge 130.
      <br/>
      The hook member 141 is elastically pressed toward the first position A by a first pressing spring 143 and is moved to the second position B by a pushing force from the mobile bracket 117.
      <br/>
      That is, the hook member 141 penetrates a slit 113a formed in the front frame 113 and slides between the first position A and the second position B. For this purpose, the hook member 141 includes a first elastic hook 141a for locking to the first locking hole 121a, and a second elastic hook 141b formed a predetermined distance from the first elastic hook 141a and for locking to the second locking hole 131a.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Also, the locking/releasing device further includes a second pressing spring 145 elastically pressing the hook member 141 toward the front side of the front frame 113.
      <br/>
      A support member 147, installed on the front frame 113, supports the first pressing spring 143 and the second pressing spring 145.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The recognition device includes a first switch 151 and a second switch 153 installed at positions which are separated a predetermined distance, and positions which correspond to an open end portion of each belt cartridge 120 and 130, respectively.
      <br/>
      The switches 151 and 153 are installed on the rear frame 115.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The first switch 151, installed at the position corresponding to the first groove 123a of the belt removing cartridge 120 so as to recognize the belt installation cartridge 130, is switched by being pressed by an open end portion of the belt installation cartridge 130 when inserted in the main body 101 of the printer.
      <br/>
      The second switch 153, installed at a position corresponding to the second groove 133a of the belt installation cartridge 130 so as to recognize the belt removing cartridge 120, is switched by being pressed by an open end portion of the belt installation cartridge 130 inserted in the main body 101 of the printer.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The operation of the belt installation/removing apparatus according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, having the above structure, will now be described.
      <br/>
      First, the photoreceptor web 102 installed at the roller unit 110 is removed.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 6, the photoreceptor web 102 is tensioned by the mobile bracket 117 which is moved to the first position A. While the hook member 141 is located at the first position A, the belt removing cartridge 120 is gradually inserted in the main body 101 of the printer such that the first groove 123a corresponds to the first switch 151.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      When the belt removing cartridge 120 is inserted to some degree, the first elastic hook 141a is pressed by the edge of the first locking hole 121a and is elastically deformed.
      <br/>
      As the belt removing cartridge 120 is further inserted, as shown in FIG. 7, the first elastic hook 141a passes through the first locking hole 121a and is elastically restored so as to be locked to the first locking hole 121a.
      <br/>
      Thus, the belt removing cartridge 120 is completely inserted in the main body 101 of the printer and is fixedly disposed, so that a user does not have to directly check the installation of the photoreceptor web 102.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      When the belt removing cartridge 120 is fixedly installed, the first switch 151 is accommodated in the first groove 123a and the second switch 151 is depressed by the open end portion of the belt removing cartridge 120.
      <br/>
      Thus, the installed state of the belt removing cartridge 120 is recognized.
      <br/>
      When it is recognized that the belt removing cartridge 120 is inserted in the main body 101, as shown in FIG. 8, the mobile bracket 117 is moved toward the second position B by using the driving device to lessen the tension of the photoreceptor web 102.
      <br/>
      Then, the hook member 141 is pushed to the second position B by the mobile bracket 117.
      <br/>
      Thus, the first elastic hook 141a is released from the first locking hole 121a.
      <br/>
      Then, the photoreceptor web 102 is free from the roller unit 110 and is clamped by the clamping device 125 in the belt removing cartridge 120 so as to be confined by the belt removing cartridge 120.
      <br/>
      Hence, when the belt removing cartridge 120 is moved as indicated by an imaginary line, the photoreceptor web 102 is removed from the roller unit 110.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Next, a new photoreceptor web 104 is installed on the roller unit 110, as shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      To install the new photoreceptor web 104, when the hook member 141 is pushed by the mobile bracket 117 to the second position B, the belt installation cartridge 130 accommodating the new photoreceptor web 104 is gradually inserted into the main body 101 of the printer such that the second groove 133a corresponds to the second switch 153.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      When the belt installation cartridge 130 is inserted a certain distance, the second elastic hook 141b is pressed by the edge portion of the second locking hole 131a and is elastically deformed.
      <br/>
      As the belt installation cartridge 130 is further inserted, the second elastic hook 141b passes through the second locking hole 131a and then is elastically restored.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 10, the second elastic hook 141b is thus locked to the second locking hole 131a so that the belt installation cartridge 130 is fixed on the main body 101 of the printer.
      <br/>
      The first switch 151 is pressed, and thus switched, by the open end portion of the belt installation cartridge 130 so that the insertion of the belt installation cartridge 130 is recognized.
      <br/>
      When the driving device is driven according to the recognition information, the mobile bracket 117 is moved to the first position A and the new photoreceptor web 104 is tensioned.
      <br/>
      Thus, the photoreceptor web 104 is supported by the support rollers 111 and the tension roller 112, and is confined by the roller unit 110.
      <br/>
      While being separated from the mobile bracket 117, the hook member 141 returns to the first position A by a pressing force of the first pressing spring 145 so that the second elastic hook 141b is released from the second locking hole 131a.
      <br/>
      In this state, as shown in FIG. 11, when the belt installation cartridge 130 is moved to the position indicated by an imaginary line out of the main body 101 of the printer, the new photoreceptor web 104 is separated from the belt installation cartridge 130 and remains in the roller unit 110.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      As described above, in the photoreceptor web installation/releasing apparatus according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the type of belt cartridges 120 and 130 inserted in the main body 101 of the printer is recognized and the two belt cartridges 120 and 130 can be selectively locked in the main body of the printer.
      <br/>
      Thus, the installation state of the belt cartridge need not be checked each time.
      <br/>
      Also, the belt cartridges 120 and 130 are prevented from being incorrectly installed on the roller unit 110.
    </p>
    <p num="24">It is contemplated that numerous modifications may be made to the photoreceptor web installation/releasing apparatus of the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.</p>
