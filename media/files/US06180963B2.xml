    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Technical Field
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to light emitting diodes (LED) and more particularly, to devices having the inorganic thin film structure that an inorganic fluorescent substance between a pair of electrodes emits light.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In recent years, light emitting devices have made a great advance.
      <br/>
      In particular, active research and development efforts are made on the following two subjects.
      <br/>
      The first relates to light emitting diodes (LED) and laser diodes (LD) relying as the basic principle on the injection and radiative recombination of electrons and holes across a semiconductor pn junction.
      <br/>
      The second relates to organic electroluminescent (EL) cells relying on the basic principle that an organic thin film serving as a light emitting layer is stacked along with electron transporting and hole transporting organic substances to accomplish injection and radiative recombination of electrons and holes similar to the semiconductor pn junction.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The LED and LD have long been studied while the research of GaN and ZnSe systems has marked a great advance in recent years.
      <br/>
      As shown in Nikkei Electronics, No. 674, page 79 (1996), for example, LEDs including a layered structure of such nitride semiconductor layers and emitting blue, green or similar light of short wavelength have already been developed.
      <br/>
      At present, reports relating to LD are also found though they are at an experimental phase.
      <br/>
      The reason why the LED and LD required a long time of development is that wide gap semiconductor materials such as GaN and ZnSe were easy to form n-type semiconductors, but difficult to form p-type semiconductors.
      <br/>
      With the progress of their crystal growth technology, the successful manufacture of p-type semiconductors was reported in recent years, which encouraged a rapid advance to realize LED and then LD.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      However, LED and LD are difficult to apply as surface-emitting devices.
      <br/>
      Even if surface-emitting devices can be constructed, they become very expensive, suffering from a disadvantage from the price viewpoint.
      <br/>
      In the mass manufacture of blue-emitting devices, the crystal growth conditions, equipment, and single crystal substrates used are undesirably very costly as compared with red LEDs.
      <br/>
      It is currently believed that the market of blue-emitting devices expands 5 times if their cost is reduced to one half.
      <br/>
      It is urgently demanded to reduce the cost and improve the production yield of the relevant technology.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      On the other hand, the organic EL devices can be formed on glass to a large area, on account of which research and development efforts have been made thereon to realize displays.
      <br/>
      In general, organic EL devices have a basic configuration constructed by forming a transparent electrode of ITO etc. on a glass substrate, stacking thereon a hole injecting and transporting layer of an organic amine compound and a light emitting layer of an organic substance exhibiting electron conductivity and intense light emission such as Alq3, and further forming an electrode of a low work function metal such as MgAg,
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The device configurations which have been reported thus far have one or more organic compound layers interposed between a hole injecting electrode and an electron injecting electrode.
      <br/>
      The organic compound layers are typically of two- or three-layer structure.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In either structure, however, an unstable metal material having a low work function must be used as one of the electrodes (usually on the electron injecting side).
      <br/>
      None of the devices available thus far are satisfactory in device lifetime, luminous efficiency, ease of production, production cost, ease of handling and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Since electroluminescent (EL) devices are light emitting devices having a thin fluorescent substance layer sandwiched between dielectric layers, they have several features including ease of handling of inorganic material, a wide angle of view, and a long lifetime.
      <br/>
      Further development of the device is expected.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      However, since the luminous wavelength of the fluorescent substance used in EL is limited, the luminous wavelength band of EL devices is restricted, leaving the problem that a full color display and a specific color cannot be obtained.
      <br/>
      Inorganic fluorescent materials are difficult to provide a sufficient luminous efficiency, which becomes a serious obstacle to increasing the emission luminance and reducing the power consumption of devices.
      <br/>
      Further, the difficult adjustment of a fluorescent material makes difficult the representation of a subtle color and the application to large-area displays.
    </p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="34">
      The light emitting diode of the invention has a positive electrode, a negative electrode, an inorganic light emitting layer disposed between the electrodes exhibiting at least electroluminescence, a high resistance inorganic electron injecting and transporting layer disposed between the inorganic light emitting layer and the negative electrode, capable of blocking holes and having conduction paths for carrying electrons, and an inorganic hole injecting and transporting layer disposed between the inorganic light emitting layer and the positive electrode.
      <br/>
      The inorganic hole injecting and transporting layer is a high resistance inorganic hole injecting and transporting layer capable of blocking electrons and having conduction paths for carrying holes.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      By disposing an electroluminescent inorganic light emitting layer between a high resistance inorganic electron injecting and transporting layer having an electron injecting and transporting function and a high resistance inorganic hole injecting and transporting layer having a hole injecting and transporting function in this way, an LED applicable to a large-area display at a low cost can be constructed.
      <br/>
      Since its manufacture by thin film-forming steps is possible, there is available a display having a high degree of freedom in the design of a display surface shape, a thin wall and a long lifetime.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The negative electrode (or electron injecting electrode) is preferably formed of materials having a low work function, for example, metal elements such as K, Li, Na, Mg, La, Ce, Ca, Sr, Ba, Al, Ag, In, Sn, Zn, and Zr, and binary or ternary alloys containing such metal elements for stability improvement, and oxides of these metal elements.
      <br/>
      Also useful are oxides and fluorides of alkali metal elements such as Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs.
      <br/>
      Exemplary alloys include Ag--Mg (Ag: 0.1 to 50 at %), Al--Li (Li: 0.01 to 12 at %), In--Mg (Mg: 50 to 80 at %), and Al--Ca (Ca: 0.01 to 20 at %).
      <br/>
      A thin film of one of these materials or a multilayer thin film of two or more of these materials may be used as the electron injecting electrode layer.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The negative electrode (or electron injecting electrode) thin film may have at least a sufficient thickness to effect electron injection, for example, a thickness of at least 0.1 nm, preferably at least 0.5 nm, more preferably at least 1 nm.
      <br/>
      Although the upper limit is not critical, the film thickness is typically about 1 to about 500 nm.
      <br/>
      On the negative electrode, an auxiliary or protective electrode may be provided.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The auxiliary electrode may have at least a sufficient thickness to ensure efficient electron injection and prevent the ingress of moisture, oxygen and organic solvents, for example, a thickness of at least 50 nm, preferably at least 100 nm, more preferably 100 to 500 nm.
      <br/>
      A too thin auxiliary electrode layer would exert its effect little, lose a step coverage capability, and provide insufficient connection to a terminal electrode.
      <br/>
      If too thick, greater stresses are generated in the auxiliary electrode layer, bringing about a detrimental effect such as the accelerated growth rate of dark spots.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      For the auxiliary electrode, an appropriate material may be chosen in consideration of the material of the electron injecting electrode to be combined therewith.
      <br/>
      For example, low resistivity metals such as aluminum may be used when electron injection efficiency is of importance.
      <br/>
      Metal compounds such as TiN may be used when sealing is of importance.
    </p>
    <p num="40">The thickness of the negative electrode and the auxiliary electrode combined is usually about 50 to about 500 nm though it is not critical.</p>
    <p num="41">
      For the positive electrode (or hole injecting electrode), materials capable of effectively injecting holes into the high resistance inorganic hole injecting and transporting layer are preferred, with those materials having a work function of 4.5 to 5.5 eV being especially preferred.
      <br/>
      Useful are compositions based on tin-doped indium oxide (ITO), zinc-doped indium oxide (IZO), indium oxide (In2 O3), tin oxide (SnO2) or zinc oxide (ZnO).
      <br/>
      These oxides may deviate more or less from their stoichiometric compositions.
      <br/>
      An appropriate proportion of SnO2 mixed with In2 O3 is about 1 to 20%, more preferably about 5 to 12% by weight.
      <br/>
      For IZO, an appropriate proportion of ZnO mixed with In2 O3 is about 12 to 32% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The positive electrode (or hole injecting electrode) may further contain silicon oxide (SiO2) for adjusting the work function.
      <br/>
      The content of silicon oxide (SiO2) is preferably about 0.5 to 10% as expressed in mol percent of SiO2 based on ITO.
      <br/>
      The work function of ITO is increased by incorporating SiO2.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The electrode on the light output side should preferably have a light transmittance of at least 50%, more preferably at least 80%, further preferably at least 90% in the light emission band, typically from 400 to 700 nm, and especially at each light emission.
      <br/>
      With a lower transmittance, the light emitted by the light emitting layer is attenuated through the electrode, failing to provide a luminance necessary as a light emitting device.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Preferably the electrode has a thickness of 50 to 500 nm, especially 50 to 300 nm.
      <br/>
      Although the upper limit of the electrode thickness is not critical, a too thick electrode would cause a drop of transmittance and separation.
      <br/>
      Too thin an electrode is insufficient for its effect and low in film strength during fabrication.
    </p>
    <p num="45">The light emitting diode of the invention has a high resistance inorganic electron injecting and transporting layer between the inorganic light emitting layer and the negative electrode.</p>
    <p num="46">By disposing a high resistance inorganic electron injecting and transporting layer having electron conduction paths and capable of blocking holes between the inorganic light emitting layer and the negative electrode in this way, there are obtained advantages including efficient injection of electrons into the inorganic light emitting layer, improved luminous efficiency, and a low drive voltage.</p>
    <p num="47">
      Preferably the second component is contained in the high resistance inorganic electron injecting and transporting layer in an amount of 0.2 to 40 mol % based on the entire components to form conduction paths, permitting electrons to be efficiently injected from the negative electrode (or electron injecting electrode) into the organic layer on the light emitting layer side.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the motion of holes from the inorganic light emitting layer to the electron injecting electrode side can be restrained, achieving efficient recombination of holes and electrons in the inorganic light emitting layer.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The light emitting diode of the invention provides a luminance equal to or greater than prior art organic EL devices and LEDs and have higher heat resistance and weather resistance so that it has a longer lifetime than the prior art devices and is devoid of current leakage or dark spots.
      <br/>
      Since an inorganic material which is inexpensive, readily available and easy to fabricate is used rather than a relatively expensive organic material, the manufacturing cost can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The high resistance inorganic electron injecting and transporting layer preferably has a resistivity of 1 to 1 * 1011 OMEGA -cm and especially 1 * 103 to 1 * 108 OMEGA -cm.
      <br/>
      The resistivity of the high resistance inorganic electron injecting and transporting layer selected within the range permits the electron injection efficiency to be drastically improved while maintaining high electron blockage.
      <br/>
      The resistivity of the high resistance inorganic electron injecting and transporting layer may also be determined from a sheet resistance and a film thickness.
    </p>
    <p num="50">Preferably the high resistance inorganic electron injecting and transporting layer contains as a first component,</p>
    <p num="51">
