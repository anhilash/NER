      The compound of formula III is prepared from the corresponding compound of formula II by reduction in the presence of iron and an organic solvent under acidic conditions.
      <br/>
      The organic solvent is a C1 --C6 alcohol, such as ethanol, or an ether such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), and preferably, an alcohol.
      <br/>
      The acidic conditions are obtained by use of a mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid, or an organic acid, such as acetic acid (AcOH).
      <br/>
      Acetic acid is preferred since it generally results in increased yields.

    <p num="33">
      The compound of formula III may then be isolated from the reaction mixture or may be reacted further in situ, without isolation from the reaction mixture.
      <br/>
      In either case, the further processing is by acylation with an acylating agent of the formula R2 C(O)X to form the compound of formula I. The leaving group X is conveniently a halogen, such as chloro, or the acetoxy group.
      <br/>
      If the compound of formula III is first isolated, then the acylation may be conducted under conventional acylating conditions, for instance, in the presence of an organic solvent of the type discussed above.
