    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a process for preparing diltiazem, and novel intermediates for use in that process, and to their preparation.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">Diltiazem, is a compound of the type of formula (VI)  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="4">More specifically, Diltiazem is (2S-cis)-3-(acyloxy)-5-�2-(dimethylamino)ethyl�-2,3-dihydro-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1.,5-benzothiazepin-4(5H)-one of the formula  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="5">
      Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker with coronary vasodilating, antihypertensive, and psychotropic activity.
      <br/>
      Vasodilating action is specific for the  ALPHA -cis-isomer.
      <br/>
      Diltiazem is the highest selling chiral cardiac prescription drug which is synthesized by resolution methods.
      <br/>
      A number of methods for its resolution are known in the literature.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A few chiral syntheses of diltiazem are known and some of these are described below.
      <br/>
      One process for the preparation of Diltiazem involves resolution of the key intermediate ( ALPHA S, BETA S)- BETA �(2-aminophenyl)thio�- ALPHA -hydroxy- BETA -(4-methoxyphenyl) propanoic acid alkyl ester of formula (V).  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)

    </p>
    <p num="8">More recently, optically active trans-phenylglycidic acid esters were prepared using a stoichiometric amount of a chiral auxiliary followed by a stereoselective opening of the epoxide by various substituted aminothiophenol to give the desired intermediate ester of formula (V) as described by Schwartz. A.; Madan, P. B.; Monacsi, E: O'Brien, J. P.; Todaro, L. J.; Coffen, D. L., in J. Org. Chem 1992, Vol. 57, P. 851.</p>
    <p num="9">Alternatively, a stereoselective Michael addition to an ( ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated carbonyl compound leading to the derivative of formula (V) has been reported by Miyata, O.; Shinada, T.; Ninomiya, 1; Nsito, T., in Tetrahedron Lett. 1991, Vol. 32, P. 3519. The compound of formula (V) was converted into Diltiazem of formula (VI) in four steps:</p>
    <p num="10">
      (i) Hydrolysis of the ester to free carboxylic acid.
      <br/>
      (ii) Cyclizing the free carboxylic acid to (2S-cis)-(3-hydroxy)2,3-dihydro-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,5-benzothiazepine-4(5H)-one.
      <br/>
      (iii) Acetylating the benzothiazepinone with acetic anhydride and pyridine to (2S-cis)-3-(acetyloxy)-2,3-dihydro-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,5-benzothiazepine-4(5H)-one.
      <br/>
      (iv) Converting the benzothiazepinone from step (iii) to Diltiazem of formula (VI) by treating it with a N, N-dialkyl alkyl halide in presence of a suitable base and a suitable solvent.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      All the above procedures have one or more drawbacks:
      <br/>
      (i) They involve resolution of either the key intermediate of formula (V) or of the final product Diltiazem of formula (VI).
      <br/>
      (ii) In most of the known stereochemical syntheses, a chiral auxiliary is used in stoichiometric amount.
      <br/>
      (iii) cis-p-methoxycinnamyl esters are prepared in several steps and it is uneconomical to get them in their stereomerically pure form.
      <br/>
      (iv) Asymmetric epoxidation of cis-p-methoxycinnamyl esters involves expensive chiral auxiliaries and even catalytic method of synthesizing these epoxides requires at least 20% of the catalyst.
      <br/>
      (v) When trans-p-methoxycinnamyl esters are used, they are converted into epoxides with a stoichiometric amount of a chiral auxiliary, and upon nucleophilic opening with 2-aminothiophenol or 2-nitrothiophenol the epoxides produce both desired and undesired intermediates of formula (V).
      <br/>
      (vi) In the synthesis using trans-p-methoxycinnamyl esters, the esters, are first dihydroxylated to furnish a diol of formula (III)  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)
      <br/>
      wherein R1 is a methoxy, and R an ethyl residue.
      <br/>
      The diol of formula (III) is then transformed to a cis-epoxide in two steps.
      <br/>
      The cis-epoxide then undergoes nucleophilic ring opening to produces the desired intermediate of formula (V).
