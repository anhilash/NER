      Technical Field

    <p num="3">The invention is related to new chemical compounds, in particular to phosphorus containing cytisine derivatives showing their hepatoprotective and antienzyme activities.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">It is known that alkaloid cytisine (1) extracted firstly from the seeds of broom and thermopsis is now widely used in the medical practice in a state of 0.15% water solution (cytiton) as an analeptic agent (Mashkovsky, M. D., "Medicine remedies", M., 1977, v.1, p.123).  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="6">
      A typical property of cytisine is its ability to arouse breathing that is connected with refectory stimulation of breathing center by intensified impulses coming from carotid balls.
      <br/>
      Simultaneous stimulation of sympathetic knots and adrenal glands leads to the rise of arterial pressure.
      <br/>
      In this connection, cytisine is recommended to be used in case of the stopping of breathing and heart activity at intoxication.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Cytisine is widespread in nature.
      <br/>
      It has been found in many plants and its extraction from a plant raw material by an ion exchange method is the main industrial way to obtain cytisine.

    <p num="9">Authors have shown that all synthesized compounds have the irreversible inhibiting activity in a case of acetylcholinesterase and display the effect of selective inhibition of the butyrylcholinesterase catalytic activity.</p>
    <p num="10">Authors are aware of no evidences of other phosphorus containing cytisine derivatives in literature.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">In connection with that the initial cytisine alkaloid displays considerable biological activity, one can assume that other phosphorus containing cytisine derivatives will also be of interest from this point of view.</p>
    <p num="12">An object of the present invention is to obtain new phosphorus containing cytisine derivatives that in particular have increased biological activity.</p>

      The synthesis of O,O-dialkyl-N-cytisinylthiophosphates (n=0, X=S, compounds 5a-e) was carried out in two stages.

Science, 1983, p.85), the interaction being performed in the benzene medium in the flow of dry argon and in the presence of triethylamine, an intermediate 0,0-dialkyl-N-cytisinylphosphite is formed that then reacts with an equimolar amount of elementary sulfur giving O,O-dialkyl-N-cytisinylthiophosphate.

    <p num="63">II. The study of antienzyme activity.</p>
    <p num="64">
      Upon investigating antienzyme activity of synthesized compounds, their interactions with acethylcholinestherase (ACE) and butirylcholinestherase (BCE) were studied.
      <br/>
      ACE from human blood erythrocytes with specific activity of 1.2 Unit/mg and BCE from horse blood serum with specific activity of 9,6 Unit/mg were used.
      <br/>
      The ACE and BCE activities were determined by the Ellman calorimetric method at 25 (degree)  C. in a 0.2M Na-phosphate buffer, pH=7.5. Acethylthiocholine iodide of the Czechoslovak company "Chemapol" was used as a substrate.
      <br/>
      Efficiency of reversible inhibitors was determined by the method of A.P. Brestkin and characterized by the value of a generalized inhibitory constant (Ki +L ) that at the mixed type of inhibition is related to competitive (Ki) and competitiveless (K1i) components with the equation:
      <br/>
      1/Ki =1/Ki +1/K1i
    </p>
    <p num="65">Activity of P450 cytochrome was determined by two methods: by the rate of hydroxylation of 3.4-benz/a/pyrene, by means of fluorimetric determination of 4-hydroxybenz/a/pyrene that was being formed, and by the rate of diethylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin by using of fluorimetric determination of 7-hydroxycoumarin that was being formed.</p>
    <p num="66">Inhibiting influence of the substances under the study on P450 cythochrome was estimated by values pJ50 that are inverse logarithms of the agent concentration causing decrease of the activity by 50%.</p>
    <p num="67">
      It has been found that cytisinylphosphates and cytisinylthiophosphates are ACE inhibitors of medium power and quite effective BCE inhibitors.
      <br/>
      The most selectivity relative to BCE was observed for thiophosphate derivatives (pK1=6.7 and pK1=6.1, correspondingly).
    </p>
    <p num="68">Also revealed were power inhibitors of p450 cythochrome that are promising for practical application, the compounds with pJ50 =5.55 and pJ50 =5.70 being among them.</p>
