    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a novel compound for photography oxidatively releasing a development inhibitor in a development process, and more particularly to a compound for a silver halide color photographic material having an improved interimage effect and an improved sharpness.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      It is known that by color developing a silver halide color photographic material, dyes such as indophenol, indoaniline, indamine, azomethine, phenoxazin, phenazine, and dyes similar to the above-described dyes are formed by the reaction of an oxidized aromatic primary amino color developing agent and couplers to form color images.
      <br/>
      In the system, for the color reproduction, a subtractive color process is usually used and for the process, silver halide emulsions selectively having sensitivities to blue, green and red respectively and color image-forming agents of yellow, magenta, and cyan each of which is in a complementary color relation with each of the above-described silver halide emulsions are used.
      <br/>
      That is, to form yellow color images, for example, acylacetanilide series or dibenzoylmethane series couplers are used, to form magenta color images, for example, pyrazolone series, pyrazolotriazole series, pyrazolobenzimidazole series, pyrazolopyrazole series, cyanoacetophnenone series, or indazolone series couplers are mainly used, and to form cyan color images, for example, phenol series or naphthol series couplers are used.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Now, each of the dyes formed from these couplers does not have an ideal absorption spectrum, in particular, the magenta and cyan dyes each has a broad absorption spectrum and/or has a side absorption in a short wavelength region, which are undesirable for color reproduction of color photographic materials.
      <br/>
      In particular, the side absorption in a short wavelength region has a tendency of lowering the saturation.
      <br/>
      As one means for improving the fault, it can be improved to some extent by causing an interimage effect.
    </p>
    <p num="4">The interimage effect is described, for example, in Hanson et al, Journal of the Optical Society of America, Vol. 42, pages 663 to 669 and A. Theils, Zeitschrift fur Wissenschftliche Photographie, Photophysigue und Photochemie, Vol. 47, pages 106 to 118 and pages 246 to 255.</p>
    <p num="5">It is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,536,386 and 3,536,487 and JP-B-48-34169 (the term "JP-B" as used herein means an "examined Japanese patent publication") that the interimage effect is obtained by using 4-thiazoline-2-thione compounds.</p>
    <p num="6">
      However, when each of these compounds is mixed with a silver halide emulsion for coating, after preparing the coating composition containing them, the compound causes a bad action with the passage of time and also when the silver halide light-sensitive material is used after storing the light-sensitive material for a long period of time, there occurs a problem of lowering the sensitivity, etc.
      <br/>
      When the compound is added to a layer containing substantially no silver halide emulsion adjacent to a silver halide emulsion layer, the above-described problem cannot be avoided.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      On the other hand, a means of releasing a compound of emphasizing the interimage effect by the oxidation during the development process by using a DIR hydroquinone is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,379,529, 3,620,746, 4,377,634, and 4,332,878 and JP-A-6-308689 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application").
      <br/>
      By these means, the occurrence of the above-described bad action after preparing the coating solution and the problem of causing lowering of the sensitivity after storing the light-sensitive material for a long period of time, which material is prepared by coating the coating solution are reduced and the interimage effect is obtained but these improvements are yet insufficient.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a compound for photography for offering a silver halide color photographic material giving an excellent sharpness without reducing other photographic properties.</p>

    <p num="81">
      The dye E-1 was dispersed by the following method.
      <br/>
      That is, water and 200 g of Pluronic F88 (ethylene oxidepropylene oxide block copolymer) made by BASF A.G. were added to 1430 g of a wett cake of a dye containing 30% of methanol followed by stirring to form a slurry having a dye concentration of 6%.
      <br/>
      Then, in a ultraviscomill (UVM-2) (trade name, manufactured by Aimex Co.) were filled 1700 ml of zirconia beads having an average particle diameter of 0.5 mm and the above-described slurry was passed therethrough and ground for 8 hours at the circumference speed of about 10 meters/second and at a jetting amount of 0.5 liter/minute.
      <br/>
      The beads were removed by filtration and after adding water to the filtrate to dilute at a dye concentration of 3%, the filtrate was heated for 10 hours at 90 (degree)  C. for the stabilization.
      <br/>
      The average particle diameter of the fine dye particles obtained was 0.60  MU m and the distribution width of the particle diameters (particle diameter standard deviation * 100/average particle diameter) was 18%.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Similarly, the solid dispersions of the dye E-2 and the dye E-3 respectively were obtained.

    <p num="92">
      Comparative Compounds A, B and C and the compounds of the present invention each was dissolved in four times of tricyclohexyl phosphate, two times of high-boiling organic solvent Oil-3, four times of ethyl acetate, 0.1 times of di-t-octylhydroquinone and two times of U-6, as much as the weight of the compound, under heating.
      <br/>
      An oily phase component on the solution was added to eight times of aqueous phase component (having a gelatin concentration of 10%, and containing surface active agents W-5 and W-3 each at a concentration of 0.1%) as much as the weight of the oily phase component and the mixture was stirred with maintaining the mixture at a temperature of 50 (degree)  C. to obtain an emulsified dispersion.

      Evaluation of samples:
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      After exposing each of the samples 101 to 118 to while light through a continuous wedge, the sample was subjected to the photographic processing described below and image densities obtained were measured.
      <br/>
      The sensitivities were obtained from the reciprocals of the exposure amounts giving the density of 1.0 about the cyan, magenta, and yellow color image densities of each sample as relative sensitivities to those of the sample 101 taken as 100, respectively and shown as the red sensitivity (S(R)), the green sensitivity (S(G)), and the blue sensitivity (S(B)).
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      Then, each of the samples 101 to 118 was exposed to a red light of the same exposure amount as the red light exposure amount at the above-described white light exposure through the same continuous wedge as the white light exposure and subjected to the photographic processing described below. the difference in the logarithmic values of the exposure amounts � DELTA logE(R)� in the cyan density of 1.0 at the white light exposure and the red light exposure was determined, which was defined as the measure for the interimage effect for the red-sensitive emulsion layer.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the measures  DELTA logE(G) and  DELTA logE(B) of the interimage effect for the green-sensitive emulsion layer and the blue-sensitive emulsion layer were determined.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      Furthermore, each of the samples 101 to 118 was exposed to a white light through a MTF pattern and subjected to the photographic processing described below.

    <p num="117">(Effect 2 as photographic additive)</p>
    <p num="118">1) Support</p>
    <p num="119">
      The support used in Example 3 of the present invention was prepared by the following method. 250 (degree)  After drying a mixture of 100 parts by weight of polyethylene-2,6-naphthalate polymer and 2 parts by weight of an ultraviolet absorbent, Tinuvin P.326 (trade name, made by Ciba-Geigy Corporation), the mixture was melted at 300 (degree)  C., extruded from a T-form die, subjected to a longitudinal stretch of 3.3 times at 140 (degree)  C., then subjected to a width stretch of 3.3 times at 130 (degree)  C., and further thermally fixed at 250 (degree)  C. for 6 seconds to provide a PEN film of 90  MU m in thickness.
      <br/>
      In addition, to the PEN film were added proper amounts of blue dyes, magenta dyes, and yellow dyes (I-1, I-4, I-6, I-24, I-26, I-27, and II-5 described in JIII Journal of Technical Disclosure, No. 94-6023).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the PEN film was wound round a stainless steel-made winding core having a diameter of 20 cm and a thermal history of 48 hours at 110 (degree)  C. was applied to provide a support which was hard to form curling by winding.
      <br/>
      2) Coating of underlayer
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      After applying a corona discharging treatment, a UV irradiation treatment, and further a glow discharging treatment to both surfaces of the support, a coating composition for underlayer made up of 0.1 g/m2 of gelatin, 0.01 g/m2 of sodium  ALPHA -sulfo-di-2-ethylhexylsuccinate, 0.04 g/m2 of salicylic acid, 0.2 g/m2 of p-chlorophenol, 0.012 g/m2 of (CH2.dbd.CHSO2 CH2 CH2 NHCO)2 CH2, 0.02 g/m2 of polyamido-epichlorohydrin polycondensation product, and water was coated on each surface (10 ml, using a bar coater) to form an underlayer.
      <br/>
      Drying was performed at 115 (degree)  C. for 6 minutes by passing the coated support through a drying zone. (The rollers and the conveyers of the drying zone were all kept at 115 (degree)  C.)
      <br/>
      3) Formation of back layers
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      On one surface of the above-described support thus coated with the underlayers were coated an antistatic layer, a magnetic recording layer, and a lubricating layer each having the composition described below as back layers.
      <br/>
      3-1) Formation of antistatic layer
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      An antistatic layer was formed on the surface of the underlayer formed on the surface of the support by coating a coating composition made up of 0.2 g/m2 of a dispersion (secondary aggregated particle diameters of about 0.08  MU m) of the fine particle powder of a tin oxide-antimony oxide composite having an average particle diameter of 0.005  MU m and a specific resistance of 5  OMEGA  * cm, 0.05 g/m2 of gelatin, 0.02 g/m2 of (CH2.dbd.CHSO2 CH2 CH2 NHCO)2 CH2, 0.005 g/m2 of polyoxyethylene-p-nonylphenol (polymerization degree of 10), and 0.22 g/m2 of resorcin.
      <br/>
      3-2) Formation of magnetic recording layer
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      A coating composition made up of 0.06 g/m2 of cobalt- GAMMA -iron oxide (specific surface area 43 m2 /g, long axis 0.14  MU m, short axis 0.03  MU m, saturation magnetization 89 emu/g, Fe+2 /Fe+3 =6/94, the surfaces were treated with aluminum oxide and silicon oxide of 2% by weight of the iron oxide) coated with 15% by weight 3-polyoxyethylenepropyloxytrimethoxysilane (polymerization degree 15), 1.2 g/m2 of diacetyl cellulose (the dispersion of the iron oxide was carried out by an open kneader and a sand mill), 0.3 g/m2 of C2 H5 C(CH2 OCONHC6 H3 (CH3)NCO)3 as a curing agent, and acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and cyclohexanone as solvents was coated thereon by a bar coater to form a magnetic recording layer of 1.2  MU m in thickness.
      <br/>
      Also, 10 mg/m2 of silica particles (particle diameter 0.3  MU m) and 10 mg/m2 of aluminum oxide (particle diameter 0.15  MU m) as abrasive coated with 15% by weight 3-polyoxyethylenepropyloxytrimethoxysilane (polymerization degree 15) were added to the magnetic recording layer as matting agents.
      <br/>
      Drying thereof was performed at 115 (degree)  C. for 6 minutes (the rollers and the conveyer of the drying zone were all kept at 115 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      The color density increase of DB of the magnetic recording layer with an X-Right (blue filter) was about 0.1, the saturated magnetic moment of the magnetic recording layer was 4.2 emu/g, the coercive force thereof was 7.3 * 104 A/m. and the squareness ratio thereof was 65%.
      <br/>
      3-3) Preparation of Lubricating layer
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      A mixture of 25 mg/M2 of diacetyl cellulose, 6 mg/m2 of C6 H13 CH(OH)C10 H20 COOC40 H8, (Compound a), and 9 mg/M2 of C50 H101 O(CH2 CH2 0)16 H (Compound b) was coated.
      <br/>
      In addition, the mixture was molten in xylene/propylene monomethyl ether (1/1) at 105 (degree)  C., the molten mixture was poured and dispersed in propylene monomethyl ether of a normal temperature in an amount of 10 times the amount of the molten mixture, and then after dispersing in acetone (average particle diameter 0.01  MU m), the dispersion was added.
      <br/>
      Then, 15 mg/m2 of silica particles (0.3  MU m) as a matting agent and 15 mg/m2 of aluminum oxide (0.15  MU m) coated with 15% by weight 3-polyoxyethylenepropyloxytrimethoxysilane (polymerization degree 15) as an abrasive were added to the layer.
      <br/>
      Drying was performed at 115 (degree)  C. for 6 minutes (the rollers and the conveyer in the drying zone were all kept at 115 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      The lubricating layer had excellent characteristics that the kinematic friction coefficient was 0.06 (stainless steel hard ball of 5 mm in diameter, load 100 g, and speed 6 cm/minute), the static friction coefficient was 0.07 (clip method) or the kinetic a C-friction coefficient of the lubricating layer and the emulsion surface described below was also 0.12.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      By following the same procedure as Example 2 except the above-described support was used in place of the supports for Samples 101 to 118 of Example 2, Samples 201 to 218 were prepared and evaluated.
      <br/>
      The results obtained were almost same as the results in Example 2.
