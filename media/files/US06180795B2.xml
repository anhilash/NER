      The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of N-alkyl sulfenimides.

      Sulfenimides have been used commercially as vulcanization accelerators and are said to be useful as pesticides.
      <br/>
      Sulfenimides have been made in the past by placing an N-alkyl sulfenamide in an organic solvent and converting the sulfenamide to the sulfenimide by the addition of anhydrous HCl gas.
      <br/>
      In this case, the amine hydrochloride salt is formed as a by-product.
      <br/>
      The amine hydrochloride salt is then removed by filtration or extraction and the product is isolated by crystallization and filtration.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, sulfenimides can be made from N-alkyl sulfenamides by placing the N-alkyl sulfenamide in an anhydrous organic solvent and adding an organic acid anhydride.
      <br/>
      This reaction produces the desired sulfenimide along with the free acid and the N-alkyl amide corresponding to the N-alkyl group of the starting sulfenamide and the acid anhydride used.
      <br/>
      Sulfenimides have also been made by the reaction of a sulfenyl chloride with an amine in an anhydrous solvent.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Reactions of sulfenamides with carbonyl compounds have been reported in the past.
      <br/>
      However, none of the these reactions has been found to produce a sulfenimide as the major product of the reaction.

      <br/>
      The resulting sulfenimide is isolated by crystallization, dilution, or by stripping off the solvent.

      The yields are very good.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      In the process of the present invention, a sulfenamide is converted to a sulfenimide by a reaction with an aldehyde.
      <br/>
      The process is carried out by placing an N-alkyl sulfenamide in an appropriate organic solvent, then adding a stoichiometric excess of an aldehyde, heating the mixture to boiling and removing the water formed in the reaction until the reaction is complete.
      <br/>
      The product thus formed can be isolated by filtration from the reaction mixture or by evaporation of the reaction solvent, followed by crystallization of the crude reaction product, and filtration from a suitable solvent.

      The ring may be substituted with any substituent that will not adversely affect the properties of the sulfenimide to be formed for the application to which it is to be put.

      The reaction solvents useful in the process of the present invention can be aliphatic hydrocarbons, which may be straight chain, branched chain, or cyclic; aromatic hydrocarbons, in which the aromatic ring may be substituted with alkyl groups or halogens; dialkyl ethers; or halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons.
      <br/>
      Examples of solvents that can be used include hexane, heptane, octane, isooctane, cyclohexane, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, chloroform, methylene chloride, ethylene dichloride, methyl chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, and the like.

    <p num="35">
      Processes currently known in the art typically use either anhydrous hydrogen chloride, or an acid anhydride to convert sulfenamides to sulfenimides.
      <br/>
      A by-product in the case of the anhydrous HCl is the amine hydrochloride corresponding to the sulfenamide used.
      <br/>
      In the case of the acid anhydrides, a by-product is the amide corresponding to the acid anhydride and the amine portion of the starting sulfenamide employed.
      <br/>
      Handling anhydrous HCl gas (and other strong mineral acids or acidic materials that can induce the desired transformation) is, however, a hazardous operation requiring special equipment to vaporize and transport the gas and to protect workers from the extremely corrosive and toxic material.
      <br/>
      Further, the amine hydrochloride by-product must be separated from the reaction mixture and then recovered by neutralization with a base, generating a salty waste stream.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Where acid anhydrides are employed, the reagent is of a lower order of acute toxicity but is still corrosive to bodily tissues and must be handled with care.
      <br/>
      Again, the by-product amides must be hydrolyzed with acid or base to regenerate the amine, leaving the acid as a waste stream that must be discarded or subjected to further processing to regenerate the anhydride.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      It is an advantage of the present invention that the aldehydes used as one of the reactants are not corrosive, as are the acids and acid anhydrides used in the prior art.
      <br/>
      Thus, they are easier to handle in a manufacturing environment and are noncorrosive to most commonly used metal equipment.
      <br/>
      A by-product of the reaction of the present invention is the imine corresponding to the amine of the sulfenamide and the aldehyde starting materials employed.
      <br/>
      This by-product is easy to wash off the product and can easily be reconverted back to the starting aldehyde and the amine by simply boiling the by-product with water and a small amount of acid as a catalyst.
      <br/>
      The raw materials may then be isolated by a simple distillation.
      <br/>
      The amine thus generated can be used to produce more of the starting sulfenamide and the aldehyde can be recycled to produce more sulfenimide.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the process of the present invention advantageously produces very little in the way of waste that must be discarded.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In greater detail, to prepare sulfenimides according to the process of the present invention, the sulfenamide used as the starting material is placed in a reaction vessel equipped with an overhead condenser along with a solvent that is inert with respect to all the reactants.
      <br/>
      The vessel must be able to be heated to the boiling point of the solvent employed, and arranged so that the water produced in the reaction may be separated from the liquid as it refluxes.
      <br/>
      The concentration of the starting sulfenamide is chosen so that the reaction mixture can be stirred and so that the slurry of the final product in the reaction mixture will be fluid enough to permit easy processing.
      <br/>
      In practice, the concentration of starting sulfenamide in the solvent will be generally less than 50 weight percent.
      <br/>
      The aldehyde is added to the mixture of sulfenamide and solvent.
      <br/>
      The mole ratio of aldehyde to the starting sulfenamide must be at least 0.5:1.0, and preferably should be at least 0.75:1.0 or more.
      <br/>
      However, a molar ratio greater than 1.5:1.0 has no beneficial effect and may hinder the isolation of the final product.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture is then heated and stirred until it boils and distillate collects in the overhead condenser.
      <br/>
      Water is separated from the refluxing liquid, and the dry condensate may be returned to the reaction.
      <br/>
      This refluxing process is continued until no more water separates from the refluxing liquid, or until chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture shows that the reaction is complete.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture is then cooled to near ambient temperature, whereupon the sulfenimide product crystallizes and can then be isolated by filtration and dried.

    <p num="39">
      The rate and extent of the reaction can be improved by the addition of a small amount of an acid catalyst at the start of the reaction.
      <br/>
      The acid catalyst can be a strong Lewis acid, such as anhydrous aluminum trichloride, or a weak organic acid, such as benzoic acid.
      <br/>
      Strong acids are known to react with sulfenamides to form sulfenimides when used in stoichiometric equivalent amounts, but in the practice of the present invention, much smaller amounts, about one weight percent of the reagents, are effective in accelerating the rate of the reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Other materials can also accelerate the rate of the transformation.
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, the addition of a quantity of anhydrous calcium chloride will accelerate the reaction nearly as well as the addition of an acid.
      <br/>
      As little as one percent by weight of calcium chloride has a noticeable effect.
      <br/>
      The degree of enhancement increases as the loading of calcium chloride increases.
      <br/>
      The rate enhancement is not due simply to the desiccant property of the anhydrous salt, since the water evolved in the reaction still collects with the distillate; and in a comparative reaction, the addition of a different drying agent, anhydrous sodium sulfate, had no effect on the reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="41">When an inorganic solid, such as calcium chloride, is used, the reaction mixture may be filtered while it is still hot and the product is in solution, in order to remove the salt so that it will not contaminate the organic product.</p>
    <p num="42">The advantages and important features of the present invention will be more apparent from the following examples.</p>
    <p num="43">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="44">Preparation of N-cyclohexyl bis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimide using benzaldehyde</p>
    <p num="45">
      A glass reaction flask was assembled with a mechanical paddle stirrer, a Dean-Stark trap with a water-cooled condenser arranged for reflux, a thermocouple, and an electric heating mantle.
      <br/>
      The flask was charged with 52.6 grams of N-cyclohexyl 2-benzothiazolylsulfenamide, 150 mL of heptane, and 21.2 grams of benzaldehyde.
      <br/>
      The mixture was stirred and heated to the boiling point.
      <br/>
      As the mixture boiled and the reaction progressed, water collected in the bottom of the Dean-Stark trap.
      <br/>
      The extent of the reaction was determined by measuring the amount of water collected in the trap and by periodically removing small samples of the reaction solution for analysis by high performance liquid chromatography.
      <br/>
      The process continued until approximately 95 percent of the starting sulfenamide was converted to the desired sulfenimide.
      <br/>
      This required 11 hours.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was cooled to ambient temperature, and the product formed a crystalline precipitate.
      <br/>
      The solid product was filtered and washed with a quantity of fresh heptane and thoroughly dried.
