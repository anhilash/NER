      An input buffer of a semiconductor device is provided.A first voltage shift circuit converts an input signal formed of a low amplitude logic signal overlapping 1.65V or 2.9V to a first signal formed of a complimentary signal formed of the low amplitude logic signal overlapping 2.9V or 1.65V.
      <br/>
      A second voltage shift circuit converts a reference potential of 1.65V or 2.9V to a second signal of 2.9V or 1.65V.
      <br/>
      A differential amplifier compares the reference potential with the input signal when the reference potential is 1.65V, and compares the first signal and the second signal when the reference potential is 2.9V.
      <br/>
      The input buffer thus operates normally whichever of 1.65V and 2.9V is the reference potential.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an input buffer of a semiconductor device, and in particular, relates to an input buffer of a semiconductor device which compares an external reference potential with an external signal and supplies an internal signal to an internal circuit according to the result of the comparison.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The recent increase in speed of the microprocessors accompanies the increase in the memory speed.
      <br/>
      Regarding data transmission between devices, a conventional interface of TTL (Transistor Transistor Logic) type has a limit on speed.
      <br/>
      Although the TTL type interface has no problem when the operating frequency is low, the overshoot and undershoot of an output signal becomes conspicuous when the operating frequency increases.
      <br/>
      Further, in the bus transmission system, irregularity of a signal due to reflection is a critical problem.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a high speed interface in which the amplitude of a signal is decreased is put into practical use.

      Both gates of P channel MOS transistors 101 and 102 are connected to the drain (node N101) of P channel MOS transistor 101.

      In the SSTL-- 3 interface, the smaller amplitude of the potential of signal transmission line 94 enables high speed transmission of the signal.

      In addition, the alternating current component of the consumption power can be reduced.
      <br/>
      The reduced consumption power of output buffer 91 allows output buffer 91 to be easily integrated.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      A problem which arises in this case is as follows.
      <br/>
      In the SSTL-- 3 interface, the potential of signal transmission line 94 needs to be maintained at terminal potential Vtt, and consumption power for generating terminal potential Vtt from power supply potential Vdd (=Vdd/2) is required, resulting in increased consumption power in the entire system.
      <br/>
      This problem is especially critical in the system such as a portable device which is driven by a battery.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      According to a proposed method, terminal potential Vtt is set at power supply potential Vdd (3.3V), reference potential VR is set at 2.9V, and input signal VI is oscillated between 2.9+0.4V and 2.9-0.4V as shown in FIG. 15. This method does not require the consumption power for generating terminal potential Vtt, so that the consumption power in the entire system is reduced.
      <br/>
      However, this method is not applicable to high speed operation since terminal potential Vtt is not equal to reference potential VR, and variation of signal VI from "H" level to "L" level and that from "L" level to "H" level are not balanced.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Then another method is proposed.
      <br/>
      According to this method, when the system is driven by a battery, terminal potential Vtt is set at power supply potential Vdd, and priority is given to the reduction of consumption power over high speed operation.
      <br/>
      When the system is driven by the power from a socket not by a battery, terminal potential Vtt is set at an intermediate potential Vdd/2, and priority is given to the high speed operation over the reduction of consumption power.
    </p>
    <p num="20">When terminal potential Vtt is set at power supply potential Vdd, and reference potential VR is set at 2.9V in input buffer 93 of FIG. 13, the resistance value of N channel MOS transistors 103 and 104 becomes smaller compared with the case in which terminal potential Vtt is set at intermediate potential Vdd/2 and reference potential VR is set at 1.65V. As a result, the intermediate level of the logic amplitude of output signal VO becomes lower and any malfunction occurs in internal circuit 82 as shown in FIG. 16.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="21">An object of the present invention is to provide an input buffer of a semiconductor device which normally operates whichever of a first potential and a second potential is given as an external referential potential.</p>
    <p num="22">
      According to one aspect of the invention, a signal conversion circuit converts an external signal formed of a low amplitude logic signal overlapping a first potential or a second potential to a signal formed of a complimentary signal of the low amplitude logic signal overlapping the second or the first potential, and a potential conversion circuit converts the first or second potential supplied as an external reference potential to the second or the first potential.
      <br/>
      A differential amplifier constituted by the first to the fourth transistors and a current mirror circuit is structured such that it compares the external reference potential with an external signal when the reference potential is the first potential, and compares an output signal of the signal conversion circuit with an output potential of the potential conversion circuit when the reference potential is the second potential.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, whichever of the first and the second potential is the external reference potential, the device operates normally and the logic amplitude of an internal signal and its intermediate level are maintained at a constant value.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Preferably, the signal conversion circuit includes a first resistance element serially connected between lines of the first and second power supply potential, as well as a fifth transistor to which an external signal is input, and the potential conversion circuit includes a second resistance element serially connected between lines of the first and second power supply potential as well as a sixth transistor to which the external reference potential is input.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the signal conversion circuit and the potential conversion circuit can be constituted easily.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Still preferably, a seventh transistor and an eighth transistor are serially connected in parallel with the serially connected first and second transistors, and a ninth transistor and a tenth transistor are serially connected in parallel with the serially connected third and fourth transistors.
      <br/>
      Input electrodes of the first and the eighth transistors, input electrodes of the second and the seventh transistors, input electrodes of the third and the tenth transistors, and input electrodes of the fourth and the ninth transistors are connected with each other.
      <br/>
      In this case, there is no difference of operational property due to the order of connection of the first to the fourth transistors between a case in which the reference potential is the first potential and the reference potential is the second potential, and the operational property becomes still more similar.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Preferably, a line of a third power supply potential to which the current mirror circuit is connected is the line of the first power supply potential.
      <br/>
      In this case, the structure of the input buffer circuit is simplified.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Preferably, the third power supply potential is a stabilized potential between the first and second power supply potentials.
      <br/>
      A stabilized potential generating circuit is further provided for generating the stabilized potential.
      <br/>
      In this case, a stable operation is carried out even if the power supply voltage varies.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      According to another aspect of the invention, a first transistor is connected between a first node and a line of a second power supply potential, a second transistor is connected between a second node and a line of a second power supply potential, serially connected third and fourth transistors are connected in parallel with the first transistor, and serially connected fifth and sixth transistors are connected in parallel with the second transistor.
      <br/>
      An external reference potential is supplied to input electrodes of the first and the third transistors, an external signal is supplied to input electrodes of the second and the fifth transistors, and input electrodes of the fourth and the sixth transistors are connected to the first node.
      <br/>
      In this case, when the external reference potential changes from the first potential to the second potential and the potential at the first and the second nodes becomes lower, the resistance value of the fourth and the sixth transistors increases.
      <br/>
      As a result, the logic amplitude and its intermediate level of an internal signal are maintained at a constant value both in the cases in which the external reference potential is the first potential and the external reference potential is the second potential.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      According to still another aspect of the invention, a first differential amplifier which outputs an intermediate level of a logic amplitude of an internal signal when the external reference potential is the first potential, as well as a second differential amplifier which outputs an intermediate level of a logic amplitude of an internal signal when the external reference potential is the second potential.
      <br/>
      When the external reference potential is the first potential, the first differential amplifier is activated, and the second differential amplifier is activated when the external reference potential is the second potential.

    <p num="32">
      FIG. 1 is a circuit diagram illustrating an input buffer of a semiconductor integrated circuit device according to the first embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 1, the input buffer includes voltage shift circuits 1 and 2 and a differential amplifier 3.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Voltage shift circuit 1 includes a P channel MOS transistor 4 serially connected between a line of power supply potential Vdd and a line of ground potential Vss, a resistance element 5 and an N channel MOS transistor 6.
      <br/>
      The gate of P channel MOS transistor 4 receives activation signal/SEL.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, resistance element 5 is constituted by a P channel MOS transistor 17 having its gate connected to the line of ground potential Vss, or a P channel MOS transistor 18 having its gate connected to its drain.
      <br/>
      The gate of N channel MOS transistor 6 receives an input signal VI.
      <br/>
      The potential at a node N5 between resistance element 5 and N channel MOS transistor 6 is an output signal V1.
    </p>
    <p num="34">If input signal VI is the one which is formed of a low amplitude logic signal overlapping intermediate potential Vdd/2 (1.65V), resistance value of N channel MOS transistor 6 varies at a relatively high level, and output signal V1 of voltage shift circuit 1 becomes a signal formed of a complimentary signal of the low amplitude logic signal overlapping 2.9V. If input signal VI is the one formed of the low amplitude logic signal overlapping 2.9V, the resistance value of N channel MOS transistor 6 varies at a relatively lower level, and output signal V1 of voltage shift circuit 1 is the one formed of a complimentary signal of the low amplitude logic signal overlapping 1.65V.</p>
    <p num="35">
      Voltage shift circuit 2 includes a P channel MOS transistor 7 serially connected between the line of power supply potential Vdd and the line of ground potential Vss, a resistance element 8 and an N channel MOS transistor 9.
      <br/>
      The gate of P channel MOS transistor 7 receives activation signal/SEL.
      <br/>
      Resistance element 8 is structured similarly to resistance element 5.
      <br/>
      The gate of N channel MOS transistor 9 receives reference potential VR.
      <br/>
      The potential at a node N8 between resistance element 8 and N channel MOS transistor 9 is an output signal V2 of voltage shift circuit 2.
    </p>
    <p num="36">When reference potential VR is 1.65V, resistance value of N channel MOS transistor 9 becomes relatively higher, and output signal V2 of voltage shift circuit 2 becomes 2.9V. When reference potential VR is 2.9V, resistance value of N channel MOS transistor 9 becomes relatively lower, and output signal V2 of voltage shift circuit 2 becomes 1.65V.</p>
    <p num="37">
      Differential amplifier 3 includes P channel MOS transistors 10-12 and N channel MOS transistors 13-16.
      <br/>
      P channel MOS transistor 10 is connected between the line of power supply potential Vdd and a node N10, and its gate receives activation signal/SEL.
      <br/>
      MOS transistors 11, 13 and 15 and MOS transistors 12, 14 and 16 are respectively serially connected between node N10 and the line of ground potential Vss.
      <br/>
      Gates of P channel MOS transistors 11 and 12 are both connected to the drain of P channel MOS transistor 11.
      <br/>
      P channel MOS transistors 11 and 12 constitute a current mirror circuit.
      <br/>
      The gates of N channel MOS transistors 13 and 14 respectively receive reference potential VR and input signal VI.
      <br/>
      Gates of N channel MOS transistors 15 and 16 respectively receive output signals V1 and V2 of voltage shift circuits 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      N channel MOS transistors 13 and 14 and N channel MOS transistors 15 and 16 each constitutes a pair of differential transistors.
      <br/>
      The potential at a node N12 between P channel MOS transistor 12 and N channel MOS transistor 14 becomes output signal VO.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The operation of this input buffer is next described.
      <br/>
      When activation signal/SEL is at "H" level of the nonactivation level, P channel MOS transistors 4, 7 and 10 are rendered nonconductive, so that the input buffer becomes in the nonactivation state.
      <br/>
      When activation signal/SEL falls to "L" level of the activation level, P channel MOS transistors 4, 7 and 10 are rendered conductive, and the input buffer is activated.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      When terminal potential Vtt and reference potential VR are of intermediate potential Vdd/2 (1.65V) (the state of FIG. 14), levels of output signals V1 and V2 from voltage shift circuits 1 and 2 become higher, and resistance values of N channel MOS transistors 15 and 16 of differential amplifier 3 are decreased compared with those of N channel MOS transistors 13 and 14.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in differential amplifier 3, reference potential VR and input signal VI that are directly input to MOS transistors 13 and 14 are dominant over output signals V1 and V2 of voltage shift circuits 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      As a result, the operation of the input buffer is similar to the operation of the input buffer shown in FIG. 13.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      When terminal potential Vtt is equal to power supply potential Vdd (3.3V), and reference potential VR is 2.9V (the state of FIG. 15), the levels of output signals V1 and V2 of voltage shift circuits 1 and 2 become lower, and resistance values of N channel MOS transistors 13 and 14 of differential amplifier 3 become lower compared with resistance values of N channel MOS transistors 15 and 16.
      <br/>
      As a result, in differential amplifier 3, output signals V1 and V2 from voltage shift circuits 1 and 2 are dominant over reference potential VR and input signal VI directly input to MOS transistors 13 and 14.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      If input signal VI is higher than reference potential VR, the level of signal V1 becomes lower than the level of signal V2, and output signal VO becomes "L" level.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, if input signal VI is lower than reference potential VR, the level of signal V1 becomes higher than the level of signal V2, and output signal VO becomes "H" level.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the relation between input signal VI and output signal VO is similar to that in the input buffer shown in FIG. 13.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      According to this embodiment, the input buffer compares, when reference potential VR is 1.65V, reference potential VR of 1.65V with input signal VI formed of the low amplitude logic signal overlapping 1.65V, and compares, when reference potential VR is 2.9V, signal V1 formed of a complimentary signal of the low amplitude logic signal overlapping 1.65V generated in voltage shift circuit 1 with signal V2 of 1.65V generated in voltage shift circuit 2.
      <br/>
      As a result, in both of the cases when reference potential VR is 1.65V and 2.9V, the input buffer operates normally, and the logic amplitude and its intermediate level of output signal VO is maintained at a constant value.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      In the input buffer shown in FIG. 1, if external power supply potential Vdd varies, the value of the current flowing in the input buffer also varies, resulting in variation of time taken from input of input signal VI to output of output signal VO.
      <br/>
      This is not preferable since the set up time and hold time of input signal VI are increased.
      <br/>
      External power supply potential Vdd could be decreased to generate a stabilized potential and the stabilized potential could be used as a power supply potential of the input buffer.
      <br/>
      However, in the interface (see FIG. 15) having its terminal potential Vtt as power supply potential Vdd, if the stabilized potential generated by decreasing power supply potential Vdd is used as a power supply potential of the input buffer, the input buffer does not operate normally since the level of input signal VI is close to power supply potential Vdd.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      As shown in FIG. 3, external power supply potential extVdd is supplied to voltage shift circuits 1 and 2, and internal power supply potential intVdd which is the stabilized potential is supplied to differential amplifier 3.
      <br/>
      Internal power supply potential intVdd is generated by an internal power supply potential generating circuit 19 as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Internal power supply potential generating circuit 19 is formed of a known stabilized potential generating circuit, receives external power supply potential extVdd and ground potential Vss and generates internal power supply potential intVdd by decreasing external power supply potential extVdd.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the variation of the time taken from the input of input signal VI to the output of output signal VO where there is a variation of external power supply voltage extVdd is restrained.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      As shown in FIG. 5, if N channel MOS transistors 20 and 21 are serially connected between node N11 and the line of ground potential Vss, N channel MOS transistors 22 and 23 are serially connected between node N12 and ground potential Vss, and V1, VR, V2 and VI are respectively supplied to gates of N channel MOS transistors 20-23, the difference of operational property between the case in which reference potential VR is 1.65V and the case in which reference potential VR is 2.9V due to the order of connection of N channel MOS transistors 13 and 15 as well as 14 and 16 can be prevented.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 6, if internal power supply potential intVdd is supplied to differential amplifier 3 in the input buffer, the variation of the time taken from the input of input signal VI to the output of output signal VO where there is a variation of external power supply potential extVdd is restrained.
