    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE FIRST EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="3">
      A first embodiment of the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for antagonizing a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) containing a condensed-bicyclic compound comprising a homo or hetero 5 to 7-membered ring group and a homo or hetero 5 to 7-membered ring group.
      <br/>
      The first embodiment of the present invention also relates to novel condensed-ring thiophene derivatives and salts thereof.
      <br/>
      The first embodiment further relates to methods for manufacturing the novel condensed-ring thiophene derivatives and the salts thereof.

    <heading>BACKGROUND ART OF THE FIRST EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Secretion of anterior pituitary hormone undergoes the control of peripheral hormone secreted from target organs for the respective hormones and by secretion-accelerating or -inhibiting hormone from hypothalamus, which is the upper central organ of anterior lobe of pituitary (in this specification, these hormones are collectively called "hypothalamic hormone").
      <br/>
      At the present stage, as hypothalamic hormones, nine kinds of hormones including, for example, thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) or gonadotropin releasing hormone +GnRH: sometimes called as LH-RH (luteinizing hormone releasing hormone)} are confirmed their existence (cf. Seirigaku 2, compiled by M. Iriku and K. Toyama, published by Bunkohdo, p610-618, 1986).
      <br/>
      These hypothalamic hormones are assumed to show their actions via the receptor which is considered to exist in the anterior lobe of pituitary (cf. ibid), and observational studies of receptor genes specific to those hormones, including cases of human, have been developed (Receptor Kiso To Rinsho, compiled by H. Imura, et al., published by Asakura Shoten, p297-304, 1993).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, antagonists or agonists specifically and selectively acting on these receptors control the action of hypothalamic hormone and controlling the secretion of anterior pituitary hormone.
      <br/>
      As the results, they are expected to be useful for prophylactic and therapeutic agents of anterior pituitary hormone dependent diseases.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Leuprorelin acetate �Fujino et al., Biological and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol.60, 00.406-413, 1974); Oliver, R. T. D. et al., British Journal of Cancers, Vol.59, p.823, 1989; and Toguchi et al., Journal of International Medical Research, Vol.18, pp.35-41�, which is a highly potent derivative of gonadotropic hormone-releasing hormone, one of the hypothalamic hormones, (hereinafter sometimes abbreviated as GnRH) �Schally A. V. et at., Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 246, pp.7230-7236, 1971; and Burgus, R. et al., Proceeding of Natural Academic Science, USA, Vol.69, pp278-282, 1972�, by administration of multiple doses, lowers release production of gonadotropic hormone in pituitary, causing lowering of reactivity on gonadotropic hormone is spermary and ovary to suppress secretion of testosterone and estrogen.
      <br/>
      Leuprorelin acetate has, therefore, been known to show antitumor activity on such hormone-dependent cancers as exemplified by prostate cancer, and has been widely used in the clinical field.
      <br/>
      Leuprorelin acetate has been widely used clinically also as a therapeutic agent of e.g. endometriosis and precocious puberty.
      <br/>
      The high antitumor activity of leuprorelin acetate is assumed to be due to its high resistance, as compared with natural GnRH, against protease, and to high affinity to GnRH receptor causing desensitization of GnRH due to decrease in number of receptors.
      <br/>
      However, as leuprorelin acetate is an ultra-agonist on GnRH receptor, it has been known that, immediately after the first administration, a transient aggravation accompanied with the rise of serum testosterone concentration due to pituitary-gonadotropic action (acute action) is observed.
      <br/>
      Circumstances being such as above, GnRH antagonistic drugs which are expected to have substantially the same therapeutic effects as described above but not to cause the above-mentioned transient pituitary-gonadotropic action (acute action) have been desired.
      <br/>
      As compounds having such GnRH antagonistic activity, a number of compounds including, for example, derivatives of GnRH such as straight-chain peptides, (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,140,009, 5,171,835), cyclic hexapeptide derivatives �JPA S61(1986)-191698� or bicyclic peptide derivatives �Journal of medicinal chemistry, Vol.36, pp.3265-3273, 1993�. These compounds are, however, all peptides, which leave many problems including, for example, dosage forms, stability of drugs, durability of actions and stability on metabolism.
      <br/>
      For solving these problems, orally administrable GnRH antagonistic drugs, especially non-peptide ones, are strongly desired.
      <br/>
      At the present stage, however, no report on non-peptide GnRH antagonistic drugs has been made.
    </p>
    <p num="6">An object of the first embodiment of the invention lies in providing novel compounds having excellent gonadotropic hormone releasing hormone antagonistic activity as well as excellent gonadotropic hormone releasing hormone antagonistic agents.</p>

      To a solution of the compound produced in Reference Example 22 (700 mg, 1.80 mmol) in dimethylformamide (10 ml) were added potassium carbonate (372 mg, 2.70 mmol), potassium iodide (299 mg, 1.80 mmol) and 2-fluorobenzyl chloride (0.43 ml, 3.60 mmol).
      <br/>
      The mixture was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was concentrated, and the concentrate was partitioned between ethyl acetate and an aqueous sodium chloride solution.
      <br/>
      The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate.
      <br/>
      The combined extract was washed with an aqueous sodium chloride solution, which was then dried (MgSO4), followed by distilling off the solvent under reduced pressure.
      <br/>
      The residue was chromatographed on silica gel to give a white powder (500 mg, 56%), m.p. 155-158 (degree)  C.

      To a solution of the compound produced in Reference Example 25 (0.270 g, 0.47 mmol) in dimethylformamide (10 ml) were added, under ice-cooling ethyl diisopropylamine (0.12 ml, 0.710 mmol) and benzylmethyl amine (0.07 ml, 0.56 mmol).
      <br/>
      The mixture was stirred for 20 hours at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was concentrated, and the concentrate was partitioned between ethyl acetate and a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogencarbonate.
      <br/>
      The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate.
      <br/>
      Organic layers were combined and dried (MgSO4), then the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure.
      <br/>
      The residue was chromatographed on silica gel to give a colorless oil (0.297 g, 100%).
      <br/>
      To a solution of this oil in ethyl acetate was added, under ice-cooling, 1N ethereal hydrochloric acid.
      <br/>
      The mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at the same temperature.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the concentrate was crystallized from ethyl acetate--ether to give the corresponding hydrochloride (0.084 g) as white crystals.

      To a solution of the compound produced in Working Example 6 (0.245 g, 0.452 mmol) in dimethylformamide (5 ml) were added, under ice-cooling, triethylamine (0.10 ml, 0.717 mmol) and benzylamine (80  MU l, 0.732 mmol).
      <br/>
      The mixture was stirred for 90 minutes at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was concentrated, and the concentrate was partitioned between ethyl acetate and a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate.
      <br/>
      The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate.
      <br/>
      The organic layer was dried (MgSO4), then the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure.
      <br/>
      The residue was chromatographed on silica gel to give a colorless oil (0.135 g, 53%).
      <br/>
      To a solution of the oily in ethanol (4 ml) was added, under ice-cooling, 1N ethanolic hydrochloric acid (0.2 ml).
      <br/>
      The mixture was stirred for 10 minutes with ice-cooling.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, which was crystallized from ethyl acetate and-ether to give the corresponding hydrochloride (0.113 g) as white crystals, m.p. 118-119 (degree)  C.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE SECOND EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="864">
      A second embodiment of the present invention relates to novel thienopyrimidine derivatives and salts thereof.
      <br/>
      The second embodiment further relates to methods for manufacturing the thienopyrimidine derivatives and the salts thereof, and pharmaceutical compositions containing the thienopyrimidine derivatives.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART OF THE SECOND EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="865">
      Secretion of anterior pituitary hormone is controlled by peripheral hormones secreted from target organs for the respective hormones and by secretion-accelerating or -inhibiting hormone from the hypothalamus, which is the upper central organ of the anterior lobe of the pituitary (in this specification, these hormones are collectively called "hypothalamic hormone").
      <br/>
      At the present stage, as hypothalamic hormones, nine kinds of hormones including, for example, thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) or gonadotropin releasing hormone +GnRH: sometimes called LH-RH (luteinizing hormone releasing hormone)} have been confirmed (cf. Seirigaku 2, compiled by M. Iriku and K Toyama, published by Bunkohdo, p610-618, 1986).
      <br/>
      These hypothalamic hormones are assumed to show their actions via the receptor which is considered to exist in the anterior lobe of the pituitary (cf. ibid), and studies of receptor genes specific to these hormones, including those of humans, have been developed (Receptor Kiso To Rinsho, compiled by H. Imura, et al., published by Asakura Shoten, p297-304, 1993).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, antagonists or agonists specifically and selectively acting on these receptors control the action of action of hypothalamic hormone and the secretion of anterior pituitary hormone.
      <br/>
      As a result, they are expected to be useful as prophylactic and therapeutic agents of anterior pituitary hormone dependent diseases.
    </p>
    <p num="866">
      Leuprorelin acetate (Fujino et al., Biological and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol.60, 00.406-413, 1974; Oliver, R. T. D. et al., British Journal of Cancers, Vol.59, p.823, 1989; and Toguchi et al., Journal of International Medical Research, Vol.18, pp.35-41), which is a highly potent derivative of gonadotropic hormone-releasing hormone, one of the hypothalamic hormones, (hereinafter sometimes abbreviated as GnRH) (Schally A. V. et at., Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 246, pp.7230-7236, 1971; and Burgus, R. et al., Proceeding of Natural Academic Science, USA, Vol.69, pp278-282, 1972), by administration of multiple doses, lowers release of gonadotropic hormone in the pituitary, causing a lowering of reactivity of gonadotropic hormone in the sperm and ovary tissue to suppress secretion of testosterone and estrogen.
      <br/>
      Leuprorelin acetate has, therefore, been known to show antitumor activity on such hormone-dependent cancers as prostate cancer, and has been widely used in the clinical field.
      <br/>
      Leuprorelin acetate has been widely used clinically also as a therapeutic agent of e.g. endometriosis and precocious puberty.
      <br/>
      The high antitumor activity of leuprorelin acetate is assumed to be due to its high resistance, as compared with natural GnRH, against protease, and to its high affinity for GnRH receptor causing desensitization of GnRH due to decrease in number of receptors.
      <br/>
      However, as leuprorelin acetate is an ultra-agonist of GnRH receptors, it has been known that, immediately after the first administration; a transient aggravation accompanied with a rise of serum testosterone concentration due to pituitary-gonadotropic action (acute action) is observed.
      <br/>
      Under these circumstances, GnRH antagonistic drugs which are expected to have substantially the same therapeutic effects as described above but not to cause the above-mentioned transient pituitary-gonadotropic action (acute action) have been desired.
      <br/>
      As compounds having such GnRH antagonistic activity, a number of compounds including, for example, derivatives of GnRH such as straight-chain peptides, (U.S. Pat. No. 5,140,009 and No. 5,171,835), cyclic hexapeptide derivatives �Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 61(1986)-191698� or bicyclic peptide derivatives �Journal of medicinal chemistry, Vol.36, pp.3265-3273, 1993� have been disclosed.
      <br/>
      These compounds are, however, all peptides, which leave many problems including, for example, dosage forms, stability of drugs, durability of actions and stability on metabolism.
      <br/>
      For solving these problems, orally administrable GnRH antagonistic drugs, especially non-peptide ones, are strongly desired.
      <br/>
      At the present stage, however, no report on non-peptide GnRH antagonistic drugs has been made.
