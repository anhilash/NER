    <p num="3">This invention relates to an electron beam apparatus using electron-emitting devices and it also relates to a method of driving such an apparatus.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      There have been known two types of electron-emitting device: the thermionic type and the cold cathode type.
      <br/>
      Of these, the cold cathode type refers to devices including field emission type (hereinafter referred to as the FE type) devices, metal/insulation layer/metal type (hereinafter referred to as the MIM type) electron-emitting devices and surface conduction electron-emitting devices.
      <br/>
      Examples of FE type devices include those proposed by W. P. Dyke &amp; W. W. Dolan, "Field Emission", Advances in Electron Physics, 8, 89 (1956) and C. A. Spindt, "Physical Properties of Thin-Film Field Emission Cathodes with Molybdenum Cones", J. Appl. Phys., 47, 5248 (1976).
    </p>
    <p num="6">Examples of MIM devices are disclosed in various papers including C. A. Mead, "Operation of Tunnel-Emission Devices", J. Appl. Phys., 32, 646 (1961).</p>
    <p num="7">
      Examples of surface conduction electron-emitting devices include one proposed by M. I. Elinson, Radio Eng.
      <br/>
      Electron Phys., 10 (1965).
      <br/>
      A surface conduction electron-emitting device is realized by utilizing the phenomenon that electrons are emitted by a small thin film formed on a substrate when an electric current is forced to flow in parallel with the film surface.
      <br/>
      While Elinson proposes the use of an SnO2 thin film for a device of an this type, the use of an Au thin film is proposed in G. Dittmer, "Thin Solid Films", 9, 317 (1972), whereas the use of In2 O3 /SnO2 and of carbon thin film are discussed respectively in M. Hartwell and C. G. Fonstad, "IEEE Trans.
      <br/>
      ED Conf.", 519 (1975) and H. Araki et al., "Vacuum", Vol. 26, No. 1, p. 22 (1983).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      FIG. 26 of the accompanying drawings schematically illustrates a typical surface conduction electron-emitting device proposed by M. Hartwell. In FIG. 26, reference numeral 121 denotes a substrate.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 122 denotes an electroconductive thin film normally prepared by producing an H-shaped thin metal oxide film by means of sputtering, part of which eventually makes an electron-emitting region 123 when it is subjected to a current conduction treatment referred to as "energization forming" as will be described hereinafter.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 26, the narrow film arranged between a pair of device electrodes has a length G of 0.5 to 1 mm and a width W' of 0.1 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Conventionally, an electron emitting region 123 is produced in a surface conduction electron-emitting device by subjecting the electroconductive thin film 122 of the device to a preliminary treatment, which is referred to as "energization forming".
      <br/>
      In an energization forming process, a constant DC voltage or a slowly rising DC voltage that rises typically at a rate of 1 V/min. is applied to given opposite ends of the electroconductive thin film 122 to partly destroy, deform or transform the film and produce an electron-emitting region 123 which is electrically highly resistive.
      <br/>
      Thus, the electron-emitting region 123 is part of the electroconductive thin film 122 that typically contains a fissure or fissures therein so that electrons may be emitted from the fissures.
      <br/>
      Note that, once subjected to an energization forming process, a surface conduction electron-emitting device comes to emit electrons from its electron emitting region 123 whenever an appropriate voltage is applied to the electroconductive thin film 122 to make an electric current run through the device.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Known surface conduction electron-emitting devices include, beside the above-described device of M. Hartwell, one comprising an insulating substrate, a pair of oppositely disposed device electrodes of an electroconductive material formed on the substrate and a thin film of another electroconductive material arranged to connect the device electrodes.
      <br/>
      An electron-emitting region is produced in the electroconductive thin film when the latter is subjected to energization forming.
      <br/>
      Techniques that can be used for energization forming include that of applying a slowly rising voltage as described above and that in which a pulse voltage is applied to an electron-emitting device and the wave height of the pulse voltage is gradually raised.

      The intensity of the electron beam emitted from an electron-emitting device can be remarkably raised by carrying out an activation process on the electron-emitting device that has been subjected to an energization forming process.
      <br/>
      In an activation process, a pulse voltage is applied to the device that is placed in a vacuum chamber so that carbon or a carbon compound may be produced on the device by deposition at a location close to the electron-emitting region from an organic substance existing in the vacuum of the vacuum chamber.

    <p num="12">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 6-141670 discloses a surface conduction electron-emitting device, its configuration and a method of manufacturing such a device.</p>
    <p num="13">
      However, when surface conduction electron-emitting devices are used in a flat type image-forming apparatus, the ratio of the electric current generated as a result of electron emission (emission current Ie) from the device to the electric current running through each device (device current If) is preferably made as large as possible in order to improve the electron emission efficiency of the device from the viewpoint of achieving a good quality for displayed images and, at the same time, reducing the power consumption rate of the device.
      <br/>
      A large emission current to device current ratio is particularly important for a high definition image-forming apparatus comprising a large number of pixels and is realized by arranging a large number of electron-emitting devices because such an apparatus inevitably consumes power at an enhanced rate and a considerable portion of the substrate of the apparatus that carries the electron-emitting devices thereon is occupied by wires connecting the devices.
      <br/>
      If each of the electron-emitting devices shows an excellent electron-emitting efficiency and consumes little power, smaller wires can be used, to provide a higher degree of freedom in designing the overall image-forming apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Further, in order to produce bright and clear images, not only the electron-emitting efficiency but also the emission current Ie of each device has to be improved.</p>
    <p num="15">Finally, each electron-emitting device is required to maintain its good performance of electron emission for a prolonged period in order for the image-forming apparatus comprising such devices to operate reliably for a long service life.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="23">
      FIGS. 1A and 1B schematically illustrate a surface conduction electron-emitting device prepared according to a first mode of realizing the present invention.
      <br/>
      It comprises an electron-scattering plane forming layer 6 arranged on the higher potential side electroconductive thin film 5 and, if necessary, also on the higher potential side device electrode of the device in order to provide a highly efficient electron-scattering plane that elastically scatters electrons striking the device from outside.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1A is a plane view and FIG. 1B is a cross-sectional side view taken along line 1B--1B in FIG. 1A. Reference numeral 1 denotes an insulating substrate, reference numerals 2 and 3 respectively denote lower and higher potential side device electrodes, reference numeral 4 denotes a lower potential side electrode, and reference numeral 7 denotes an electron-emitting region.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The electron-scattering plane is a boundary plane of two different substances at which incident electrons are elastically scattered in a highly efficient way.
      <br/>
      The electron-scattering plane is formed on the higher potential side electroconductive thin film 5 and, if necessary, also on the higher potential side device electrode 3 and extending from the electron-emitting region 7 toward the higher potential side device electrode 3 over a length L that preferably satisfies the relationship expressed by formula (1) below:  (Equation image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      where Vf is the voltage (device voltage) applied between the oppositely disposed device electrodes 2 and 3 of the surface conduction electron-emitting device 8, Va is the voltage applied between the surface conduction electron-emitting device 8 and an anode 9, which will be described below, and H is the distance between the electron-emitting device and the anode.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 2, an anode 9 is arranged vis-a-vis the surface conduction electron-emitting device 8 in order to effectively capture electrons coming from the electron-emitting device when the latter is driven to emit electrons.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The effect of an electron-scattering plane for efficiently scattering electrons may be given rise to in a manner as described below by referring to FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4, reference 25 denotes a vacuum space and external electrons come to strike the electron-scattering plane forming layer by way of this space.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 26 denotes the surface of an electron-scattering plane forming layer that reflects and scatters part of incident electrons to give rise to their respective tracks, only one of which is shown there, indicated by reference numeral 28.
      <br/>
      A boundary plane is formed under the surface and operates as an electron-scattering plane 27.
      <br/>
      This plane is defined as a boundary plane of either of the first and second layers of an electron-scattering plane forming layer or an electron-scattering plane forming layer and the higher potential side electroconductive thin film, although its function is the same in both cases.
      <br/>
      Some of the electrons passing through the surface 26 of the electron-scattering plane forming layer are reflected and scattered by this electron-scattering plane to fly into the vacuum space to give rise to their respective tracks, only one of which is shown there, indicated by reference numeral 29.
      <br/>
      The remaining electrons that pass through the electron-scattering plane 27 will eventually lose the energy they have and will not fly back into the vacuum space, as indicated by reference numeral 30.
      <br/>
      Thus, it will be safe to assume that an electron-scattering plane 27 effectively and efficiently produces scattered electrons that fly back into the vacuum space.
    </p>
    <p num="27">If the distance, or the depth, of the electron-scattering plane 27 from the surface 26 of the electron-scattering plane forming layer is too large, electrons can lose the energy they have while they are traveling therebetween to reduce the electron scattering efficiency of the electron-scattering plane.</p>
    <p num="28">
      If the electron-scattering plane forming layer has a double-layered configuration, the first and second layers are prepared from different materials in order to produce a good electron scattering effect.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the materials of the two layers are so selected as to make the electron-scattering plane show a large potential difference.
      <br/>
      A large potential difference may be obtained when both the electronegativities and the work functions of the two materials show a large difference.
      <br/>
      As will be described hereinafter, a favorable effect can be achieved when semiconductor substances, specifically Si and B, are used for the first layer and metals of the IIIb group, specifically La and Sc, or those of the IIa group, specifically Sr and Ba, are used for the second layer.
      <br/>
      However, materials that can be used for these two layers are not limited to those listed above, and many other materials may be used if they produce a highly efficient elastic electron scattering effect on the electron scattering plane.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Now, a surface conduction electron-emitting device that can be used for the purpose of the invention will be described in greater detail.</p>
    <p num="30">
      Materials that can be used for the substrate 1 include quartz glass, glass containing impurities such as Na to a reduced concentration level, soda lime glass, a glass substrate realized by forming an SiO2 layer on soda lime glass by means of sputtering, and ceramic substances such as alumina, as well as Si.
      <br/>
      While the oppositely arranged lower and higher potential side device electrodes 2 and 3 may be made of any highly conducting material, preferred candidate materials include metals such as Ni, Cr, Au, Mo, W, Pt, Ti, Al, Cu and Pd and their alloys, printable conducting materials made of a metal or a metal oxide selected from Pd, Ag, Au, RuO2, Pd--Ag, etc., in combination with glass, transparent conducting materials such as In2 O3 --SnO2 and semiconductor materials such as polysilicon.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Referring to FIGS. 1A and 1B, the gap length G separating the device electrodes 2 and 3, the length W of the device electrodes, the contours of the lower and higher potential side electroconductive films 4 and 5 and other factors for designing a surface conduction electron-emitting device according to the invention may be determined depending on the application of the device.
      <br/>
      The gap length G separating the device electrodes 2 and 3 is preferably between hundreds of nanometers and hundreds of micrometers and, still preferably, between several micrometers and several tens of micrometers.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The length W of the device electrodes 2 and 3 is preferably between several micrometers and several hundreds of micrometers depending on the resistance of the electrodes and the electron-emitting characteristics of the device.
      <br/>
      The film thickness d of the device electrodes is between several tens of nanometers and several micrometers.
    </p>
    <p num="33">A surface conduction electron-emitting device according to the invention may have a configuration other than the one illustrated in FIGS. 1A and 1B and, alternatively, it may be prepared by laying electroconductive thin films 4 and 5 on a substrate 1 and then oppositely disposed lower and higher potential side device electrodes 2 and 3.</p>
    <p num="34">
      The electroconductive thin films 4 and 5 are preferably fine particle films in order to provide excellent electron-emitting characteristics.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the electroconductive thin films is determined as a function of the stepped coverage of the electroconductive thin films on the device electrodes 2 and 3, the electric resistance between the device electrodes 2 and 3 and the parameters for the forming operation that will be described later as well as other factors and preferably between several tenths of a nanometer and several hundreds of nanometers and more preferably between a nanometer and fifty nanometers.
      <br/>
      The electroconductive thin films 4 and 5 normally show a sheet resistance Rs between 102 and 107 OMEGA /.quadrature.. Note that Rs is the resistance defined by R=Rs(l/w), where t, w and l are the thickness, the width and the length of a thin film respectively and R is the resistance determined along the longitudinal direction of the thin film.
      <br/>
      Also note that, while the forming process is described in terms of current conduction treatment for the purpose of the present invention, it is not limited thereto and may include a variety of processing steps where a fissure is formed in the thin film to produce a high resistance state there.
    </p>
    <p num="35">The electroconductive thin films 4 and 5 are made of fine particles of a material primarily selected from metals such as Pd, Pt, Ru, Ag, Au, Ti, In, Cu, Cr, Fe, Zn, Sn, Ta, W and Pb, oxides such as PdO, SnO2, In2 O3, PbO and Sb2 O3, borides such as HfB2, ZrB2, LaB6, CeB6, YB4 and GdB4, carbides such TiC, ZrC, HfC, TaC, SiC and WC, nitrides such as TiN, ZrN and HfN, and the like.</p>
    <p num="36">
      The term a "fine particle film" as used herein refers to a thin film constituted of a large number of fine particles that may be loosely dispersed, tightly arranged or mutually and randomly overlapping (to form an island structure under certain conditions).
      <br/>
      The diameter of fine particles to be used for the purpose of the present invention is between several tenths of a nanometer and several hundreds of nanometers and preferably between a nanometer and twenty nanometers.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Since the term "fine particle" is frequently used herein, it will be described in greater depth below.</p>
    <p num="38">
      A small particle is referred to as a "fine particle" and a particle smaller than a fine particle is referred to as an "ultrafine particle".
      <br/>
      A particle smaller than an "ultrafine particle" and constituted by several hundred atoms is referred to as a "cluster".
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      However, these definitions are not rigorous and the scope of each term can vary depending on the particular aspect of the particle to be dealt with.
      <br/>
      An "ultrafine particle" may be referred to simply as a "fine particle" as in the case of this patent application.
    </p>
    <p num="40">"The Experimental Physics Course No. 14: Surface/Fine Particle" (ed., Koreo Kinoshita; Kyoritu Publication, Sep. 1, 1986) describes as follows:</p>
    <p num="41">
      "A fine particle as used herein refers to a particle having a diameter somewhere between 2 to 3  MU m and 10 nm and an ultrafine particle as used herein means a particle having a diameter somewhere between 10 nm and 2 to 3 nm.
      <br/>
      However, these definitions are by no means rigorous and an ultrafine particle may also be referred to simply as a fine particle.
      <br/>
      Therefore, these definitions are a rule of thumb in any means.
      <br/>
      A particle constituted of two atoms to several tens or hundreds of atoms is called a cluster." (Ibid., p.195, 11.22-26)
    </p>
    <p num="42">Additionally, "Hayashi's Ultrafine Particle Project" of the New Technology Development Corporation defines an "ultrafine particle" as follows, employing a smaller lower limit for the particle size:</p>
    <p num="43">
      "The Ultrafine Particle Project (1981-1986) under the Creative Science and Technology Promoting Scheme defines an ultrafine particle as a particle having a diameter between about 1 and 100 nm.
      <br/>
      This means an ultrafine particle is an agglomerate of about 100 to 108 atoms.
      <br/>
      From the viewpoint of atom, an ultrafine particle is a huge or ultrahuge particle." ("Ultrafine Particle--Creative Science and Technology": ed., Chikara Hayashi, Ryoji Ueda, Akira Tazaki; Mita Publication, 1988, p.2, 11.1-4) "A particle smaller than an ultrafine particle and constituted by several to several hundred atoms is referred to as a cluster. (Ibid., p.2, 11.12-13)
    </p>
    <p num="44">Taking the above general definitions into consideration, the term "a fine particle" as used herein refers to an agglomerate of a large number of atoms and/or molecules having a diameter with a lower limit between a tenth of several nanometers and a nanometer and with an upper limit of several micrometers.</p>
    <p num="45">
      The electron-emitting region 7 is formed between the lower potential side and higher potential side electroconductive thin films 4 and 5 and comprises an electrically highly resistive fissure, although its performance is dependent on the thickness, the nature and the material of the electroconductive thin films 4 and 5 and the energization forming process which will be described hereinafter.
      <br/>
      The electron emitting region 7 may contain in the inside electroconductive fine particles having a diameter between a tenth of several nanometers and tens of several nanometers.
      <br/>
      The material of such electroconductive fine particles may contain all or part of the materials that can be used to prepare the electroconductive thin films 4 and 5 including the electron emitting region.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Subsequently, an electron-scattering plane forming layer 6 is produced.
      <br/>
      This will be described in terms of an electron-scattering plane forming layer having a double-layered configuration. (FIG. 17A schematically illustrates such a double-layered configuration.)
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Firstly the second layer of an electron-scattering plane forming layer 6 is produced on the higher potential side electroconductive thin film 5.
      <br/>
      Techniques that can be used for this operation include vacuum evaporation and sputtering as well as-chemical techniques such as MOCVD (metal organic chemical vapor deposition).
      <br/>
      Two or more than two such techniques may be used in combination.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      If the technique of vacuum evaporation or sputtering is used, a patterning operation has to be conducted in order to form a film only in necessary areas.
      <br/>
      If the technique of MOCVD is used, to the contrary, a film can be formed selectively on the higher potential side device electrode 3 and the higher potential side electroconductive thin film 5, although the produced films may not necessarily show a desired profile because there may be areas where a film can easily grow and areas where a film cannot easily grow depending on surface configuration or other factors of the device.
      <br/>
      If such is the case, MOCVD may be used for areas near the electron-emitting region 7, while vacuum evaporation or sputtering may be used for the remaining areas.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Materials that can be used for the second layer include metals of the 2a and 3a groups, specifically Sr, Ba, Sc and La.
      <br/>
      Any of these substances can be used in combination with one of the materials that can be used for the first layer, which will be described hereinafter.
      <br/>
      Source gases that can be used for CVD for the second layer include Sr(C11 H19 O2)3, Ba(C11 H19 O2)3, Sc(C11 H19 O2)3 and La(C11 H19 O2)3.
    </p>
    <p num="50">Note that the second layer is not necessary if the boundary plane of the first layer and the electroconductive thin film is used for an electron-scattering plane. (FIG. 17B schematically illustrates such a single-layered configuration.)</p>
    <p num="51">
      Then, the first layer is formed.
      <br/>
      The methods that can be used for forming the second layer can also be used for the first layer.
      <br/>
      While materials that can be used for the first layer include semiconductor substances, the use of Si or B is preferable.
      <br/>
      The film thickness of the first layer has to be rigorously controlled to less than 10 nm, preferably less than 5 nm, because the film thickness of the first layer significantly affects the efficiency of elastic electron-scattering of the device.
      <br/>
      Source gases that can be used for CVD for the first layer include SiH4 and B(C2 H5)3.
    </p>
    <p num="52">Note that the two component layers of an electron-scattering plane forming layer having a double-layered configuration are not necessarily arranged continuously and they may be layered in a discontinuous manner.</p>
    <p num="53">Now, the right side of formula (1) will be described below.</p>
    <p num="54">
      For driving a surface conduction electron-emitting device to emit electrons, values for Vf, H and Va are selected respectively from somewhere between ten and several tens of volts (V), 2 and 8 millimeters (mm) and 1 and 10 kilovolts (kV).
      <br/>
      By looking into the electric field formed by the electron-emitting device and the anode under these conditions, it will be found that electrons in a region above the higher potential side electroconductive thin film 5 are subjected to a downward force directed to the higher potential side electroconductive thin film 5 or the device electrode 3.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 schematically illustrates such a region indicated by oblique lines and denoted by reference numeral 10.
      <br/>
      In this region, electrons are subjected to a downward force due to the electric field generated there.
    </p>
    <p num="55">The region extends from the electron-emitting region toward the higher potential side device electrode for a distance of  (Equation image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="56">which is the same as the right side of formula (1).</p>
    <p num="57">
      Most of the electrons emitted from the electron-emitting region cannot leave the slashed region of FIG. 3 immediately because of the downward force of the electric field applied to them and strike the electron-scattering plane forming layer.
      <br/>
      The incident electrons are scattered and/or absorbed by the layer.
      <br/>
      Electrons are scattered either elastically without losing the energy they have or non-elastically, losing part of the energy they have.
      <br/>
      Further, secondary electrons may be emitted by incident electrons.
      <br/>
      Since the energy level of electrons scattered non-elastically and those energized and emitted secondarily by incident electrons is lower than that of elastically scattered electrons, they cannot overcome the downward force exerted by the electric field and hence cannot leave the slashed region so that they are eventually absorbed by the higher potential side electroconductive thin film 5 or the device electrode 3 and take part in the device current If.
      <br/>
      Thus, only electrons that are elastically scattered can overcome the downward force of the electric field and eventually leave the region to produce an emission current.

      Electrons emitted from the electron-emitting region 7 show a certain spread angle.
      <br/>
      While some of them may immediately get out of the slashed region of FIG. 3 and fly toward the anode 9 as indicated by trajectory a, most of them are pulled back by the downward force of the as electric field existing there and enter the electron-scattering plane forming layer 6.
      <br/>
      A given portion of these electrons are elastically scattered and eventually leave the slashed region 10 to get to the anode 9.
      <br/>
      Once they leave the electron-emitting region by the distance expressed by formula 2, the force applied to them by the electric field is directed upward so that they may produce their respective trajectories that get to the anode such as trajectory b illustrated in FIG. 3.

      Electrons emitted from the electron-emitting region may be elastically scattered by the electroconductive thin film 3 with a non-zero probability if an electron-scattering plane forming layer 6 is not provided.

      However, the probability with which electrons are elastically scattered is remarkably increased by arranging an electron-scattering plane forming layer 6 to increase the ratio of "surviving" electrons and hence the electron emitting efficiency of the device: Preferably, the electron-scattering plane forming layer 6 is made to entirely cover the higher potential side electroconductive thin film 5 that is directly neighboring the slashed region 10 of FIG. 3 and, if the region 10 gets to the surface of the higher potential side device electrode 3 that does not carry thereon any electroconductive thin film, it may preferably be extended to the surface of the electrode 3 or made longer than the length expressed by formula (2).

      In other words, the two layers can be produced in a single manufacturing step and, therefore, an electron-emitting device according to the first mode and a device according to the second mode of realizing the present invention can be manufactured with a same number of manufacturing steps, although they may alternatively be manufactured with different manufacturing steps.

      A high melting point substance layer 84 may well be formed by deposition in an area of the electron-emitting region located close to the lower potential side electroconductive thin film by applying a positive pulse voltage to the lower potential side electroconductive thin film, which is opposite to the case of driving the device, and using a CVD technique in an atmosphere containing an appropriate source gas.

For the purpose of the present invention, the temperature at which the material for the high melting point substance layer gives rise to a vapor pressure of 1.3 * 10-3 Pa (10-5 Torr) is of particular interest from the viewpoint that the film may be partly sublimated as it is heated to degrade its performance.

      FIG. 7 is a schematic block diagram of an arrangement comprising a vacuum chamber that can be used as a gauging system for determining the performance of an electron emitting device of the type under consideration.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 7, the gauging system includes a vacuum chamber 16 and a vacuum pump 17.
      <br/>
      An electron-emitting device is placed in the vacuum chamber 16.

      The device comprises a substrate 1, lower and higher potential side device electrodes 2 and 3, lower and higher potential side thin films 4 and 5 and an electron-emitting region 7.
      <br/>
      Although not shown in FIG. 7, the device additionally comprises an electron-scattering plane forming layer, a low work function material layer and/or a high melting point substance layer.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, the gauging system has a power source 11 for applying a device voltage Vf to the device, an ammeter 12 for metering the device current If running through the thin films 4 and 5 between the device electrodes 2 and 3, an anode 15 for capturing the emission current Ie produced by electrons emitted from the electron-emitting region 7 of the device, a high voltage source 13 for applying a voltage to the anode 15 of the gauging system and another ammeter 14 for metering the emission current Ie produced by electrons emitted from the electron-emitting region 7 of the device.
      <br/>
      For determining the performance of the electron-emitting device, a voltage between 1 and 10 kV may be applied to the anode, which is spaced apart from the electron emitting device by distance H which is between 2 and 8 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Instruments including a vacuum gauge and other pieces of equipment necessary for the gauging system are arranged in the vacuum chamber 16 so that the performance of the electron-emitting device or the electron source in the chamber may be properly tested under desired atmosphere.

      The vacuum pump 17 may be provided with an ordinary high vacuum system comprising a turbo pump and a rotary pump and an ultra-high vacuum system comprising an ion pump.

      The entire vacuum chamber containing an electron source substrate therein can be heated to 250 (degree)  C. by means of a heater (not shown).

      <br/>
      Note that both the vertical and transversal axes of the graph represent linear scales.
    </p>
    <p num="71">As seen in FIG. 8A, an electron-emitting device according to the invention has three remarkable features in terms of emission current Ie, which will be described below.</p>
    <p num="72">
      (i) Firstly, an electron-emitting device according to the invention shows a sudden and sharp increase in the emission current Ie when the voltage applied thereto exceeds a certain level (which is referred to as a threshold voltage hereinafter and indicated by Vth in FIG. 8A), whereas the emission current Ie is practically undetectable when the applied voltage is lower than the threshold value Vth.
      <br/>
      Differently stated, an electron-emitting device according to the invention is a non-linear device having a clear threshold voltage Vth to the emission current Ie.
      <br/>
      (ii) Secondly, since the emission current Ie increases monotonically dependent on the device voltage Vf, the former can be effectively controlled by way of the latter.
      <br/>
      (iii) Thirdly, the emitted electric charge captured by the anode 35 is a function of the duration of time of application of the device voltage Vf.
      <br/>
      In other words, the amount of electric charge captured by the anode 15 can be effectively controlled by way of the time during which the device voltage Vf is applied.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Because of the above remarkable features, it will be understood that the electron-emitting behavior of an electron source comprising a plurality of electron-emitting devices according to the invention and hence that of an image-forming apparatus incorporating such an electron source can easily be controlled in response to the input signal.
      <br/>
      Thus, such an electron source and an image-forming apparatus may find a variety of applications.
    </p>
    <p num="74">On the other hand, the device current If either monotonically increases relative to the device voltage Vf (as shown in FIG. 8A, a characteristic referred to as "MI characteristic" hereinafter) or changes to show a curve specific to a voltage-controlled-negative-resistance characteristic (a characteristic referred to as "VCNR characteristic" hereinafter) as shown in FIG. 8B. These characteristics of the device current are dependent on the manufacturing method.</p>
    <p num="75">Now, some examples of the usage of electron-emitting devices, to which the present invention is applicable, will be described.</p>
    <p num="76">According to a fourth mode of realizing the invention, an electron source and hence an image-forming apparatus can be realized by arranging on a substrate a plurality of electron-emitting devices according to any of the above described first through third modes of realizing the present invention, and including the thus obtained electron source and an image-forming member within a vacuum container.</p>
    <p num="77">Electron-emitting devices may be arranged on a substrate in a number of different modes.</p>
    <p num="78">
      For instance, a number of electron-emitting devices may be arranged in parallel rows along a direction thereinafter referred to row-direction), each device being connected by wires at opposite ends thereof, and driven to operate by control electrodes (hereinafter referred to as grids) arranged in a space above the electron-emitting devices along a direction perpendicular to the row direction (hereinafter referred to as column-direction) to realize a ladder-like arrangement.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a plurality of electron-emitting devices may be arranged in rows along a X-direction and columns along an Y-direction to form a matrix, the X- and Y-directions being perpendicular to each other, and the electron-emitting devices on a given row are connected to a common X-directional wire by way of one of the electrodes of each device while the electron-emitting devices on a given column are connected to a common Y-directional wire by way of the other electrode of each device.
      <br/>
      The latter arrangement is referred to as a simple matrix arrangement.
      <br/>
      Now, the simple matrix arrangement will be described in detail.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      In view of the above described three basic characteristic features (i) through (iii) of a surface conduction electron-emitting device, to which the invention is applicable, it can be controlled for electron emission by controlling the wave height and the wave width of the pulse voltage applied to the opposite electrodes of the device above the threshold voltage level.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the device does not practically emit any electrons below the threshold voltage level.
      <br/>
      Therefore, regardless of the number of electron-emitting devices arranged in an apparatus, desired surface conduction electron-emitting devices can be selected and controlled for electron emission in response to an input signal by applying a pulse voltage to each of the selected devices.

      The control circuit 43 coordinates the operations of related components so that images may be appropriately displayed in accordance with externally fed video signals.

      The synchronizing signal separation circuit 46 separates the synchronizing signal component and the luminance signal component from an externally fed NTSC television signal and can be easily realized using a popularly known frequency separation (filter) circuit.
      <br/>
      Although a synchronizing signal extracted from a television signal by the synchronizing signal separation circuit 46 is constituted, as well known, of a vertical synchronizing signal and a horizontal synchronizing signal, it is simply designated as Tsync signal here for convenience sake, disregarding its component signals.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a luminance signal drawn from a television signal, which is fed to the shift register 44, is designated as DATA signal.

    <p num="111">The shift register 44 carries out for each line a serial/parallel conversion on DATA signals that are serially fed on a time series basis in accordance with control signal Tsft fed from the control circuit 43. (In other words, a control signal Tsft operates as a shift clock for the shift register 44.) A set of data for a line of one image that have undergone a serial/parallel conversion (and correspond to a set of drive data for N electron-emitting devices) are sent out of the shift register 44 as n parallel signals Id1 through Idn.</p>

    <p num="114">
      As described above, an electron-emitting device, to which the present invention is applicable, is characterized by the following features in terms of emission current Ie.
      <br/>
      Firstly, there exists a clear threshold voltage Vth and the device emits electrons only when a voltage exceeding Vth is applied thereto.
      <br/>
      Secondly, the level of emission current Ie changes as a function of the change in the applied voltage above the threshold level Vth.
      <br/>
      More specifically, when a pulse-shaped voltage is applied to an electron-emitting device according to the invention, practically no emission current is generated so far as the applied voltage remains under the threshold level, whereas an electron beam is emitted once the applied voltage rises above the threshold level.
      <br/>
      It should be noted here that the intensity of an output electron beam can be controlled by changing the peak level Vm of the pulse-shaped voltage.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the total amount of electric charge of an electron beam can be controlled by varying the pulse width Pw.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      Thus, either voltage modulation method or pulse width modulation method may be used for modulating an electron-emitting device in response to an input signal.
      <br/>
      With voltage modulation, a voltage modulation type circuit is used for the modulation signal generator 47 so that the peak level of the pulse shaped voltage is modulated according to input data, while the pulse width is held constant.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      With pulse width modulation, on the other hand, a pulse width modulation type circuit is used for the modulation signal generator 47 so that the pulse width of the applied voltage may be modulated according to input data, while the peak level of the applied voltage is held constant.
      <br/>
      Although it is not particularly mentioned above, the shift register 44 and the line memory 45 may be either of digital or of analog signal type so long as serial/parallel conversions and storage of video signals are conducted at a given rate.
      <br/>
      If digital signal type devices are used, output signal DATA of the synchronizing signal separation circuit 46 needs to be digitized.
      <br/>
      However, such conversion can be easily carried out by arranging an A/D converter at the output of the synchronizing signal separation circuit 46.
      <br/>
      It may be needless to say that different circuits may be used for the modulation signal generator 47 depending on if output signals of the line memory 45 are digital signals or analog signals.
      <br/>
      If digital signals are used, a D/A converter circuit of a known type may be used for the modulation signal generator 47 and an amplifier circuit may additionally be used, if necessary.
      <br/>
      As for pulse width modulation, the modulation signal generator 47 can be realized by using a circuit that combines a high speed oscillator, a counter for counting the number of waves generated by said oscillator and a comparator for comparing the output of the counter and that of the memory.
      <br/>
      If necessary, am amplifier may be added to amplify the voltage of the output signal of the comparator having a modulated pulse width to the level of the drive voltage of a surface-conduction type electron-emitting device according to the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      If, on the other hand, analog signals are used with voltage modulation, an amplifier circuit comprising a known operational amplifier may suitably be used for the modulation signal generator 47 and a level shift circuit may be added thereto if necessary.
      <br/>
      As for pulse width modulation, a known voltage control type oscillation circuit (VCO) may be used with, if necessary, an additional amplifier to be used for voltage amplification up to the drive voltage of a surface-conduction type electron-emitting device.

      Then, the generated electron beams are accelerated by applying a high voltage to the metal back 35 or a transparent electrode (not shown) by way of the high voltage terminal Hv.

      The electron-emitting devices 24 are arranged in rows (to be referred to as device rows hereinafter) on the substrate 21 to form an electron source comprising a plurality of device rows, each row having a plurality of devices.

      The surface conduction electron-emitting devices of each device row are electrically connected in parallel with each other by a pair of common wires so that they can be driven independently by applying an appropriate drive voltage to the pair of common wires.

      More specifically, a voltage exceeding the electron emission threshold level is applied to the device rows to be driven to emit electrons, whereas a voltage below the electron emission threshold level is applied to the remaining device rows.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, any two external terminals arranged between two adjacent device rows can share a single common wire.

      Note that, however, while stripe-shaped grid electrodes are shown in FIG. 16, the profile and the locations of the electrodes are not limited thereto.

      <br/>
      The photoresist pattern was dissolved into an organic solvent and the Ni/Ti deposit film was treated by using a lift-off technique to produce a pair of device electrodes 2 and 3 having a width of W1=300  MU m and separated from each other by a gap distance of G=3  MU m.

      <br/>
      The black stripes were made of a popular material containing graphite as a principal ingredient.

      A metal back 35 is arranged on the inner surface of the fluorescent film 34.

      After preparing the fluorescent film, the metal back 35 was prepared by carrying out a smoothing operation (normally referred to as "filming") on the inner surface of the fluorescent film and thereafter forming thereon an aluminum layer by vacuum evaporation.
    </p>
    <p num="231">While a transparent electrode might be arranged on the outer surface of the fluorescent film 34 of the face plate 36 in order to enhance its electroconductivity, it was not used in this example because the fluorescent film showed a sufficient degree of electroconductivity by using only a metal back.</p>
    <p num="232">For the above bonding operation, the components were carefully aligned in order to ensure an accurate positional correspondence between the color fluorescent members and the electron-emitting devices.</p>
    <p num="233">Step J:</p>
    <p num="234">
      The image forming apparatus was then placed in a vacuum processing system shown in FIG. 13 and the vacuum chamber 53 was evacuated to reduced the internal pressure to less than 2.6 * 10-3 Pa.
      <br/>
      FIG. 24 shows a diagram of the wiring arrangement used for the forming operation in this example.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 24, a pulse generated by a pulse generator 91 is applied to one of the X-directional wires 22 selected by a line selector.
      <br/>
      Both the pulse generator and the line selector are controlled for operation by a control unit 93.
      <br/>
      The Y-directional wires 23 of the electron source 94 are connected together and grounded.
      <br/>
      The thick solid line in FIG. 24 represents a control line, whereas thin solid lines represent so many wires.
      <br/>
      The applied pulse voltage had a triangular pulse wave form with an increasing wave height as shown in FIG. 6B. As in the case of Example 1, a rectangular pulse voltage having a wave height of 0.1 V was inserted into intervals of the triangular pulse to gauge the resistance of each device row and the forming operation was terminated for the row when the resistance exceeded 3.3k OMEGA  for each device row (or 1M OMEGA  for each device).
      <br/>
      Then, the voltage applying line was switched to a next line by the line selector.
      <br/>
      The pulse wave height was about 7.0 V for all the lines when the forming operation was terminated.

      La(C11 H19 O2)3 was introduced into the vacuum chamber until the internal pressure was raised to 1.3 * 10-1 Pa.

      The same wiring arrangement as in Step J was also used to apply a pulse voltage to each of the electron-emitting devices.
      <br/>
      The pulse wave generated by the pulse generator was a rectangular pulse having a pulse wave height of 18 V, a pulse width of 100  MU sec. and a pulse interval of 167  MU sec.

      In other words, the pulse voltage applied to the X-directional wires and having a pulse width of T1=100  MU sec. and a pulse interval of T2=16.7 msec. (or 60 Hz in terms of frequency) was switched sequentially on a wire by wire basis by the line selector for every 167  MU sec.
      <br/>
      The pulse generator and the line selector were driven to operate synchronously under the control of a control unit.
    </p>
    <p num="237">As a result of this step, a second La layer of the electron-scattering plane forming layer was produced on the higher potential side electroconductive thin film by deposition.</p>

      The envelope was evacuated again to reduce the internal pressure to about 10-5 Pa, while heating the entire panel to about 80 (degree)  C., and the exhaust pipe (not shown) was heated to melt by a gas burner and hermetically seal the envelope.
      <br/>
      Finally, the getter (not shown) arranged in the envelope was heated by high frequency heating to carry out a getter process.

    <p num="241">
      The image-forming apparatus produced after the above steps was then driven to operate by applying a scan signal and a modulation signal from a signal generator (not shown) to the electron-emitting devices by way of external terminals Dx1 through Dxm and Dy1 through Dyn so that 14 V was applied to the selected devices, which consequently emitted electrons.
      <br/>
      The emitted electron beams were accelerated by applying a high voltage greater than 5 kV to the metal back 35 by way of the high voltage terminal Hv to make them collide with the fluorescent film 34, which was consequently excited and fluoresced to display images.

    <p num="242">Thereafter, the image-forming apparatus was broken apart and the devices were taken out and observed through a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to find out that, in each device, the first layer (B thin film) of the electron-scattering plane forming layer had a film thickness between 5 and 10 nm and was extended by a distance of about L=10 to 20  MU m.</p>

    <p num="255">The CPU 107 controls the display apparatus and carries out the operation of generating, selecting and editing images to be displayed on the display screen.</p>

      For example, the CPU 107 sends control signals to the multiplexer 104 and appropriately selects or combines signals for images to be displayed on the display screen.
      <br/>
      At the same time it generates control signals for the display panel controller 103 and controls the operation of the display apparatus in terms of image display frequency, scanning method (e.g., interlaced scanning or non-interlaced scanning), the number of scanning lines per frame and so on.
    </p>

    <p num="259">
      The decoder 105 is a circuit for converting various image signals input via said circuits 108 through 114 back into signals for three primary colors, luminance signals and I and Q signals.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the decoder 105 comprises image memories as indicated by a dotted line in FIG. 25 for dealing with television signals such as those of the MUSE system that require image memories for signal conversion.

    <p num="260">
      The multiplexer 104 is used to appropriately select images to be displayed on the display screen according to control signals given by the CPU 107.
      <br/>
      In other words, the multiplexer 104 selects certain converted image signals coming from the decoder 105 and sends them to the drive circuit 102.
      <br/>
      It can also divide the display screen in a plurality of frames to display different images simultaneously by switching from a set of image signals to a different set of image signals within the time period for displaying a single frame.

    <p num="261">The display panel controller 103 is a circuit for controlling the operation of the drive circuit 102 according to control signals transmitted from the CPU 107.</p>

      A display apparatus according to the invention and having a configuration as described above and illustrated in FIG. 25 can display on the display panel 101 various images given from a variety of image data sources.

      On the other hand, the display controller 103 generates control signals for controlling the operation of the drive circuit 102 according to the image signals for the images to be displayed on the display panel 101.

      The drive circuit 102 then applies drive signals to the display panel 101 according to the image signals and the control signals.
      <br/>
      Thus, images are displayed on the display panel 101.

      All the above described operations are controlled by the CPU 107 in a coordinated manner.

      Although not described with respect to the above embodiment, it is possible to provide it with additional circuits exclusively dedicated to audio signal processing and editing operations.

    <p num="268">
      It may be needless to say that FIG. 25 shows only an example of possible configuration of a display apparatus comprising a display panel provided with an electron source prepared by arranging a number of surface conduction electron-emitting devices and the present invention is not limited thereto.
      <br/>
      For example, some of the circuit components of FIG. 25 that are not necessary fo for a particular application may be omitted.
      <br/>
      To the contrary, additional components may be arranged there depending on the application.
      <br/>
      For example, if a display apparatus according to the invention is used for visual telephone, it may be appropriately made to comprise additional components such as a television camera, a microphone, lighting equipment and transmission/reception circuits including a modem.

    <p num="269">
      As described above in detail, by arranging an electron-scattering plane that elastically scatters incident electrons and has a length L defined by formula (1) above on the higher potential side electroconductive thin film of a surface conduction electron-emitting device at a depth of less than 10 nm from the surface, the electron-emitting efficiency of the device can be remarkably improved.

      Additionally, by arranging a low work function material layer on the lower potential side electroconductive thin film at a position close to the electron-emitting region, the emission current of the device can be improved or, by arranging a high melting point substance layer, the reduction of the emission current can be suppressed.
