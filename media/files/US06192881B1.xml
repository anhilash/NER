    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="31">
      FIG. 1 is a schematic view of the preferred embodiment.
      <br/>
      Fireplace 9 comprises planar base 10.
      <br/>
      Base 10 comprises a plurality of gas orifices 20.
      <br/>
      Each orifice 20 may be fabricated in base 10 or comprise any one of those threaded orifices available in the art.
      <br/>
      Orifices 20 range in size from 1/16" to 1" in diameter.
      <br/>
      Base 10 comprises any solid heat resistant material such as metal, clay, plastic, wood, concrete, stone, and ceramic.
      <br/>
      Windscreen 40 encircles a perimeter of base 10, thereby preventing strong winds from affecting the flame.
      <br/>
      Windscreen 40 may comprise any flame resistant material identified in the list above for the base 10.
      <br/>
      Although shown in the preferred embodiment as having a rectangular shape, base 10 may have any shape including round, oval or any other form.
      <br/>
      Base 10 comprises safety valve 80 and quick-connect 70.
      <br/>
      Safety valve 80 is connected to base 10 by block 12.
      <br/>
      Safety valve 80, having probe 81, is known in the art and will terminate the fuel gas flow in the event of loss of flame on the fireplace 9.
      <br/>
      Gas hose 60 is connected to safety valve 80 by quick connect 70.
      <br/>
      Quick-connect 70, known in the art, allows gas hose 60 to be quickly attached to the invention.
      <br/>
      Hose 60 is connected to valve 90 by quick connect 71, also known in the art.
      <br/>
      Valve 90, used for fuel gas flow control and shut-off, is connected to fuel tank 100.
      <br/>
      Fuel tank 100 may contain any suitable fuel gas, such as propane or butane.
      <br/>
      Fuel gas G is fed to safety valve 80 through hose 60.
      <br/>
      It flows through a channel (shown in FIG. 2) in block 12 to enter gas channels, 11.
      <br/>
      It flows through gas channels 11, (not shown), to flow from gas orifices 20.
      <br/>
      This results in a vertical flame shape as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Base 10 may be fabricated from one single piece of material or laminated together from a plurality of pieces.
      <br/>
      Orifices 20 may be set on a spacing, L1, having a range of not less than 1 inch and not greater than 2 feet.
      <br/>
      It is possible to add rocks (not shown) to the base in order to enhance the visual effect.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 2 is a side elevation view of the preferred embodiment along line A--A in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Quick-connect 70 and safety valve 80 are connected to base 10 at block 12.
      <br/>
      Legs 30 support base 10 to keep base 10 at some spacing, S, above the ground.
      <br/>
      Legs 30 are adjustable to allow use of the invention on uneven surfaces.
      <br/>
      The legs allow the base 10 to be clear of any combustible material that may be on the ground or surface of use.
      <br/>
      Gas channel 11 runs from block 12 to each gas orifice 20.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 depicts an alternate arrangement wherein the windscreen 40 described in FIG. 1 is not used.
      <br/>
      This results in the pleasing visual effect of a plurality of flames extending above a planar surface.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 3 is a side elevation view of the preferred embodiment.
      <br/>
      Windscreen 40 encloses base 10 as well as the flames F. The seams between the windscreen 40 and base 10 are watertight 12 and therefore, can contain water W. In operation, the gas flows from each orifice 20 and up through the water W. The fluid W may also comprise any noncombustible fluid.
      <br/>
      Once the gas emerges above the water, the gas is ignited by match or spark igniter, each known in the art.
      <br/>
      This gives the enjoyable visual effect of a gas flame burning in a sustained manner above the surface of the fluid including the reflectance of the flames on the surface of the fluid.
      <br/>
      When used with fluid, the orifices 20 further comprise a diaphragm valve or check valve 25, known in the art, to prevent water or fluid from entering into gas channel 11.
      <br/>
      The gas may be further directed to the fluid surface by flowing through a pipe 13 to the proper elevation at or near the fluid surface.
      <br/>
      The diameter of pipe 13 equates to those identified for the gas orifices 20 in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a cover for the preferred embodiment.
      <br/>
      Cover 50 comprises opposing sides 54 and 55.
      <br/>
      Each opposing side 54 and 55 is attached to top 59 at right angles.
      <br/>
      Lip 56 and lip 53 are each attached respectively to side 55 and 54.
      <br/>
      Each lip cooperates with an outer edge of base 10.
      <br/>
      Handle 51 is used to carry the invention.
      <br/>
      Cover 50 slides over base 10 and windscreen 40 so as to enclose the invention when not in use.
      <br/>
      Strap 52 allows cover 50 be secured to the invention.
      <br/>
      Hole 57 cooperates with pin 58.
      <br/>
      Pin 58 latches an exterior side of windscreen 40 so as to lock the cover 50 in place over the invention.
      <br/>
      Cover 50 may be used as a stand for the invention during use.
      <br/>
      Cover 50 also comprises ledges 61 and 62, which oppose each other on the top of the cover 50.
      <br/>
      Ledges 61 and 62 allow the cover to have a gap G between the underside of base 10 and the cover 50 when the cover 50 is being used as a stand for the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram of the system.
      <br/>
      Fuel tank 520 is contained within any machine or vehicle, for example, a recreational vehicle.
      <br/>
      Fuel line 510 extends from fuel tank 520 to the equipment within the recreational vehicle and as such is generally an integral part of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Tee 500 is installed in line 510.
      <br/>
      Tee 500 is connected to valve 540 and to quick connect 550, known in the art.
      <br/>
      Line 560, connected to quick connect 550, is of sufficient length to allow the invention 9, as described in FIG. 1, to be connected to hose 560, and thereby fuel tank 520, while allowing a user to position the invention in a safe place for use.
      <br/>
      Hose 560 may be of any length desired by a user.
      <br/>
      Fuel tank 520 is serviced by fuel filler 530.
      <br/>
      Fuel tank 520 may be of any size readily available in the art.
      <br/>
      Valve 540 may be of any type appropriate for fuel gas service readily available in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      FIG. 6 is a top perspective view of the preferred embodiment.
      <br/>
      Windscreen 40 is shown about a perimeter of base 10.
      <br/>
      Line "A" depicts an elevation of the surface of a fluid as described in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In an alternate embodiment wherein fluid is used, pipe 13 extends from orifice 20.
      <br/>
      Each orifice 20 may have a pipe 13, or a user may use pipe 13 on less than all orifices 20, in order to create the desired visual effect.
      <br/>
      Pipe 13 extends to approximately elevation "A", either above or below the surface of the fluid.
      <br/>
      In the fluid filled embodiment, safety valve probe 81 extends above the surface of the fluid to detect a loss of flame condition, if such occurs.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, numerous modifications and variations can be made and still the result will come within the scope of the invention.
