    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a writable optical disc, and a reading system and a manufacturing method of the disc.</p>
    <p num="2">
      In a writable optical disc, information such as a synchronizing signal and address information (hereinafter called prepit information) for searching a position on the disc are previously recorded by laser cutting at a preformat stage in a manufacturing process.
      <br/>
      As one of the methods of the preformat of the prepit information, a track (groove or land) on which information is written by a user is wobbled.
      <br/>
      In another method, prepits are recorded on the track.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      However, in the former method, the track itself is wobbled in a waveform in right and left by a wobbling signal.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the magnitude of the modulation by the wobbling signal is limited to a small degree.
      <br/>
      As a result, the C/N (carrier to noise ratio) decreases.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, since the interference of the adjacent tracks at the wobbling must be considered, pitch between the tracks can not be reduced.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the writing capacity of the disc is limited.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In the latter method, since the prepits are recorded, the space for writing the information is reduced.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the available efficiency of the disc is low.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">An object of the present invention is to provide a writable disc in which the writing capacity of the disc is increased.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIG. 1 typically showing a writable optical disc of the present invention, an optical disc 1 comprises a transparent layer 1a made of transparent resin such as polycarbonate, a coloring matter 1b under the transparent layer 1a, and a metallic reflection film 5.
      <br/>
      On the underside of the transparent layer 1a, a plurality of grooves 2 (as viewed from the reflection film 5) as information writing tracks, and a land 3 (as viewed from the reflection film 5) as a guiding track are spirally formed from a central portion of the disc to an outer periphery thereof.
      <br/>
      Prepits 4 are recorded on the land 3 as the guiding track for prepit information by the preformat.
      <br/>
      The metallic reflection film 5 is coated on the coloring matter 1b.
      <br/>
      A protection film (not shown) is layered on the reflection film 5.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, a laser beam is projected from a portion above the disc 1 to the groove 2 and the land 3.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      FIG. 2a shows the track of the disc 1 which is spirally formed thereon.
      <br/>
      The prepits 4 are recorded on every other land 3 for preventing the prepit information from interfering.
      <br/>
      When writing or reproducing the information by a pickup, if the prepits 4 are recorded on each of the lands 3, the pickup may read information of prepits 4 recorded on adjacent lands which are disposed on opposite sides of the groove 2 at the same time.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the prepit information can not be ensurely reproduced.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 2b show another example tracks for preventing the interference of the information.
      <br/>
      A recording pattern comprising a first pattern and a second pattern is provided for recording the prepit information on the land.
      <br/>
      Each of the first and second patterns has sync Sy (at every SYNC frame) and ID information necessary for servo.
      <br/>
      The sync Sy and ID information recorded by the first pattern are deflected with a predetermined phase difference, for example, with 180 phase difference from the sync Sy and ID information recorded by the second pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The prepit information is first recorded in the spiral direction by the first pattern.
      <br/>
      If the sync Sy and the ID of the adjacent lands are almost overlapped, the first pattern is changed to the second pattern to continue recording.
      <br/>
      Then, if the sync Sy and the ID of the adjacent lands of the second pattern are almost overlapped, the first pattern is used again.
    </p>
    <p num="22">FIGS. 3 and 3A show the manufacturing process of the disc.</p>
    <p num="23">
      In a conventional disc, a prepit is recorded on a groove.
      <br/>
      In cutting of an original glass substrate, a groove is formed by laser cutting.
      <br/>
      If the conventional disc is employed for the present invention, the prepit is cut on a land after the groove is cut.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the number of processes increases, and it is difficult to precisely cut the prepit.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In the present invention, when a laser cutting is performed, a resist coated on an original glass substrate is exposed by laser cutting and developed based on the prepit information, thereby forming lands and recording prepits on the lands at the same time.
      <br/>
      Thus, a master stamper is made.
      <br/>
      The master stamper is processed by electroforming to form a sub master, or the sub master is further processed by electroforming at even times to form a sub stamper.
      <br/>
      After the electroforming, a replication is made to the transparent layer 1a.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the coloring matter 1b is formed on the underside of the layer 1a.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In the process, since the substrate is cut by only one cutting process, the prepit is not deflected from the land.
      <br/>
      Thus, a disc having high accuracy can be manufactured.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      FIG. 4 shows a cutting machine employed with the laser cutting.
      <br/>
      The cutting machine comprises a laser 10 for emitting a laser beam having a large power.
      <br/>
      An optical modulator 11 is provided for modulating the laser beam from the laser 10 in accordance with land cutting information applied from an encoder 12.
      <br/>
      A glass substrate 14 having a resist 15 coated thereon is mounted on a spindle motor 16.
      <br/>
      The laser beam modulated by the modulator 11 is focused on the resist 15 by an objective lens 13 for forming a spot thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The spindle motor 16 is rotated by a rotation detector 17 and a rotation servo circuit 18 at a constant linear velocity (CLV).
      <br/>
      The motor 16 is mounted on a feeding unit 19 to be moved in a radial direction of the glass substrate 14 by a position detector 20 and a feeding servo circuit 21 at a predetermined speed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the lands and prepits are cut on resist 15 of the substrate 14 in a spiral direction from a central portion of the substrate to an outer periphery thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="28">FIGS. 5a and 5b show an embodiment of a reading system for reading information written on the disc.</p>
    <p num="29">
      A laser beam for reproducing information is reflected from a prism 32 and projected on a recording surface of the disc 1 through an objective lens 31 to form a spot of the laser beam.
      <br/>
      The light reflected from the disc 1 is fed to a photodetector 33 through the prism 32.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      FIG. 5b shows the spot of the laser beam on the disc 1.
      <br/>
      The spot is formed on the groove 2 near the land 3.
      <br/>
      The photodetector 33 comprises four photodetecting elements A, B, C and D divided by a line parallel with the radius of the disc and a line parallel with the tangential direction of the groove 2 as the information recording track.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The divided four elements A to D produce corresponding output signals A to D which are applied to amplifiers 34 to 37, respectively.
      <br/>
      A plurality of adders and subtracters 38 to 43 and 47 are provided for adding and subtracting amplified signals from the amplifiers.
      <br/>
      Thus, an RF signal, a tracking error signal, and prepit information recorded on the land are read out.
    </p>
    <p num="32">In order to read the information written on the groove 2, all of the outputs A to D are added.</p>
    <p num="33">
      In order to obtain the RF signal, the outputs A and D are added by the adder 40, and the outputs B and C are added by the adder 41.
      <br/>
      Outputs (A+D) and (B+C) are added by the adder 43.
      <br/>
      Thus, the RF signal (A+B+C+D) is produced from a terminal 46.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The tracking error signal is obtained by a difference between the outputs (A+D) and (B+C) divided in the tracking direction of the groove 2.
      <br/>
      In this state, the difference of a primary light, not a zero level light, is obtained.
      <br/>
      The output (A+D) of the adder 40 and the output (B+C) of the adder 41 are subtracted by the subtracter 42.
      <br/>
      Thus, the tracking error signal (A+D)-(B+C) is produced from a terminal 45.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The prepit information signal (hereinafter called prepit signal) is obtained by a difference between outputs (A+B) and (C+D) divided in the radial direction of the disc.
      <br/>
      In this state, the difference of a primary light, not a zero level light, is obtained.
      <br/>
      The outputs A and B are added by the adder 38, and the outputs C and D are added by the adder 39.
      <br/>
      The output (A+B) of the adder 38 and the output (C+D) of the adder 39 are subtracted by the subtracter 47.
      <br/>
      Thus, the prepit signal (A+B)-(C+D) is produced from a terminal 44.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      As shown in FIG. 2a, when the disc makes one turn, one tracking finishes, the position of the lands 3 changes from the left (right) to the right (left) of the groove 2.
      <br/>
      However, the change of the position can be easily detected because polarity of the prepit signal (A+B)-(C+D) produced from the terminal 44 is inverted.
    </p>
    <p num="37">FIGS. 6 and 6A show RF, tracking error and prepit signals read out by the reading system with respect to the conditions of the disc.</p>
    <p num="38">
      From the foregoing, it will be seen that signals are sufficiently and exactly read out.
      <br/>
      The prepit signal does not affect the RF signal, because the depth of the groove of the track is determined as shown in FIG. 7.
    </p>
