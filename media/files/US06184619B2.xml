      An electron apparatus includes a rear substrate having an electron-emitting device, a front substrate irradiated with electrons, and a support member for maintaining the interval between these substrates.
      <br/>
      The distribution of the electric field is controlled, and a force acting in the direction away from the support member is applied to emitted electrons to prevent the electrons from striking the support member.
      <br/>
      At this time, the electrons are accelerated toward the front substrate.
      <br/>
      Since the degree of deflection by a deflection force on the rear substrate side is larger than the degree of deflection by a deflection force on the front substrate side, the deflection force on the rear substrate side is relatively weakened.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an electron apparatus associated with electron emission and, more particularly, to an image forming apparatus for forming an image by electrons.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventionally, two types of devices, namely hot and cold cathode devices, are known as electron-emitting devices.
      <br/>
      Known examples of the cold cathode devices are surface-conduction emission (SCE) type electron-emitting devices, field emission type electron-emitting devices (to be referred to as FE type electron-emitting devices hereinafter), and metal/insulator/metal type electron-emitting devices (to be referred to as MIM type electron-emitting devices hereinafter).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A known example of the surface-conduction emission type electron-emitting devices is described in, e.g., M. I. Elinson, "Radio Eng.
      <br/>
      Electron Phys., 10, 1290 (1965) and other examples will be described later.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The surface-conduction emission type electron-emitting device utilizes the phenomenon that electrons are emitted from a small-area thin film formed on a substrate by flowing a current parallel through the film surface.
      <br/>
      The surface-conduction emission type electron-emitting device includes electron-emitting devices using an Au thin film �G.
      <br/>
      Dittmer, "Thin Solid Films", 9,317 (1972)�, an In2 O3 /SnO2 thin film �M.
      <br/>
      Hartwell and C. G. Fonstad, "IEEE Trans.
      <br/>
      ED Conf.", 519 (1975)�, a carbon thin film �Hisashi Araki et al., "Vacuum", Vol. 26, No. 1, p. 22 (1983)�, and the like, in addition to an SnO2 thin film according to Elinson mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      FIG. 19 is a plan view showing the surface-conduction emission type electron-emitting device by M. Hartwell et al. described above as a typical example of the device structures of these surface-conduction emission type electron-emitting devices.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 19, numeral 3001 denotes a substrate; and 3004, a conductive thin film made of a metal oxide formed by sputtering.
      <br/>
      This conductive thin film 3004 has an H-shaped pattern, as shown in FIG. 19. An electron-emitting portion 3005 is formed by performing electrification processing (referred to as forming processing to be described later) with respect to the conductive thin film 3004.
      <br/>
      An interval L in FIG. 19 is set to 0.5 to 1 mm, and a width W is set to 0.1 mm. The electron-emitting portion 3005 is shown in FIG. 19 in a rectangular shape at almost the center of the conductive thin film 3004 for the sake of illustrative convenience.
      <br/>
      However, this does not exactly show the actual position and shape of the electron-emitting portion 3005.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In the above surface-conduction emission type electron-emitting devices by M. Hartwell et al. and the like, typically the electron-emitting portion 3005 is formed by performing electrification processing called energization forming processing for the conductive thin film 3004 before electron emission.
      <br/>
      That is, the forming processing is to form an electron-emitting portion by electrification.
      <br/>
      For example, a constant DC voltage or a DC voltage which increases at a very low rate of, e.g., 1 V/min is applied across the two ends of the conductive thin film 3004 to partially destroy or deform the conductive thin film 3004, thereby forming the electron-emitting portion 3005 with an electrically high resistance.
      <br/>
      Note that the destroyed or deformed part of the conductive thin film 3004 has a fissure.

      Since the above-described cold cathode devices can emit electrons at a temperature lower than that for hot cathode devices, they do not require any heater.
      <br/>
      The cold cathode device therefore has a structure simpler than that of the hot cathode device and can be micropatterned.
      <br/>
      Even if a large number of devices are arranged on a substrate at a high density, problems such as heat fusion of the substrate hardly arise.
      <br/>
      In addition, the response speed of the cold cathode device is high, while the response speed of the hot cathode device is low because it operates upon heating by a heater.
    </p>
    <p num="14">For this reason, applications of the cold cathode devices have enthusiastically been studied.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Of cold cathode devices, the above surface-conduction emission type electron-emitting devices are advantageous because they have a simple structure and can be easily manufactured.
      <br/>
      For this reason, many devices can be formed on a wide area.
      <br/>
      As disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 64-31332 filed by the present applicant, a method of arranging and driving a lot of devices has been studied.
      <br/>
      Regarding applications of surface-conduction emission type electron-emitting devices to, e.g., image forming apparatuses such as an image display apparatus and an image recording apparatus, electron-beam sources, and the like have been studied.

      As an application to image display apparatuses, in particular, as disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,066,833 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 2-257551 and 4-28137 filed by the present applicant, an image display apparatus using the combination of an surface-conduction emission type electron-emitting device and a fluorescent substance which emits light upon reception of an electron beam has been studied.
      <br/>
      This type of image display apparatus using the combination of the surface-conduction emission type electron-emitting device and the fluorescent substance is expected to have more excellent characteristics than other conventional image display apparatuses.
      <br/>
      For example, in comparison with recent popular liquid crystal display apparatuses, the above display apparatus is superior in that it does not require a backlight because it is of a self-emission type and that it has a wide view angle.

    <p num="18">An example of an application of a larger number of MIM type electron-emitting devices arranged side by side to an image display apparatus is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 3-55738 filed by the present applicant.</p>
    <p num="19">Of image display apparatuses using electron-emitting devices like the ones described above, a thin, flat display apparatus receives a great deal of attention as an alternative to a CRT (Cathode-Ray Tube) display apparatus because of a small space and light weight.</p>
    <p num="20">FIG. 22 is a perspective view of an example of a display panel for a flat image display apparatus where a portion of the panel is removed for showing the internal structure of the panel.</p>
    <p num="21">
      In FIG. 22, numeral 3115 denotes a rear plate; 3116, a side wall; and 3117, a face plate.
      <br/>
      The rear plate 3115, the side wall 3116, and the face plate 3117 form an envelope (airtight container) for maintaining the inside of the display panel vacuum.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The rear plate 3115 has a substrate 3111 fixed thereto, on which N * M cold cathode devices 3112 are provided (M, N=positive integer equal to "2" or greater, appropriately set in accordance with an object number of display pixels).
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 23, the N * M cold cathode devices 3112 are arranged with M row-direction wirings 3113 and N column-direction wirings 3114.
      <br/>
      The portion constituted with the substrate 3111, the cold cathode devices 3112, the row-direction wiring 3113, and the column-direction wiring 3114 will be referred to as "multi electron-beam source".
      <br/>
      At an intersection of the row-direction wiring 3113 and the column-direction wiring 3114, an insulating layer (not shown) is formed between the wirings, to maintain electrical insulation.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Further, a fluorescent film 3118 made of a fluorescent substance is formed under the face plate 3117.
      <br/>
      The fluorescent film 3118 is colored with red, green and blue, three primary color fluorescent substances (not shown).
      <br/>
      Black conductive material (not shown) is provided between the fluorescent substances constituting the fluorescent film 3118.
      <br/>
      Further, a metal back 3119 made of Al or the like is provided on the surface of the fluorescent film 3118 on the rear plate 3115 side.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In FIG. 22, symbols Dx1 to Dxm, Dy1 to Dyn, and Hv denote electric connection terminals for airtight structure provided for electrical connection of the display panel with an electric circuit (not shown).
      <br/>
      The terminals Dx1 to Dxm are electrically connected to the row-direction wiring 3113 of the multi electron-beam source; Dy1 to Dyn, to the column-direction wiring 3114; and Hv, to the metal back 3119.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The inside of the airtight container is exhausted at about 10-6 Torr.
      <br/>
      As the display area of the image display apparatus becomes larger, the image display apparatus requires a means for preventing deformation or damage of the rear plate 3115 and the face plate 3117 caused by a difference in pressure between the inside and outside of the airtight container.
      <br/>
      If the deformation or damage is prevented by heating the rear plate 3115 and the face plate 3117, not only the weight of the image display apparatus increases, but also image distortion and parallax are caused when the user views the image from an oblique direction.
      <br/>
      To the contrary, in FIG. 22, the display panel comprises a structure support member (called a spacer or rib) 3120 made of a relatively thin glass to resist the atmospheric pressure.
      <br/>
      With this structure, the interval between the substrate 3111 on which the multi beam-electron source is formed, and the face plate 3117 on which the fluorescent film 3118 is formed is normally kept at submillimeters to several millimeters.
      <br/>
      As described above, the inside of the airtight container is maintained at high vacuum.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In the image display apparatus using the above-described display panel, when a voltage is applied to the cold cathode devices 3112 via the outer terminals Dx1 to Dxm and Dy1 to Dyn, electrons are emitted by the cold cathode devices 3112.
      <br/>
      At the same time, a high voltage of several hundreds V to several kV is applied to the metal back 3119 via the outer terminal Hv to accelerate the emitted electrons and cause them to collide with the inner surface of the face plate 3117.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the respective fluorescent substances constituting the fluorescent film 3118 are excited to emit light, thereby displaying an image.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The above-mentioned electron beam apparatus of the image forming apparatus or the like comprises an envelope for maintaining vacuum inside the apparatus, an electron source arranged inside the envelope, a target on which an electron beam emitted by the electron source is irradiated, an acceleration electrode for accelerating the electron beam toward the target, and the like.
      <br/>
      In addition to them, a support member (spacer) for supporting the envelope from its inside against the atmospheric pressure applied to the envelope is arranged inside the envelope.
    </p>
    <p num="28">The display panel of this image display apparatus suffers the following problem.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Some of electrons emitted near the spacer strike the spacer, or ions produced by the action of emitted electrons attach to the spacer.
      <br/>
      Further, some of electrons which have reached the face plate are reflected and scattered, and some of the scattered electrons strike the spacer to charge the spacer.
      <br/>
      The orbits of electrons emitted by the cold cathode devices are changed by the charge-up of the spacer, and the electrons landing positions different from proper positions on the fluorescent substances.
      <br/>
      As a result, a distorted image is displayed near the spacer.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      To solve this problem, the charge-up of the spacer is eliminated (to be referred to as charge-up elimination hereinafter) by flowing a small current through the spacer.
      <br/>
      In this case, a high-resistance film is formed on the surface of an insulating spacer to flow a small current through the surface of the spacer.
      <br/>
      The high-resistance film used is a tin oxide film, a mixed-crystal thin film of tin oxide and indium oxide, an island-like metal film, or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      As the number of emitted electrons by cold cathode devices increases, the charge-up elimination ability becomes poorer, and the charge-up amount depends on the intensity of an electron beam.
      <br/>
      Along with this, an electron beam emitted by a device near the spacer shifts from a proper position on the target depending on the intensity (luminance) of the electron beam.
      <br/>
      For example, in displaying a moving image, the image fluctuates.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="32">It is an object of the present invention to provide a new structure including a support member near the support member.</p>
    <p num="33">The first aspect of an electron apparatus according to the present invention has the following arrangement.</p>
    <p num="34">An electron apparatus comprising a rear substrate having an electron-emitting device, a front substrate having a member to be irradiated with electrons, and a support member for maintaining an interval between the rear substrate and the front substrate is characterized in that an electric field for accelerating electrons from the rear substrate toward the front substrate is applied, a surface of the support member has a first region with a length d1 from a portion connected to the rear substrate and a resistance R1 per unit length in a longitudinal direction, a third region with a length d3 from a portion connected to the front substrate and a resistance R3 per unit length in the longitudinal direction, and a second region which is sandwiched between the first and third regions and has a resistance R2 per unit length in the longitudinal direction, both R1 and R3 are lower than R2, and the lengths and resistances of the first and third regions satisfy at least either one of the following conditions:</p>
    <p num="35">
      a) d1&lt;d3
      <br/>
      b) R1&gt;R3
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In the first aspect, by setting the resistance of the first region per unit length on the rear substrate side to be lower than the resistance of the second region per unit length, a force acting in the direction away from the support member can be applied to electrons emitted by the electron-emitting device.
      <br/>
      More specifically, if the resistance of the first region per unit length is set lower than the resistance of the second region per unit length, the electric field for accelerating the electrons allows the normal line of its equipotential plane near the connected portion between the support member and the rear substrate to have a component in the direction away from the support member.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the electrons receive the force in the direction away from the support member.
      <br/>
      Particularly in the first aspect, deflection of the electrons is preferably controlled by satisfying at least either one of conditions a) and b).
      <br/>
      More specifically, the structure satisfying condition a) is compared with the structure satisfying d1 &gt;= d3 while the remaining requirements are kept unchanged.
      <br/>
      As a result, the structure satisfying condition a) is smaller in shift amount of the actual irradiation point of the electron from the point of projection from the electron-emitting device on the electron irradiation surface of the front substrate.
      <br/>
      In addition, the structure satisfying condition b) is compared with the structure satisfying R1 &lt;= R3 while the remaining requirements are kept unchanged.
      <br/>
      As a result, the structure satisfying condition b) is smaller in shift amount of the actual irradiation point of the electron from the point of projection from the electron-emitting device on the electron irradiation surface of the front substrate.
      <br/>
      This is because the speed of the electron near the front substrate is higher than that near the rear substrate, so that the influence of deflection on the shift amount of the actual irradiation point of the electron from the point of projection from the electron-emitting device on the electron irradiation surface of the front substrate is greater in the first region than in the third region.
      <br/>
      Therefore, this shift amount can be suppressed by setting the deflection force in the first region or/and the distance to apply the force to be smaller than the deflection force in the third region or/and the distance to apply the force.
      <br/>
      Further, the structure satisfying R1 &lt;= R3 and d1 &gt;= d3 is compared with the structure satisfying d1&lt;d3 while the remaining requirements are kept unchanged.
      <br/>
      As a result, the shift amount is smaller in the structure satisfying d1&lt;d3.
      <br/>
      The structure satisfying R1 &lt;= R3 and d1 &gt;= d3 is compared with the R1&gt;R3 while the remaining requirements are kept unchanged.
      <br/>
      As a result, the shift amount is smaller in the structure satisfying R1&gt;R3.
      <br/>
      From these results, the electron apparatus can employ various structures satisfying at least either one of conditions a) and b).
    </p>
    <p num="37">When R1 and R3 are sufficiently lower than R2, the end portion of the first region on the second region side is regarded to have the same potential as that of the portion of the first region which is connected to the rear substrate, and the end portion of the third region on the second region side is regarded to have the same potential as that of the portion of the third region which is connected to the front substrate, deflection can be more easily applied in the third region than in the first region by setting d3&gt;d1.</p>
    <p num="38">The second aspect of the electron apparatus according to the present invention has the following arrangement.</p>
    <p num="39">
      An electron apparatus comprising a rear substrate having an electron-emitting device, a front substrate having a member to be irradiated with electrons, and a support member for maintaining an interval between the rear substrate and the front substrate is characterized in that an electric field for accelerating electrons from the rear substrate toward the front substrate is applied, a surface of the support member has a first region with a length d1 from a portion connected to the rear substrate, a third region with a length d3 from a portion connected to the front substrate, and a second region sandwiched between the first and third regions, potential differences per unit length in a longitudinal direction on the surface of the support member in the first and third regions are smaller than a potential difference per unit length in the longitudinal direction on the surface of the support member in the second region, and letting  DELTA V1 be a potential difference between a potential of a portion connected to the rear substrate and a potential of a portion of the first region on the second region side, and  DELTA V3 be a potential different between a potential of a portion connected to the front substrate and a potential of a portion of the third region on the second region side, the potential differences satisfy:
      <br/>
      DELTA V1/d1&gt; DELTA V3/d3
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In this structure, the potential differences per unit length in the longitudinal direction on the surface of the support member in the first and third regions are smaller than the potential difference per unit length in the longitudinal direction on the surface of the support member in the second region.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the electrons receive a force in the direction away from the support member in the first region, and a force in the direction toward the support member in the third region.
      <br/>
      If the first and third regions of the support member have different potential differences per unit length, and the potential difference per unit length in the third region is particularly set smaller than the potential difference per unit length in the first region, a force larger than deflection in the first region near the rear substrate is applied to the electrons near the front substrate where the electrons are accelerated and hardly deflected.
    </p>
    <p num="41">In the respective aspects described above, to relax charge-up in third region, the third region desirably extends from the portion connected to the front substrate where charge-up most easily occurs, to the position corresponding to 1/10 or more of the distance between the front substrate and the rear substrate.</p>
    <p num="42">
      In the respective aspects described above, a member having a higher conductivity than a conductivity of a surface of the second region may be exposed on a surface of the first or third region.
      <br/>
      Various members are available as the member having a higher conductivity than the conductivity of the surface of the second region.
      <br/>
      This higher-conductivity member can adopt various structures, and is a film formed on the surface of the first or third region or a member having the surface and interior almost uniform.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      As a concrete example of the structure in the respective aspects described above, the second region is also made conductive, and a current is flowed between the front substrate and the rear substrate to relax the charge-up of the support member.
      <br/>
      To give the second region desired conductivity, a conductive film may be formed as the second region on the surface of the support member.
      <br/>
      In particular, when a member having high insulating properties is used as a substrate for the support member, a conductive film is effectively formed on the surface of the insulating member.
      <br/>
      A proper sheet resistance of the support member is 106 to 1012  OMEGA .
    </p>
    <p num="44">In the respective aspects described above, to decrease the probability of unwanted discharge, a potential difference between a potential of an end portion of the first region on the second region side and a potential of an end portion of the third region on the second region side, and an interval between the end portion of the first region on the second region side and the end portion of the third region on the second region side have a relationship of not more than 8 kV/mm, and more preferably not more than 4 kV/mm.</p>
    <p num="45">
      In the respective aspects described above, the support member is desirably connected to the rear substrate or the front substrate via wiring or an electrode.
      <br/>
      In arranging a member serving as the support member after wiring or an electrode is formed on the rear or front substrate, a conductor is formed at an abutment portion against the wiring or electrode formed on the substrate in advance.
      <br/>
      This structure can realize electrically good connection.
      <br/>
      It is also preferable to arrange an acceleration electrode on the front substrate side in order to apply the electric field for accelerating the electrons from the rear substrate toward the front substrate.
      <br/>
      The support member is desirably electrically connected to the acceleration electrode on the front substrate side.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In the respective aspects described above, the electron-emitting device is a cold cathode type electron-emitting device or a surface-conduction emission type electron-emitting device.

    <p num="50">An image forming apparatus using any one of the electron apparatuses described above is characterized in that the member to be irradiated with electrons has a light-emitting substance which emits light upon irradiation of electrons.</p>
    <p num="51">In the image forming apparatus, the light-emitting substance may be a fluorescent substance.</p>
    <p num="52">
      The present invention will be described in more detail with reference to FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Numeral 30 denotes a face plate (face substrate) including fluorescent substances and a metal back; 31, a rear plate (rear substrate) including an electron source substrate; 50, a main body for the spacer; 51, a high-resistance film on the surface of the spacer; 52, an electrode (intermediate layer) on the side surface of the spacer in contact with the face plate; 53, an electrode (intermediate layer) on the side surface of the spacer in contact with the rear plate; and 13, device driving wiring.
      <br/>
      These parts 50, 51, 52, 53, and 13 constitute the support member (frits (not shown in FIG. 1) are also a constituent element of the support member when the intermediate layer 52 and the face plate 30, and the intermediate layer 53 and the rear plate 31 (i.e., the intermediate layer 53 and the wiring 13) are respectively connected via the frits).
      <br/>
      Numeral 111 denotes a device; 112, typical electron beam orbits; and 25, equipotential lines.
      <br/>
      Symbol a denotes a length of the third region (length of the region having a resistivity R3) corresponding to the distance from the lower surface of the face plate to the lower end of the intermediate layer 52; and b, a length of the first region (length of the region having a resistivity R1) corresponding to the distance from the upper surface of the rear plate 31 to the upper end of the intermediate layer 53.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      To prevent the charge-up of the spacer, the resistance of the high-resistance film serving as a charge-up prevention film may be decreased.
      <br/>
      This however leads to an increase in power consumption and generation of heat.
      <br/>
      For this reason, by controlling the potential gradient near the spacer without decreasing the resistance of the high-resistance film, the beam is controlled.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the beam is temporarily moved apart from the spacer by the electrode 53 of the spacer on the electron source substrate side.
      <br/>
      Then, the beam is caused to return to a proper position by the electrode 52 on the side surface of the spacer in contact with the face plate.
      <br/>
      At this time, the space near the spacer has a potential distribution indicated by the equipotential lines 25.
      <br/>
      Since the beam is more accelerated nearer the face plate 30, the electrode 52 on the side surface of the spacer in contact with the face plate must be made longer than the electrode 53 on the side surface of the spacer in contact with the electron source substrate, and the potential gradient on the face plate side must be made steep.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      When no electron beam directly strikes the spacer, the charge-up of the spacer near the face plate is large.
      <br/>
      Variations in charge-up amount are considered to most influence fluctuation of the beam.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the electrode 52 on the side surface of the spacer in contact with the face plate is formed to cover this charge-up region.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the dependency of the beam landing position of the face plate on the electron emission amount can be reduced.

      4 According to the concepts of the present invention, the present invention is not limited to an image forming apparatus suitable for display.

      The above-mentioned image forming apparatus can also be used as a light-emitting source instead of a light-emitting diode for an optical printer made up of a photosensitive drum, the light-emitting diode, and the like.
      <br/>
      At this time, by properly selecting m row-direction wirings and n column-direction wirings, the image forming apparatus can be applied as not only a linear light-emitting source but also a two-dimensional light-emitting source.

      In this case, the image forming member is not limited to a substance which directly emits light, such as a fluorescent substance used in embodiments (to be described below), but may be a member on which a latent image is formed by charging of electrons.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="62">An embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="63">General Description of Image Display Apparatus</p>
    <p num="64">First, the construction of a display panel of an image display apparatus to which the present invention is applied and a method for manufacturing the display panel will be described below.</p>
    <p num="65">FIG. 13 is a perspective view of the display panel where a portion of the panel is removed for showing the internal structure of the panel.</p>
    <p num="66">
      In FIG. 13, numeral 1015 denotes a rear plate; 1016, a side wall; and 1017, a face plate.
      <br/>
      These parts form an airtight container for maintaining the inside of the display panel vacuum.
      <br/>
      To construct the airtight container, it is necessary to seal-connect the respective parts to obtain sufficient strength and maintain airtight condition.
      <br/>
      For example, a frit glass is applied to junction portions, and sintered at 400 to 500 (degree)  C. in air or nitrogen atmosphere, thus the parts are seal-connected.
      <br/>
      A method for exhausting air from the inside of the container will be described later.
      <br/>
      Since the inside of the airtight container is kept exhausted at about 10-6 Torr, a spacer 1020 having an intermediate layer 1031 on the face plate side and an intermediate layer 1032 on the rear plate side is arranged as a structure resistant to the atmospheric pressure in order to prevent damage of the airtight container caused by the atmospheric pressure or sudden shock.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The rear plate 1005 has a substrate 1011 fixed there, on which N * M cold cathode devices 1012 are provided (M, N=positive integer equal to "2" or greater, appropriately set in accordance with an object number of display pixels.
      <br/>
      For example, in a display apparatus for high-quality television display, desirably N=3000 or greater, M=1000 or greater.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, N=3072, M=1024.).
      <br/>
      The N * M cold cathode devices 3112 are arranged with M row-direction wirings 1013 and N column-direction wirings 1014.
      <br/>
      The portion constituted with these parts 1011 to 1014 will be referred to as "multi electron-beam source".
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      In the multi electron-beam source used in the image display apparatus of the present invention, the material, shape, and manufacturing method of the cold cathode device are not limited as far as an electron source is prepared by wiring cold cathode devices in a simple matrix.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the multi electron-beam source can employ a surface-conduction emission (SCE) type electron-emitting device or an FE type or MIM type cold cathode device.
    </p>
    <p num="69">The structure of the multi electron-beam source prepared by arranging SCE type electron-emitting devices (to be described later) as cold cathode devices on a substrate and wiring them in a simple matrix will be described.</p>
    <p num="70">
      FIG. 15 is a plan view of a multi electron-beam source used in the display panel in FIG. 13. SCE type electron-emitting devices like the one shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B (to be described later) are arranged on the substrate 1011.
      <br/>
      These devices are wired in a simple matrix by the row-direction wiring electrodes 1013 and the column-direction wiring electrodes 1014.
      <br/>
      At an intersection of each row-direction wiring electrode 1013 and the column-direction wiring electrode 1014, an insulating layer (not shown) is formed between the electrodes to maintain electrical insulation.
    </p>
    <p num="71">FIG. 16 shows a cross-section cut out along the line B-B' in FIG. 15.</p>
    <p num="72">A multi electron-beam source having this structure is manufactured by forming the row-direction wiring electrodes 1013, the column-direction wiring electrodes 1014, an electrode insulating film (not shown), and device electrodes and conductive thin films of SCE type electron-emitting devices on the substrate in advance, and then supplying electricity to the devices via the row-direction wiring electrodes 1013 and the column-direction wiring electrodes 1014 to perform forming processing and activation processing (both of which will be described later).</p>
    <p num="73">
      In this embodiment, the substrate 1011 of the multi electron-beam source is fixed to the rear plate 1015 of the airtight container.
      <br/>
      However, if the substrate 1011 has sufficient strength, the substrate 1011 of the multi electron-beam source itself may be used as the rear plate of the airtight container.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      Further, a fluorescent film 1018 is formed under the face plate 1017.
      <br/>
      As this embodiment is a color display apparatus, the fluorescent film 1018 is colored with red, green and blue three primary color fluorescent substances.
      <br/>
      The fluorescent substance portions are in stripes as shown in FIG. 5A, and black conductive material 1010 is provided between the stripes.
      <br/>
      The object of providing the black conductive material 1010 is to prevent shifting of display color even if electron-beam irradiation position is shifted to some extent, to prevent degradation of display contrast by shutting off reflection of external light, to prevent charge-up of the fluorescent film by electron beams, and the like.
      <br/>
      The black conductive material 1010 mainly comprises graphite, however, any other materials may be employed so far as the above object can be attained.
    </p>
    <p num="75">Further, three-primary colors of the fluorescent film is not limited to the stripes as shown in FIG. 5A. For example, delta arrangement as shown in FIG. 5B or any other arrangement may be employed.</p>
    <p num="76">Note that when a monochrome display panel is formed, a single-color fluorescent substance may be applied to the fluorescent film 1018, and the black conductive material may be omitted.</p>
    <p num="77">
      Further, a metal back 1019, which is well-known in the CRT field, is provided on the rear plate side surface of the fluorescent film 1018.
      <br/>
      The object of providing the metal back 1019 is to improve light-utilization ratio by mirror-reflecting a part of light emitted from the fluorescent film 1018, to protect the fluorescent film 1018 from collision between negative ions, to use the metal back 1019 as an electrode for applying an electron-beam accelerating voltage, to use the metal back 1019 as a conductive path for electrons which excited the fluorescent film 1018, and the like.
      <br/>
      The metal back 1019 is formed by, after forming the fluorescent film 1018 on the face plate 1017, smoothing the fluorescent film front surface, and vacuum-evaporating Al thereon.
      <br/>
      Note that in a case where the fluorescent film 1018 comprises fluorescent material for low voltage, the metal back 1019 is not used.
    </p>
    <p num="78">Further, for application of accelerating voltage or improvement of conductivity of the fluorescent film, transparent electrodes made of an ITO material or the like may be provided between the face plate 1017 and the fluorescent film 1018, although the embodiment does not employ such electrodes.</p>
    <p num="79">
      FIG. 14 is a schematic cross-sectional view cut out along the line A-A' in FIG. 13. Reference numerals of the respective parts are the same as those in FIG. 13. In this embodiment, the spacer 1020 comprises a high-resistance film 11 for relaxing charge-up on the surface of an insulating member 1, in addition to a low-resistance film 21 serving as an electrode for effectively relaxing charge-up near the face plate.
      <br/>
      The low-resistance film 21 is formed on the surfaces of the insulating member 1 to relax charge-up.
      <br/>
      Further, the low-resistance film 21 is formed on an abutment surface 3 of the spacer which faces the inner surface (metal back 1019 and the like) of the face plate 1017, and a side surface 5 of the spacer which contacts the inner surface of the face plate 1017.
      <br/>
      A necessary number of such spacers are fixed on the inner surface of the face plate and the surface of the substrate 1011 at necessary intervals with a joining material 1040 to attain the above purpose.
      <br/>
      In addition, the high-resistance films 11 are formed at least the surfaces, of the surfaces of the insulating member 1, which are exposed in a vacuum in the airtight container, and are electrically connected to the inner surface (metal back 1019 and the like) of the face plate 1017 and the surface of the substrate 1011 (row- or column-direction wiring 1013 or 1014) via the low-resistance film 21 and the joining material 1040 on the spacer 1020.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, each spacer 1020 has a thin plate-like shape, extends along a corresponding row-direction wiring 1013, and is electrically connected thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="80">The spacer 1020 preferably has insulating properties good enough to stand a high voltage applied-between the row- and column-direction wirings 1013 and 1014 on the substrate 1011 and the metal back 1019 on the inner surface of the face plate 1017, and conductivity enough to prevent the surface of the spacer 1020 from being charged.</p>
    <p num="81">
      As the insulating member 1 of the spacer 1020, for example, a silica glass member, a glass member containing a small amount of an impurity such as Na, a soda-lime glass member, or a ceramic member consisting of alumina or the like is available.
      <br/>
      Note that the insulating member 1 preferably has a thermal expansion coefficient near the thermal expansion coefficients of the airtight container and the substrate 1011.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      If a change in potential in the region where the film 21 is formed is ignored, the current obtained by dividing an accelerating voltage Va applied to the face plate 1017 (the metal back 1019 and the like) on the high potential side by a resistance Rs of the high-resistance film 11 for preventing charge-up flows in the high-resistance film 11 of the spacer 1020.
      <br/>
      The resistance Rs of the spacer is set in a desired range from the viewpoint of prevention of charge-up and consumption power.
      <br/>
      A sheet resistance R/sq is preferably set to 1012  OMEGA /sq or less from the viewpoint of prevention of charge-up.
      <br/>
      To obtain a sufficient charge-up prevention effect, the sheet resistance R is preferably set to 1011  OMEGA /sq or less.
      <br/>
      The lower limit of this sheet resistance depends on the shape of each spacer and the voltage applied between the spacers, and is preferably set to 105  OMEGA /sq or more.
    </p>
    <p num="83">The desired range of the resistance of the high-resistance film per unit length in the application direction of the electric field for accelerating electrons depends on the thickness of the film, the width of the spacer, and the sheet resistance, and is preferably 107 to 1013  OMEGA /mm.</p>
    <p num="84">
      A thickness t of the high-resistance film formed on the insulating material preferably falls within a range of 10 nm to 1  MU m. Although the thickness changes depending on the surface energy of the material, the adhesion properties with the substrate, and the temperature of the substrate, a thin film having a thickness of 10 nm or less is generally formed into an island-like shape and exhibits unstable resistance, resulting in poor reproduction characteristics.
      <br/>
      In contrast to this, if the thickness t is 1  MU m or more, the film stress increases to increase the possibility of peeling of the film.
      <br/>
      In addition, a longer period of time is required to form a film, resulting in poor productivity.
      <br/>
      The thickness preferably falls within a range of 50 to 500 nm.
      <br/>
      The sheet resistance R/sq is  RHO /t, and a resistivity  RHO  of the charge-up prevention film preferably falls within a range of 0.1  OMEGA cm to 108  OMEGA cm in consideration of the preferable ranges of R/sq and t. To set the sheet resistance and the film thickness in more preferable ranges, the resistivity  RHO  is preferably set to 102 to 106  OMEGA cm.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      As described above, when a current flows in the high-resistance film formed on the spacer or the overall display generates heat during operation, the temperature of the spacer rises.
      <br/>
      If the resistance temperature coefficient of the high-resistance film is a large negative value, the resistance decreases with an increase in temperature.
      <br/>
      As a result, the current flowing in the spacer increases to raise the temperature.
      <br/>
      The current keeps increasing beyond the limit of the power source.
      <br/>
      It is empirically known that the resistance temperature coefficient which causes such an excessive increase in current is a negative value whose absolute value is 1% or more.
      <br/>
      That is, the resistance temperature coefficient of the high-resistance film is preferably set to less than -1%.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      As a material for the high-resistance film 11 having charge-up prevention properties, for example, a metal oxide can be used.
      <br/>
      Of metal oxides, a chromium oxide, nickel oxide, or copper oxide is preferably used.
      <br/>
      This is because, these oxides have relatively low secondary electron-emitting efficiency, and are not easily charged even if the electrons emitted by the cold cathode device 1012 collide with the spacer 1020.
      <br/>
      In addition to such metal oxides, a carbon material is preferably used because it has low secondary electron-emitting efficiency.
      <br/>
      Since an amorphous carbon material has a high resistance, the resistance of the spacer 1020 can be easily controlled to a desired value.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      An aluminum-transition metal nitride is preferable as another material for the high-resistance film 11 having charge-up prevention characteristics because the resistance can be controlled in a wide resistance range from the resistance of a good conductor to the resistance of an insulator by adjusting the composition of the transition metal.
      <br/>
      This nitride is a stable material which undergoes only a slight change in resistance in the manufacturing process for the display apparatus (to be described later).
      <br/>
      In addition, this material has a resistance temperature coefficient of less than -1% and hence can be easily used in practice.
      <br/>
      As a transition metal element, Ti, Cr, Ta, or the like is available.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      The film made of the aluminum-transition metal and the nitride (nitride film containing the aluminum-transition metal) is formed on the insulating member by a thin film formation means such as sputtering, reactive sputtering in a nitrogen atmosphere, electron beam deposition, ion plating, or ion-assisted deposition.
      <br/>
      A metal oxide film can also be formed by the same thin film formation method except that oxygen is used instead of nitrogen.
      <br/>
      Such a metal oxide film can also be formed by CVD or alkoxide coating.
      <br/>
      A carbon film is formed by deposition, sputtering, CVD, or plasma CVD.
      <br/>
      When an amorphous carbon film is to be formed, in particular, hydrogen is contained in an atmosphere in the process of film formation, or a hydrocarbon gas is used as a film formation gas.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The low-resistance film 21 of the spacer 1020 also functions to electrically connect the high-resistance film 11 to the face plate 1017 (metal back 1019 and the like) on the high potential side.
      <br/>
      The low-resistance film 21 will also be referred to as an intermediate electrode layer (intermediate layer) hereinafter.
      <br/>
      This intermediate electrode layer (intermediate layer) has a plurality of functions as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="90">1 The low-resistance film serves to electrically connect the high-resistance film 11 to the face plate 1017 and the substrate 1011.</p>
    <p num="91">
      As described above, the high-resistance film 11 is formed to prevent the surface of the spacer 1020 from being charged.
      <br/>
      When, however, the high-resistance film 11 is connected to the face plate 1017 (metal back 1019 and the like) and the substrate 1011 (wirings 1013 and 1014 and the like) directly or via the joining material 1040, a large contact resistance is produced at the interface between the connecting portions.
      <br/>
      As a result, the charges produced on the surface of the spacer may not be quickly removed.
      <br/>
      The connected state can be however improved by forming the low-resistance intermediate layer on the abutment surface 3 and the side surface portion 5, of the spacer 1020, which are in contact with the face plate 1017, the substrate 1011, and the joining material 1040.
    </p>
    <p num="92">2 The low-resistance film serves to make the potential distribution of the high-resistance film 11 uniform.</p>
    <p num="93">
      Electrons emitted by the cold cathode devices 1012 follow the orbits formed in accordance with the potential distribution formed between the face plate 1017 and the substrate 1011.
      <br/>
      To prevent the electron orbits from being disturbed near the spacer 1020, the entire potential distribution of the spacer 1020 must be controlled.
      <br/>
      When the high-resistance film 11 is connected to the face plate 1017 (metal back 1019 and the like) and the substrate 1011 (wiring 1013 or 1014 and the like) directly or via the joining material 1040, variations in the connected state occurs owing to the contact resistance of the interface between the connecting portions.
      <br/>
      As a result, the potential distribution of the high-resistance film 11 may deviate from a desired value.
      <br/>
      To avoid this, if the low-resistance intermediate layer is formed throughout the entire lengths of the spacer end portions (abutment surface 3 or side surface portion 5), of the spacer 1020, which are in contact with the face plate 1017 and the substrate 1011, and a desired potential is applied to the intermediate layer portion, the overall potential of the high-resistance film 11 can be effectively controlled.
    </p>
    <p num="94">3 The intermediate layer serves to control the orbits of emitted electrons.</p>
    <p num="95">
      Electrons emitted by the cold cathode devices 1012 follow the orbits formed in accordance with the potential distribution formed between the face plate 1017 and the substrate 1011.
      <br/>
      Electrons emitted by the cold cathode devices near the spacer may be subjected to constrains (changes in the positions of the wirings and the devices) accompanying the structure of the spacer.
      <br/>
      In this case, to form an image free from distortion and irregularity, the orbits of the electrons emitted by the cold cathode devices must be controlled to irradiate the electrons at desired positions on the face plate 1017.
      <br/>
      The formation of the low-resistance intermediate layers on the side surface portions 5 in contact with the face plate 1017 and the substrate 1011 allows the potential distribution near the spacer 1020 to have desired characteristics, thereby controlling the orbits of emitted electrons.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      As a material for the low-resistance film 21, a material having a resistance sufficiently lower than that of the high-resistance film 11 can be selected.
      <br/>
      For example, such a material is properly selected from metals such as Ni, Cr, Au, Mo, W, Pt, Ti, Al, Cu, and Pd, alloys thereof, printed conductors constituted by metals such as Pd, Ag, Au, RuO2, and Pd-Ag or metal oxides and glass or the like, transparent conductors such as In2 O3 --SnO2, and semiconductor materials such as polysilicon.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      The joining material 1040 needs to have conductivity to electrically connect the spacer 1020 to the row-direction wiring 1013 and the metal back 1019.
      <br/>
      That is, a conductive adhesive or frit glass containing metal particles or conductive filler is suitably used.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      In FIG. 13, symbols Dx1 to Dxm, Dy1 to Dyn and Hv denote electric connection terminals for airtight structure provided for electrical connection of the display panel with an electric circuit (not shown).
      <br/>
      The terminals Dx1 to Dxm are electrically connected to the row-direction wiring 1013 of the multi electron-beam source; Dy1 to Dyn, to the column-direction wiring 1014 of the multi electron-beam source; and Hv, to the metal back 1019 of the face plate.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      To exhaust air from the inside of the airtight container and make the inside vacuum, after forming the airtight container, an exhaust pipe and a vacuum pump (neither is shown) are connected, and air is exhausted from the airtight container to vacuum at about 10-7 Torr.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the exhaust pipe is sealed.
      <br/>
      To maintain the vacuum condition inside of the airtight container, a getter film (not shown) is formed at a predetermined position in the airtight container, immediately before/after the sealing.
      <br/>
      The getter film is a film formed by heating and evaporating getter material mainly including, e.g., Ba, by heating or high-frequency heating.
      <br/>
      The suction-attaching operation of the getter film maintains the vacuum condition in the container 1 * 10-5 or 1 * 10-7 Torr.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      In the image display apparatus using the above display panel, when a voltage is applied to the cold cathode devices 1012 via the outer terminals Dx1 to DxM and Dy1 to DyN, electrons are emitted by the cold cathode devices 1012.
      <br/>
      At the same time, a high voltage of several hundreds V to several kV is applied to the metal back 1019 via the outer terminal Hv to accelerate the emitted electrons to cause them collide with the inner surface of the face plate 1017.
      <br/>

    <p num="104">
      Next, the manufacturing method of the multi electron-beam source used in the display panel according to the embodiment of the present invention will be described.
      <br/>
      As far as the multi electron-beam source used in the image display apparatus of the present invention is obtained by arranging cold cathode devices in a simple matrix, the material, shape, and manufacturing method of the cold cathode device are not limited.
      <br/>
      As the cold cathode device, therefore, an SCE type electron-emitting device or an FE type or MIM type cold cathode device can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      Under circumstances where inexpensive display apparatuses having large display screens are required, an SCE type electron-emitting device, of these cold cathode devices, is especially preferable.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the electron-emitting characteristic of an FE type device is greatly influenced by the relative positions and shapes of the emitter cone and the gate electrode, and hence a high-precision manufacturing technique is required to manufacture this device.
      <br/>
      This poses a disadvantageous factor in attaining a large display area and a low manufacturing cost.
      <br/>
      According to an MIM type device, the thicknesses of the insulating layer and the upper electrode must be decreased and made uniform.
      <br/>
      This also poses a disadvantageous factor in attaining a large display area and a low manufacturing cost.
      <br/>
      In contrast to this, an SCE type electron-emitting device can be manufactured by a relatively simple manufacturing method, and hence an increase in display area and a decrease in manufacturing cost can be attained.
      <br/>
      The present inventors have also found that among the SCE type electron-emitting devices, an electron-beam source where an electron-emitting portion or its peripheral portion comprises a fine particle film is excellent in electron-emitting characteristic and further, it can be easily manufactured.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, this type of electron-beam source is the most appropriate electron-beam source to be employed in a multi electron-beam source of a high luminance and large-screened image display apparatus.
      <br/>
      In the display panel of the embodiment, SCE type electron-emitting devices each having an electron-emitting portion or peripheral portion formed from a fine particle film are employed.

      First, the basic structure, manufacturing method and characteristic of the preferred SCE type electron-emitting device will be described, and the structure of the multi electron-beam source having simple-matrix wired SCE type electron-emitting devices will be described later.

      Next, a method of manufacturing a preferred flat SCE type electron-emitting device will be described with reference to FIGS. 7A to 7E which are cross-sectional views showing the manufacturing processes of the SCE type electron-emitting device.

      Note that reference numerals are the same as those in FIGS. 6A and 6B.
    </p>
    <p num="125">(1) First, as shown in FIG. 7A, the device electrodes 1102 and 1103 are formed on the substrate 1101.</p>
    <p num="126">
      Upon formation of the electrodes 1102 and 1103, first, the substrate 1101 is fully washed with a detergent, pure water and an organic solvent, then, material of the device electrodes is deposited there (as a depositing method, a vacuum film-forming technique such as evaporation and sputtering may be used).
      <br/>
      Thereafter, patterning using a photolithography etching technique is performed on the deposited electrode material.
      <br/>
      Thus, the pair of device electrodes 1102 and 1103 shown in FIG. 7A are formed.
    </p>
    <p num="127">(2) Next, as shown in FIG. 7B, the conductive thin film 1104 is formed.</p>
    <p num="128">
      Upon formation of the conductive thin film 1104, first, an organic metal solvent is applied to the substrate 1101 in FIG. 7A, then the applied solvent is dried and sintered, thus forming a fine particle film.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the fine particle film is patterned, in accordance with the photolithography etching method, into a predetermined shape.
      <br/>
      The organic metal solvent means a solvent of organic metal compound containing material of minute particles, used for forming the conductive thin film, as main component (i.e., Pd in this embodiment).
      <br/>
      In the embodiment, application of organic metal solvent is made by dipping, however, any other method such as a spinner method and spraying method may be employed.
    </p>
    <p num="129">As a film-forming method of the conductive thin film made with the minute particles, the application of organic metal solvent used in the embodiment can be replaced with any other method such as a vacuum evaporation method, a sputtering method or a chemical vapor-phase accumulation method.</p>
    <p num="130">(3) Then, as shown in FIG. 7C, appropriate voltage is applied between the device electrodes 1102 and 1103, from a power source 1110 for the forming processing, then the forming processing is performed, thus forming the electron-emitting portion 1105.</p>
    <p num="131">
      The forming processing here is electric energization of a conductive thin film 1104 formed of a fine particle film, to appropriately destroy, deform, or deteriorate a part of the conductive thin film, thus changing the film to have a structure suitable for electron emission.

      In the conductive thin film, the portion changed for electron emission (i.e., electron-emitting portion 1105) has an appropriate fissure in the thin film.
      <br/>
      Comparing the thin film 1104 having the electron-emitting portion 1105 with the thin film before the forming processing, the electric resistance measured between the device electrodes 1102 and 1103 has greatly increased.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      The forming processing will be explained in detail with reference to FIG. 8 showing an example of waveform of appropriate voltage applied from the forming power source 1110.
      <br/>
      Preferably, in case of forming a conductive thin film of a fine particle film, a pulse-form voltage is employed.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a triangular-wave pulse having a pulse width T1 is continuously applied at pulse interval of T2, as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      Upon application, a wave peak value Vpf of the triangular-wave pulse is sequentially increased.
      <br/>
      Further, a monitor pulse Pm to monitor status of forming the electron-emitting portion 1105 is inserted between the triangular-wave pulses at appropriate intervals, and current that flows at the insertion is measured by a galvanometer 1111.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      In this example, in 10-5 Torr vacuum atmosphere, the pulse width T1 is set to 1 msec; and the pulse interval T2, to 10 msec.
      <br/>
      The wave peak value Vpf is increased by 0.1 V, at each pulse.
      <br/>
      Each time the triangular-wave has been applied for five pulses, the monitor pulse Pm is inserted.
      <br/>
      To avoid ill-effecting the forming processing, a voltage Vpm of the monitor pulse is set to 0.1 V. When the electric resistance between the device electrodes 1102 and 1103 becomes 1 * 106  OMEGA , i.e., the current measured by the galvanometer 1111 upon application of monitor pulse becomes 1 * 10-7 A or less, the electrification of the forming processing is terminated.

    <p num="134">
      Note that the above processing method is preferable to the SCE type electron-emitting device of this embodiment.
      <br/>
      In case of changing the design of the SCE type electron-emitting device concerning, e.g., the material or thickness of the fine particle film, or the device electrode interval L, the conditions for electrification are preferably changed in accordance with the change of device design.
    </p>
    <p num="135">(4) Next, as shown in FIG. 7D, appropriate voltage is applied, from an activation power source 1112, between the device electrodes 1102 and 1103, and the activation processing is performed to improve electron-emitting characteristics obtained in the preceding step.</p>
    <p num="136">
      The activation processing here is electrification of the electron-emitting portion 1105, formed by the forming processing, on appropriate condition(s), for depositing carbon or carbon compound around the electron-emitting portion 1105 (In FIG. 7D, the deposited material of carbon or carbon compound is shown as material 1113).
      <br/>
      Comparing the electron-emitting portion 1105 with that before the activation processing, the emission current at the same applied voltage has become, typically 100 times or greater.
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      The activation is made by periodically applying a voltage pulse in 10-4 or 10-5 Torr vacuum atmosphere, to accumulate carbon or carbon compound mainly derived from organic compound(s) existing in the vacuum atmosphere.

      The accumulated material 1113 is any of graphite monocrystalline, graphite polycrystalline, amorphous carbon or mixture thereof.

      More specifically, a rectangular-wave voltage Vac is set to 14 V; a pulse width T3, to 1 msec; and a pulse interval T4, to 10 msec.

      While applying voltage from the activation power source 1112, the galvanometer 1116 measures the emission current Ie, thus monitors the progress of activation processing, to control the operation of the activation power source 1112.

    <p num="157">
      FIG. 12 shows a typical example of (emission current Ie) to (device voltage (i.e., voltage to be applied to the device) Vf) characteristic and (device current If) to (device application voltage Vf) characteristic of the device used in the display apparatus.
      <br/>
      Note that compared with the device current If, the emission current Ie is very small, therefore it is difficult to illustrate the emission current Ie by the same measure of that for the device current If.
      <br/>
      In addition, these characteristics change due to change of designing parameters such as the size or shape of the device.
      <br/>
      For these reasons, two lines in the graph of FIG. 12 are respectively given in arbitrary units.
    </p>
    <p num="158">Regarding the emission current Ie, the device used in the display apparatus has three characteristics as follows:</p>
    <p num="159">First, when voltage of a predetermined level (referred to as "threshold voltage Vth") or greater is applied to the device, the emission current Ie drastically increases, however, with voltage lower than the threshold voltage Vth, almost no emission current Ie is detected.</p>
    <p num="160">That is, regarding the emission current Ie, the device has a nonlinear characteristic based on the clear threshold voltage Vth.</p>
    <p num="161">
      Second, the emission current Ie changes in dependence upon the device application voltage Vf.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the emission current Ie can be controlled by changing the device voltage Vf.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      Third, the emission current Ie is output quickly in response to application of the device voltage Vf.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, an electrical charge amount of electrons to be emitted from the device can be controlled by changing period of application of the device voltage Vf.
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      The SCE type electron-emitting device with the above three characteristics is preferably applied to the display apparatus.
      <br/>
      For example, in a display apparatus having a large number of devices provided corresponding to the number of pixels of a display screen, if the first characteristic is utilized, display by sequential scanning of display screen is possible.
      <br/>
      This means that the threshold voltage Vth or greater is appropriately applied to a driven device, while voltage lower than the threshold voltage Vth is applied to an unselected device.
      <br/>
      In this manner, sequentially changing the driven devices enables display by sequential scanning of display screen.

      The sync signal separation circuit 1706 is a circuit for separating a sync signal component and a luminance signal component from an externally input NTSC television signal.

      As is known well, this circuit can be easily formed by using a frequency separation (filter) circuit.
      <br/>
      The sync signal separated by the sync signal separation circuit 1706 is constituted by vertical and horizontal sync signals, as is known well.
      <br/>
      In this case, for the sake of descriptive convenience, the sync signal is shown as the signal Tsync.
      <br/>
      The luminance signal component of an image, which is separated from the television signal, is expressed as a signal DATA for the sake of descriptive convenience.

      This signal is input to the shift register 1704.

      The shift register 1704 operates on the basis of the control signal Tsft sent from the control circuit 1703.

      The electron-emitting device 15 according to the present invention has the following basic characteristics with respect to an emission current Ie, as described above with reference to FIG. 12. A clear threshold voltage Vth (8 V in the surface-conduction emission type electron-emitting device of the embodiment described later) is set for electron emission.
      <br/>
      Each device emits electrons only when a voltage equal to or higher than the threshold voltage Vth is applied.
    </p>
    <p num="184">
      In addition, the emission current Ie changes with a change in voltage equal to or higher than the electron emission threshold voltage Vth, as shown in FIG. 12. Obviously, when a pulse-like voltage is to be applied to this device, no electrons are emitted if the voltage is lower than the electron emission threshold voltage Vth.
      <br/>
      If, however, the voltage is equal to or higher than the electron emission threshold voltage Vth, the electron-emitting device emits an electron beam.
      <br/>
      In this case, the intensity of the output electron beam can be controlled by changing a peak value Vm of the pulse.

      Slightly different circuits are used for the modulated signal generator depending on whether the line memory 1705 outputs a digital or analog signal.

    <p num="191">Structure of Intermediate Layer</p>
    <p num="192">
      The present invention will be explained in more detail with reference to FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Numeral 30 denotes a face plate (face substrate) including fluorescent substances and a metal back; 31, a rear plate (rear substrate) including an electron source substrate; 50, a main body for the spacer; 51, a high-resistance film on the surface of the spacer; 52, an electrode (intermediate layer) on the face plate side; 53, an electrode (intermediate layer) on the rear plate side; and 13, device driving wiring.
      <br/>
      These parts 50, 51, 52, 53, and 13 constitute a support member (frits (not shown in FIG. 1) are also a constituent element of the support member when the intermediate layer 52 and the face plate 30, and the intermediate layer 53 and the rear plate 31 (i.e., the intermediate layer 53 and the wiring 13) are respectively connected via the frits).
      <br/>
      Numeral 111 denotes a device 112, typical electron beam orbits; and 25, equipotential lines.
      <br/>
      Symbol a denotes a length of the third region (length of the region having a resistivity R3) corresponding to the distance from the lower surface of the face plate to the lower end of the intermediate layer 52; and b, a length of the first region (length of the region having a resistivity R1) corresponding to the distance from the upper surface of the rear plate 31 to the upper end of the intermediate layer 53.
    </p>
    <p num="193">
      If some of electrons emitted near the spacer strike the spacer or ions produced by the action of emitted electrons attach to the spacer due to any reason, the spacer is charged.
      <br/>
      The orbits of electrons emitted by the devices are changed by the charge-up of the spacer, and the electrons reach positions different from proper positions to distort an image near the spacer.
      <br/>
      To avoid this, the high-resistance film 51 is formed on the surface of the spacer.
      <br/>
      As the electron emission amount increases, the charge-up elimination ability becomes poorer, and the landing position of the beam fluctuates depending on the electron emission amount.
      <br/>
      To prevent this fluctuation, the electrons must be made not to directly strike the spacer.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, as shown in FIG. 1, the intermediate layer 52 for setting the spacer at the same potential as that of the electron source substrate is formed on the side surface of the spacer in contact with the face plate, and the intermediate layer 53 for setting the spacer at the same potential as that of the electron source substrate is formed on the side surface of the spacer in contact with the electron source substrate.
      <br/>
      At this time, the potential near the spacer has a distribution indicated by the equipotential lines 25.
      <br/>
      By this potential distribution, electrons emitted by the devices 111 follow orbits like the orbits 112 to temporarily space apart from the spacer near the rear plate and to be drawn by the spacer near the face plate.
      <br/>
      Since the electron beam is more accelerated nearer the face plate, the intermediate layer 52 is made longer than the intermediate layer 53, and the potential near the face plate is more steeply changed than that near the rear plate.
    </p>
    <p num="194">
      If the electron emission amount is large even when the electrons emitted by the devices are made not to directly strike the spacer, the spacer is more greatly charged on the face plate side, as show in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The charge-up is the largest at a portion corresponding to 1/10 of the distance between the electron source substrate and the face plate from the face plate toward the rear plate.
      <br/>
      From this, the intermediate layer 52 on the side surface of the spacer in contact with the face plate is made to have a length equal to or more than 1/10 of the distance between the electron source substrate and the face plate.
    </p>
    <p num="195">
      Since too long intermediate layers 52 and 53 of the spacer lead a decrease in discharge breakdown voltage and an excess shift of the beam position, the heights of the electrodes of the spacer are set such that the accelerating voltage and the exposure length of the high-resistance film of the spacer have a relationship of 8 kV/mm or less.
      <br/>
      To further increase the discharge breakdown voltage, the lengths of the electrodes of the spacer are desirably set such that the accelerating voltage and the exposure length of the high-resistance film have a relationship of 4 kV/mm or less.

    <p num="196">The intermediate layers may extend to the abutment surface of the spacer against the face plate and/or the abutment surface of the spacer against the electron source substrate, as shown in FIGS. 3A-3C.

      In the seventh embodiment, an image apparatus was formed by arranging spacers by the same method as in the first embodiment, and driven similarly to the first embodiment to obtain a high-quality image in which a beam shift was suppressed even near the spacer.

      FIG. 27 is a cross-sectional view of an image forming apparatus near a spacer in the first embodiment for explaining the eighth embodiment.
      <br/>
      According to the eighth embodiment, in the same structure as that in the first embodiment, a distance h between an electron source substrate and a face plate is set to 3.0 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="228">
      Referring to FIG. 27, numeral 31 denotes a rear plate including an electron source substrate; 30, a face plate including fluorescent substances and a metal back; 50, a spacer; 324, an intermediate layer on the rear plate side; 325, an intermediate layer on the face plate side; 13, wiring; 111, a device; 112, an electron beam orbit; and 51, a high-resistance film.

      In the eighth embodiment, a length d3 of the intermediate layer 325 on the face plate side was set to 800  MU m, a length d1 of the intermediate layer 324 on the rear plate side was set to 1,100  MU m, and the length of each spacer in the wiring direction was set to 80 mm.

      In this case, the high-resistance film of the spacer had a resistance of about 6 * 109  OMEGA /mm per unit length between the face plate and the rear plate.

      The intermediate layer 324 on the rear plate side had a resistance of about 9 * 108  OMEGA /mm per unit length, and the intermediate layer 325 on the face plate side had a resistance of about 1 * 104  OMEGA /mm per unit length.
      <br/>
      When a voltage of 6.5 kV was applied to the face plate 30 to drive the devices, the position, on the face plate 30, of a beam from the nearest line shifted to the spacer by about 110  MU m for the electron emission amount Ie of 3  MU A per device, and a positional variation (fluctuation) of about 150  MU m was confirmed for the electron emission amount Ie of 0.14 to 5.6  MU A per device.

      The position of a beam from the second nearest line shifted to the spacer by about 300  MU m, and a positional variation (fluctuation) of about 70  MU m depending on Ie was confirmed.

      From these results, an image forming apparatus in which the positional variation (fluctuation) depending on Ie is small can be provided, similar to the first embodiment.

    <p num="230">In the eighth embodiment, the electrode 325 on the face plate side was formed by sputtering Al in the Ar atmosphere to a thickness of 1,000 A. The electrode 324 on the rear plate side was formed by sputtering a chromium oxide target in the Ar atmosphere to a thickness of 2,000 A. As the high-resistance film 51, nickel oxide was used, and the nickel target was sputtered in the oxygen plasma to a thickness of 1,500 A. The spacer substrate was made of a borosilicate glass.</p>
    <p num="231">Even if the intermediate layer on the face plate side is shorter than the intermediate layer on the rear plate side, satisfactory deflection can be applied to electrons as far as a significant difference is set between the resistance of the intermediate layer per unit length on the face plate side and the resistance of the intermediate layer per unit length on the rear plate side, and the resistance of the intermediate layer per unit length on the face plate side is lower.</p>
    <p num="232">
      As has been described above, according to the present invention, preferable deflection can be applied to electrons which are emitted by the electron-emitting devices to reach the member to be irradiated.
      <br/>
      In particular, electrons can be made to reach positions nearer desired landing positions while the electrons are prevented from striking the support member.
      <br/>
      Fluctuation of the electron landing position depending on the number of emitted electrons can be reduced.
      <br/>
      In addition, when the image display apparatus is used as an image forming apparatus, distortion and fluctuation of an image can be reduced.
