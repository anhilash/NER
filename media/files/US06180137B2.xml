    <p num="2">
      Etherlipids are synthetic analogues of platelet activating factor (PAF; 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), an effector generally believed to be involved in a variety of physiological processes, such as inflammation, the immune response, allergic reactions and reproduction.
      <br/>
      Etherlipids have been shown to be effective antitumor agents in animals, and are believed to be selectively cytotoxic to a broad variety of cancer cells (see, for example, Dietzfelbinger et al. (1993); Zeisig et al. (1993); Powis et al. (1990); Berdel (1991); Bhatia and Hadju (1991); Reed et al. (1991); Workman (1991); Workman et al. (1991); Bazill and Dexter (1990); Berdel (1990); Counsell et al. (1990); Tritton and Hickman (1990); Muschiol et al. (1990); Layton et al. (1980); Runge et al. (1980); Great Britain Patent No. 1,583,661; U.S. Pat. No. 3,752,886).
      <br/>
      Etherlipids have also been shown to be antimetastatic and anti-invasive, and to be capable of cell differentiation induction.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Mechanisms of etherlipid cytotoxicity, while not definitively established, appear to involve action at, and possible disruption of, the cell membrane.
      <br/>
      The selective cytotoxicity of etherlipids may involve intracellular accumulation and differential activity of alkyl cleavage enzymes.
      <br/>
      Etherlipids may also be selective inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C and protein kinase C activities, as well as of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis.
      <br/>
      Hence, etherlipids are potentially quite useful as therapeutic agents.
      <br/>
      However, their administration can also lead to hemolysis, hepatic dysfunction and gastrointestinal disorders.
      <br/>
      Applicants have found that certain liposomal formulations of etherlipids can buffer these toxicities without inhibiting anticancer efficacy, and thereby can provide a more therapeutically useful basis for etherlipid administration.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">This invention provides a liposome comprising a bilayer having a lipid component which comprises: (a) a phosphatidylcholine; (b) a sterol; (c) a headgroup derivatized lipid containing a phosphatidylethanolamine and a moiety selected from the group consisting of dicarboxylic acids, gangliosides, polyethylene glycols and polyalkylethers, which headgroup-derivatized lipid comprises from about 5 mole percent to about 20 mole percent of the bilayer's lipid component; and, (d) an etherlipid having the following formula:  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="10">the etherlipid comprising from greater than about 10 mole percent, to less than about 30 mole percent, of the bilayer's lipid component.</p>
    <p num="11">
      "Liposomes" are self-assembling structures comprising one or more lipid bilayers, each of which surrounds an aqueous compartment and comprises two opposing monolayers of amphipathic lipid molecules.
      <br/>
      Amphipathic lipids comprise a polar (hydrophilic) headgroup region covalently linked to one or two non-polar (hydrophobic) acyl chains.
      <br/>
      Energetically unfavorable contacts between the hydrophobic acyl chains and the aqueous medium are generally believed to induce lipid molecules to rearrange such that the polar headgroups are oriented towards the aqueous medium while the acyl chains reorient towards the interior of the bilayer.
      <br/>
      An energetically stable structure is formed in which the acyl chains are effectively shielded from coming into contact with the aqueous medium.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Liposomes can have a single lipid bilayer (unilamellar liposomes, "ULVs"), or multiple lipid bilayers (multilamellar liposomes, "MLVs"), and can be made by a variety of methods (for a review, see, for example, Deamer and Uster (1983)).
      <br/>
      These methods include without limitation: Bangham's methods for making multilamellar liposomes (MLVs); Lenk's, Fountain's and Cullis' methods for making MLVs with substantially equal interlamellar solute distribution (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,522,803, 4,588,578, 5,030,453, 5,169,637 and 4,975,282); and Papahadjopoulos et al.'s reverse-phase evaporation method (U.S. Pat. No. 4,235,871) for preparing oligolamellar liposomes.
      <br/>
      ULVs can be produced from MLVs by such methods as sonication (see Papahadjopoulos et al. (1968)) or extrusion (U.S. Pat. No. 5,008,050 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,059,421).
      <br/>
      The etherlipid liposome of this invention can be produced by the methods of any of these disclosures, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Various methodologies, such as sonication, homogenization, French Press application and milling can be used to prepare liposomes of a smaller size from larger liposomes.
      <br/>
      Extrusion (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,008,050) can be used to size reduce liposomes, that is to produce liposomes having a predetermined mean size by forcing the liposomes, under pressure, through filter pores of a defined, selected size.
      <br/>
      Tangential flow filtration (see WO89/008846), can also be used to regularize the size of liposomes, that is, to produce liposomes having a population of liposomes having less size heterogeneity, and a more homogeneous, defined size distribution.
      <br/>
      The contents of these documents are incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Liposome sizes can also be determined by a number of techniques, such as quasi-electric light scattering, and with equipment, e.g., Nicomp.RTM. particle sizers, well within the possession of ordinarily skilled artisans.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The liposomes of this invention can be unilamellar or multilamellar.
      <br/>
      Preferably the liposomes are unilamellar and have diameters of less than about 200 nm, more preferably, from greater than about 50 nm to less than about 200 nm; such liposomes are preferably produced by a method comprising the steps of: dissolving lipids in a suitable organic solvent so as to establish a lipidic solution; removing the organic solvent from the resulting lipidic solution; adding an aqueous solution so as to form liposomes; and, then extruding the resulting liposomes through a suitable filter.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Liposomes of the 50-200 nm size are preferred because they generally believed to circulate longer in mammals than do larger liposomes, which are more quickly recognized by the mammals' reticuloendothelial systems ("RES"), and hence, more quickly cleared from the circulation.
      <br/>
      Longer circulation can enhance therapeutic efficacy by allowing more liposomes to reach their intended site of actions, e.g., tumors or inflammations.
      <br/>
      Small unilamellar liposomes, i.e., those generally less than 50 nm in diameter, carry amounts of bioactive agents which may be, in some cases, too low to be of sufficient therapeutic benefit.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      R1 of the etherlipid, the chain attached at the carbon -1 position of its glycerol backbone by way of an oxygen, has the formula Y1 Y2.
      <br/>
      Y2 is CH3 or CO2 H, but preferably is CH3.
      <br/>
      Y1 is --(CH2)n1 (CH.dbd.CH)n2 (CH2)n3 (CH.dbd.CH)n4 (CH2)n5 (CH.dbd.CH)n6 (CH2)n7 (CH.dbd.CH)n8 (CH2)n9 ; the sum of n1+2n2+n3+2n4+n5+2n6+n7+2n8+n9 is an integer of from 3 to 23; that is, the acyl chain is from 4-24 carbon atoms in length. n1 is equal to zero or is an integer of from 1 to 23; n3 is equal to zero or is an integer of from 1 to 20; n5 is equal to zero or is an integer of from 1 to 17; n7 is equal to zero or is an integer of from 1 to 14; n9 is equal to zero or is an integer of from 1 to 11; and each of n2, n4, n6 and 8 is independently equal to zero or 1.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The hydrocarbon chain is preferably saturated, that is, it preferably has no double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms, each of n2, n4, n6 and n8 then being equal to zero.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, Y1 is preferably (CH2)n1. More preferably, R1 is (CH2)n1 CH3, and most preferably, is (CH2)17 CH3. Alternatively, the chain can have one or more double bonds, that is, it can be unsaturated, and one or more of n2, n4, n6 and n8 can be equal to 1.
      <br/>
      For example, when the unsaturated hydrocarbon has one double bond, n2 is equal to 1, n4, n6 and n8 are each equal to zero and Y1 is (CH2)n1 CH.dbd.CH(CH2)n3. n1 is then equal to zero or is an integer of from 1 to 21, and n3 is also zero or is an integer of from 1 to 20, at least one of n1 or n3 not being equal to zero.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Z is oxygen, sulfur, NH, or --NHC(O)--, Z then being connected to the methyl group by way of either the nitrogen or carbonyl carbon.
      <br/>
      Z can also be --OC(O)--, it then being connected to the methyl group by way of either the oxygen or carbonyl carbon atom.
      <br/>
      Preferably, Z is O; accordingly, this invention's glycerol-based etherlipids preferably have a methoxy group at the sn-2 position of their glycerol backbone.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      R2 is an alkyl group, or a halogen-substituted alkyl group, having the formula (C(X1)n10 (X2)n11)n12 CX3 X4 X5, wherein each of X1, X2, X3, X4, and X5 is independently hydrogen or a halogen, but is preferably hydrogen. n10 is equal to zero, 1 or 2; n11 is equal to zero, 1, or 2; and n12 is equal to zero or an integer of from 1 to 23, but is most preferably, zero, R2 then being CX3 X4 X5.
      <br/>
      X3, X4, and X5 are most preferably H, R2 then being CH3.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the etherlipid preferably has a methyl group attached to its carbon -2.
      <br/>
      However, R2 can then also be CH2 F, CHF2 or CF3.
      <br/>
      When n12 is not zero, the sum of n10+n11 is equal to 2, n12 is preferably equal to 1, and R2 is preferably CH2 CH3, CH2 CF3 or CF2 CF3.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Most preferably, the etherlipid is one in which Y2 is CH3, R1 is (CH2)n1 CH3, R2 is CH3 and Z is O. The preferred etherlipid is therefore:  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="21">that is, 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ("ET-18-OCH3 " or "edelfosine").</p>
    <p num="22">
      Preferably, the phosphatidylcholine ("PC") is partially or wholly unsaturated, that is, it has two acyl chains, at least one of which has at least one double bond between adjacent carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      More preferably, presently, the PC is dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine ("DOPC").
      <br/>
      The liposome's lipid bilayer also contains a sterol, which generally affects the fluidity of lipid bilayers (see, for example, Lewis and McElhaney (1992) and Darnell et al. (1986)) Accordingly, sterol interactions with surrounding hydrocarbon chains generally inhibit emigration of these chains from the bilayer.
      <br/>
      The sterol of the liposomes of this invention is preferably, but not necessarily, cholesterol, and can also be a variety of other sterolic compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A "headgroup-derivatized" lipid is a lipid which, when present in a liposomal lipid bilayer with an etherlipid, can buffer the toxicity of the etherlipid.
      <br/>
      That is, the derivatized lipid can decrease the etherlipid's toxicity, such that it is generally less toxic than the free form of the etherlipid.
      <br/>
      Headgroup-derivatized lipids generally are amphipathic lipids comprising hydrophobic acyl chains, and a phosphorylethanolamine group to which a suitable chemical moiety has been attached.
      <br/>
      Acyl chains are those which can adopt compatible packing configurations with the hydrophobic portions of other lipids present in the bilayer, and which can interact with an etherlipid such that release of the etherlipid from the bilayer is inhibited and etherlipid toxicity is buffered; these are saturated or unsaturated, straight-chained or branched, and typically contain from 4 to 24 carbon atoms in a straight chain.
      <br/>
      Preferred acyl chains are palmitate or oleate chains; hence preferred headgroup-modified lipids are dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine ("DPPE"), palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine ("POPE") or dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine ("DOPE"); most preferably, presently, the lipid is DOPE.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Chemical moieties suitable for attachment to such lipids are those, such as dicarboxylic acids, gangliosides, polyethylene glycols, polyalkyl ethers and the like, which can be attached to the amino group of a phosphorylethanolamine, and which give rise to lipids having toxicity buffering, circulation-enhancing properties.
      <br/>
      Means of identifying suitable chemical moieties, for example by subjecting derivatized lipids to in vitro and in vivo toxicity testing, are well known to, and readily practiced by, ordinarily skilled artisans given the teachings of this invention.
      <br/>
      Means of attaching chemical moieties to phosphorylethanolamine groups are also well known to, and readily practiced by, ordinarily skilled artisans.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Toxicity buffering capacities of headgroup-derivatized lipids can be determined by a number of in vitro and in vivo testing methods well known to, and readily practiced by, ordinarily skilled artisans, given the teachings of this invention.
      <br/>
      For example, etherlipid-induced red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis can be examined in vitro by combining an etherlipid with an RBC suspension, incubating the combination, and then quantitating the percentage of RBC lysis.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Toxicity-buffering can also be assessed by determining the etherlipid's therapeutic window "TW," which is a numerical value derived from the relationship between the compound's induction of hemolysis and its ability to inhibit the growth of tumor cells.
      <br/>
      TW values are determined in accordance with the formula Hl5 /Gl50 (wherein "Hl5 " equals the concentration of compound inducing the hemolysis of 5% of the red blood cells in a culture, and wherein "Gl50 " equals the dose of compound inducing fifty percent growth inhibition in a population of cells exposed to the agent).
      <br/>
      The higher an agent's Hl5 value, the less hemolytic is the agent--higher Hl5 's mean that greater concentrations of compound are required to be present in order for the compound to induce 5% hemolysis.
      <br/>
      Hence, the higher its Hl5, the more therapeutically beneficial is a compound, because more of it can be given before inducing the same amount of hemolysis as an agent with a lower Hl5.
      <br/>
      By contrast, lower Gl50 's indicate better therapeutic agents--a lower Gl50 value indicates that a lesser concentration of an agent is required for 50% growth inhibition.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the higher is its Hl5 value and the lower is its Gl50 value, the better are a compound's agent's therapeutic properties.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Generally, when a bioactive agent's TW is less than 1, it cannot be used effectively as a therapeutic agent.
      <br/>
      That is, the agent's Hl5 value is sufficiently low, and its Gl5) value sufficiently high, that it is generally not possible to administer enough of the agent to achieve a sufficient level of tumor growth inhibition without also attaining an unacceptable level of hemolysis.
      <br/>
      Etherlipid liposomes having bilayers that also comprise headgroup-derivatized lipids have TW's of greater than 1.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the TW of an etherlipid in a liposomal bilayer also comprising a headgroup-derivatized lipid is greater than about 1.5, more preferably, greater than about 2, and still more preferably, greater than about 3.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Headgroup-derivatized lipids can also be circulation-enhancing lipids, that is, the modifications directed to lipid toxicity buffering can also afford circulation enhancement.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, headgroup-derivatized lipids can inhibit clearance of liposomes from the circulatory systems of animals to which they have been administered.
      <br/>
      Liposomes are generally believed to be cleared from an animal's body by way of its reticuloendothelial system (RES).
      <br/>
      Avoiding RES clearance means that the frequency of liposome administration can be reduced, and that less of a liposome-associated bioactive agent need be administered to achieve desired serum levels of the agent.
      <br/>
      Enhanced circulation times can also allow targeting of liposomes to non-RES containing tissues.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Liposome outer surfaces are believed to become coated with serum proteins, such as opsonins, in animals' circulatory systems.
      <br/>
      Without intending in any way to be limited by theory, it is believed that liposome clearance can be inhibited by modifying the outer surface of liposomes such that binding of serum proteins thereto is generally inhibited.
      <br/>
      Effective surface modification, that is, alterations to the outer surfaces of liposomes which result in inhibition of opsonization and RES uptake, is believed to be accomplished by incorporating into liposomal bilayers lipids whose polar headgroups have been derivatized by attachment thereto of a chemical moiety which can inhibit the binding of serum proteins to liposomes such that the pharmacokinetic behavior of the liposomes in the circulatory systems of animals is altered (see, e.g., Blume et al. (1993); Gabizon et al. (1993); Park et al. (1992); Woodle et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556; and, U.S. Pat. No. 4,837,028).
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Presently, dicarboxylic acids, such as glutaric, sebacic, succinic and tartaric acids, are preferred components of headgroup-derivatized lipids.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the dicarboxylic acid is glutaric acid ("GA").
      <br/>
      Accordingly, preferred headgroup-derivatized lipids include phosphatidylethanolamine-dicarboxylic acids such as dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine-glutaric acid ("DPPE-GA"), palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine-glutaric acid ("POPE-GA") and dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine-glutaric acid ("DOPE-GA").
      <br/>
      Most preferably, presently, the derivatized lipid is DOPE-GA.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The liposomes of this invention can comprise one or more additional lipids, that is, lipids in addition to the phosphatidylcholine, sterol, headgroup-derivatized lipid and etherlipid already present in the liposomes' bilayers.
      <br/>
      Additional lipids are selected for their ability to adapt compatible packing conformations with the other lipid components of the bilayer such that the lipid constituents are tightly packed, and release of the lipids from the bilayer is inhibited.
      <br/>
      Lipid-based factors contributing to compatible packing conformations are well known to ordinarily skilled artisans and include, without limitation, acyl chain length and degree of unsaturation, as well as the headgroup size and charge.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, suitable additional lipids, including various phosphatidylethanolamines ("PE's") such as egg phosphatidylethanolamine ("EPE") or dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine ("DOPE") can be selected by ordinarily skilled artisans without undue experimentation.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Preferred embodiments of this invention have the phosphatidylcholine being DOPC, the sterol being cholesterol ("chol"), the headgroup-derivatized lipid being DOPE-GA and the etherlipid being ET-18-OCH3.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, presently, the liposome comprises DOPC, chol, DOPE-GA and ET-18-O-CH3 in a respective molar ratio of 4:3:1:2, wherein DOPC comprises 40 mole % of the bilayer lipid component, chol 30% mole, DOPE-GA 10 mole % and the etherlipid 20 mole %. Preferably, the liposomes are unilamellar and have an average diameter of from about 50 nm to about 200 nm, "average" meaning that the median diameter of a population of this invention's liposomes is between about 50 and 200 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The liposome can comprise an additional bioactive agent, that is, a bioactive agent in addition to the etherlipid.
      <br/>
      A "bioactive agent" is any compound or composition of matter that can be administered to animals, preferably humans.
      <br/>
      Such agents can have biological activity in animals; the agents can also be used diagnostically in the animals.
      <br/>
      Bioactive agents which may be associated with liposomes include, but are not limited to: antiviral agents such as acyclovir, zidovudine and the interferons; antibacterial agents such as aminoglycosides, cephalosporins and tetracyclines; antifungal agents such as polyene antibiotics, imidazoles and triazoles; antimetabolic agents such as folic acid, and purine and pyrimidine analogs; antineoplastic agents such as the anthracycline antibiotics and plant alkaloids; sterols such as cholesterol; carbohydrates, e.g., sugars and starches; amino acids, peptides, proteins such as cell receptor proteins, immunoglobulins, enzymes, hormones, neurotransmitters and glycoproteins; dyes; radiolabels such as radioisotopes and radioisotope-labeled compounds; radiopaque compounds; fluorescent compounds; mydriatic compounds; bronchodilators; local anesthetics; and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Liposomal bioactive agent formulations can enhance the therapeutic index of the bioactive agent, for example by buffering the agent's toxicity.
      <br/>
      Liposomes can also reduce the rate at which a bioactive agent is cleared from the circulation of animals.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, liposomal formulation of bioactive agents can mean that less of the agent need be administered to achieve the desired effect.
      <br/>
      Additional bioactive agents preferred for the liposome of this invention include antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic agents, or therapeutic lipids, for example, ceramides.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the additional bioactive agent is an antineoplastic agent.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Liposomes can be loaded with one or more biologically active agents by solubilizing the agent in the lipid or aqueous phase used to prepare the liposomes.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, ionizable bioactive agents can be loaded into liposomes by first forming the liposomes, establishing an electrochemical potential, e.g., by way of a pH gradient, across the outermost liposomal bilayer, and then adding the ionizable agent to the aqueous medium external to the liposome (see Bally et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,077,056 and WO86/01102).

    <p num="36">
      The liposome of this invention can be dehydrated, stored and then reconstituted such that a substantial portion of its internal contents are retained.
      <br/>
      Liposomal dehydration generally requires use of a hydrophilic drying protectant such as a disaccharide sugar at both the inside and outside surfaces of the liposome bilayers (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,635).
      <br/>
      This hydrophilic compound is generally believed to prevent the rearrangement of the lipids in the liposome, so that the size and contents are maintained during the drying procedure and through subsequent rehydration.
      <br/>
      Appropriate qualities for such drying protectants are that they be strong hydrogen bond acceptors, and possess stereochemical features that preserve the intramolecular spacing of the liposome bilayer components.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the drying protectant can be omitted if the liposome preparation is not frozen prior to dehydration, and sufficient water remains in the preparation subsequent to dehydration.

"Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers" as used herein are those media generally acceptable for use in connection with the administration of lipids and liposomes, including liposomal bioactive agent formulations, to animals, including humans.
      <br/>
      Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are generally formulated according to a number of factors well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled artisan to determine and account for, including without limitation: the particular liposomal bioactive agent used, its concentration, stability and intended bioavailability; the disease, disorder or condition being treated with the liposomal composition; the subject, its age, size and general condition; and the composition's intended route of administration, e.g., nasal, oral, ophthalmic, topical, transdermal, vaginal, subcutaneous, intramammary, intraperitoneal, intravenous, or intramuscular (see, for example, Nairn (1985)).
      <br/>
      Typical pharmaceutically acceptable carriers used in parenteral bioactive agent administration include, for example, D5W, an aqueous solution containing 5% weight by volume of dextrose, and physiological saline.
      <br/>
      Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can contain additional ingredients, for example those which enhance the stability of the active ingredients included, such as preservatives and anti-oxidants.

      Further provided is a method of treating a mammal afflicted with a cancer, e.g., a brain, breast, lung, colon or ovarian cancer, or a leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoma, carcinoma, which comprises administering the pharmaceutical composition of this invention to the mammal, etherlipids being believed to be selectively cytotoxic to tumor cells.
      <br/>
      Generally, liposomal etherlipids can be used to treat cancers treated with free, that is, nonliposomal, etherlipids.

      However, encapsulation of an etherlipid in a liposome can enhance its therapeutic index, and therefore make the liposomal etherlipid a more effective treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      An amount of the composition comprising an anticancer effective amount of the etherlipid, typically from about 0.1 to about 1000 mg of the lipid per kg of the mammal's body, is administered, preferably intravenously.
      <br/>
      For the purposes of this invention, "anticancer effective amounts" of liposomal etherlipids are amounts effective to inhibit, ameliorate, lessen or prevent establishment, growth, metastasis or invasion of one or more cancers in animals to which the etherlipids have been administered.
      <br/>
      Anticancer effective amounts are generally chosen in accordance with a number of factors, e.g., the age, size and general condition of the subject, the cancer being treated and the intended route of administration, and determined by a variety of means, for example, dose ranging trials, well known to, and readily practiced by, ordinarily skilled artisans given the teachings of this invention.
      <br/>
      Antineoplastic effective amounts of the liposomal etherlipid of this invention are about the same as such amounts of free, nonliposomal, etherlipids, e.g., from about 0.1 mg of the etherlipid per kg of body weight of the mammal being treated to about 1000 mg per kg.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Preferably, the liposome administered is a unilamellar liposome having an average diameter of from about 50 nm to about 200 nm.
      <br/>
      The anti-cancer treatment method can include administration of one or more bioactive agents in addition to the liposomal etherlipid, these additional agents preferably, but not necessarily, being included in the same liposome as the etherlipid.
      <br/>
      The additional bioactive agents, which can be entrapped in liposomes' internal compartments or sequestered in their lipid bilayers, are preferably, but not necessarily, anticancer agents or cellular growth promoting factors.
    </p>
    <p num="41">The liposomes are also effective as anti-inflammatory agents.</p>
    <p num="42">
      This invention will be better understood from the following examples.
      <br/>
      However, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand that these examples are merely illustrative of the invention as defined in the claims which follow thereafter.

    <p num="43">Example 1</p>
    <p num="44">Preparation</p>
    <p num="45">
      Liposomes were prepared with edelfosine (ET-18-O-CH3, 5 mg/ml), various other lipids obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, Ala., and cholesterol (Sigma Chemical Co.).
      <br/>
      Briefly, the lipids were dissolved in an organic solvent, such as chloroform, at various mole ratios.
      <br/>
      The organic solvent was then removed, and the dried lipids were rehydrated, e.g., with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) (Gibco BRL Life Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y.).
      <br/>
      The resulting liposomes were extruded through 0.1 micron Nuclepore.RTM. filters (see, for example, Mayer et al., 1985).
      <br/>
      Liposome sizes were then determined by light scattering, using a Nicomp.RTM. Model 370 Submicron Particle Sizer.
    </p>
    <p num="46">Example 2</p>
    <p num="47">Red Blood Cell ("RBC") Hemolysis Assay</p>
    <p num="48">
      A 4% suspension of red blood cells (RBCs), 0.5 ml, was washed three times in PBS and then incubated with free (non-liposomal) etherlipid or liposomal etherlipid, prepared as described above.
      <br/>
      These samples were vortexed on a 37 deg. C. agitator for 20 hours, and were then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm. 0.2 ml of the resulting supernatant was diluted to 1 ml with water, and the percentage hemolysis in the sample was quantitated by spectrophotometric examination at 550 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Results from these studies are presented in Table 1 (see below), wherein the concentration ( MU M) of edelfosine required to cause 10 % RBC hemolysis ("Hl10 ") in each formulation is set forth.
      <br/>
      The table's first column is a short-hand designation of the particular formulation, "ELL" standing for "etherlipid liposome." The second column indicates the components of the formulation tested, including dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine "(DOPE"), cholesterol ("CHOL"), dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-glutaric acid ("DOPE-GA"), dioeloyl phosphatidylcholine ("DOPC"), palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine ("POPC"), distearoyl phosphatidylcholine ("DSPC"), egg phosphatidylcholine ("EPC") and edelfosine ("EL," for etherlipid).
      <br/>
      The respective molar ratios of the various lipid components are also set forth.
      <br/>
      The last row of the table gives the Hl10 value for edelfosine alone, i.e., not incorporated in a liposome.
