    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to reagents useful as anticoagulants.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the invention relates to the use of compounds having the formula I, and pharmaceutical salts thereof, as anticoagulants.
      <br/>
      The compounds inhibit the ability of factor VIIa (fVIIa) in complex with tissue factor (TF) to cleave a low-molecular weight substrate and/or factor X and, as a result, blood coagulation initiated by tissue factor is inhibited.
      <br/>
      The invention further relates to the use of compound I as an inhibitor of clotting activity, and methods of inhibiting clotting activity, tissue factor activity, and FVIIa activity as well as methods for treatment of coagulation related diseases states.
    </p>
    <p num="3">The invention also relates to novel compounds with anticoagulative effect and pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Blood coagulation is a process consisting of a complex interaction of various blood components, or factors, which eventually gives rise to a fibrin clot.
      <br/>
      Generally, the blood components which participate in what has been referred to as the coagulation "cascade" are proenzymes or zymogens, enzymatically inactive proteins, which are converted to proteolytic enzymes by the action of an activator, itself an activated clotting factor.
      <br/>
      Coagulation factors that have undergone such a conversion and generally referred to as "active factors", and are designated by the addition of the letter "a" to the name of the coagulation factor (e.g. fVIIa).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Activated factor X (fXa) is required to convert prothrombin to thrombin, which then converts fibrinogen to fibrin as a final stage in forming a fibrin clot.
      <br/>
      There are two systems, or pathways that promote the activation of factor X. The "intrinsic pathway" refers to those reactions that lead to thrombin formation through utilisation of factors present only in plasma.
      <br/>
      A series of protease-mediated activations ultimately generates factor IXa, which, in conjunction with factor Villa, cleaves factor X into Xa.
      <br/>
      An identical proteolysis is effected by fVIIa and its cofactor TF in the "extrinsic pathway" of blood coagulation.
      <br/>
      TF is a membrane bound protein and does not normally circulate in plasma.
      <br/>
      Upon vessel disruption, however, it is exposed and forms a complex with fVIIa to catalyse factor X activation or factor IX activation in the presence of Ca2+ and phospholipid (Nemerson and Gentry, Biochemistry 25:4020-4033 (1986)).
      <br/>
      While the relative importance of the two coagulation pathways in hemostasis is unclear, in recent years fVIIa and TF have been found to play a pivotal role in the initiation and regulation of blood coagulation.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      FVII is a trace plasma glycoprotein that circulates in blood as a single-chain zymogen.
      <br/>
      The zymogen is catalytically inactive (Williams et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264:7536-7543 (1989); Rao et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 85:6687-6691 (1988)).
      <br/>
      Single-chain fVII may be converted to two-chain fVIIa by factor Xa, factor XIIa, factor IXa, fVIIa or thrombin in vitro.
      <br/>
      Factor Xa is believed to be the major physiological activator of fVII.
      <br/>
      Like several other plasma proteins involved in hemostasis, fVII is dependent on vitamin K for its activity, which is required for the gamma-carboxylation of multiple glutamic acid residues that are clustered in the amino terminus of the protein.
      <br/>
      These gamma-carboxylated glutamic acids are required for the metal-associated interaction of fVII with phospholipids.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The conversion of zymogen fVII into the activated two-chain molecule occurs by cleavage of an internal Arg152-Ile153 peptide bond (Hagen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83: 2412-2416 (1986); Thim et al., Biochemistry 27:7785-7793 (1988)).
      <br/>
      In the presence of TF, phospholipids and calcium ions, the two-chain fVIIa rapidly activates factor X or factor IX by limited proteolysis.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      It is often desirable to selectively block or inhibit the coagulation cascade in a patient.
      <br/>
      Anticoagulants such as heparin, coumarin, derivatives of coumarin, indandione derivatives, thrombin inhibitors, factor Xa inhibitors, modified fVII or other agents may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Inhibition of coagulation is beneficial in a number of diseased states, for example 25 during kidney dialysis, or to treat deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and a host of other medical disorders.
      <br/>
      For example, heparin treatment or extracorporeal treatment with citrate ions (U.S. Pat. No. 4,500,309) may be used in dialysis to prevent coagulation during the course of treatment.
      <br/>
      Heparin is also used in preventing deep vein thrombosis in patients undergoing surgery.
      <br/>
      Treatment with heparin and other anticoagulants may, however, have undesirable side effects.
      <br/>
      Available anticoagulants generally act throughout the body, rather than acting specifically at the site of injury, i.e. the site at which the coagulation cascade is active.
      <br/>
      Heparin, for example, may cause severe bleedings.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, with a half-life of approximately 80 minutes, heparin is rapidly cleared from the blood, necessitating frequent administrating.
      <br/>
      Because heparin acts as a cofactor for antithrombin III (AT III), and AT III is rapidly depleted in DIC treatment, it is often difficult to maintain the proper heparin dosage, necessitating continuous monitoring of AT III and heparin levels.
      <br/>
      Heparin is also ineffective if AT III depletion is extreme.
      <br/>
      Further, prolonged use of heparin may also increase platelet aggregation and reduce platelet count, and has been implicated in the development of osteoporosis.
      <br/>
      Indandione derivatives may also have toxic side effects.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Other known anticoagulants comprise thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors derived from bloodsucking organisms.
      <br/>
      Antithrombins, hirudin, hirulog and hirugen are recombinant proteins or peptides derived from the leach Hirudo medicinalis, whereas the factor Xa inhibitor antistatin and the recombinant derivative rTAP are tick-derived proteins.
      <br/>
      Inhibitors of platelet aggregation such as monoclonal antibodies or synthetic peptides, which interfere with the platelet receptor GPIIb/IIa are also effective as anticoagulants.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Bleeding complications are observed as an undesired major disadvantage of anti-thrombin, anti-factor Xa, as well as anti-platelet reagents.
      <br/>
      This side effect is strongly decreased or absent with inhibitors of the fVIIa/TF activity.
      <br/>
      Such anticoagulants comprise the physiological inhibitor TFPI (tissue factor pathway inhibitor) and modified fVII (fVIIai), which is fVIIa modified in such a way that it is catalytically inactive but still binds to TF and competes with active fVIIa.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In addition to the anticoagulants briefly described above, several naturally occurring proteins have been found to have anticoagulant activity.
      <br/>
      For example, Reutelingsperger (U.S. Pat. No. 4,736,018) isolated anticoagulant proteins from bovine aorta and human umbilical vein arteries.
      <br/>
      Maki et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,732,891) disclose human placenta-derived anticoagulant proteins.
      <br/>
      In addition, AT III has been proposed as a therapeutic anticoagulant (Schipper et al., Lancet 1 (8069): 854-856 (1978); Jordan, U.S. Pat. No. 4,386,025; Bock et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,517,294).
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the vessel wall is an important event in the formation of vascular lesions in atherosclerosis, after vascular reconstruction or in response to other vascular injury.
      <br/>
      For example, treatment of atherosclerosis frequently includes the clearing of blocked vessels by angioplasty, endarterectomy or reduction atherectomy, or by bypass grafting, surgical procedures in which atherosclerotic plaques are compressed or removed through catheterization (angioplasty), stripped away from the arterial wall through an incision (endarterectomy) or bypassed with natural or synthetic grafts.
      <br/>
      These procedures remove the vascular endothelium, disturb the underlying intimal layer, and result in the death of medial SMCs.
      <br/>
      This injury is followed by medial SMC roliferation and migration into the intima, which typically occurs within the first few weeks nd up to six months after injury and stops when the overlying endothelial cell layer is re-stablished.
      <br/>
      In humans, these lesions are composed of about 20% cells and 80% extracellular matrix.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In about 30% or more of patients treated by angioplasty, endarterectomy or bypass grafts, thrombosis and/or SMC proliferation in the intima causes re-occlusion of the vessel and consequent failure of the reconstructive surgery.
      <br/>
      This closure of the vessel subsequent to surgery is known as restenosis.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Modified FVIIa (FVIIai) has been shown to effectively suppress the restenosis process possibly as a result of a decreased procoagulant activity and thrombin generation initially after treatment of the constricted vessel.</p>
    <p num="16">
      For long term prophylactic treatment and increased compliance it would be desirable to have access to low-molecular-weight compounds which may be administered via a route other than intravenously and which have an inhibitory effect on fVIIa-TF activity similar to that of fVIIai.

      There is still a need in the art for improved compositions having anticoagulant activity which can be administered orally or otherwise non-intravenously at relatively low doses and not producing the undesirable side effects associated with traditional anticoagulant compositions.
      <br/>
      The present invention fulfills this need by providing anticoagulants that act specifically on fVIIa-TF at sites of injury, and further provides other related advantages such as its effect on the restenosis process.
      <br/>
      As compared to most other anticoagulants with an effect on the fVIIa-TF activity, the present invention has the advantage that it is a small synthetic molecule suitable for oral administration and for prophylactic treatment of atherosclerotic patients at risk for thrombosis.

    <p num="114">Methods for Identifylng Inhibitory Compounds</p>
    <p num="115">The general strategy for identifylng compounds is depicted below:  (Chemical Structure image '12' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="116">Inhibitory Compounds are Identified in a fX Activation Assay:</p>
    <p num="117">
      The compounds are dissolved in DMSO and mixed with a solution of fVIIa in Ca2 +-containing buffer (1+5). 30  MU l of this mixture was then mixed with 45  MU l TF (relipidated in PC/PS vesicles) and 25  MU l of a solution containing fX, all in Ca2 +-containing buffer.
      <br/>
      This gives final concentrations of 100 pM fVIIa, 5 pM TF, 175 nM fX and various concentrations of the compounds.
      <br/>
      After a 5-min incubation, the fVIIa/TF-catalyzed activation of fX is terminated by the addition of 50  MU l buffer containing enough EDTA to give an excess over the Ca2+ ions present. 50  MU l of a 2-mM solution of S-2765 (fXa substrate) is then added and the fXa formed is allowed to hydrolyze the substrate for 10 minutes during which the absorbance at 405 nm is continuously monitored in a SPECTRAmax (tm)  340 plate reader.
      <br/>
      The slope of the absorption curve is compared to that of a control where DMSO alone was added to fVIIa/TF/fX.
    </p>
    <p num="118">Test of Anticoagulant Potency in a fVIIaTF-initiated Clotting Assay:</p>
    <p num="119">
      The test compounds, 20 mM in DMSO, are diluted in citrated normal human plasma just before the analysis (1+19) and placed in the sample carousel. 55  MU l sample (compound in plasma) is mixed with 55  MU l of thromboplastin (Innovin, Dade) and incubated for 5 min.
      <br/>
      The clotting reaction is started by adding 55  MU l of a 25-mM CaCl2 solution, ylelding a final compound concentration of 0,33 mM.
      <br/>
      The clotting time is measured using an ACL 300 R coagulometer.
      <br/>
      The ratio between the clotting time in the presence and absence of test compound is used to quantify the anticoagulant efficiency.

      The compounds with general formula I have interesting pharmacological properties.
      <br/>
      For example, the compounds of this invention can be used to modulate and normalize an impaired haemostatic balance in mammals caused by deficiency or malfunction of blood clotting factors or their inhibitors.
      <br/>
      The fVIIa and in particular the fVIIa/TF activity plays an important role in the control of the coagulation cascade, and modulators of this key regulatory activity such as the present invention can be used in the treatment of coagulation-related diseased states.
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      Preferably the pharmaceutical composition is administered by the oral route.
