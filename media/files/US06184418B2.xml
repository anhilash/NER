      A method for acylating an aromatic compound, specifically an activated or deactivated aromatic compound, is disclosed.
      <br/>
      The method is suitable for preparing aromatic ketones.
      <br/>
      The preparation of a catalyst and novel bismuth compounds is also disclosed.
      <br/>
      Said aromatic compound acylation method comprises reacting said aromatic compound with an acylating agent in the presence of a catalyst, and is characterised in that the acylation reaction is performed in the presence of an effective amount of at least one bismuth salt of trifluoromethanesulphonic acid.

    <p num="6">In the following presentation of the invention, by "aromatic compound" we understand the conventional notion of aromaticity as defined in the literature, in particular by Jerry MARCH in Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th Edition, John Wiley and Sons, 1992, p 40 and following.</p>
    <p num="7">By "deactivated aromatic compound", we define an aromatic compound without substitutent, such as benzene for example, or an aromatic compound that contains one or several substitutents that deactivate the aromatic nucleus, such as electroattractive groups.</p>
    <p num="8">By "activated aromatic compound", we mean an aromatic compound consisting of one or more substitutents that activate the aromatic nucleus such as electron donor groups.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The notions of electron donor and electroattractive groups are defined in literature.
      <br/>
      One may refer, among others, to Jerry MARCH in Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th Edition, John Wiley and Sons, 1992, chapter 9, pp. 273-292.
    </p>
    <p num="10">A standard method for the preparation of aromatic ketones consists of performing an acylation reaction of the Freidel-Crafts sort.</p>
    <p num="11">A reaction of the aromatic compound and an acylation agent is performed in the presence of a catalyst, usually aluminum chloride.</p>
    <p num="12">
      An example of this type of method is shown in the works of C. Kuroda et al �Sci.
      <br/>
      Papers Inst.
      <br/>
      Phys. Chem. Res. 18, pp 51-60 (1932)� that have described the preparation of methoxyacetophenones, by reaction of an aromatic compound that carries from 1 to 3 methoxy groups, with acetyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      However, the use of aluminum chloride presents many inconveniences.
      <br/>
      Aluminum chloride is a corrosive and irritant product.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is necessary to use a large quantity of aluminum chloride, at least as much as the stoichiometry on account of the complexation of the ketone formed.
      <br/>
      Consequently, aluminum chloride is not a true catalyst.
    </p>
    <p num="14">At the end of the reaction, it is necessary to eliminate the aluminum chloride from the reaction solution by performing a basic or acid hydrolysis.</p>
    <p num="15">
      This hydrolysis involves adding water to the reaction solution, which appreciably complicates the implementation of the process since the metal cation, more specifically the aluminum cation, then forms aluminum polyoxo- and/or polyhydroxo-complexes of a milky consistency in the presence of water which are later difficult to separate.
      <br/>
      This results in the need to perform a long and costly treatment that consists, after the hydrolysis, of an extraction of the organic phase, a separation of the aqueous and organic phases, possibly even a drying of the latter.
      <br/>
      The separation of the aluminum chloride is therefore long and costly.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Besides, there is also the problem of saline aqueous runoffs that must later be neutralized, requiring an additional operation.</p>
    <p num="17">Furthermore, the aluminum chloride cannot be recycled because of the hydrolysis.</p>
    <p num="18">
      To avoid this inconvenience, Atsushi Kawada et al �J.
      <br/>
      Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. Pp 1157-1158 (1993) and Synlett pp 545-546 (1994)� have proposed to perform the acylation reaction of an aromatic compound using an acetic anhydride in the presence of a catalytic quantity of trifluoromethanesulfonate of lanthanide, in particular ytterbium or scandium triflate.
    </p>
    <p num="19">The inconvenience of these catalysts is that they only allow the acylation of activated aromatic compounds, such as anisole.</p>
    <p num="20">These last references, as many catalysts described in prior art, do not address in a general way the acylation problems of aromatic substrates that are both activated as well as deactivated, and in conditions that are easy to implement.</p>
    <p num="21">This invention reaches this objective and gives a procedure to avoid the afore-mentioned inconveniences.</p>
    <p num="22">There is now, and this is what this invention pertains to, a method that will allow for the acylation of an aromatic compound that consists in making the said aromatic compound react with an acylation agent, in the presence of a catalyst characterized by the fact that the acylation reaction is performed in the presence of an effective quantity of at least one bismuth salt of triflic acid.</p>
    <p num="23">In this text, by "triflic acid" we mean the trifluoromethanesulfonic acid CF3 SO3 H.</p>
    <p num="24">As mentioned below, the invention calls for the use of tris-trifluoromethanesulfonate of bismuth as a catalyst as well as catalysts containing less than three trifluoromethanesulfonic anions for one bismuth cation.</p>
    <p num="25">Another element of the invention is the preparation process of the catalyst for the invention.</p>
    <p num="26">Lastly, another element of the invention relates to new bismuth compounds</p>
    <p num="27">More precisely, this invention relates to the acylation method of an aromatic compound that fits the general formula (I):  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>

    <p num="36">The formula (I) aromatic compound can carry one or several substitutents.</p>

      One or several carbon atoms can be replaced by another heteroatom, preferably oxygen.

    <p num="77">It is preferable to select a solvent from the initial substrate and preferably an organic, polar, aprotic solvent.</p>
    <p num="78">As examples of polar, aprotic, organic solvents that may also be used in the invention's method, we can cite in particular linear or cyclic carboxamides such as N,N-dimethyl acetamide (DMAC), N,N-diethyl acetamide, dimethyl formamide (DMF), diethyl formamide, or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP); nitrate compounds such as nitromethane, nitroethane, 1-nitropropane, 2-nitropropane or their mixes, nitrobenzene; aliphatic or aromatic nitriles such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, butanenitrile, isobutanenitrile, benzonitrile, benzyl cyanide; dimethylsulfoxyde (DMSO); tetramethylsulfone (sulfolane), dimethylsulfone, hexamethylphosphotriamide (HMPT); dimethylethylene urea , dimethylpropylene urea, tetramethylurea, propylene carbonate</p>
    <p num="79">The preferred solvents are: nitromethane, nitroethane, 1-nitropropane, 2-nitropropane.</p>
    <p num="80">A mix of organic solvents can also be used.</p>
    <p num="81">
      The first stage of the invention's method consists of the acylation of the aromatic compound.
      <br/>
      In the next stage, a hydrolysis of the reaction mass obtained is performed.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      The ratio between the aromatic compound's molar number and the acylation agent's molar number can vary because the substrate can be used as a reaction solvent.
      <br/>
      Thus, the ratio can range from 0.1 to 10, preferably from 1.0 to 4 0 (slashed zero)
    </p>
    <p num="83">The quantity of catalyst used is determined in such a way that the ratio between the number of moles of catalyst and the number of moles of acylation agent is less than 1.0 and varies, preferably, between 0.001 and 0.8, and even more preferably between 0.02 and 0.2.</p>
    <p num="84">As far as the quantity of organic solvent used is concerned, it is usually chosen in such a way that the ratio between the number of moles of organic solvent and the number of moles of aromatic compound varies, preferably between 0 and 100 and even more preferably between 0 and 50.</p>
    <p num="85">The temperature at which the acylation reaction is performed depends on the reactivity of the starting substrate and of that of the acylation agent.</p>
    <p num="86">It is between 20 (degree)  C. and 200 (degree)  C., preferably between 40 (degree)  C. and 150 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="87">Usually, the reaction is conducted at atmospheric pressure, but higher or lower atmospheric pressures may also be used.</p>
    <p num="88">
      On a practical level, there are no constraints concerning the reagents.
      <br/>
      They can be introduced in any order.
    </p>
    <p num="89">After the reagents are placed in contact, the reaction mixture is brought to the desired temperature.</p>
    <p num="90">A variation to the invention consists in heating one of the reagents (acylation agent or aromatic compound) with the catalyst, and then introducing the other reagent.</p>
    <p num="91">
      The duration of the reaction depends on many parameters.
      <br/>
      In most cases it ranges from 30 minutes to 8 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="92">In the following step of the invention's method, a hydrolysis of the reaction mass obtained is performed.</p>
    <p num="93">
      The quantity of water used can vary greatly.
      <br/>
      The ratio between the number of moles of water and the number of moles of aromatic compound can range from 10 to 100, and preferably from 20 to 30.
    </p>
    <p num="94">With this end in view, a preferred implementation method consists in adding the reaction mass to a water bottom that has been brought to a temperature ranging between 0 (degree)  and 100 (degree)  C., preferably ranging between 150 and 30 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="95">A variation of the invention consists in replacing the water with a basic solution, usually of soda, sodium carbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate that has a weight concentration ranging from 5 to 20%.</p>
    <p num="96">
      The catalyst is separated, preferably by filtration.
      <br/>
      The catalyst can be recycled after drying.
    </p>
    <p num="97">At the end of the reaction, the desired product is retrieved, namely the aromatic ketone in organic phase.</p>
    <p num="98">The aqueous and organic phases are separated.</p>
    <p num="99">The organic phase is washed one or several times, preferably twice, with water.</p>
    <p num="100">The aqueous and organic phases are separated.</p>
    <p num="101">Then the aromatic ketone is retrieved from the organic phase according to known techniques, by elimination of the organic solvent, by distillation or by crystallization.</p>
    <p num="102">Another variant of the invention consists in retrieving the aromatic ketone directly, by distillation of the organic phase that contains the latter and the catalyst.</p>
    <p num="103">In accordance with the method described in the invention, the aromatic ketone retrieved is represented by the formula (III):  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="104">In said formula (III), A, R, R3 and n have the same meaning as described previously.</p>
    <p num="105">Another element of this invention relates to the preparation of a catalyst that matches formula (IV).</p>
    <p num="106">It is advantageously prepared according to a new process that consists in performing a triarylbismuth and triflic acid reaction at low temperature.</p>
    <p num="107">Thus, in the formula (IV), by "Ar" we mean a monocyclic or polycyclic aromatic, carbocyclic radical, possibly substituted, having preferably from 6 to 18 carbon atoms.</p>
    <p num="108">
      More particularly phenyl or naphthyl radicals, that are possibly substituted, for example, by alkyl or alkoxy radicals with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogen atoms, of trifluoromethyl groups.
      <br/>
      As Ar radicals, we preferably choose a phenyl or tolyl radical, or even more preferably, a phenyl radical.
    </p>
    <p num="109">Triphenylbismuth is the preferred reagent.</p>
    <p num="110">The quantity of reagents used is usually such that the ratio between the number of moles of triflic acid and the number of moles of the triarybismuth is preferably selected between 0.9 and 3.1.</p>
    <p num="111">Depending on the quantity of triflic acid used, we then obtain a catalyst containing more or less triflate anions.</p>
    <p num="112">To obtain a catalyst of formula Bi(OT)3, the quantity of triflic acid is between 2.9 and 3.1 moles by mole of triarylbismuth, and is preferably equal to 3 0 (slashed zero)</p>
    <p num="113">
      According to a variation of the invention, as new products, we prepare intermediate products in the manufacturing of the triflate of bismuth that more specifically match the following formula:
      <br/>
      Arn Bi(OTf)3-n  (IV)
      <br/>
      where n is equal to 1 or 2 and Ar and OTf have the same meaning as that given previously.
    </p>
    <p num="114">In particular, these compounds match the following formulas: Bi(OTf)Ph2 and Bi(OTf)2 Ph, and are new products.</p>
    <p num="115">
      Their preparation depends on the quantity of triflic acid used.
      <br/>
      Therefore, for the formula (IV) catalysts where n is equal to 1 and which is illustrated by the formula (IVb), the quantity of triflic acid ranges from 1.9 to 2.1 moles, preferably with 2 moles for every mole of triarylbismuth.
      <br/>
      In the case of the formula (IV) catalysts where n is equal to 2 and which is illustrated by the formula (IVb), the quantity of triflic acid ranges from 0.9 to 1.1, with preferably 1 mole per mole of triarylbismuth.
    </p>
    <p num="116">The reaction to prepare the catalyst is usually performed in an organic solvent.</p>
    <p num="117">More specifically we use halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, preferably dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2 dichloroethane.</p>
    <p num="118">The triarylbismuth is present in the organic solvent at a concentration level ranging preferably between 0.01 and 1 mole/liter.</p>
    <p num="119">According to a preferred implementation method, the triflic acid is progressively added to the solution that contains the triarylbismuth and the organic solvent.</p>
    <p num="120">As far as the temperature of the reaction is concerned, it is preferably chosen below 0 (degree)  C. and even more preferably between -10 (degree)  C. and -20 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="121">At the end of the reaction, we let the reaction mixture return to room temperature (preferably between 15 (degree)  C. and 25 (degree)  C.) and obtain a bismuth triflate according to formula (IV) in a precipitated form.</p>
    <p num="122">Said precipitate is separated according to common liquid/solid separation techniques, preferably by filtration.</p>
    <p num="123">The catalyst prepared in this manner can be used in the acylation method of the invention.</p>
    <p num="124">
      The invention permits access to new catalysts, in particular, those of formulas (IVa) and (IVb).
      <br/>
      These catalysts present an interesting catalytic activity and have the advantage of not being as costly as the tris-trifluoromethanesulfonate of bismuth, because of the lesser quantity of trifluoromethanesolfonic acid required during preparation.

    <p num="125">The following examples illustrate the invention without however setting any limits to it.</p>
    <p num="126">In these examples, the yields mentioned refer to this formula:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="127">By "minority reactant", we mean either the aromatic substrate or the acylation agent, depending on the relative quantities of each that are added.</p>
