      Compound corresponding to the general formula (I)in which R1 represents a hydrogen atom, a (C1-C4)alkyl group or a phenyl(C1-C4)alkyl group, R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a (C1-C4) alkyl group, and R3, R4 and R5 each represent a hydrogen or halogen atom or a trifluoromethyl, cyano, hydroxyl, (C1-C6)alkyl or (C1-C6) alkoxy group.

    <p num="1">This application is a 371 of PCT/FR98/01446 filed Jul. 07, 1998, now WO 99/02517 published Jan. 21, 1999.</p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to the compounds of general formula (I)  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="3">in which</p>
    <p num="4">
      R1 represents a hydrogen atom, a (C1 -C4)alkyl group or a phenyl(C1 -C4)alkyl group,
      <br/>
      R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a (C1 -C4) alkyl group, and
      <br/>
      R3, R4 and R5 each represent, independently of each other, a hydrogen or halogen atom or a trifluoromethyl, cyano, hydroxyl, (C1 -C6)alkyl or (C1 -C6)alkoxy group.
    </p>
    <p num="5">When R2 represents a hydrogen atom, the molecules of general formula (I) contain two asymmetric carbon atoms, i.e. the carbon atom in position 6 and the carbon atom of the pyrrolidine ring to which it is attached; for the same combination of substituents R1, R3, R4 and R5, the compounds of the invention can thus exist in the form of 4 different isomers.</p>
    <p num="6">When R2 is other than a hydrogen atom, the carbon atom in position 7 is also asymmetric; for the same combination of substituents R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5, the compounds of the invention can thus exist in the form of 8 different optical isomers.</p>
    <p num="7">The compounds of the invention can also exist in the form of bases or addition salts with acids.</p>
    <p num="8">In accordance with the invention, the compounds of general formula (I) can be prepared according to a process illustrated by the scheme which follows.  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="9">A derivative of general formula (II), in which X represents a halogen atom and R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as defined above, is reacted with diethyl propanedioate in basic medium in order to obtain, via a bis-alkylation, a cyclized diester of general formula (III), which is saponified under acidic conditions, or optionally under basic conditions, into an acid of general formula (IV) in which Y represents a hydroxyl group; this acid can be converted into an ester of general formula (IV) in which Y represents an alkoxy group, or alternatively into a Weinreb amide of general formula (IV) in which Y represents an (N-alkoxy)alkylamino group.</p>
    <p num="10">
      The derivative of general formula (IV) is then treated either according to the method described in Tetrahedron Lett., (1984) 25(46) 5271, or according to the method described in J. Med. Chem. (1997) 39 3235.
      <br/>
      According to the first method, the derivative of general formula (IV) is reacted with the organomagnesium reagent derived from 3-bromopropanamine, in which the amine function is protected with a silyl function, after which this function is hydrolysed in acidic medium; according to the second method, the derivative of general formula (IV) is reacted with N-vinylpyrrolid-2-one under basic conditions in order to form an intermediate which is hydrolysed in acidic medium.
    </p>
    <p num="11">An imine of general formula (V) is obtained, which is reduced to a derivative of general formula (VI) by an agent such as sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride in a suitable solvent.</p>
    <p num="12">The cis and trans stereoisomers formed during this step can be separated by chromatography into more polar isomers and less polar isomers.</p>
    <p num="13">
      If so desired, it is also possible at this stage to separate the enantiomers, for example by treating a cis or trans stereoisomer of general formula (VI) with a chiral substrate, for example an S-proline derivative, under peptide coupling conditions, for example in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, in order to obtain a derivative of general formula (I) in which R1 represents a prolinyl group, in the form of a mixture of diastereoisomers which can be separated by chromatography.
      <br/>
      The enantiomers are then obtained by treating each of the diastereoisomers in acidic medium.
      <br/>
      Finally, and if it is desired to introduce a group R1 other than a hydrogen atom, an alkylation of the nitrogen in the pyrrolidine ring is carried out by any known method, for example a reductive methylation according to the Eschweiler-Clarck method (formaldehyde and formic acid), or by reductive amination in the presence of an aldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride, or alternatively by acylation, in order to form an amide, which is reduced to an amine, using an agent such as lithium aluminium hydride.
    </p>
    <p num="14">For certain compounds, all the substituents R2, R3, R4 and R5 cannot be present in the starting compound of general formula (II); depending on their nature, these substituents can be introduced onto one and/or the other of the compounds of general formulae (III), (IV), (V), (VI) and (I), in which R2, R3, R4 and/or R5 represent hydrogen atoms, according to any known methods, for example the method described in J. Het. Chem. (1996) 33 1051-1056, optionally after activation of the nitrogen in the pyridine ring by formation of the corresponding N-oxide.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The examples which follow illustrate the preparation of a number of compounds of the invention.
      <br/>
      The elemental microanalyses and the IR and NMR spectra confirm the structures of the compounds obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The numbers indicated in parentheses in the example titles correspond to those in the 1st column of Table 1 given later.</p>
    <p num="17">In the compound names, the hyphen "-" forms part of the name, and the underscore mark "_" serves merely to indicate the line break; it should be removed if a line break does not occur at that point, and should not be replaced either with a normal hyphen or with a space.</p>

    <p num="172">The compounds of the invention underwent tests which revealed their therapeutic properties.</p>
    <p num="173">Thus, they were studied as regards their affinity towards nicotinic receptors, according to the methods described by Anderson and Arneric, Eur. J. Pharmacol (1994) 253 261, and by Hall et al., Brain Res. (1993) 600 127.</p>
    <p num="174">
      Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 150 to 200 g are decapitated and the entire brain is removed rapidly, it is homogenized in 15 volumes of 0.32M sucrose solution at 4 (degree)  C. and is then centrifuged at 1000 * g for 10 min.
      <br/>
      The pellet is discarded and the supernatant is centrifuged at 20,000 * g for 20 min at 4 (degree)  C. The pellet is collected and homogenized using a Polytron (tm)  mill in 15 volumes of double-distilled water at 4 (degree)  C., after which it is centrifuged at 8000 * g for 20 min.
      <br/>
      The pellet is discarded and the supernatant and the layer of skin ("buffy coat") are centrifuged at 4000 * g for 20 min, the pellet is recovered, washed with double-distilled water at 4 (degree)  C. and centrifuged once again before being stored at -80 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="175">
      On the day of the experiment, the tissue is thawed slowly and is suspended in 3 volumes of buffer. 150  MU l of this membrane suspension are incubated at 4 (degree)  C. for 120 min in the presence of 100  MU l of 1 nM �3 H�cytisine in a final volume of 500  MU l of buffer, in the presence or absence of test compound.
      <br/>
      The reaction is quenched by filtration through Whatman GF/B (tm)  filters pretreated with polyethyleneimine, the filters are rinsed with twice 5 ml of buffer at 4 (degree)  C. and the radioactivity retained on the filter is measured by liquid scintigraphy.
      <br/>
      The non-specific binding is determined in the presence of 10  MU m (-)-nicotine; the non-specific binding represents 75 to 85% of the total binding recovered on the filter.
      <br/>
      For each concentration of test compound, the percentage of inhibition of the specific binding of �3 H�cytisine is determined, then the IC50, the concentration of compound which inhibits 50% of the specific binding, is calculated.
      <br/>
      The IC50 values for the compounds of the invention are between 0.001 and 1  MU M.
    </p>
    <p num="176">The results of the biological tests carried out on the compounds of the invention show that they are powerful and selective cholinergic ligands for nicotinic receptors.</p>
    <p num="177">These results suggest the use of the compounds in the treatment or prevention of disorders associated with dysfunctioning of the nicotinic receptors, in particular in the central nervous system or in the gastrointestinal system.</p>
    <p num="178">In the central nervous system, these disorders comprise cognitive deficiencies, more specifically memory deficiencies, but also attention deficiencies, associated with Alzheimer's disease, with pathological ageing (Age-Associated Memory Impairment, AAMI), with Parkinson's disease, with trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome), with Korsakoff's alcoholic syndrome and with vascular dementia (multi-infarct dementia, MID).</p>
    <p num="179">The compounds of the invention may also be useful in the treatment of motor disorders observed in Parkinson's disease or other neurological diseases such as Huntington's chorea, Tourette's syndrome, tardive dyskinesia and hyperkinesia.</p>
    <p num="180">
      The compounds of the invention can also constitute a curative or symptomatic treatment of cerebrovascular accidents and cerebral hypoxic attacks.
      <br/>
      They can be used in cases of psychiatric pathology: schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, panic attacks, compulsive and obsessive behaviour.
      <br/>
      They can prevent the symptoms due to withdrawal from tobacco, from alcohol or from the various substances which induce a dependency, such as cocaine, LSD, cannabis or benzodiazepines.
      <br/>
      Lastly, they can be useful for the treatment of pain.
    </p>
    <p num="181">In the gastrointestinal system, the compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerous colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and obesity.</p>
    <p num="182">To this end, the compounds of the invention can be in any composition form which is suitable for enteral, parenteral or transdermal administration, such as tablets, coated tablets, gelatin capsules, wafer capsules, drinkable or injectable suspensions or solutions such as syrups or ampules, transdermal patches, etc., combined with suitable excipients, and dosed to allow a daily administration of from 0.01 to 20 mg/kg.</p>
