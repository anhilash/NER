    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This application is related to an impedance transport circuit and more particularly to a circuit which is capable of transporting both AC and DC impedance.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Many electronic circuits require a high input or output impedance.
      <br/>
      However, circuits with high magnitude currents require large transistors to create high input or output impedance.
      <br/>
      Typically, large transistors are not desired.
      <br/>
      Hence, a trade off is left between high current capability and high output impedance.
    </p>
    <p num="3">It is an object of this invention to provide a circuit which can transport a desired impedance to a high current circuit by utilizing small transistors.</p>
    <p num="4">It is yet another object of this invention to provide a circuit which transports both input AC and DC impedance to the output.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      In accordance with the present invention, there is disclosed an impedance transport circuit which is capable of transporting an AC input impedance to an output impedance and invert its polarity.
      <br/>
      This impedance transport circuit utilizes two MOS transistors and an Op-Amp which causes the drain voltages of the transistors to be equal.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is disclosed an impedance transport circuit which is capable of transporting both AC and DC input impedance to an output impedance.
      <br/>
      This impedance transport circuit utilizes four MOS transistors and two Op-Amps which cause the drain voltages of all transistors to be equal.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="7">
      FIG. 1 shows the first step in developing the impedance transport circuit of this invention;
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 shows a representation of input impedance and output impedance; and
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows the preferred embodiment of the impedance transport circuit of this invention.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="8">
      Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a circuit 10 of an impedance transport of this invention.
      <br/>
      Circuit 10 comprises an operational amplifier Op-amp 12, two same size p-channel metal oxide silicon field effect transistors (PMOS) T1 and T2.
      <br/>
      The sources of both transistors T1 and T2 are connected to VDD.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The output of the Op-amp 12 is connected to the gate of both transistors T1 and T2.
      <br/>
      The positive (+) input of the Op-amp 12 is connected to the drain of the transistor T1 at node 14 and the negative (-) input of the Op-amp 12 is connected to the drain of the transistor T2 at node 16.
      <br/>
      Drain of the transistor T1 is grounded through impedance RIN which represents the impedance of input current source 11 and drain of the transistor T2 is grounded through a load impedance RL.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In operation, the output voltage of the Op-amp 12 forces the voltage of the gates of both transistors T1 and T2 to a voltage where both positive and negative input voltages of the Op-amp 12 become equal.
      <br/>
      When both positive and negative voltages of the Op-amp are equal then the voltages of nodes 14 and 16 are also equal.
      <br/>
      As a result, since transistors T1 and T2 have equal sizes, equal source voltages, equal gate voltages and equal drain voltages, any voltage or current change across or through the transistor T1 is replicated in transistor T2.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The voltage of node 16 can change due to a change at the load impedance.
      <br/>
      Any change in the voltage of node 16 causes the Op-amp 12 to adjust its output and therefore change the voltage of node 14 to be equal to the voltage of node 16.
      <br/>
      For the purpose of simplicity hereinafter, when it is referred to "a change in the voltage of node 16" it should be understood that "the voltage of node 14 also changes to become equal to the voltage of node 16".
    </p>
    <p num="12">The voltage from VDD to ground is a fixed voltage which leads to:</p>
    <p num="13">(VSD1 =VSD2)+VIN =VDD.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Therefore, if the voltage of node 16 changes, then the input voltage VIN and the voltage VDS1 across the transistor T1 and the voltage VDS2 across transistor T2 have to compensate for the change.
      <br/>
      When the voltages of nodes 16 and 14 change, if VIN increases, VSD1 =VSD2 decreases by the same amount or if VIN decreases, VDS1 =VDS2 increases by the same amount.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      For example, if VIN is 3 volts (voltage at nodes 16 and 14) and if VDD is 5 volts then,
      <br/>
      VIN +VSD2 =3 +VSD2 =5 volts
      <br/>
      VSD2 =VSD1 =2 volts.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      If the voltage at nodes 16 and 14 change to 3.5 volts then,
      <br/>
      VIN +VSD2 =3.5+VSD2 =5 volts
      <br/>
      VSD2 =VSD1 =1.5 volts.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The above voltage changes affect AC impedance and DC impedance differently.
      <br/>
      However, prior to studying the AC and DC impedance, it should be noted that to measure impedance, an industry convention needs to be followed.
      <br/>
      The industry convention considers a current positive when the current flows from a node that the impedance is observed into an element with impedance.
      <br/>
      Also, the industry convention considers a voltage positive when the higher potential of the voltage across the element with the impedance is located at the node from which the impedance is observed.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIG. 2, there is shown a representation of input impedance and output impedance.
      <br/>
      Again based on the industry convention, the input impedance RIN is the impedance which can be observed from node 14 looking into the current source 11 and the output impedance ROUT is the impedance which can be observed from node 16 looking into the circuit 10.
    </p>

      Referring back to FIG. 1, for the input impedance, the current IIN is positive since it flows from the transistor T1 and node 14 into the resistor RIN.
      <br/>
      The voltage VIN is also positive since the higher potential is at node 14.
      <br/>
      However for the output impedance, the current IOUT is negative since it flows from transistor T1 into node 16.
      <br/>
      The voltage VOUT is also negative since the higher potential is at VDD as opposed to node 16.

      The above conventions allow the AC and DC input impedance to be compared to the AC and DC output impedance.
      <br/>
      An AC impedance is an impedance that occurs during the time the voltage and current are changing from one level to another.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the voltage of node 16 changes, it causes the current IIN and the voltage VIN at the input and the current IOUT and the voltage VOUT at the output to change.
      <br/>
      During this change, an AC input impedance RACI is generated at the input and an AC output impedance RACO is generated at the output.

    <p num="21">An AC impedance RAC is equal to:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>

      As the input voltage VIN changes from VIN1 to VIN2 the current passing through transistor T1 and the resistor RIN changes.

      Since the changes in transistor T1 is replicated in transistor T2, the current change in transistor T2 is equal to the current change in transistor T2.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the current change for the AC output impedance is equal to the current change for the AC input impedance except with an opposite sign due to the convention.

      Equations 3 and 4 show that the AC input impedance has the same magnitude as the AC output impedance except with reverse polarity.
      <br/>
      This shows that circuit 10 transports the AC input impedance to the output impedance, but changes the polarity.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Circuit 20 only transports the AC impedance with a reverse polarity but, does not transport the DC impedance.

      A DC impedance RDC is equal to:  (Equation image '6' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="31">The main difference between the DC and the AC impedance is that the DC impedance needs the actual voltage and the actual current as opposed to the AC impedance which requires the change in voltage and the change in current.</p>

      In Circuit 10, the currents through transistors T1 and T2 are equal.
      <br/>
      Therefore, for the DC input and output impedance we have the same current with different polarities because of the convention.
      <br/>
      However, the input voltage across RIN is VIN, but the output voltage across transistor T2 is VDD -VIN.
      <br/>
      Therefore, RDCI is equal to:  (Equation image '7' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="33">and DC output impedance is equal to:  (Equation image '8' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="34">So, the output DC impedance not only has a reverse polarity, but also is translated to a different value.</p>
    <p num="35">
      In order to transport both the DC and the AC input impedance to the output impedance without polarity change or translation, one more stage is required.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 3, there is shown a circuit 20 of this invention which is capable of transporting both AC and DC impedance.
      <br/>
      Circuit 20, comprises circuit 10 of FIG. 1 and a second circuit 22.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, all the elements of circuit 10 of FIG. 1 are designated by the same reference numerals.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Circuit 22 comprises an Op-Amp 24 and two p-channel MOS transistors T3 and T4.
      <br/>
      The drain of transistor T3 is connected to the drain of the transistor T2.
      <br/>
      The sources of both transistors T3 and T4 are grounded.
      <br/>
      The output of the Op-Amp 24 is connected to the gates of both transistors T3 and T4.
      <br/>
      The positive input of the Op-Amp 24 is connected to the drain of the transistor T3 at node 26 which is the same as node 16 and the negative input of the Op-amp 24 is connected to the drain of the transistor T4 at node 28.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In operation, the output voltage of the Op-amp 24 forces the voltage of the gates of both transistors T3 and T4 to a voltage where both positive and negative input voltages of the Op-amp 24 become equal.
      <br/>
      When both positive and negative voltages of the Op-amp are equal then the voltages of nodes 26 and 28 are also equal.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The Op-amps 12 and 24 have to balance the circuit 20.
      <br/>
      The output of Op-amp 12 causes the voltages of the nodes 14 and 16 to be equal and the output of Op-amp 24 causes the voltages of nodes 26 and 28 to be equal.
      <br/>
      Since nodes 26 and 16 are directly connected to each other and have the same voltage, nodes 14, 16, 26, and 28 must have equal voltages.
      <br/>
      Therefore, Op-amps 12 and 24 work, in cooperation with each other, to provide the same voltage at nodes 14, 16, 26, and 28.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In circuit 20, the output impedance ROUT2 is the impedance which can be observed from node 28 looking into the circuit 20.
      <br/>
      Since the voltage of nodes 14, 16, 26, and 28 are equal, the input voltage VIN is equal to the output voltage VOUT2.
      <br/>
      Also, the input current IIN through the input impedance RIN has the same direction as the output current IOUT2 through the transistor T4.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the voltage of node 28 changes, the voltage of node 16 changes by the same magnitude and same polarity.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      As a result, the output voltage VOUT2 and the output current IOUT2 have the same magnitude and polarity as the input voltage VIN and the input current IIN respectively.
      <br/>
      Therefore, circuit 20 transports both AC and DC input impedance to the output.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Transistors T1, T2, T3, and T4 are small transistors which can handle a current in the range of 1-20  MU A. Circuit 20 can replace the large output transistor of a high current circuit.
      <br/>
      Circuit 20 can replace large transistors which can handle a current in the range of 100  MU A to 30 mA.
      <br/>
      Circuit 20 including its four transistors and two Op-amps is substantially smaller than one large transistor which can handle a current in the range of 100  MU A to 30 mA.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      In circuit 20, the two transistors T1 and T2 are p-channel transistors and the two transistors T3 and T4 are n-channel transistors.
      <br/>
      However, this can be reversed.
      <br/>
      The two transistors T1 and T2 can be selected to be n-channel transistors which requires that the two transistors T3 and T4 to be p-channel transistors.
    </p>
    <p num="43">Circuit 10, which transports only the AC impedance and changes its polarity, is also useful in certain applications such as canceling the effect of an AC impedance in a circuit.</p>
    <p num="44">
      The disclosed embodiments of this invention can be designed to scale the output impedance.
      <br/>
      By selecting different size transistors, the output impedance can be set to a desired value.
      <br/>
      The ratio of the size of the output transistor to the size of the input transistor determines the ratio between the input and output impedance.
      <br/>
      If the size of the output transistor is larger or smaller than the size of the input transistor then, the output impedance will be smaller or larger respectively.
