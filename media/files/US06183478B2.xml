    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">The invention relates generally to devices for affixing a component to bone, and more particularly, to a device for temporarily affixing a bone plate to two or more spinal vertebrae.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Following fracture or surgical treatment of the spine, it is often necessary to attach or fix a bone plate to two or more spinal vertebrae via a screw assembly in order to stabilize the spine, to promote fusion, and to expedite mobilization of a patient.
      <br/>
      One difficult aspect of affixing a bone plate to the vertebrae is the positioning of surgical instruments and implant components within the surgical site.
      <br/>
      This difficulty is often attributable to the relatively high level of precision required during this surgical procedure.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The need for a relatively high level of precision is due to a number of factors.
      <br/>
      First, the surgical opening is usually only two or three inches long, which provides a limited field of vision for the surgeon, and limits freedom of movement within the surgical site.
      <br/>
      Second, the spine is a particularly sensitive and delicate part of the human body that does not lend itself to in-depth probing or exploration.
      <br/>
      Third, delicate soft tissue proximate the surgical site must be retracted during the surgery without being cut or perforated.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The requisite level of precision, however, is often difficult to achieve in view of the inability to know, in advance, the specific bone plate geometry required to provide optimal stability for the spine.
      <br/>
      Usually, several bone plates must be temporarily secured to vertebrae and subsequently removed from the surgical site before finding a proper bone plate geometry.
      <br/>
      But, each insertion and removal of a bone plate increases the likelihood of surgical imprecision.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A number of temporary fixation pins and screws have been developed that allegedly facilitate the temporary fixation of bone plates to two or more vertebrae.
      <br/>
      These prior art temporary fixation pins and screws, however, suffer from certain drawbacks.
      <br/>
      For example, a fixation screw is generally sharp enough to penetrate bone.
      <br/>
      This sharpness can easily damage tissue, however, given the delicate nature of the spine and the soft tissue encountered at the surgical site, coupled with the relatively narrow visual opening into the surgical site.
    </p>
    <p num="8">It would therefore be desirable to provide a device that facilitates the safe and precise temporary fixation of a bone plate to two or more spinal vertebrae.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The present invention provides a device for facilitating the temporary fixation of a bone plate to two or more spinal vertebrae.
      <br/>
      Although the invention is primarily shown and described as a device for temporarily affixing a bone plate to two or more spinal vertebrae, it is understood that the device has other applications as well.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The temporary fixation device includes a fixation member slidably disposed within a sleeve.
      <br/>
      The fixation member is movable with respect to the sleeve between retracted and extended positions.
      <br/>
      A bias member is disposed within the sleeve in communication with the fixation member for biasing the fixation member to a retracted position.
      <br/>
      As the fixation member moves from the retracted position to an extended position, a distal, bone-engaging end of the fixation member emerges from the sleeve.
      <br/>
      The distal end of the fixation member is at least partially threaded so as to penetrate and engage bone and to secure the bone plate to the vertebrae.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The drawings are understood to be illustrative of the concepts disclosed herein to facilitate comprehension of the invention.
      <br/>
      Further, the drawings are not to scale, and the scope of the invention is not to be limited to the particular embodiments shown and described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      FIG. 1 shows a device 80 for providing temporary fixation of a bone plate 10 to two or more vertebrae.
      <br/>
      The device 80 includes a fixation member 12, which is slidably disposed in a sleeve 50.
      <br/>
      The fixation member 12 is movable between a retracted position (FIG. 7) and an extended position (FIG. 8), as described in detail below.
      <br/>
      While in the retracted position, the sleeve 50 prevents the fixation member 12 from inadvertently damaging tissue.
      <br/>
      And, while in the extended position, the fixation member 12 can engage bone so as to secure the bone plate 10 to two or more vertebrae.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      FIG. 2 shows a fixation member 12, which includes a distal end 14 for penetrating and engaging bone and a proximal end 16 for coupling to a rotating member.
      <br/>
      A connection region 18 is located between the distal and proximal ends 14, 16 of the fixation member 12.
      <br/>
      The distal, bone-engaging end 14 of the fixation member 12 terminates at a sharp point 20 that approximately coincides with a longitudinal axis 22 of the fixation member.
      <br/>
      The distal, bone-engaging end 14 of the fixation member 12 has a threaded portion 24 with a predetermined pitch to allow for sufficient penetration and engagement of the fixation member 12 with bone.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the threaded portion 24 has a pitch and a quantity of threads sufficient to achieve self-tapping of the fixation member 12 into bone.
      <br/>
      In an exemplary embodiment, the threaded portion 24 of the distal, bone-engaging end 14 has at least four threads.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The fixation member 12 should be sized so as to occupy a volume less than or substantially equal to that of the permanent bone screw to be implanted in the bone plate.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the diameter of the distal, bone-engaging end 14 of the fixation member 12 should be less than or equal to the diameter to the distal end of the permanent bone screw in order to minimize the volume of bone removed during the process and, in turn, to optimize the attachment strength of the permanent bone screw.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The connection region 18 of the fixation member 12 is substantially cylindrical with a diameter that is greater than the diameter of the distal, bone-engaging end 14 of the fixation member.
      <br/>
      In the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the connection region has a first transition portion 25 and a second transition portion 26.
      <br/>
      The first and second transition portions 25, 26 each have substantially constant diameters, the diameter of the first transition portion generally being greater than the diameter of the second transition portion.
      <br/>
      In alternate embodiments (not shown), the connection region 18 may be tapered or may have a uniform diameter throughout the first and second transition portions 25, 26.

      Referring now to FIG. 5, a sleeve in which the fixation member of FIGS. 2-4 may be disposed is shown.

      The sleeve 50 is elongate and substantially cylindrical and has openings at proximal and distal ends 58, 60 thereof, and an aperture therethrough.
      <br/>
      The sleeve 50 should have an inner diameter 62 and a length 54 such that the fixation member 12 has a predetermined range of longitudinal movement when disposed therein.

      This configuration is effective to retain the fixation member 12 of FIGS. 2-4 within the sleeve.

      The sleeve 50 has a distal region 68 with a geometry such that the distal region may mate with a complimentary surface of a bone plate (not shown) and to allow placement of the sleeve at a variety of orientations.

      This configuration limits the amount of the fixation member 12 that may extend beyond the distal end 60 of the sleeve 50.

      In an exemplary embodiment, the distal region 68 of the sleeve 50 also has a crimped portion 70 with a crimping angle a between about 30 (degree)  and about 60 (degree) . Preferably, the crimped portion 70 reduces the outer diameter 56 of the first area 72 of the sleeve 50.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the crimped portion 70 may reduce the outer diameter 56 of both the first and second areas 72, 74 of the distal region 68 of the sleeve, or solely the outer diameter of the second area of the distal region.

      FIG. 7 shows the temporary fixation device 80 including a bias member 82 for biasing the fixation member 12 to a retracted position, as shown.
      <br/>
      In general, while in a retracted position, the bias member 82 should prevent the distal end 14 of the fixation member from extending beyond the sleeve 50.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In one embodiment, the bias member 82 is a spring having a plurality of coils 84 circumscribed about the distal, bone-engaging end 14 of the fixation member 12.
      <br/>
      The diameter 86 of the bias member 82 should be greater than the inner diameter 62 of the second area 74 of the fixation member 12 to prevent the bias member from exiting the distal end 60 of the sleeve 50.
      <br/>
      Further, the bias member 82 provides accuracy during the positioning of the fixation member 12 in bone, since the bias member surrounds the fixation member, thus not allowing the fixation member to drift within the sleeve 50.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      FIG. 8 depicts device 80 with the fixation member 12 in an extended position.
      <br/>
      The extended position is characterized by the distal end 14 of the fixation member 12 extending beyond the distal end 60 of the sleeve 50.
      <br/>
      The specific length of the fixation member which extends beyond the sleeve 50 in the extended position can be readily varied.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In an exemplary embodiment of the temporary fixation device 80, the proximal end 16 of the fixation member 12 has a diameter which is greater than that of the first area 72 of the sleeve 50, to prevent it from being disposed therein.
      <br/>
      Also, the first transition portion 25 of the connection region 18 of the fixation member 12 should have a diameter greater than that of the second area 74 of the sleeve 50 to prevent it from being disposed therein.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Thus, the maximum amount of the fixation member 12 that may extend beyond the distal end 60 of the sleeve in this exemplary embodiment is equal to the length of the distal, bone-engaging end 14 of the fixation member 12 plus the length of the second transition portion 26 of the fixation member, minus the length of the second area 74 of the sleeve 50.
      <br/>
      This amount is generally between about 0.09 inch and about 0.39 inch.
    </p>
    <p num="33">One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate, however, that because the first and second transition portions 25, 26 of the fixation may have a wide range of diameters, and/or may have equal diameters, that the amount of the fixation member that may extend beyond the distal end 60 of the sleeve may vary beyond the above range.</p>
    <p num="34">
      In use, the distal, bone-engaging end 14 of the fixation member 12 of the device 80 can be engaged with bone in several ways.
      <br/>
      By way of a non-limiting example, the distal, bone-engaging end 14 of the fixation member 12 can enter and engage bone through pre-drilled or already-fashioned holes.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the fixation member 12 is self-tapping.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Upon the removal of the distal end 14 of the fixation member 12 from bone, the bias member 82 automatically biases the fixation member to a retracted position in which the fixation member is disposed entirely within the sleeve 50 (see FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      This automatic biasing and retraction of the fixation member 12 into the sleeve 50 allows the surgeon, after removal of the fixation member 12 from bone, to move the device 80 within the surgical site with confidence that its sharp point 20 will not contact any vulnerable areas of the spine or surrounding soft tissue.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      FIG. 9 shows the device 80 affixed to vertebrae 90 through a bone plate 10.
      <br/>
      The device 80 can be affixed to vertebrae 90 either before or after a bone plate 10 has been suitably positioned on the vertebrae.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the bone plate 10 is positioned on the vertebrae 90 and then the device 80 is fit through the bone plate into the vertebrae.
      <br/>
      As described above, the device 80 may be fitted through a suitably-sized opening in the plate 10 and self-tapped or threaded into the vertebrae 90.
      <br/>
      This provides temporary fixation of the plate 10 to the vertebrae 90, the temporary fixation being maintained during subsequent surgical operations such as drilling, tapping operations.
      <br/>
      The device is then removed and replaced with permanent bone screws.
