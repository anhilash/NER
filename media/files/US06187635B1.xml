      A CHE programmed memory device (30) avoids forward biasing at an isolated P-well (38) junction with a deep N-well (36) and prevents emitting electrons that may cause voltage buildup across the isolated P-well region (38) by applying a forward bias current (50) or voltage source (40) connected to the deep N-well region (36) for slightly forward biasing the deep N-well region.
      <br/>
      This maintains the voltage drop of isolated P-well region (38) below the diode turn-on voltage.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to a memory devices such as EPROMs and Flash EPROMs and, even more particularly, to a channel hot electron (CHE) programmed memory device having improved reliability and operability.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      CHE programming of electrically erasable programmable read-only memories (EPROMs) and flash (EPROMs) can generate between 50  MU A-100  MU A of cell current.
      <br/>
      For state of the art devices, which are often built onto P-type epitaxial layers over a low resistivity substrate, this substrate current sinks into the low resistivity layer and does not generate significant voltage drop.
      <br/>
      However, for EPROMs and flash EPROMs that use a non-epitaxial layer substrate, or ones that are built on an isolated P-well surrounded by a deep N-well, such as in a triple well process, the substrate current that is generated during programming can build up large voltage drops across the resistive FAMOS P-well region.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      If voltage drop exceeds the diode turn-on voltage of approximately 0.7 volts, then the source junction will forward bias.
      <br/>
      This problem of the resistive P-well situation may be seen in a lowering of the floating-gate avalanche-injection metal oxide semiconductor (FAMOS) BVCEO voltage value.
      <br/>
      Lowering the BVCEO values, unfortunately, reduces the maximum drain potential of the device.
      <br/>
      For a constant current programming load line, this reduces the gate current and degrades programmability of the EPROM or flash EPROM.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      FIGS. 1 and 2 show the adverse effects of lower and BVCEO voltage values.
      <br/>
      In particular, FIG. 1 illustrates a plot of two BVCEO characteristic lines for a flash EPROM cell built over a triple well structure that includes an isolated P-well within a deep N-well.
      <br/>
      In the first case of line 10, the isolated P-well is well grounded and the deep N-well potential is at ground potential.
      <br/>
      The resistance R equals 15  OMEGA .
      <br/>
      In the second case of line 12, the isolated P-well is simulated to be resistive at a value of 15 K OMEGA .
      <br/>
      Line 10 shows the shift in the BVCEO characteristic that yields a lowered programming voltage and generally degrades performance of the memory.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Another problem that arises when the substrate current builds up a voltage drop across the resistive FAMOS P-well is that once the source junction forward biases, it sprays electrons into the substrate.
      <br/>
      Some of the electrons will be collected by the drain junctions of the adjacent cells in the bit line stress mode.
      <br/>
      In this case, electrons entering the high electric field region near the drain create hot electron-holes pairs.
      <br/>
      Due to the polarity of the gate field near the drain, these hot electron-hole pairs are likely to be injected into the gate oxide and cause charge loss from the floating gate.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The table of FIG. 2 shows the effect of rising body potential on bit line stress.
      <br/>
      In the table of FIG. 2, the gate voltage, Vg, equals zero; the drain voltage, Vd, equals six volts; and the source voltage, Vs, equals zero.
      <br/>
      Bit line stress occurs for approximately one second, in this example.
      <br/>
      The parameter, Vb, represents the bins voltage across the resistive FAMOS P-well region.
      <br/>
      As the FIG. 2 table shows, with Vb exceeding 0.7 volts, the threshold voltage, Vt values of 0.10, 0.05, and 0.5 when Vb was at or below 0.7 volts.
      <br/>
      The lowered Vt, therefore, indicates the degraded programmability that breakdown of the source junction diode causes.
      <br/>
      Basically, as the substrate potential rises, the charge loss from floating gate rises correspondingly.
      <br/>
      This phenomenon exhibits an approximately exponential cause and effect relationship.
      <br/>
      Also, there is some expectation that the above-stated bit line stress mechanism causes grain degradation in flash memory devices as a result of the hot hole injection.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      To avoid the above issues, the voltage drop in the substrate during programming should stay below the diode turn on voltage of approximately 0.7 volts.
      <br/>
      One way to achieve this result is to reduce the FAMOS P-well sheet resistance.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, for triple well technology, this solution increases the process complexity.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a desire to build single isolated P-well to meet the CMOS requirements for negative voltage switching, and use the same isolated well for FAMOS devices.
      <br/>
      In this case, the high sheet resistance of the isolated P-well cannot meet the FAMOS requirements.
      <br/>
      For large arrays, the substrate bias build-up during programming forward biases the source junction and cause the above-stated device reliability concerns.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Other known solutions to this problem are process-oriented, using either a low-sheet-resistance FAMOS P-well or a very high energy implant.
      <br/>
      Both solutions, however, increase the process and the device-design complexities.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">In light of the above limitations, there is a need for a CHE programmed memory device having improved reliability and operability that substantially eliminates or reduces problems of forward biasing the isolated P-well junction and emitting electrons into the P-substrate problems, without the undesirable process and device design complexities that affect existing methods and devices.</p>
    <p num="11">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a CHE programmed memory device having improved reliability and operability that avoids forward biasing at the isolated P-well junction and emitting electrons into the substrate by slightly forward biasing the deep N-well with respect to the isolated P-well.</p>
    <p num="12">
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the forward bias is applied as a voltage to the deep N-well in the range of -0.3 V-0.5 V, or a negative constant current of approximately -10  MU A) that is pumped into the deep N-well with isolated P-well being grounded.
      <br/>
      With the isolated P-well/deep N-well diode slightly forward biased, any substrate current generated during programming can easily forward bias this diode more.
      <br/>
      This results in pumping holes into the P-substrate.
      <br/>
      In that case, the isolated P-well potential does not rise more than 0.2 V-0.3 V. This essentially eliminates the problems of forward biasing the isolated P-well junction and spraying electrons into the P-substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      A technical advantage of the present invention is that is makes the use of resistive isolated P-wells in triple well designs practical by diverting the substrate current into the low resistivity P-substrate during programming.
      <br/>
      The present invention simplifies the process of building a flash EPROM array over a triple well by eliminating the requirement for a separate low-sheet-resistance, FAMOS P-well, thereby reducing fabrication costs.
      <br/>
      The present invention does not require an additional well and requires only a small circuit change.
      <br/>
      Moreover, present the invention is useful for all EPROMs built on triple wells.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">Preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in the Figures like numerals being used to refer to like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.</p>
    <p num="16">
      FIG. 3 illustrates a BVCEO line 14 showing the results of applying the concepts for which RB =15 Ohms and the deep N-well current is constant at -5  MU A, to yield a deep N-well potential of approximately -0.4 V. By pumping a slightly negative voltage into the deep N-well no shift in the BVCEO characteristic curve occurs, as was the case in the BVCEO plots of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, no reduction in Vt after bitline stress occurs.
      <br/>
      The result is that no degradation in programmability or gate current reduction occurs with the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      FIG. 4 shows one embodiment of the present invention that includes memory cell 30 formed on P-substrate 32 which itself is grounded at ground connection 34.
      <br/>
      Forming the components of memory cell 30 may use any of a variety of known fabrication processes.
      <br/>
      Deep N-well 36 surrounds isolated P-well 38.
      <br/>
      Instead of grounding deep N-well 36, a slightly negative voltage VDN of approximately -0.4 V is applied to deep N-well 36 at connection 40.
      <br/>
      Isolated P-well 38 is grounded at ground potential connection 42.
      <br/>
      Within isolated P-well 38, N+ region 44 is for forming the memory cell source region and N+ region 46 is for forming the associated drain region.
      <br/>
      Gate dielectric region 48 is positioned over isolated P-well 38 between source N+ region 44 and drain N+ region 46.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      FIG. 5 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the present invention with reference numerals generally referring to the elements of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5, however, shows deep N-well current source 50, instead of deep N-well voltage source 40, connecting to deep N-well 36.
      <br/>
      Current source 50 pumps a negative current of approximately -10  MU A into deep N-well 36.
      <br/>
      Isolated P-well 38 is grounded, as before.
      <br/>
      With the junction between deep N-well 36 and isolated P-well 38 slightly forward biased, any current, ISUB, within P-substrate 32.
      <br/>
      The result is that the potential of isolated P-well 38 will not exceed 0.2-0.3 volts.
      <br/>
      This essentially eliminates the reduced gate current and programmability problems of the prior art devices.
