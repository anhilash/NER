    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a variable delay circuit which controls a delay circuit provided on a transfer path to vary the delay time of the delay circuit and to a semiconductor integrated circuit device having such a delay circuit.</p>
    <p num="3">
      The circuit design mainstream utilizes clock synchronization due to the recent progress towards increasing of the operation speed and the integration density.
      <br/>
      Hence, it becomes important to suitably supply a given circuit with a clock that is synchronized with an external clock signal.
      <br/>
      The latest art uses a DLL (Delay Locked Loop) circuit having the minimum delay time unit equal to approximately 200 ps in order to generate an internal clock which is synchronism with the external clock.
      <br/>
      As the frequency of the internal clock is increased, it is required that a variable delay circuit using the DLL circuit has a higher precision.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. The Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">A description will now be given, with reference to FIG. 1, of a conventional variable delay circuit.</p>
    <p num="6">The circuit shown in FIG. 1 has a four-stage delay circuit consisting of first, second, third and fourth delay circuits 201, 202, 203 and 204, respectively.</p>
    <p num="7">
      The first delay circuit 201 includes gates G201 and G202, and the second delay circuit 202 includes gates G203, G204 and G205.
      <br/>
      The third delay circuit 203 includes gates G206, G207 and G208, and the fourth delay circuit 204 includes gates G209, G210 and G211.
      <br/>
      The first through fourth delay circuits 201 through 204 are supplied with switch input signals via switch terminals (SW) P203 through P206.
      <br/>
      One of the switch input signals is switched to a high level (H), an input clock signal applied to an input terminal P201 is delayed by a delay time based on which one of the switch input signals is switched to the high level.
      <br/>
      A resultant delayed clock signal is output via an output terminal P202.
      <br/>
      Each of the gates G201-G211 has a unit delay time 1 td.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In the operation of the first delay circuit 201, the gate G201 is masked when the signal applied to the switch terminal P203 is at a low level (L).
      <br/>
      The output signal obtained at the output terminal 202 is always at the low level irrespective of whether the other input of the gate G201 is high or low.
      <br/>
      The gate 201 is released from the masked state when the signal applied to the switch terminal P203 is at the high level.
      <br/>
      If the potential of the other input of the gate G201 successively changes to the high level and the low level in this order, the output signal of the output terminal P202 is changed to the high level and the low level in this order.
      <br/>
      Hence, when the signal applied to the switch terminal P203 is at the high level, the delay time from the input terminal P201 to the output terminal P202 is equal to 2 td because the input signal passes through the two stages of gates therebetween.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In the operation of the second delay circuit 202, the gate G203 is masked when the signal applied to the switch terminal P204 is at the low level.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the output terminal P202 is always at the low level irrespective of whether the other input of the gate G203 is high or low.
      <br/>
      The gate 203 is released from the masked state when the signal applied to the switch terminal P204 is at the high level.
      <br/>
      If the potential of the other input of the gate G203 successively changes to the high level and the low level in this order, the output signal of the output terminal P202 is changed to the high level and the low level in this order.
      <br/>
      Hence, when the signal applied to the switch terminal P204 is at the high level, the delay time from the input terminal P201 to the output terminal P202 is equal to 4 td because the input signal passes through the four stages of gates therebetween.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Similarly, the output signal of the output terminal P202 obtained when the third delay circuit 203 or the fourth delay circuit 204 is activated by the switch signal applied to the switch terminal P205 or P206, respectively.
      <br/>
      If the switch signal applied to the switch terminal P205 is at the high level, the delay time provided from the input terminal P201 to the output terminal P202 is equal to 6 td, which corresponds to 6 gates.
      <br/>
      When the switch signal applied to the switch terminal P206 is at the high level, the delay time from the input terminal P201 to the output terminal P202 is equal to 8 td, which corresponds to 8 gates.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Hence, the conventional variable delay circuit having four stages of delay circuits is capable of providing the variable times equal to 2 td to 8 td.</p>
    <p num="12">A description will now be given, with reference to FIG. 2, of a conventional DLL circuit utilizing the above-mentioned conventional variable delay circuit.</p>
    <p num="13">
      Referring to FIG. 2, a conventional DLL circuit 210 includes a variable delay circuit 212, a phase comparator circuit 215, and a delay control circuit 216.
      <br/>
      The variable delay circuit 212 delays an external clock signal received by an input circuit 211 by a given delay time, and outputs the delayed external clock signal to an output circuit 213.
      <br/>
      The phase comparator circuit 215 compares the phase of a reference signal "ref" supplied from the input circuit 211 with the phase of a signal "in" output by a dummy circuit 214.
      <br/>
      The signal output by the dummy circuit 214 has a delay time equal to the sum of the delay times of the input circuit 211, the variable delay circuit 212 and the output circuit 213 and the delay times of wiring lines provided between the input circuit 211 and the output circuit 213.
      <br/>
      The conventional DLL circuit 210 thus configured functions to delay the clock signal from the input circuit 211 with a precision of approximately 200 ps so that the output clock signal having a predetermined phase relationship with the clock signal from the input circuit 211.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      A description will now be given, with reference to FIG. 3, of a phase setting process of the DLL circuit 210.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 3, a symbol "ref" denotes the reference signal output by the input circuit 211, and a symbol "in" denotes the signal output by the dummy circuit 214.
      <br/>
      The DLL circuit 210 delays the external clock received via the input circuit 211 by a given delay time through the variable delay circuit 212.
      <br/>
      The output circuit 213 receives the delayed clock signal from the variable delay circuit 212 and supplies a circuit of the following stage with the clock signal which has been pulled in phase with the external clock signal.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The dummy circuit 214 supplies the phase comparator circuit 215 with the signal "in" having the same delay time as that equal to the sum of the delay times of the input circuit 211, the variable delay circuit 212 and the output circuit 213 and the delay times of the wiring lines provided therebetween (step S101).
      <br/>
      The input circuit 211 outputs, as the reference signal "ref", the external clock signal to the phase comparator circuit 215 (step S101).
      <br/>

    <p num="59">
      FIG. 4 is a circuit diagram of a variable delay circuit according to an embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The variable delay circuit shown in FIG. 4 is connected to a transfer path extending from an input terminal P1 to an output terminal P2, and includes a plurality of delay circuits connected in parallel with the transfer path.
      <br/>
      The circuit configuration shown in FIG. 4 includes five delay circuits 41, 42, 43, 44 and 45.
      <br/>
      The delay time of the variable delay circuit can be controlled by controlling the variable delay circuits 41-45.
      <br/>
      The number of stages of the variable delay circuit is not limited to five as shown in FIG. 4 but may be equal to an arbitrary number.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The first through fifth delay circuits 41-45 include transistors TR1-TR5, respectively.
      <br/>
      The drains of the transistors TR1-TR5 are open, and the gates thereof receive switch signals via switch terminals P3-P7, respectively.
      <br/>
      The sources of the transistors TR1-TR5 are connected to the transfer path.
      <br/>
      The delay time of the variable delay circuit shown in FIG. 4 can be changed by varying the gate capacitance of at least one of the transistors TR1-TR5 by controlling the gate voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      The variable delay circuit shown in FIG. 4 has a small size and a capability of varying the delay time with a high precision by controlling the gate capacitances of the transistors TR1-TR5.
      <br/>
      The transistors TR1-TR5 can be configured so as to have delay times in arithmetical series in which the delay times respectively implemented by each of the transistors TR1-TR5 are equal to each other.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, it is possible to arrange the transistors TR1-TR5 so as to have delay times in geometrical series in which the ratios of the delay times implemented by the individual transistors are equal to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Referring to FIG. 5, there is illustrated a configuration of the variable delay circuit according to another embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The variable delay circuit shown in FIG. 5 is connected to a transfer path extending from an input terminal P8 to an output terminal P9, and includes a delay circuit group 56 connected in parallel with the transfer path.
      <br/>
      The delay time of the variable delay circuit can be varied by controlling the delay circuit group 56, which includes five stages of delay circuits in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      However, the delay circuit group 56 can have an arbitrary number of stages.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The delay circuit group 56 shown in FIG. 5 includes first through fifth delay circuits 51-55.
      <br/>
      The first delay circuit 51 includes a transistor TR6 having a source connected to the transfer path, a drain connected to the second delay circuit 52, and a gate to which a switch signal is applied via a switch terminal P10.
      <br/>
      The second delay circuit 52 includes a transistor TR7 having a source connected to the first delay circuit 51, a drain connected to the third delay circuit 53, and a gate to which a switch signal is applied via a switch terminal P11.
      <br/>
      The third delay circuit 53 includes a transistor TR8, which has a source connected to the second delay circuit 52, a drain connected to the fourth delay circuit 54, and a gate to which a switch signal is applied via a switch terminal P12.
      <br/>
      The fourth delay circuit 54 has a transistor TR9, which has a source connected to the third delay circuit 53, a drain connected to the fifth delay circuit 55 and a gate to which a switch signal is applied via a switch terminal P13.
      <br/>
      The fifth delay circuit 55 includes a transistor TR10, which has a source connected to the fourth delay circuit 54, a drain which is in the open state, and a gate to which a switch signal is applied via a switch terminal P14.
      <br/>
      The gate capacitance of at least one of the transistors TR6-TR10 can be changed by controlling the gate voltage starting from the switch terminal P10, so that the delay time of the variable delay circuit can be controlled.
      <br/>
      Thus, the variable delay circuit shown in FIG. 5 has a small size and a capability of varying the delay time with a high precision without increasing the circuit size.
    </p>
    <p num="64">FIG. 6 is a circuit diagram of the configuration of the variable delay circuit according to yet another embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="65">
      The variable delay circuit shown in FIG. 6 is connected to a transfer path extending from an input terminal P15 to an output terminal P16, and includes a first delay circuit group 61, a second delay circuit group 62, and a third delay circuit group 63.
      <br/>
      The delay time of the variable delay circuit can be varied by controlling any of the groups 61-63.
      <br/>
      The configuration shown in FIG. 6 is not limited to three but may include an arbitrary number of groups.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Each of the delay circuit groups 61, 62 and 63 is configured so as to have the same configuration as that of the delay circuit group 56 shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The first group 61 includes three transistors TR11, TR12 and TR13, which receive switch signals via switch terminals P17, P18 and P19, respectively.
      <br/>
      The second group 62 includes three transistors TR14, TR15 and TR16, which receive switch signals via switch terminals P20, P21 and P22, respectively.
      <br/>
      The third group 63 includes three transistors TR17, TR18 and TR19, which receive switch signals via switch terminals P23, P24 and P25, respectively.
      <br/>
      At least one of the three transistors in each group can be controlled starting from the respective first transistor connected to the transfer path, so that the delay time by which the signal on the transfer path is delayed by the variable delay circuit can be varied.
      <br/>
      Thus, the variable delay circuit shown in FIG. 6 has a small size and a capability of varying the delay time with a high precision.
    </p>
    <p num="67">FIG. 7 is a circuit diagram of a variable delay circuit according to a further embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="68">
      The variable delay circuit shown in FIG. 7 includes four transfer paths, each extending from an input terminal P17 to an output terminal P18, and four delay circuits 71, 72, 73 and 74 provided in the respective transfer paths.
      <br/>
      One of the delay circuits 71-74 can be selected to control the delay time.
      <br/>
      The configuration shown in FIG. 7 is limited to the four delay circuits 71-74, but may be equipped with an arbitrary number of delay circuits.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The delay circuits 71-74 respectively include capacitors C1-C4 respectively having different capacitance values, switches SW1-SW4 provided in series in the respective transfer lines, and switch terminals P19-P22 for controlling the switches SW1-SW4.
      <br/>
      Hence, the variable delay circuit shown in FIG. 7 has a small size and a capability of varying the delay time with a high precision by selecting at least one of the delay circuits 71-74.
    </p>
    <p num="70">FIG. 8 is a block diagram of a DLL circuit using the variable delay circuit of the present invention, which may have any of the configurations shown in FIGS. 4 through 7.</p>

      The second variable delay circuit 2 can be configured according to the present invention and may have the same configuration as that shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The second variable delay circuit 2 is capable of controlling the delay time with a comparatively high precision.
      <br/>
      The term "comparatively high precision" means that the second variable delay circuit 2 has a higher precision than that of the first variable delay circuit 1.
      <br/>
      The delay time of the second variable delay circuit 2 can be varied by changing the gate capacitance of the built-in transistor or transistors by controlling the gate voltage or voltages.

      At the phase comparing operation of the first phase comparing circuit 5 at step S2 shown in FIG. 10, the first phase comparing circuit 5 makes a decision that the two signals are in phase ("just") and there is no need to increase or decrease the delay time, if the timing (edge) of the signal 13a with respect to that of the signal 10c is located within the range from time T(r1) to time T(r2), as shown in FIG. 12B. If the timing of the signal 13a with respect to that of the signal 10c is delayed over the time T(r1), the first phase comparing circuit 5 makes a decision that the delay time should be increased ("+1").

      However, at the next phase setting timing, the first delay control circuit 3 controls the first variable delay circuit 1 to decrease the delay time by the time equal to one stage on the basis of the decision result "-1" provided by the first phase comparing circuit 5.
      <br/>
      That is, if the first phase comparing circuit 5 has a precision so that the in-phase decision period is longer than the delay time of one stage of the first variable delay circuit 1, the delay time increasing and decreasing operations are alternatively executed indefinitely, so that the number of stages in the first variable delay circuit cannot be determined for ever.
