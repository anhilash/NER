      The present invention provides a method for mass production of an antimicrobial peptide, which comprises the steps of: constructing a fusion gene containing a first gene encoding a negatively charged acidic peptide having at least two cysteine residues and a second gene encoding a positively charged basic antimicrobial peptide; transforming a host microorganism with an expression vector comprising the fusion gene; cultivating the transformed microorganism to express a fusion peptide containing the acidic peptide and antimicrobial peptide, and, recovering the expressed antimicrobial peptide.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the present invention, the inhibitory effect of the expressed antimicrobial peptide on the growth of the host microorganism can be dramatically minimized by fusing it with the acidic peptide.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, antimicrobial peptides can be produced massively from a recombinant microorganism regardless of the kind of the antimicrobial peptides.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a method for mass production of an antimicrobial peptide, more specifically, to a method for mass production of an antimicrobial peptide by producing the antimicrobial peptide in a form of fusion protein with a foreign peptide through gene manipulation.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In general, antimicrobial peptides do not easily lose their biological activities by physical and chemical factors such as heat, alkali, etc.
      <br/>
      Moreover, they do not readily induce a resistance to microorganisms as they show an antimicrobial activity through their characteristic action mechanism which is clearly discriminated from conventional antibiotics.
      <br/>
      Thus, antimicrobial peptides have enjoyed high industrial applicability in the areas of pharmacy, food, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      However, there is a crucial problem in the industrial application of the antimicrobial peptides, since the conventional techniques do not permit mass production of the peptides at a low price.
      <br/>
      For example, chemical synthesis does not allow the mass production of the antimicrobial peptides in an economical manner.
      <br/>
      In this regard, genetic engineering technology employing recombinant microorganisms, has been suggested in the art as an alternative means.
      <br/>
      However, it has also revealed a disadvantage of low productivity since the expressed antimicrobial peptides inhibit the growth of the recombinant microorganisms.
    </p>
    <p num="6">U.S. Pat. No. 5,205,154 discloses a gene construct comprising a gene of a carrier polypeptide inhibiting the antimicrobial activity of cecropin and a gene of cecropin, where araB is employed as the carrier polypeptide, though the nature of the carrier polypeptide is not critical.</p>
    <p num="7">U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,866 teaches a process for preparing a positively charged antimicrobial peptide as a fusion protein with a negatively charged peptide to inhibit bacterial proteolysis, where glutathione-S-transferase, protein A, IgG-binding domain of protein A, protein F from Pseudomonas aeruginosa or prepro defensin is employed as the negatively charged peptide.</p>
    <p num="8">Accordingly, there are strong reasons for exploring and developing alternative means for mass production of the antimicrobial peptide in an economical manner.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">The present inventors have made an effort to solve the disadvantages of low productivity and poor economy in the course of manufacturing the antimicrobial peptide, and successfully prepared the antimicrobial peptide in a massive and economical manner by the aid of recombinant DNA technology.</p>
    <p num="10">A primary object of the present invention is to provide a method for mass production of an antimicrobial peptide in recombinant microorganisms, which employs an expression system permitting mass production of the antimicrobial peptide.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">A method for mass production of an antimicrobial peptide of the present invention, comprises the steps of: constructing a fusion gene containing a first gene encoding an acidic peptide having at least two cysteine residues and a second gene encoding a basic antimicrobial peptide; transforming a host microorganism with an expression vector comprising the fusion gene; culturing the transformed microorganism to express a fusion peptide containing the acid peptide and the antimicrobial peptide; and, recovering the antimicrobial peptide from the fusion peptide.</p>
    <p num="13">In carrying out the present invention, a gene construct which comprises a first gene encoding an acidic peptide having at least two cysteine residues and a second gene encoding a basic antimicrobial peptide, and an expression vector which comprises a promoter operably linked to a gene sequence containing a first gene encoding an acidic peptide having at least two cysteine residues and a second gene encoding a basic antimicrobial peptide, are essentially required, and the fusion gene may be present in a form of monomer or multimer.</p>
    <p num="14">Contrary to the results in U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,866, the present inventors discovered that: a general acidic peptide gene does not permit an efficient expression of a basic antimicrobial peptide; and, the presence of at least two cysteine residues in the acidic peptide can efficiently solve the said problem.</p>
    <p num="15">
      In the gene construct of the invention, a first gene codes for an acidic peptide having at least two cysteine residues and neutralizing positive charges of an antimicrobial peptide substantially.
      <br/>
      Although the length of the acidic peptide is not limited, it is, preferably, equal to or longer than that of the antimicrobial peptide in order to efficiently neutralize the charges of a desired antimicrobial peptide, when considering length and distribution of positive charges.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the acidic peptide has two or more cysteine residues.
      <br/>
      It is postulated that the cysteine residues promote interaction between negative charges of the acidic peptide and positive charges of the antimicrobial peptide by the formation of a secondary structure through disulfide bonds.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In accordance with the present invention, the acidic peptide may be synthesized artificially or selected among natural acidic peptides, and may be obtained using the synthetic gene encoding the peptide or isolated from nature.
      <br/>
      The artificially designed acidic peptide has two or more cysteine residues, and the natural acidic peptide may be modified to have sufficient cysteine residues.
      <br/>
      Also, the acidic peptide gene may be modified in various ways for the purpose of easy fusion with a second gene encoding the antimicrobial peptide, easy isolation of the antimicrobial peptide from the fusion peptide, or the preparation of various multimeric forms of a fusion gene.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      For example, the acidic peptide gene may be synthesized or modified so that it can be connected to the antimicrobial peptide gene to have a correct reading frame resulting the desired antimicrobial peptide.
      <br/>
      Also, the acidic peptide gene may be synthesized or modified to include nucleotide sequences encoding a cleavage site for a specific protease or a chemical in order to isolate the antimicrobial peptide from the expressed fusion peptide.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The acidic peptide gene may be selected to have the most suitable length for the neutralization of the antimicrobial peptide among monomers or multimers of the acidic peptide genes.
      <br/>
      The multimer of an acidic peptide gene may be prepared by employing gene amplification technique.
      <br/>
      For example, vectors comprising multimers of an acidic peptide gene can be prepared by inserting an acidic peptide gene between two Class-IIS restriction enzyme sites of a vector containing two oppositely oriented Class-IIS restriction enzyme sites, digesting the vector with a Class-IIS restriction enzyme, isolating a DNA fragment containing the acidic peptide gene, self-ligating the isolated DNA fragments to prepare multimers, and cloning the various multimers into the vector digested with the Class-IIS restriction enzyme (see: Lee, J. H. et al., Genetic Analysis: Biomolecular Engineering, 13:139-145(1996)).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In accordance with the present invention, the antimicrobial peptide may be designed artificially or selected among natural acidic peptides, and may be obtained using the synthetic gene encoding the desired peptide or isolated from nature.
      <br/>
      The antimicrobial peptide gene may be modified in various ways for the purpose of easy fusion with the acidic peptide gene, easy isolation of the antimicrobial peptide from the fusion peptide, or the preparation of various multimeric forms of the fusion gene.
    </p>
    <p num="20">For example, the antimicrobial peptide gene may be modified so that the C-terminal region of the antimicrobial peptide can be connected to the N-terminal region of the acidic peptide in a correct reading frame (antimicrobial peptide gene I).</p>
    <p num="21">Also, the antimicrobial peptide gene may be modified to include nucleotide sequences encoding a site cleaved by a specific protease or a chemical at the N-terminus in order to isolate the antimicrobial peptide from the expressed fusion peptide, and nucleotide sequences permitting termination of peptide synthesis at the C-terminus of the antimicrobial peptide (antimicrobial peptide gene II).</p>
    <p num="22">In addition, the antimicrobial peptide gene may be modified to include nucleotide sequences encoding a cleavage site for a specific protease or a chemical (for example, a codon encoding a methionine residue for the cleavage by CNBr) at the N-terminus and the C-terminus of the antimicrobial peptide in order to isolate the antimicrobial peptide from the expressed fusion peptide (antimicrobial peptide gene III).</p>
    <p num="23">The fusion gene may be prepared by ligating the acidic peptide gene and the antimicrobial peptide gene prepared as described above, and the acidic peptide gene or the antimicrobial peptide gene may be a monomer or a multimer as mentioned above.</p>
    <p num="24">In accordance with the present invention, the fusion gene contains a first gene encoding an acidic peptide and a second gene encoding an antimicrobial peptide gene, and those may be ligated directly or indirectly through linker, etc., if the two genes are connected in a correct reading frame.</p>
    <p num="25">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the fusion gene may be prepared by modifying the acidic peptide gene and the antimicrobial peptide gene to have complementary nucleotide sequences at the 3'-termini of single strands of each gene, annealing two genes via a partial hybridization, and performing PCR with the hybridized genes as a template and with primers corresponding to the sequences to the 5'-termini of respective single stranded genes.</p>
    <p num="26">
      Various number of monomer of a fusion gene thus prepared, may be concatenated to prepare various multimers of the fusion gene by the conventional methods in the art, e.g., self-ligation of a fusion gene.
      <br/>
      A multimer of a fusion gene may be also prepared by employing gene amplification system.
      <br/>
      For example, vectors containing multimers of a fusion gene can be prepared by inserting the fusion gene between two Class-IIS restriction enzyme sites of a vector containing two oppositely oriented Class-IIS restriction enzyme sites, digesting the vector with the Class-IIS restriction enzyme, isolating a DNA fragment containing the fusion gene, self-ligating the isolated DNA fragments to prepare multimers of a fusion gene, and cloning the multimers of the fusion gene into the vector digested with the Class-IIS restriction enzyme.
    </p>
    <p num="27">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a multimer of a fusion gene is a multimer of the fusion gene comprising antimicrobial peptide gene III.</p>
    <p num="28">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a multimer of a fusion gene is a multimer wherein the fusion gene comprising antimicrobial peptide gene II is ligated to 3'-terminus of a monomer or multimer of a fusion gene comprising antimicrobial peptide gene I.</p>
    <p num="29">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a multimer of a fusion gene is a multimer wherein the fusion gene comprising antimicrobial peptide gene II is ligated to 3'-terminus of a monomer or multimer of a fusion gene comprising antimicrobial peptide gene III.</p>
    <p num="30">
      A multimer of a fusion gene can be cloned into a suitable expression vector and expressed in a microorganism, e.g., E. coli, to express multimer of the fusion peptide.
      <br/>
      The multimer of the fusion peptide is treated with an enzyme or a chemical, e.g., CNBr, to remove the acidic peptide and separate the antimicrobial peptide into monomers, and the antimicrobial peptide is purified using cation-exchange chromatography, etc.
      <br/>
      When a multimer of a fusion peptide obtained after expression of a multimer is treated with an enzyme or a chemical, e.g., CNBr, the antimicrobial peptide present at the end of the multimer may be obtained in a monomer of native form.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The present invention is further illustrated in the following examples, which should not be taken to limit the scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      Particularly, since antimicrobial peptides, acidic peptides and genes of their multimers used in Examples are only preferred embodiments of the invention, the present invention covers all of the inventions employing an acidic peptide containing at least two cysteins residues for the purpose of mass production of various basic antimicrobial peptides.
    </p>
    <p num="32">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="33">Selection of Acidic Peptides</p>
    <p num="34">
      The native Guamerin (hereinafter, referred to as "G"; Jung, H. I. et al.(1995) J. Biol. Chem., 270:13879-13884) and a modified MIS (hereinafter, referred to as "M"; Zasloff, M.(1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 84:5449-5453) which have a lot of cysteine residues were employed as acidic peptides.
      <br/>
      As can be seen in FIGS. 1(A) and 1(B) (wherein only sense sequences were shown), single stranded oligonucleotides (SEQ ID NO:1; and, SEQ ID NO:3) encoding the acidic peptides were synthesized.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The oligonucleotides thus synthesized were dissolved in TE buffer (pH 8.0) in the same molar ratio, heated at 70 (degree)  C. for 10 minutes, and left to stand at 0 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      After 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, double stranded DNA fragments were isolated, and cloned into pBBS1 vector (see: Lee, J. H. et al., Genetic Analysis: Biomolecular Engineering, 13:139-145(1996)) digested with BbsI to construct pBBS1-G1 (Guamerin) or pBBS1-M1 (MIS) vector.
      <br/>
      Since, multimers (pBBS1-Gn or pBBS1-Mn, n=1,2,3, . . . ) of the acidic peptide genes can be prepared using the pBBS1-G1, or pBBS1-M1 vector thus constructed, the acidic peptides having the most suitable length to neutralize an antimicrobial peptide were selected.
    </p>
    <p num="36">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="37">Preparation of an Antimicrobial Peptide Gene</p>
    <p num="38">
      In order to prepare an antimicrobial peptide by expressing the antimicrobial peptide in a multimeric form of a fusion peptide and treating it with CNBr, methionine codons were introduced to both ends of a gene of Buforin II(TRSSRAGLQFPVGRVHRLLRK(SEQ ID NO:9); Park, C. B. et al., (1996) Biochem.

    </p>
    <p num="39">
      A DNA sequence encoding Buforin II (hereinafter, referred to as "B") was synthesized and cloned into pBBS1 vector digested with BbsI to construct pBBS1-B1 vector.
      <br/>
      The resulting pBBS1-B1vector contains a complete Buforin II gene and two methionine codons at both ends of the Buforin II gene.

    <p num="40">EXAMPLE 3</p>
    <p num="41">Preparation of a Fusion Gene Containing an Acidic Peptide Gene and an Antimicrobial Peptide Gene</p>
    <p num="42">
      In order to prepare a fusion gene containing the acidic peptide gene and the antimicrobial peptide gene obtained in Examples 1 and 2, PCR was carried out as followings (see: FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B)): Using a couple of primers corresponding to 5'-end and 3'-end of the acidic peptide (i.e., Guamerin) gene (primer 1:5'-AAAGAAGACGGCCCCCGGTCGACGAGAATGCG-3'(SEQ ID NO:10) and primer 2:5'-GCTGCTACGGGTCATGATCCCCGCGCAGGT-3'(SEQ ID NO:11)), respectively, the Guamerin gene was amplified by the aid of PCR technique.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, using a couple of primers corresponding to 5'-end and 3'-end of the antimicrobial peptide (Buforin II) (primer 3:5'-ACCTGCGCGGGGATCATGACCCGTAGCAGC-3'(SEQ ID NO:12) and primer 4:5'-TGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGA-3'(SEQ ID NO:13), respectively, the Buforin II gene was amplified by PCR.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The PCR products thus amplified were mixed in a same molar ratio and amplified again by PCR using primer 1 (SEQ ID NO:10) and primer 4 (SEQ ID NO:13).
      <br/>
      The PCR product thus obtained was digested with BbsI.
      <br/>
      Then, the fragments of the fusion gene containing the Guamerin gene and the Buforin II gene were isolated and cloned into pBBS1 vector digested with BbsI to construct pBBS1-(GB)1 vector (see: FIG. 2(A)).
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      And then, in order to prepare multimers of the fusion gene employing gene amplification system, the pBBS1-(GB)1 vector was digested with BbsI and the fragments containing the fusion gene were isolated.
      <br/>
      The isolated DNA fragments were self-ligated to prepare multimers, and the various multimers were cloned into pBBS1 vector digested with BbsI to construct vectors comprising multimers of the fusion gene which were designated as pBBS1-(GB)n (n=1,2,3,4, . . . ) (see: FIG. 3).
    </p>
    <p num="45">On the other hand, pBBS1-(MB)1 vector and vectors comprising multimers of the fusion gene, pBBS1-(MB)n (n=1,2,3,4, . . . ) were constructed in the same manner as mentioned above, except for employing MIS (containing S--S bond) as acidic peptide instead of Guamerin (see: FIG. 2(B)).</p>
    <p num="46">EXAMPLE 4</p>
    <p num="47">Preparation of a Fusion Gene for the Expression of a Native Antimicrobial Peptide and its Multimers</p>
    <p num="48">
      The antimicrobial peptide obtained from the multimers of fusion gene prepared in Example 3 has a homoserine residue at their C-terminus.
      <br/>
      In order to prepare a native antimicrobial peptide which does not contain the homoserine residue, a fusion gene whose sequence was slightly modified from that of the fusion gene prepared in Example 3 and its multimers were prepared as followings: For this purpose, Guamerin was used as the acidic peptide and MSI-78(GIGKFLKKAKKFGKAFVKILKK-NH2 : SEQ ID NO:14) was used as the antimicrobial peptide, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="49">Two kinds of antimicrobial peptide genes (hereinafter, referred to as "BI" and "BII", respectively) suitable for the purpose were prepared, where antimicrobial peptide gene I was prepared so that the peptide encoded by this gene may have no methionine residue at the N-terminus, and the C-terminus can be in-frame fused to the following acidic peptide gene in a correct reading frame, and antimicrobial peptide gene II was prepared so that the peptide encoded by this gene may have one methionine residue at N-terminus and peptide synthesis may be terminated at C-terminus.</p>
    <p num="50">
      The antimicrobial peptide genes I and II thus prepared were ligated with an acidic peptide gene, respectively, in the same manner as in Example 3 to prepare fusion genes, and cloned into pBBS1 vector digested with BbsI to construct pBBS1-(GBI)1 and pBBS1-(GB II)1 vectors, respectively (see: FIGS. 4(A) and 4(B)).
      <br/>
      Multimers of the GB I fusion gene were prepared from the pBBS1-(GB I)1 vector employing gene amplification system, and monomer of the GB II fusion gene was ligated to the ends of the multimers to construct vectors which were designated as pBBS1-�(GB I)n (GB II)� (n=0,1,2,3,4, . . . )

    <p num="53">
      In order to express the multimers of the fusion genes cloned in the vectors prepared in Examples 3 and 4 in E. coli, the multimers were cloned into an expression vector pET21c (Novagen, USA) digested with BamHI/HindIII, and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) to express multimers of the fusion peptides.
      <br/>
      After the induction of expression of the multimers, the cells were harvested from the cultured media.
      <br/>
      The lysates thus obtained were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (see: FIG. 5(A)).
      <br/>
      In FIG. 5(A), lane M shows molecular weight marker; lane 1 shows cell lysates of E. coli which does not contain the expression vector; and, lanes 2 to 14 show cell lysates of E. coli transformed with pET21c, pET21c-B1, pET21c-B2, pET21c-B4, pET21c-B6, pET21c-(GB)1, pET21c-(GB)2, pET21c-(GB)4, pET21c-(GB)6, pET21c-(MB)1, pET21c-(MB)2, pET21c-(MB)4, and pET21c-(MB)6, respectively.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 5(A), it was found that the expression of the multimers remarkably increased compared to that of the multimers of Buforin II alone.
      <br/>
      Among the recombinant E. coli containing an expression vector, one recombinant showing maximum expression was finally selected.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Inclusion bodies of the multimer of the fusion peptide whose expression was confirmed as above were suspended in a solution containing 1N HCl and 6M guanidinium chloride, and treated with 1M CNBr.
      <br/>
      Then, the peptides were collected by reverse-phase concentration using Sep-Pak, and the antimicrobial peptides with positive charges were purified by QAE-Sephadex (Sigma Chemical Co., USA) anion-exchange chromatography.
      <br/>
      The antimicrobial peptide thus isolated was further purified by reverse-phase HPLC to obtain a pure recombinant antimicrobial peptide.

      Various Guamerin-antimicrobial peptide fusion genes were prepared by fusing the synthesized Guamerin gene with various antimicrobial peptide genes shown in Table 1, respectively.
      <br/>
      That is, the synthesized Guamerin gene was digested with BspHI to give the termini complementary to BspHI or NcoI cleavage site, and fused with the antimicrobial peptide genes synthesized which were digested with NcoI to prepare fusion genes.

      In order to express the fusion genes prepared in Example 6 in E. coli, PRSET (Invitrogen, USA) expression vector was employed.
      <br/>
      The expression vector was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, dephosphorylated, and Guamerin-antimicrobial peptide fusion genes synthesized in Example 6 were cloned. E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS was transformed with the vectors having fusion genes by CaCl2 method (see: Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed. (1989)).
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      The transformants were cultured in 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin at 37 (degree)  C. overnight.
      <br/>
      The cultured cells were diluted in 5 ml of fresh LB medium in a final concentration of 1%(v/v), and incubated at 37 (degree)  C. for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      Then, lactose was added to the cultured medium in a final concentration of 2% to induce the expression of the fusion peptides at 37 (degree)  C. for 4 hours.
      <br/>
      The expression of fusion genes was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (see: FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      In FIG. 7, lane M shows molecular weight markers (97.4, 66.2, 45, 31, 21.5, 14.4 Kd); lanes 1-8 show cell lysates of E. coli transformed with fusion genes in which genes encoding apidaecin I, bombinin, cecropin A, drosocin, HNP1, indolicidin, melittin and tachyplesin I were employed as antimictobial peptide genes, respectively.

      As clearly illustrated and demonstrated as above, the present invention provides a method for mass production of antimicrobial peptide, which comprises a step of preparing the antimicrobial peptide as a fusion peptide with a foreign peptide.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the present invention, the inhibitory effect of the expressed antimicrobial peptide on the growth of host microorganism can be dramatically minimized by fusing it with the acidic peptide.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, antimicrobial peptides can be produced massively from a recombinant microorganism regardless of the kind of the antimicrobial peptides.
