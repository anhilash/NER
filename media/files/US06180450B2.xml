      In one aspect of the invention, an insulative nitride oxidation barrier layer is provided over a cell polysilicon layer to a thickness of at least about 150 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      An insulating layer is provided above the nitride oxidation barrier layer, and an contact/container is etched therethrough and through dielectric and cell polysilicon layers.
      <br/>
      Such exposes edges of the cell polysilicon within the contact/container.
      <br/>
      The wafer is then exposed to an oxidizing ambient to oxidize the cell polysilicon exposed edges, with the nitride oxidation barrier layer during such oxidation exposure inhibiting oxidation of the outer surface of the cell polysilicon layer.
      <br/>
      In another aspect, a multi-container stacked capacitor construction has its containers defined or otherwise electrically isolated in a single CMP step.
      <br/>
      In another aspect, a combination etch stop/oxidation barrier layer or region is provided to enable exposure of a precise quantity of the outside walls of a stacked capacitor container.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates generally to capacitor formation in semiconductor wafer processing, and to formation of memory cells employing capacitors.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      As DRAMs increase in memory cell density, there is a continuous challenge to maintain sufficiently high storage capacitance despite decreasing cell area.
      <br/>
      Additionally, there is a continuing goal to further decrease cell area.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The principal way of increasing cell capacitance is to through cell structure techniques.
      <br/>
      Such techniques include three-dimensional cell capacitors, such as trenched or stacked capacitors.
      <br/>
      This invention concerns stacked capacitor cell constructions, including what are commonly known as crown or cylindrical container stacked capacitors, as well as to other stacked capacitor constructions.
      <br/>
      Aspects of the invention will have specific application in 64 Meg process flows and beyond.

      A series of four word lines 16, 18, 20 and 22 are provided, being comprised of polysilicon regions 24 and WSix regions 26.
      <br/>
      The discussion focuses on word line 18, with the remaining word lines having similar constructions.
      <br/>
      The conductive portions of word line 18 include a top 28 and sidewalls 30.
      <br/>
      Such are electrically insulated by covering layers of a first insulating material 31A and 31B, which in the preferred embodiment comprise Si3 N4.
      <br/>
      Such would be provided in separate steps and could of course be comprised of different materials.
      <br/>
      A pair of source/drain areas 32, 34 lie adjacent word line 18.
      <br/>
      A source/drain area 36 is also shown with respect to word line 20, with source/drain region 34 serving as a common active area for both word lines 18 and 20.
      <br/>
      Word line 18 in operation define a field effect transistor gate for a transistor of a memory cell.
      <br/>
      Capacitors will be provided and electrically connect with source/drain areas 32 and 36.
      <br/>
      Thus, region 32 defines an area on a semiconductor wafer to which a capacitor plate is to be connected.
      <br/>
      A bit line will connect with region 34, as will be apparent from the continuing discussion.

      A planarized underlying layer 40 of insulating material is provided atop the wafer over the word line and source/drain areas to provide an upper surface 42 which is elevationally above insulating material 31 and correspondingly word line top 28.

      Surface 42 is preferably from about 500 Angstroms to about 2000 Angstroms above the upper surface of the uppermost insulating region 31.
      <br/>
      Underlying layer 40 is preferably an oxide of the SiO2 variety, such as phosphosilicate glass (PSG) or borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG), with BPSG being preferred.

      Where insulating layer 40 comprises an oxide, the material of region 44 preferably comprises an insulative nitride, such as Si3 N4.
      <br/>
      Alternatively where region 40 comprises PSG or BPSG, the material of layer 44 might constitute SiO2 deposited by decomposition of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS).

      Alternately considered, the combination of underlying layer 40 and combination layer 44 can be considered as a base layer 48 of insulating material, with layer 44 constituting an uppermost region 44 thereof.

    <p num="15">
      In the illustrated and preferred embodiment, insulating base layer 48 is not homogeneous, with uppermost region 44 thereof being formed of a different material from remaining portions of base layer 48.

      Base layer 48 might also be formed to be homogeneous throughout, with the uppermost portion thereof providing the etch stop/oxidation barrier function, as will be apparent from the continuing discussion.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The thickness of uppermost region 44 is preferably from about 100 Angstroms to about 4000 Angstroms, depending upon the material used to provide a desired etch stop/oxidation barrier function.
      <br/>
      Where uppermost region/layer 44 comprises Si3 N4, the preferred thickness is from about 100 Angstroms to about 500 Angstroms.

      An intermediate layer 49 or insulating material is provided atop uppermost region/layer 44 of base layer 48.

      The insulating material of intermediate layer 49 is different in composition from the insulating material of uppermost region/layer 44, with the insulating material of intermediate layer 49 being selectively etchable relative to the insulating material of uppermost region/layer 44.
      <br/>
      Typically and preferably, the insulating material of intermediate layer 49 will be the same as underlying insulating layer 40 (where base layer 48 is not homogeneous), and thus typically preferably comprises an oxide such as PSG or BPSG.

      Referring to FIG. 2, capacitor or first contact/container openings 52, 54 are etched through intermediate layer 49, combination layer 44 and underlying insulating layer 40 to the one source/drain areas 32, 36, thus outwardly exposing areas to which electrical connection is to be made.
      <br/>
      Contact/container openings 52, 54 have a first open width "A" at upper surface 50.
      <br/>
      The discussion proceeds solely with reference to the capacitor being formed in contact/container opening 52, with an understanding that the same capacitor construction will be formed relative to contact/container opening 54.
      <br/>
      An example etch chemistry for producing the desired anisotropic contact/container etch would include CHF3 and O2 chemistry at low O2 flow rates, or CF4, Ar, CH2 F2 and CHF3 chemistry, for the oxide selective to the nitride of layer 44.
      <br/>
      This would be followed by a chemistry of CHF3 and O2 with increased O2 flow rates for the etch of the nitride.
      <br/>
      This would be followed again by the low O2 flow rate chemistry for the etch of the oxide to expose active areas 32, 36.

      <br/>
      First layer 56 is provided to a thickness which is less than one-half first open width dimension "A" leaving a second outward opening 58 having a second open width "B", which is less than first open width "A".
      <br/>
      The conductive material of layer 56 is selected such that the insulating material of intermediate layer 49 is selectively etchable relative to the conductive material of first layer 56.
      <br/>
      Where intermediate layer 49 comprises oxide, an example suitable and preferred material for layer 56 is conductively doped hemispherical grain polysilicon.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Referring to FIG. 3, first layer of conductive material 56 is removed from above upper surface 50 of intermediate insulating layer 49 to define an isolated capacitor storage node container 60.
      <br/>
      The preferred technique for removing such material is by chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) using, for example, a KOH, SiO2 particles and water as a slurry.
      <br/>
      For purposes of the continuing discussion, isolated capacitor storage node 60 defines sidewalls, having inner surfaces 62 and outer surfaces 64.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Referring to FIG. 4, intermediate insulating layer 49 has been etched selectively relative to isolated capacitor storage node 60 and combination layer/uppermost region 44, using combination layer 44 as an etch stop during such etching to expose only a portion of outer surfaces 64 of the sidewalls of container 60.
      <br/>
      Prior techniques, such as disclosed in our co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 07/947,523, principally employed a timed etch for exposing a portion of outer sidewalls of a capacitor container.
      <br/>
      Such provides a disadvantage of less process control in not being able to accurately set or predict the quantity of outside sidewall surface area which will be exposed, and thus resulting capacitance.
      <br/>
      The above-described combination layer/uppermost region 44 thus provides a function of providing a defined end point for accurately controlling the quantity of outside surface area of the container to be exposed.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Referring to FIG. 5, a capacitor dielectric layer 61 is provided atop the wafer over isolated capacitor storage node 60, including the inner and outer sidewall surfaces 62, 64 respectively, thereof.
      <br/>
      An example dielectric material would include an insulative nitride or oxide.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, a conductive capacitor cell layer 65 is provided over dielectric layer 61.
      <br/>
      A typical and preferred conductive material is conductively doped polysilicon.
      <br/>
      For purposes of the continuing discussion, cell capacitor layer 65 has an outer surface 66.
      <br/>
      An electrically insulative nitride oxidation barrier layer 68 is provided over cell polysilicon layer 65 to a thickness of at least about 150 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      A typical and preferred thickness for layer 68 is from about 250 Angstroms to about 1500 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      A typical and preferred material is Si3 N4.

      The function of such layer will be apparent from the continuing discussion.

    <p num="23">
      Referring to FIG. 6, a planarized overlying layer 70 of insulating material is provided above nitride oxidation barrier layer 68.
      <br/>
      Such insulating material preferably comprises the same insulating material of underlying layer 40, and thus typically comprises an oxide such as PSG or BPSG.
      <br/>
      A masking layer 72 is provided above overlying layer 70.
      <br/>
      The material of the masking layer is selected such that material of overlying layer 70 and underlying 40 is selectively etchable relative to the material of masking layer 72.
      <br/>
      Where the materials of layers 70 and 40 comprise oxide, the material of masking layer 72 preferably comprises a nitride, such as Si3 N4.
      <br/>
      In such case and where the material of uppermost region/layer 44 also comprises a nitride, the thickness of masking layer 72 is preferably provided to be greater than that of layer/region 44.
      <br/>
      The purposes of such will be apparent from the continuing discussion.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring to FIG. 7, a bit line contact/container opening 74 is anisotropically etched over the other source/drain area 34 through masking layer 72, overlying layer 70, nitride oxidation barrier layer 68 and cell polysilicon layer 65.
      <br/>
      During such etch, combination layer/region 44 is utilized as an etch stop, which capacitor dielectric layer 61 being too thin to function as a reliable etch stop.
      <br/>
      For purposes of the continuing discussion, contact/container opening 74 includes interior sidewalls 76 which include a pair of exposed edges 75 of cell polysilicon layer 65.
      <br/>
      At the latter stages during such anisotropic etch, conditions are modified slightly to obtain an undercut etch into polysilicon exposed edges 75.
      <br/>
      Wafer 10 is then exposed to oxidizing ambient conditions to oxidize the cell polysilicon exposed edges to form insulating SiO2 regions 78 (FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      Example oxidizing ambient conditions to produce the desired regions 78 would include H2 and O2 at 850 (degree)  C. in a conventional atmospheric furnace.
      <br/>
      The reason for undercut into cell polysilicon layer 65 is to prevent regions 78 from undesirably projecting considerably into contact/container opening 74.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Exposure of a wafer to oxidizing ambient conditions typically causes oxidation of silicon, even that silicon which underlies such insulating layers as PSG and BPSG.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the invention, nitride oxidation barrier layer 68 during exposure to an oxidizing ambient inhibits oxidation of outer surface 66 of cell polysilicon layer 65 which would otherwise could occur through material of overlying layer 70.
      <br/>
      Additionally, combination layer/uppermost region 44 during oxidizing ambient exposure inhibits oxidation of lower outer sidewalls 64 of isolated capacitor storage node 60, and inhibits oxidation which would otherwise occur at the surface of silicon source/drain area 34.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Referring to FIG. 8, combination layer/uppermost region 44 is etched from within bit line contact/container opening 74.
      <br/>
      Note that during such etch, a like quantity of masking layer 72 is also removed.
      <br/>
      Accordingly where the materials of layers 72 and region 44 are the same, layer 72 is provided thicker than layer 44 such that an effective layer of masking material remains after the layer 44 etch.
      <br/>
      Then, underlying layer 40 is etched from within bit line contact/container opening 74 to outwardly expose source/drain area 34.
      <br/>
      During such etch, masking layer 72 prevents etch of material 70, thus eliminating any need for masking at this point.
      <br/>
      Note also that where regions 31 comprise an insulative nitride, such as Si3 N4, an etch can be conducted which is selective to nitride and silicon of region 34.
      <br/>
      An example etch chemistry for such an anisotropic etch includes CHF3 and CF4.
      <br/>
      Alternately, a thin etch stop layer (such as Si3 N4) could be deposited over the wafer and regions 31 prior to deposition of layer 40 to shield regions 31 from the final bit line contact/container etch.
