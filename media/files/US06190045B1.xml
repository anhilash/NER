      <br/>
      The present invention would be a tubular bag or container constructed of transparent plastic.
      <br/>
      The bag or container would include two end mounted holes and two side mounted holes which are carved into the bag or container, allowing easy access.
      <br/>
      Elastic bands would circumferentially surround the holes and when the elastic bands would be expanded, a user could insert large items into the bag or container to store these items for a particular length of time.
      <br/>
      As an option, the present invention could be manufactured in a variety of sizes and from different materials, such as nylon or any other washable fabric.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      The present invention would be a tubular bag or container constructed of transparent plastic.
      <br/>
      The bag or container would include two-end mounted holes and two side-mounted holes which are carved into the bag or container, allowing easy access.
      <br/>
      Elastic bands would circumferentially surround the holes and when the elastic bands would be expanded, a user would be able to obtain large items such as toys or shoes located within the bag or container.
      <br/>
      In addition, a user could insert large items into the bag or container to store these items for a particular length of time.
      <br/>
      As an option, the present invention could be manufactured in a variety of sizes and from different materials, such as nylon or any other washable fabric.
      <br/>
      The bag or container itself could also be manufactured in a number of colors and designs, including logos for sports teams.
    </p>
    <p num="15">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved storage container.</p>
    <p num="16">It is another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved storage container that is flexible.</p>
    <p num="17">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved storage container that can be easily and efficiently manufactured.</p>
    <p num="18">It is still another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved storage container that can be used to store a wide variety of products.</p>
    <p num="19">It is still another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved storage container that would allow easy access to the contents of the storage container.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment when considered with the attached drawings and appended claims.
      <br/>
      BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows a side view of the container of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 shows a closeup side view of one of the side mounted elastic holes in the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows a closeup view of the elastic loop attached to the container of the present invention.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="21">
      Referring now to the present invention, FIG. 1 shows a side view of container 6.
      <br/>
      Container 6 would be a tubular bag constructed of transparent plastic.
      <br/>
      Container 6 would be roughly in the shape of a sock.
      <br/>
      Container 6 has a top-mounted hole 26, a bottom-mounted hole 27 and two side-mounted holes 28 and 29.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Top-mounted hole 26 is circumferentially surrounded by elastic band 4, which is kept in place by stitching 3.
      <br/>
      Top-mounted hole 26 is also surrounded by decorative side panel 5, which comprises extra fabric attached to container 6.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Bottom-mounted hole 27 is circumferentially surrounded by elastic band 12, which is kept in place by stitching 20.
      <br/>
      Bottom-mounted hole 27 is also surrounded by decorative side panel 21, which comprises extra fabric attached to container 6.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Side-mounted hole 28 is circumferentially surrounded by elastic band 8, which is kept in place by stitching 7.
      <br/>
      Side-mounted hole 28 is also surrounded by decorative side panel 9, which comprises extra fabric attached to container 6.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Side-mounted hole 29 is circumferentially surrounded by elastic band 18, which is kept in place by stitching 16.
      <br/>
      Side-mounted hole 29 is also surrounded by decorative side panel 17, which comprises extra fabric attached to container 6.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Container 6 can be used to store or contain certain items when any of the elastic bands of the present invention are expanded.
      <br/>
      Shown as examples of possible items that the present invention could contain are toy ball 10, which is completely contained within the present invention, and bag 14, which is shown being removed from container 6 through elastic band 12.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Container 6 also has a top mounted elastic loop 2, which would allow container 6 to be mounted in a wide variety of places.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, container 6 is shown attached to post 1 by hanging elastic loop 2 on post 1.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      FIG. 2 shows a closeup side view of side-mounted hole 28, with elastic band 8, stitching 7, and side panel 9.
      <br/>
      The other three elastic bands and associated parts on the present invention are identical to the parts shown in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      FIG. 3 shows elastic loop 2 attached to container 6.
      <br/>
      Elastic loop 2 is made from elastic and has two ends, first end 30 and second end 32.
      <br/>
      First end 30 and second end 32 are preferably attached to the top of container 6 by an "X" pattern of stitching that is used in conjunction with perimeter stitching.
