      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to novel immortalized cell lines of retinal origin (retinal endothelial and retinal pigmentary epithelial origin) which are capable of being implanted in the retina and of conveying a substance of therapeutic interest into the eye and the central nervous system.
      <br/>
      Such lines can also serve as a model for studying the blood/central nervous system interfaces.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Background</p>
    <p num="5">Both the blood-brain barrier and the blood-retina barrier are important in controlling the passage of substances to and from the neural parenchyma, especially in the maintenance of haemostasis.</p>
    <p num="6">
      In the retina, the blood-retina barrier comprises two different types of cells which are anatomically separate.
      <br/>
      The retinal vascular endothelium, which supplies the anterior portion of the retina, is currently considered to have an identical structure to the cerebral endothelium (Towler et al., J. Physiol., 1994, 480, 10-11P), whereas the cells of the retinal pigmentary epithelium cover the permeable vessels of the choroidal circulation and form the posterior barrier by means of their tight apical junctions; they are consequently similar to the tight junction epithelial cells of the choroid plexus.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The cerebral and retinal endothelia are of a different nature to the peripheral endothelium and do not serve only to express tight junctions and form a physical barrier.
      <br/>
      Other properties of the endothelium contribute to the specialized nature of this barrier, particular properties being the distribution and expression of substances such as the glucose transporter (GLUT-1), the transferrin receptor and P-glycoprotein (Pgp), the expression product of the drug resistance gene.
    </p>
    <p num="8">The cerebral and retinal endothelia also differ from the peripheral endothelium in their permeability to the circulating leukocytes.</p>
    <p num="9">The in vitro study of the molecular mechanisms of the induction of the endothelial phenotype has the disadvantage of being dependent on the availability, in primary cell cultures, of endothelial cells of cerebral or retinal vessels or pigmentary epithelial cells of the retina.</p>
    <p num="10">
      As far as in vivo transfer is concerned, the use of primary nerve tissues of foetal origin for cellular transplantation in human therapy gives rise to numerous ethical and practical problems; one alternative to this problem is to use primary cell lines of neural origin (for example neurons, glial cells, astrocytes) or non-neural cell cell lines (for example fibroblasts, myoblasts, chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, hepatocytes).
      <br/>
      Although the cell lines of the adrenal medulla, fibroblasts or myoblasts can actually release active substances in vivo, they are not normally present in the central nervous system, but can modify the normal function of the nervous system and cause a rejection reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Because of the heterogeneity of the endothelial cells of different tissues, influenced by the environment of these cells, it was important to be able to have cells adapted to the retinal environment in order to have tools permitting a good morphological and physiological integration of the cells when they are implanted or grafted.</p>
    <p num="12">Consequently, the Inventors set themselves the task of providing immortalized cell lines derived from primary cultures of the endothelium of the blood-retina barrier and the retinal pigmentary epithelium of mammals, especially rodents and more particularly rats, which cell lines are better capable of meeting practical needs, especially in that all the lines obtained are stable and have most of the characteristics of the differentiated cells.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">The present invention relates to immortalized mammalian cell lines, characterized in that they are derived from primary cultures of retinal cells selected from the group comprising the primary retinal endothelial cells and the primary retinal epithelial cells, in that they comprise a nucleic acid fragment containing at least one immortalizing fragment of a heat-sensitive viral oncogene, which nucleic acid fragment may be associated with at least one selection gene, and in that they stably exhibit the morphological characteristics and at least the surface antigen expression characteristics of the corresponding primary culture cells.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">Stability is understood as meaning the maintenance of the morphological and phenotypic characteristics of the immortalized lines for up to at least 30 passages and even up to more than 50 passages.</p>
    <p num="15">In one advantageous embodiment of said lines, they are derived from retinal endothelial cells and exhibit at least the morphological characteristics and antigen expression characteristics of the primary culture retinal endothelial cells, namely fusiform morphology, expression of the endothelial tissue markers such as RECA-1, constitutive expression of markers specific for the CNS endothelium, such as at least P-glycoprotein, GLUT-1 and the transferrin receptor, and absence of expression of surface antigens specific for the cerebral endothelial cells, such as the 1A8B antigen.</p>
    <p num="16">In another advantageous embodiment of said lines, they are derived from retinal pigmentary epithelial cells and exhibit the morphological characteristics and antigen expression characteristics of the primary culture retinal pigmentary epithelial cells, namely pavement morphology and expression of RET-PE2 and cytokeratins.</p>
    <p num="17">Surprisingly, such cells do not differ in their expression of the characteristics of the differentiated retinal endothelial cells or the differentiated retinal pigmentary epithelial cells.</p>
    <p num="18">Moreover:</p>
    <p num="19">
      the retinal pigmentary epithelial cells are capable, in vivo, of integrating appropriately into the cytoarchitecture of the retina of a host mammal without proliferating, and of preventing the loss of photoreceptors, especially in rats of the RCS (Royal College of Surgeons) strain, and
      <br/>
      the retinal endothelial cells are capable, in vitro, of serving as a model for the blood-retina barrier in the absence or presence of the retinal pigmentary epithelial cells.
    </p>
    <p num="20">In another advantageous embodiment of said lines, the nucleic acid fragment containing at least one immortalizing fragment of an oncogene contains a fragment of a heat-sensitive SV40 T-oncogene.</p>
    <p num="21">
      This gave:
      <br/>
      immortalized retinal endothelial cells, called IO/JG2/1, which were fusiform like the primary culture cells and expressed the above-mentioned markers specific for the CNS endothelial cells, as well as the same surface antigens and the same antigens of the major histocompatibility complex as the primary culture retinal endothelial cells, and
      <br/>
      immortalized retinal pigmentary epithelial cells, called IO/LD7/4, which were very similar to the primary culture cells; although not pigmented, these cells express the specific RET-PE2 antigen and the cytokeratins.
    </p>
    <p num="22">According to the invention, the immortalized retinal endothelial cells called IO/JG2/1 were deposited under no. I-1695 on Apr. 18th 1996 in the Collection Nationale de Cultures de Micro-organismes held by the Institut Pasteur, 28 rue de Docteur Roux, 75724 PARIS CEDEX 15.</p>
    <p num="23">According to the invention, the immortalized retinal pigmentary epithelial cells called IO/LD7/4 were deposited under no. I-1694 on Apr. 18th 1996 in the Collection Nationale de Cultures de Micro-organismes held by the Institut Pasteur.</p>
    <p num="24">The present invention further relates to cell lines derived from the immortalized lines as defined above, hereafter called vector cell lines, characterized in that they comprise at least one cell line as defined above, associated with an expression vector comprising a sequence coding for a polypeptide, a protein or a viral vector, optionally associated with at least one selection gene and optionally at least one marker gene, and in that they are capable, in vivo, of integrating into the retina and especially the subretinal space of a host mammal, preventing the loss of photoreceptors and producing said peptide, said protein or said viral vector.</p>
    <p num="25">In terms of the present invention, expression vector is understood as meaning any nucleic acid fragment integrated into the genome or present in the cytoplasm of said cell lines and capable of permitting the expression of said polypeptides, protein or viral vector.</p>
    <p num="26">All the lines according to the present invention (cell lines and vector lines) have the advantage of constituting a pure, homogeneous and sufficient source of cells of retinal origin for the purpose of reproducible application to transplantations, especially because all these lines have the phenotype of the primary culture lines.</p>
    <p num="27">As regards the vector lines more particularly, they integrate well into the retinal vascularization, are very well tolerated, release in vivo, over a long period, the active substance which they express, and can be used in the preparation of a composition for the treatment of primary or secondary ophthalmological or neurological disorders.</p>
    <p num="28">The present invention further relates to a model for studying and identifying the biochemical and cellular systems of the blood-retina barrier, characterized in that it comprises at least one cell line as defined above.</p>
    <p num="29">

    <p num="30">It must be clearly understood, however, that these Examples are given solely in order to illustrate the subject of the invention, without in any way implying a limitation.</p>
    <p num="31">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="32">Methods Used to Characterize the Immortalized Cells According to the Invention</p>
    <p num="33">a) Isolation and Culture of Rat Aortic Endothelial Cells</p>
    <p num="34">The aortic endothelium is isolated by the method described by McGUIRE P. G. et al. (Lab. Invest., 1987, 57, 94-105).</p>
    <p num="35">The rat aorta is removed by dissection and cut into small pieces (2-5 mm), which are placed on 24-well plates coated with collagen and containing an endothelial cell culture medium, in such a way that the luminal face of the pieces of aorta is in contact with the collagen.</p>
    <p num="36">The RPMI culture medium is supplemented with 20% of foetal calf serum, 7.5  MU g/ml of endothelial cell growth supplement, 80  MU g/ml of heparin, 2 mM glutamine, 0.5  MU g/ml of vitamin C, 100 U/ml of penicillin and 100  MU g/ml of streptomycin.</p>
    <p num="37">
      After 3 days, the explants are removed and the adhering cells proliferate to the point of confluence.
      <br/>
      At confluence, the cells have a pavement morphology characteristic of the endothelial vessels, express Von Willebrand's factor and proliferate in a medium containing D-valine.
    </p>
    <p num="38">The cells are used after three passages (earliest stage for experimental use).</p>
    <p num="39">b) Protocol for Carrying Out Electron Microscopy for the Morphological Study of the Different Cells Obtained</p>
    <p num="40">
      The monolayers of the immortalized cells (retinal endothelial cells and RPE cells) are cultivated in 24-well plates to the point of confluence.
      <br/>
      The cells are fixed with a mixture of 1% of paraformaldehyde and 3% of glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate HCl (pH 7.4), or 2.5% of glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffered to pH 6.9 by the addition of 0.5% (w/v) tannic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      After rinsing 3 times for 5 minutes in a sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), the cells are fixed again for 2 hours at 4 (degree)  C., in the absence of light, in 1% aqueous osmium tetroxide solution, dehydrated in the presence of different strengths of alcohol (1 * 10 min 50-90%, 4 * 10 min 100%), included in Araldite and cured at 60 (degree)  C. for 12 hours.
      <br/>
      Semi-thin (1  MU m) and ultra-thin (50 nm) sections are prepared using a Leica Ultracut S.RTM. microtome.
      <br/>
      The semi-thin sections are stained with 1% toluidine blue in 50% ethanol for microscopic observation and the ultra-thin sections are stained sequentially with 1% lead citrate in 50% ethanol and with lead citrate and are observed and photographed with a JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV.
    </p>
    <p num="42">c) Protocol for Detecting the Endothelial and Epithelial Surface Antigens by ELISA, Immunohistochemistry and Flux Cytometry</p>
    <p num="43">ELISA:</p>
    <p num="44">Rat retinal endothelial cells (primary culture and immortalized cells) are inoculated at confluence density onto 96-well plates which have first been coated with 0.05% type IV collagen.</p>
    <p num="45">
      Before the cells are plated, the collagen is fixed in ammonia vapour and the plates are washed twice with HBSS.
      <br/>
      The cells are cultivated for 3 days before experimental use.
      <br/>
      After the experimental treatments, the cells are washed 4 times in Hanks' buffered saline solution (HBSS) and fixed with 0.1% of glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 10 minutes at room temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The cells are washed with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, for 20 minutes at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The primary antibodies are diluted in 100  MU l of HBSS containing 100  MU g/ml of normal rabbit IgG and 4 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin and then incubated with the cells for 45 minutes at 37 (degree)  C. The cells are washed 4 times with PBS containing 0.2% of Tween 20 and then incubated with a biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (1:700; Amersham) for 45 minutes at 37 (degree)  C. The cells are washed again 4 times with PBS containing 0.2% of Tween 20 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase/streptavidine (1:700; Amersham) for 45 minutes at 37 (degree)  C. The cells are washed 4 times in PBS containing 0.2% of Tween 20 and incubated with 100  MU l of tetramethylbenzidine in a citrate-acetate buffer (pH 5) for 10 minutes.
      <br/>
      The reactions are stopped by the addition of 50  MU l of 1 M sulphuric acid and the reaction product is quantified (optical density at 450 nm).
    </p>
    <p num="47">* Histochemical studies:</p>
    <p num="48">The primary cultures and immortalized cells are inoculated onto slides (Gibco/BRL) and cultivated to the point of confluence.</p>
    <p num="49">The surface antigens are detected by washing the cells in HBSS and then blocking with HBSS containing 100  MU g/ml of normal rabbit IgG and 4 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin.</p>
    <p num="50">
      The primary antibodies are then added to the non-fixed cells, the cells are incubated for 1 hour on ice and washed, a second, specific biotinylated antibody is added and the cells are incubated for 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      After washing, FITC-labelled streptavidine is incubated with the cells for 15 minutes.
      <br/>
      The cells are then fixed, mounted and observed under a Zeiss Axiophot.
      <br/>
      For the intracellular antigens, the cells are fixed and rendered permeable as described for the ELISA method.
    </p>
    <p num="51">* Flux cytometry:</p>
    <p num="52">
      The flux cytometry of the confluent retinal cultures is carried out on a FACScan apparatus (Becton-Dickinson).
      <br/>
      After washing, the cellular monolayers are dissociated in HBSS containing 1 mg/ml of collagenase/dispase and 0.2% of EDTA and the cells are resuspended in PBS.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      5.104 cells/flask are incubated for 1 hour with the primary antibody on ice, this being followed by a second incubation for 1 hour with an anti-mouse IgG rabbit F(ab')2 antibody conjugated with FITC, in the presence of 20% of normal rat serum.
      <br/>
      After 2 washes, the cells are resuspended in PBS and analyzed.
      <br/>
      The non-stained cells are used for calibration and the cells stained only with the second antibody are used to establish the background.
    </p>
    <p num="54">d) Protocol for Studying the Migration of the T-lymphocytes Across the Monolayer</p>
    <p num="55">The capacity of the immortalized cells to allow the trans-endothelial migration of the T-cells specific for the antigen is determined as described in GREENWOOD J. et al. (Immunol., 1993, 80, 401-406).</p>
    <p num="56">The T-cells (2.105 cells/ml/well) are introduced into 24-well plates containing monolayers of primary cell culture or immortalized retinal endothelial cells and RPE cells.</p>
    <p num="57">
      The T-cells sediment and migrate in 4 hours.
      <br/>
      To evaluate the migration rate, the co-cultures are placed under a phase contrast microscope and maintained at 37 (degree)  C. and in an atmosphere containing 5% of CO2.
    </p>

    <p num="62">
      Endothelial cells are derived from 4- to 6-week-old female Lewis rats free of pathogens.
      <br/>
      The retinal cells are isolated and cultivated by the methods described by GREENWOOD J. (J. Neuroimmunol., 1992, 39, 123-132) and ABBOTT N. J. et al. (Cell Sci., 1992, 103, 23-37).
      <br/>
      These techniques produce primary cultures with a purity in excess of 95%.
      <br/>
      The rat retinas are dispersed by enzymatic digestion, the fragments of microvessels are separated from the cells themselves by centrifugation and the cells are washed and cultured in flasks coated with collagen.
      <br/>
      The growth medium consists of Ham's F-10 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 17.5% of serum (Advanced Protein Products Ltd), 7.5  MU g/ml of endothelial cell growth supplement (Advanced Protein Products Ltd), 80  MU g/ml of heparin, 2 mM glutamine, 0.5  MU g/ml of vitamin C, 100 U/ml of penicillin and 100  MU g/ml of streptomycin.
    </p>
    <p num="63">The cultures are maintained at 37 (degree)  C. and in an atmosphere containing 5% of CO2 ; the medium is replaced every three days to the point of confluence.</p>
    <p num="64">b) Immortalization of the Cells</p>
    <p num="65">A retroviral vector containing the SV40 T-gene, which is replication-deficient and obtained according to the technique described by P. S. JAT et al. (Mol. Cell. Biol., 1986, 1204-1217), is produced in quantity in selected fibroblast lines (SVUI9.5 line).</p>
    <p num="66">
      This retroviral vector codes in particular for a tsa58 T-antigen, which is temperature-sensitive and associated with the gene coding for neomycin as a selection marker.
      <br/>
      It is obtained from the culture supernatant of SVU19.5 cells after passage through a 0.45  MU m filter to remove the producer cells.
      <br/>
      It is added to a primary culture of endothelial cells such as those prepared in a) (transfection).
    </p>
    <p num="67">200  MU l of virus in 2 ml of a medium containing 8  MU g/ml of Polybrene (Aldrich) are added to the endothelial cells; the whole is incubated for 4 hours at 37 (degree)  C. in an incubator under a CO2 atmosphere, the flask being shaken every 15 minutes.</p>
    <p num="68">
      After incubation, the medium is removed and 5 ml of fresh medium are added; the whole is recultivated overnight.
      <br/>
      The cells are then kept in the incubator for 48 hours.
      <br/>
      They are then plated on a selective medium containing 200  MU g/ml of geneticin (G418, Gibco) and the immortalized parental lines are obtained by selection of the resistant colonies.

      A voluminous nucleus is observed together with the presence of peripheral heterochromatin and numerous cytosolic organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and polysomes.
      <br/>
      The junctions between the cells often exhibit interdigitation with regions of cytoplasmic density at the narrow points of contact.

    <p num="152">2 rats are present in each cage during the test; their activity is measured for 5 minutes.</p>
    <p num="153">In a first stage, the animal explores its environment but gets accustomed to it.</p>
    <p num="154">In a second stage, the activity of the animal increases only if the walls are changed; in fact, if the visual environment is the same, the activity is not modified.</p>
    <p num="155">The extent of the animal's activity can consequently be used as an index of its visual detection and its visual acuity.</p>
    <p num="156">Results</p>
    <p num="157">The capacity of the dystrophic rats to detect the variations in their visual environment decreases over a period of 3 months.</p>
    <p num="158">The exploratory activity of the rats grafted with IO/LD7/4 cells is high in the second part of the test, i.e. when the environment has been modified (plain walls changed to decorated walls or vice-versa) (FIG. 14).</p>
    <p num="159">c) Electrophysiological Evaluation</p>
    <p num="160">
      The head and eyes of the anaesthetized rats are immobilized by means of a stabilizing apparatus and sutures, respectively.
      <br/>
      The superior colliculus contralateral to the stimulated eye is exposed.
      <br/>
      The animals are adapted to a light level of 0.34 cd/m2 for 1 hour before recording in order to enable the cones and rods to be evaluated simultaneously.
      <br/>
      The rat is orientated to face a translucent hemisphere (radius of 55 cm) so that the tested eye is at the centre.
      <br/>
      The stimuli, comprising a fixed light 10 (degree)  in diameter and 5.8 cd/m2 in intensity, are projected onto the surface of the hemisphere.
    </p>
    <p num="161">Different receptive fields (multi-unitary or single) are recorded from the layer nearest the surface of the superior colliculus (SC) (about 200  MU m from the surface of the SC) using glass-coated carbon fibre electrodes.</p>
    <p num="162">The recordings cover the whole of the SC on the basis of a grid system with a pitch of 200  MU m (FIGS. 15 and 16).</p>
    <p num="163">Results</p>
    <p num="164">The axons of the retina project onto the SC in a precise and well-defined manner; consequently, modifications in the recordings obtained from the SC do indeed reflect the changes which have occurred in the retina (FIG. 15).</p>
    <p num="165">A small scotoma begins to develop after 6 weeks in the dystrophic rats; it occupies half the visual field after 3 months and includes the whole of the retina after 6 months.</p>
    <p num="166">The primary RPE and IO/LD7/4 grafts slow down this deterioration of the visual field.</p>
    <p num="167">The grafts of IO/LD7/4 cells appear to be the more effective.</p>
    <p num="168">d) Morphological Evaluation of the Prevention of the Loss of Photoreceptors After the Grafting of Primary RPE Cells</p>
    <p num="169">4 eyes which had received either primary RPE cells or IO/LD7/4 cells were examined.</p>
    <p num="170">Using an image analysis software in association with a microscope (DMR, Leica), the thickness of each of the cellular layers of the retina is measured on the dystrophic 6-month-old rats and the number of nuclei in the inner and outer nuclear layers is counted.</p>
    <p num="171">The proportion of retina saved is estimated.</p>
    <p num="172">Results</p>
    <p num="173">
      After 6 months, no layer of photoreceptors is observed in the dystrophic rats.
      <br/>
      A few cells exist in the inner nuclear layer and can be considered as vestiges of photoreceptors.
    </p>
    <p num="174">The grafts of immortalized cells show large regions of saved cells in 6-month-old animals.</p>
    <p num="175">The proportion of retinal zone saved by the grafts of primary RPE cells is 6% and 13.8% with an outer nuclear layer (ONL) having a thickness equal to 3 strata of nuclei, whereas the percentage of retina saved by the grafts of IO/LD7/4 cells is 27.9% and 36.3% with an ONL having a thickness equal to 5 strata of nuclei.</p>
    <p num="176">An important difference between these sections is the presence of a distinct external plexiform layer in the eyes grafted with IO/LD7/4 cells (FIG. 17).</p>
    <p num="177">3. Migration of the IO/LD7/4 cells in vivo</p>
    <p num="178">Method</p>
    <p num="179">15 dystrophic 4-week-old rats are grafted with fluorescent IO/LD7/4 cells.</p>
    <p num="180">10 of the recipient rats are grafted on both eyes; the other 5 rats are grafted on one eye only.</p>
    <p num="181">The animals (2 with a transplant on both eyes and one with a transplant on one eye only) are sacrificed 3, 7, 14, 28, 42 and 98 days after grafting by administration of a lethal dose of anaesthetic (intracardiac perfusion in the presence of PBS).</p>
    <p num="182">The animals are enucleated and the eyes are fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 6 hours.</p>
    <p num="183">The tissue is cryoprotected and included in OTC.</p>
    <p num="184">Sections are prepared (14  MU m thick) and made up into 3 series.</p>
    <p num="185">Series A is stained with cresyl violet; series B is stained with an antimicroglia antibody; the series are examined under a fluorescence microscope.</p>
    <p num="186">Results</p>
    <p num="187">The labelled cells are located in all the grafted eyes up to 14 days after the operation, but are more difficult to identify later because of elimination of the marker.</p>
    <p num="188">If the staining is clearly visible, the labelled cells occupy up to 30% of the retina.</p>
    <p num="189">Staining of the adjacent sections with cresyl violet confirms the action of the grafts on the saving of photoreceptors in all the transplants.</p>
    <p num="190">As is apparent from the foregoing description, the invention is in no way limited to those modes of execution, embodiments and modes of application which have now been described more explicitly; on the contrary, it encompasses all the variants thereof which may occur to those skilled in the art, without deviating from the framework or the scope of the present invention.</p>
