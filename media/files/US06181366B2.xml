      A video communications system 100, a video switching system 108 and method are provided for establishing video communications with a video communications device 104 utilizing the agent selection and reporting features of an automatic call distributor (ACD) 102.
      <br/>
      The ACD 102 receives an initial request from the video communications device 104 and rejects the initial request.
      <br/>
      A computer system 112 detects the initial request and acquires destination information in the initial request identifying the video communications device 104.
      <br/>
      The computer system 112 sends a simulated call to the ACD 102 requesting an agent for video communications.
      <br/>
      The ACD 102 selects an agent and notifies the computer system 112 which agent is selected.
      <br/>
      The computer system 112 then instructs an agent terminal 110 associated with the selected agent to establish video communications with the video communications device 104.
      <br/>
      The ACD 102 generates reports relating to the video communications.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention is related to a system for establishing video communications between a video communications device and a remote agent and, more particularly, to a video switching system, video communications system and method for establishing video communications between a video communications device and a remote agent wherein a telephonic switch selects which remote agent is to receive the video communications and provides reporting capabilities relating to the video communications.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Telephonic switches are increasingly being used by businesses to automatically route incoming customer calls to available agents.
      <br/>
      One common type of telephonic switch is an automatic call distributor (ACD) which generally includes a multiport switch controlled by a central processing unit to interconnect external telephonic units of an external telephonic network with internal telephonic units.
      <br/>
      An example of such an ACD is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,140,611 issued to Jones et al. on Aug. 18, 1992, entitled "Pulse Width Modulated Self-Clocking and Self-Synchronizing Data Transmission and Method for a Telephonic Communication Network Switching System", the disclosure ofwhich is hereby incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      One feature of numerous telephonic switches is the ability to intelligently select which agents receive certain incoming telephone calls.
      <br/>
      This selection process may be based on information provided by the caller, the skills of the individual agents, automatic number identification (ANI) information, dialed number identification service (DNIS) information or other information.
      <br/>
      Complex software routines stored in the telephonic switch use this information to properly route calls.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Another advantageous feature is the ability of telephonic switches to acquire, process and report information concerning different aspects of switch activity.
      <br/>
      Typically, a data display terminal generates visual representations of the information.
      <br/>
      Based on this information, management and supervisory personnel are able to evaluate the call activity within the switch and, if necessary, make changes for more efficient switch operation.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Telephonic switches further provide for predictive outdialing wherein the switch automatically calls an individual at a certain time and telephone number.
      <br/>
      When the individual answers the outdialed call, the switch connects the individual to a selected agent.
    </p>

      Video communications devices are increasingly being used to transmit video images between two locations.
      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      A video communications system 100 which employs a telephonic switch, such as an automatic call distributor (ACD) 102, to establish video communications with a video communications device 104, which is commonly known as a KIOSK, in accordance with the present invention is shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The video communications are established over a conventional network 106.
      <br/>
      The structure and philosophy of networks for transmitting video communications are well known and, as such, will not be further described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      A video switching system 108 establishes video communications between an agent terminal 110 and the video communications device 104, via the network 106.
      <br/>
      A computer system 112 receives information from the ACD 102, prompts the agent terminal 110 to establish communications with the video communications device 104 and provides information to the ACD 102 regarding the video communications.
      <br/>
      The computer system 112 includes a switch circuit 126 for communicating with the ACD 102.
      <br/>
      The communications between the ACD 102 and the computer system 112 can be performed over a dedicated T1 line 116 or any other connecting line 118.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In a typical call switching system, the ACD 102 transfers a call to an agent console 120 based on which agent is located at the agent console 120.
      <br/>
      Although the ACD 102 is typically connected to more than one agent console 120, only one agent console is shown for ease of description.
      <br/>
      Current call switching systems have further eliminated the agent console 120 having the call directly routed to the agent terminal 110 associated with an agent.
      <br/>
      Agent consoles 120 are well known and will not be further discussed.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the present invention may be advantageously employed in call switching systems both with and without agent consoles.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The ACD 102 further includes an agent selection system 122 for selecting an available agent to receive a call.
      <br/>
      Methods for selecting an agent to receive a call based on ANI information, DNIS information, agent skills and the like are well known.
      <br/>
      A reporting system 124 generates reports detailing switch operation and provides these reports to an appropriate display device, such as an electronic display or printer.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The present invention provides a system and method for establishing video communications between the agent terminal 110 and the video communications device 104 which utilizes the agent selection and reporting features of the ACD 102.
      <br/>
      In operation, an individual at the video communications device 104 typically enters a specified request to establish video communications with an agent.
      <br/>
      A banking customer, for example, may be requesting a video conference with a bank agent from an automatic teller machine (ATM).
      <br/>
      The video communications device 104 sends an initial request over the network 106 to the ACD 102 to establish the video communications.
      <br/>
      The ACD 102 detects destination information, such as ANI information, contained in the initial request identifying video communications device 104.
      <br/>
      The ACD 102, however, can only route voice communications and, therefore, rejects the initial request.
      <br/>
      In response, the video communications device 104 disconnects from the network 106.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The ACD 102 sends the destination information obtained from the initial request to the computer system 112 via the line 118.
      <br/>
      The computer system 112 then takes the T1 line 116 off hook, thus simulating an incoming call to the ACD 102.
      <br/>
      In particular, a switch circuit 126 signals to the ACD 102 that video communications are being established, requests that the ACD select one of the agents to receive the video communications and transmits a video request signal to the agent terminal 110 associated with the agent selected by the ACD 102.
      <br/>
      The switch circuit 126 may indicate to the ACD 102 that the simulated call is to be routed to an agent who can answer video calls (video agent) or the ACD 102 may be programmed to identify any simulated calls received over the dedicated T1 line 116 as video communications.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The agent selection means 122 selects an agent to handle the simulated call using predefined criteria, such as which agents handle video calls, which agents are available and the like.
      <br/>
      When the agent selection means 122 has selected an agent, the ACD 102 notifies the computer system 112 which agent was selected.
      <br/>
      The computer system 112 then generates the video request signal and transmits the video request signal to the agent terminal 110 associated with the selected agent.
      <br/>
      As should be readily understood by those skilled in the art, the video communications system 100 contains a plurality of agent terminals, each of which is associated with an agent.
      <br/>
      The computer system 112 identifies which agent is associated with which agent terminal in any of a number of well known methods.
      <br/>
      For instance, each agent may log on with an unique identification number and agent terminal identification number.
      <br/>
      The computer system 112 thereafter stores the entered identification numbers to match agents and agent terminals.
      <br/>
      Such methods are well known in the art and will not be further discussed herein.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The video request signal preferably contains the destination information received from the video communications device 104.
      <br/>
      Using the destination information, the agent terminal 110 establishes video communications with the video communications device 104 over the network 106.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the agent terminal 110 includes a video card which receives the video request signal and outdials the video communications device 104.
      <br/>
      Although video cards are well known, the video card currently contemplated for use in the present invention is manufactured by the Intel Corporation in Santa Clara, Calif.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Video communications are consequently established between the agent selected by the ACD 102 and the video communications device 104.
      <br/>
      The ACD 102 continues to monitor the simulated call received from the computer system 112.
      <br/>
      The reporting system 124 stores information relating to the video communications established by the computer system 112.
      <br/>
      Consequently, management and supervisory personnel are able to evaluate the video call activity and, if necessary, make changes for more efficient operation using the extensive reporting capabilities of the ACD 102.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      When the video communications are terminated, the computer system 112 senses a release message received from the agent terminal 110.
      <br/>
      The computer system 112 then notifies the ACD 102 that the video communication is terminated either by placing the T1 line 116 on-hook or by sending an appropriate message over the line 118.
      <br/>
      The ACD 102 then removes the call from the agent and can thereafter route another call to the agent.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In accordance with the present invention, a method for establishing video communications with a video communications device 104 is provided.
      <br/>
      The method comprises the steps of receiving at a telephonic switch 102 an initial request that the video communications device 104 wishes to establish video communications; detecting when the telephonic switch 102 receives the initial request; and establishing video communications with the video communications device 104 based on the initial request.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the initial request is rejected by the telephonic switch 102.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The initial request preferably includes destination information such as automatic number identification (ANI) information, which uniquely identifies the video communications device 104.
      <br/>
      The method preferably includes the steps of: prompting the telephonic switch 102 to select one of a plurality of agents to receive the video communications and establishing video communications between the video communications device 104 and the selected one of the agents.
    </p>
