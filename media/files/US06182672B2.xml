      A looped fastener having a fabric covered elasticized member having a thin, substantially rectangular cross-sectional configuration having terminal ends formed in a loop by passing the elasticized member through a hollow open ended decorative body.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">This invention relates to an improved fastener for various purposes and particularly to fasteners for hair ties.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Presently, there are many different methods of securing hair.
      <br/>
      Ribbons, bands, strings, barrettes, fabric rings, wraps, clips, combs, hair pins, ropes and clasps are commonly used to assist in achieving certain hair styles.
      <br/>
      Prior art discloses hair ties which are either secured by wrapping string or the like around a closed loop or by using a locking device to close a loop.
      <br/>
      The prior art which uses a locking device is limited in its fabrication because it must be made of thin rope-like material in order to be able to pass through the locking device.
      <br/>
      These methods of hair styling assistance are satisfactory in their function.
      <br/>
      However, because of the modes applied in accomplishing a secure closed loop, these methods are limited in their design capabilities.
      <br/>
      The average person knows that the reason hair styles exist is because they are an expression of design.
    </p>
    <p num="6">The present invention accomplishes the desired effect of securing hair by utilizing an adjustable loop while also allowing the user the opportunity of expression of design which is more applicable to today's styles than the aforementioned prior art.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention is directed to an improved hair tie fastener which performs the function of securing varying amounts of hair while also offering diversity of design expression.
      <br/>
      It is an object of this present invention to hold varying amounts of hair in the location desired by the wearer.
      <br/>
      It is an object of this present invention to hold hair in place during exercise and other physical activities performed by the wearer.
      <br/>
      It is an object of this present invention to enable the wearer to choose between several fashionable designs in achieving a style best suited for the wearer.
      <br/>
      A looped fastener hair tie having features of the present invention comprises a predetermined length of a long narrow elasticized memberhaving a thin, substantially rectangular cross-sectional configuration,covered with fabric, which is passed through one or more decorative stop bodies having open ends forming a loop generally in the middle of the elasticized member.
      <br/>
      The fabric when fully extended is longer than the elasticized member in its unstretched condition, so that the fabric becomes gathered into a plurality of folds.
      <br/>
      The size of the loop of the present invention is regulated by moving the decorative stop bodies in one direction or another.
      <br/>
      Once the preferred loop size is accomplished the folds of fabric covering the elasticized member work in conjunction with the stop bodies in securing the hair by bunching at the open end of the stop bodies.
      <br/>
      The fabric covered elasticized member of the present invention comprises terminal ends which may be tied or decorated with additional stop bodies for the purpose of keeping the primary stop bodies intact.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="9">
      FIG. 1 illustrates a looped hair fastener 10 having a predetermined length of a long narrow elasticized member 20, having a thin, substantially rectangular cross-sectional configuration, similar in shape to a ribbon or material strip covered with fabric 30, passing through one or more stop bodies 40, forming a loop 18 generally in the middle of the cord 20, the elasticized member having terminal ends which may be tied or fitted with additional stop bodies 50.
      <br/>
      The elasticized member 20 is covered with fabric 30 which may be made from an assortment of cloth materials decorated in a variety of patterns and designs.
      <br/>
      The fabric 30 exceeds the length of the elasticized member 20 and is closed around the terminal ends of the elasticized member 20.
      <br/>
      The elasticized member 20 and the cover of fabric 30 are joined at the terminal ends.
      <br/>
      The loop 18 is formed and regulated by sliding one or more stop bodies 40 over the fabric 30 covering the elasticized member 20.
      <br/>
      Because the cover of fabric 30 exceeds the length of the elasticized member 20 the fabric 30 gathers in bunches along the looped hair fastener 10.
      <br/>
      In actual use, the bunching of fabric 30 around the open ends of the primary stop bodies 40 enables the user to more tightly fasten the looped hair tie fastener about the object to be fastened.
      <br/>
      In cases where a plurality of primary stop bodies 40 are present additional loops may be formed.
      <br/>
      The terminal ends of the looped hair tie fastener 10 may be tied or fitted with secondary stop bodies 50.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The primary stop bodies 40 and the secondary stop bodies 50 are generally spherically shaped, although a multitude of body shapes, such as cylindrical, rectangular, square, octagonal, or similar shapes could be used such as the shapes used in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The primary stop bodies 40 and the secondary stop bodies 50 could also be formed in the shape of characters, living things, icons, and the like.
      <br/>
      The primary stop bodies 40 and the secondary stop bodies 50 are constructed of plastic, wood, stone, gems, glass, and other suitable materials.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      FIG. 2 illustrates the looped hair tie fastener utilizing a single primary stop body 40.
      <br/>
      In actual use conditions, the loop 18 of the looped hair tie fastener 10 is expanded to its maximum size or at least a size larger than the object to be fastened by moving the primary stop body 40 down toward the secondary stop bodies 50.
      <br/>
      Once the object to be fastened is positioned within the loop 18, the user can hold onto the primary stop body 40 and pull one or both of the secondary stop bodies 50 therefore tightening the loop around the object to be fastened.
      <br/>
      The same tightening effect may be accomplished by holding onto one or more of the secondary stop bodies 50 and sliding the primary stop body 40 toward the object to be fastened.
