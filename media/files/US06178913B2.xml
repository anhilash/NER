    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The invention disclosed and claimed herein also relates to a collapsible boat structure; however, the invention is characterized by its relative simplicity and ease of use.
      <br/>
      The structural components of the boat of this invention cooperate in a unique manner not suggested by the prior art to attain the desired result of quickly and reliably converting a boat between a non-collapsed condition in which the boat is suitable for normal boat usage on the water and a collapsed condition enabling the width of the boat to be reduced for the boat to be readily trailed after a vehicle or stored.
      <br/>
      The conversion takes place with virtually no manual effort on the part of the boat user.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The collapsible boat includes a boat deck comprising a plurality of boat deck panels including first and second center deck panels disposed side-by-side and first and second outer deck panels.
      <br/>
      The first outer deck panel is disposed alongside the first center deck panel and the first center deck panel is positioned between the second center deck panel and the first outer deck panel.
      <br/>
      The second outer deck panel is disposed alongside the second center deck panel and the second center deck panel is positioned between the first center deck panel and the second outer deck panel.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Panel mover means is provided for selectively moving the first and second outer deck panels either toward or away from one another.
      <br/>
      The first and second center deck panels move from a substantially horizontal orientation to a substantially vertical orientation when the first and second outer deck panels move toward one another to reduce the width of the boat deck.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The collapsible boat of this invention additionally includes guide means for guiding movement of the first and second outer deck panels.
      <br/>
      The panel mover means is operatively associated with the first and second outer deck panels to move the first and second outer deck panels along the guide means.
      <br/>
      The first and second center deck panels move responsive to movement of the first and second outer deck panels along the guide means.

    <heading>MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      Referring now to FIGS. 1-15, a collapsible boat constructed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention is illustrated.
      <br/>
      The boat includes a boat deck 10 including center deck panels 12, 14 disposed side-by-side and outer deck panels 16, 18.
      <br/>
      Outer deck panel 16 is disposed alongside center deck panel 12, the deck panel 12 being positioned between center deck panel 14 and outer deck panel 16.
      <br/>
      Outer deck panel 18 is disposed alongside the center deck panel 14 and the center deck panel 14 is positioned between the center deck panel 12 and the outer deck panel 18.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      When the boat is in non-collapsed condition for use as a boat, the panels 12, 14, 16 and 18 are all oriented horizontally.
      <br/>
      This can be seen in FIG. 1, for example.
      <br/>
      When, however, the boat is to be collapsed for storage or transport, for example on a trailer, the center deck panels are moved from a horizontal orientation to a vertical orientation as shown in FIG. 2, for example.
      <br/>
      Pontoons 20 are connected to the outer deck panels 16, 18.
      <br/>
      The outer deck panels move toward one another when the center deck panels are moved to a vertical orientation and the pontoons 20 move along with the outer deck panels.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The deck panels each have two components--a rigid supporting framework and the panel per se, which may be formed of any suitable material such as plywood and is supported by and disposed above the supporting framework.
      <br/>
      So that details of the operation of the collapsible boat can readily be seen, only the supporting framework is shown in certain figures, namely, FIGS. 3-7. The supporting framework for the center deck panels is identified by reference numeral 24 and the supporting framework for the outer deck panels is identified by reference numeral 26.
      <br/>
      Each supporting framework is of unitary, rigid construction, being comprised of steel, aluminum or any other suitable material.
      <br/>
      The panels of the center deck panels supported by framework 24 are identified by reference numeral 28.
      <br/>
      The panels of the outer deck panels supported by framework 26 are identified by reference numeral 30.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Parallel beams 36 extend between the outer deck panels 16, 18.
      <br/>
      The ends of the beams are located in brackets 38 affixed to the supporting frameworks 26 of the outer deck panels.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Rollers 40 (see FIG. 6) are located at the tops and bottoms of the brackets 38 so that the beams 36 freely ride or float relative to the brackets.
      <br/>
      The beams 36 cooperating with brackets 38 comprise guide means guiding movement of the outer deck panels.
      <br/>
      Stops 42 at the beam ends are engageable with brackets 38 to prevent the beams from exiting the brackets.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      An electrically operated jack is employed to move the outer deck panels toward and away from one another.
      <br/>
      The electric jack includes a housing 42 secured to framework 26 of outer deck panel 18 and an elongated threaded screw member 44 which can be extended or retracted by the motor (not shown) within housing 42.
      <br/>
      At its distal end screw member 44 is attached to a pivoted arm 46 depending from supporting framework 26 of outer deck panel 16.
      <br/>
      This may best be seen with reference to FIGS. 12-15. The upper end of arm 46 is pivotally connected to the outer deck panel 16 at an elongated rod 48 (see FIGS. 4 and 5).
      <br/>
      Rod 48 extends a significant portion of the length of outer deck panel 16 and is connected to arms 46 located at the ends of the rod 48.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 5 shows the supporting frameworks of all of the panels in their non-collapsed positions.
      <br/>
      By actuating the motor of the jack within housing 42 to retract the screw member 44 the outer deck panels 16, 18 will be pulled toward one another, the outer deck panels sliding relative to the beams 36.
      <br/>
      The pulling force will be exerted on the supporting framework 26 of outer deck panel 16 at three locations, i.e. the locations of arms 46.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      It will be appreciated that, unless displaced, the center deck panels will prevent movement of the outer deck panels toward one another.
      <br/>
      The boat includes structure which will automatically cause the center deck panels to move to a vertical orientation upon movement of the outer deck panels toward one another.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Arms 46 are each connected to a mechanical linkage 52 including a link arm 54 pivotally connected at its end to supporting framework 24 of center deck panel 12.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 12 through 15 illustrate how the mechanical linkage cooperates responsive to sliding of outer deck panels 16, 18 toward one another to raise the center deck panels from a horizontal position to a vertical position.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Hinges 60 interconnect the center deck panels to their respective outer deck panels.
      <br/>
      The hinges 60 may be formed of any suitable material such as plastic.
      <br/>
      The hinges 60 are located at the top surface of the panels as shown in FIG. 11, for example.
      <br/>
      As may perhaps best be seen with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10, the center deck panels are also pivotally connected by means of hinges, in particular, hinges 62.
      <br/>
      Opposed pivoted ends of each hinge 62 define slots 64.
      <br/>
      Bolts or other mechanical fasteners 66 pass through the slots 64 and secure the hinges 62 to the supporting framework 24 in a fashion which will allow the hinge to move or slide relative to the supporting framework and the bolts 66 as indicated by the double-headed arrows in FIG. 10.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The center deck panels 12, 14 have side walls 68 which are spaced from one another and define a gap therebetween.
      <br/>
      Each hinge 62 bridges the gap at the bottoms of the center deck panels.
      <br/>
      Abutment members 70 extending from the center deck panels are in contact when the center deck panels are horizontal (as shown in FIG. 9) to maintain the panels in position relative to one another to form the gap.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The gap between the center deck panels and the floating hinge construction are quite important since they permit the outer deck panels to move toward one another without the center deck panels binding together to jam up or interfere with the operation.
      <br/>
      It is appreciated that if the side walls 68 were in abutting engagement when the process started the center deck panels would not have sufficient clearance to pivot relative to one another as shown in FIG. 13 during the initial stage of the operation which brings the center deck panels to a vertical orientation.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Reversal of the electric jack will result in the screw member 44 causing the deck panels to return to the original condition shown in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="22">
      The beam 36 at the stern of the boat may be used to support a motor 72.
      <br/>
      To prevent torquing of the beam 36 by the motor a V-shaped beam structure 74 is affixed to rearmost beam 36 and extends forwardly into a bracket 76 welded or otherwise secured to the adjacent beam 36 of the boat.
      <br/>
      The distal end of structure 74 is not attached to the bracket 76 but the bracket arms will restrict up and down movement thereof relative to the beam structure.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Referring now to FIGS. 16 through 21, a shelter 80 is shown positioned on the boat.
      <br/>
      The shelter 80 has two sides 82, 84 which are supported respectively by outer deck panels 16, 18.
      <br/>
      The shelter does not rest on center deck panels 12, 14.
      <br/>
      Shelter 80 also includes a roof 86 including a roof segment 88 movable with outer deck panel 16 and a roof segment 90 movable with outer deck panel 18.
      <br/>
      The roof segment 90 is pivotally connected to pivot arms 92 which in turn are pivotally connected to shelter side 84 of the shelter.
      <br/>
      When the outer deck panels 16, 18 of the boat move together to the position shown in FIG. 21, the angled inner end of roof segment 90 will engage a roller 94 on roof segment 88.
      <br/>
      The segment 90 will rise as shown in FIGS. 18 and 19 to allow the roof segment 88 to move under roof segment 90, thus reducing the width of the shelter.
      <br/>
      FIG. 21 shows the boat and roof in collapsed condition.
