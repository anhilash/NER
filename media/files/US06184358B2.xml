      The present invention relates to proteins or polypeptides, referred to herein as isolated and/or recombinant mammalian (e.g., human) IP-10/Mig receptor proteins designated CXC Chemokine Receptor 3 (CXCR3) and variants thereof, including those characterized by selective binding of one or more chemokines (e.g., IP-10 and/or Mig), and/or the ability to induce a cellular response (e.g., chemotaxis, exocytosis).
      <br/>
      Antibodies reactive with CXCR3 receptors can be produced using the proteins or variants thereof or host cells comprising same as immunogen.Another aspect of the invention relates to isolated and/or recombinant nucleic acids encoding a mammalian (e.g., human) CXCR3 protein and variants thereof, including antisense nucleic acid, recombinant nucleic acid constructs, such as plasmids or retroviral vectors, comprising a nucleic acid which encodes a protein of the present invention or variant thereof, and to host cells comprising a nucleic acid or construct, useful in the production of recombinant proteins.
      <br/>
      Also encompassed are methods of identifying ligands, and inhibitors (e.g., antagonists) or promoters (e.g., agonists) of receptor function, including methods in which host cells comprising a nucleic acid encoding a CXCR3 or variant thereof are used in an assay to identify and assess the efficacy of ligands, inhibitors or promoters.
      <br/>
      Inhibitors and promoters of receptor function can be used to modulate receptor activity, permitting selective inhibition of lymphocyte function, particularly of effector cells such as activated T lymphocytes and NK cells for therapeutic purposes.

    <heading>RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
    <p num="1">This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 08/709,838, filed Sep. 10, 1996, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Chemokines constitute a family of small cytokines that are produced in inflammation and regulate leukocyte recruitment (Baggiolini, M. et al., Adv. Immunol. 55: 97-179 (1994); Springer, T. A., Annu. Rev. Physiol. 57: 827-872 (1995); and Schall, T. J. and K. B. Bacon, Curr.
      <br/>
      Opin. Immunol. 6: 865-873 (1994)).
      <br/>
      Chemokines are capable of selectively inducing chemotaxis of the formed elements of the blood (other than red blood cells), including leukocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes, such as T cells and B cells.
      <br/>
      In addition to stimulating chemotaxis, other changes can be selectively induced by chemokines in responsive cells, including changes in cell shape, transient rises in the concentration of intracellular free calcium ions (�Ca2+ �i), granule exocytosis, integrin upregulation, formation of bioactive lipids (e.g., leukotrienes) and respiratory burst, associated with leukocyte activation.
      <br/>
      Thus, the chemokines are early triggers of the inflammatory response, causing inflammatory mediator release, chemotaxis and extravasation to sites of infection or inflammation.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Two subfamilies of chemokines, designated as CXC and CC chemokines, are distinguished by the arrangement of the first two of four conserved cysteine residues, which are either separated by one amino acid (as in CXC chemokines IL-8,  GAMMA IP-10, Mig, PF4, ENA-78, GCP-2, GRO ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA , NAP-2, NAP-4) or are adjacent residues (as in CC chemokines MIP-1 ALPHA , MIP-1 BETA , RANTES, MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, I-309).
      <br/>
      Most CXC chemokines attract neutrophil leukocytes.
      <br/>
      For example, the CXC chemokines interleukin 8 (IL-8), platelet factor 4 (PF4), and neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2) are potent chemoattractants and activators of neutrophils.
      <br/>
      The CXC chemokines designated Mig (monokine induced by gamma interferon) and IP-10 ( GAMMA IP-10, interferon-gamma inducible 10 kDa protein) are particularly active in inducing chemotaxis of activated peripheral blood lymphocytes.
      <br/>
      CC chemokines are generally less selective and can attract a variety of leukocyte cell types, including monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, T lymphocytes and natural killer cells.
      <br/>
      CC chemokines such as human monocyte chemotactic proteins 1-3 (MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3), RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted), and the macrophage inflammatory proteins 1 ALPHA  and 1 BETA  (MIP-1 ALPHA  and MIP-1 BETA ) have been characterized as chemoattractants and activators of monocytes or lymphocytes, but do not appear to be chemoattractants for neutrophils.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      CC and CXC chemokines act through receptors which belong to a superfamily of seven transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled receptors (Murphy, P. M., Annu. Rev. Immunol., 12: 593-633 (1994); Gerard, C. and N. P. Gerard, Curr.
      <br/>
      Opin. Immunol., 6: 140-145 (1994)).
      <br/>
      This family of G-protein coupled (serpentine) receptors comprises a large group of integral membrane proteins, containing seven transmembrane-spanning regions.
      <br/>
      The receptors are coupled to G proteins, which are heterotrimeric regulatory proteins capable of binding GTP and mediating signal transduction from coupled receptors, for example, by the production of intracellular mediators.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The chemokine receptors can be divided into two groups: CC chemokine receptors 1 through 5 (CCR1-5), which bind CC chemokines, and CXC chemokine receptors 1 through 4 (CXCR1-4), which bind CXC chemokines.
      <br/>
      In general, the CC chemokine receptors occur on several types of leukocytes, and are important for the migration of monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and T cells (Qin, S., et al., Eur. J. Immunol., 26:640-647 (1996); Carr, M. W., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91(9):3652-3656 (1994); Taub, D. D., et al., J. Clin.

      <br/>
      In contrast, the two IL-8 receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, are largely restricted to neutrophils and are important for the migration of neutrophils (Baggiolini, M., et al., Adv. Immunol., 55:97-179 (1994)).
      <br/>
      The IL-8 receptors, CXCR1 (IL-8R1, interleukin-8 receptor type 1; Holmes, W. E. et al., Science, 253: 1278-1280 (1991)) and CXCR2 (IL-8R2, interleukin-8 receptor type 2; Murphy, P. M. and H. L. Tiffany, Science, 253: 1280-1283 (1991)) recognize the NH2-terminal Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) motif, an essential binding epitope observed in CXC chemokines that induce neutrophil chemotaxis (Clark-Lewis, I. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266: 23128-23134 (1991); Hebert, C. A. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266: 18989-18994 (1991); and Clark-Lewis, I. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90: 3574-3577 (1993)).

    <p num="6">
      In contrast to monocytes and granulocytes, lymphocyte responses to chemokines are not well understood.
      <br/>
      Notably, none of the receptors of known specificity appear to be restricted to lymphocytes and the chemokines that recognize these receptors cannot, therefore, account for events such as the selective recruitment of T lymphocytes that is observed in T cell-mediated inflammatory conditions.
      <br/>
      Moreover, although a number of proteins with significant sequence similarity and similar tissue and leukocyte subpopulation distribution to known chemokine receptors have been identified and cloned, the ligands for these receptors remain undefined.
      <br/>
      Thus, these proteins are referred to as orphan receptors.
      <br/>
      The characterization of the ligand(s) of a receptor, is essential to an understanding of the interaction of chemokines with their target cells, the events stimulated by this interaction, including chemotaxis and cellular activation of leukocytes, and the development of therapies based upon modulation of receptor function.

FIG. 3A is a graph illustrating the concentration dependent �Ca2+ �i changes in IP-10/MigR-transfected 300-19 cells. IP-10 or Mig were each added at 1, 10, and 100 nM to Fura-2/AM loaded cells (arrowhead), and �Ca2+ �i -dependent fluorescence changes were recorded. Non-transfected cells (lower tracings) were stimulated with IP-10 or Mig at 100 nM under identical conditions.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3B is a graph illustrating the results of studies assessing receptor desensitization and cross-desensitization, in which IP-10/MigR expressing 300-19 cells were sequentially stimulated with 100 nM IP-10 or Mig, and with IP-10 followed by Mig or vice versa, and fluorescence changes were recorded.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3C is a graph illustrating the chemotaxis of IP-10/MigR expressing Jurkat cells stimulated with IP-10 (filled circles) or Mig (filled squares). The lower panel shows the response of non-transfected Jurkat cells when stimulated with increasing amounts of IP-10 (open circles) or Mig (open squares). Mean numbers ( +- SD) of migrating cells per five high power fields are presented.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 4A-4B are graphs illustrating the responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to IP-10 and Mig. Freshly isolated PBL from donor blood buffy coats were used as such (lower tracings and open symbols), or were used after culturing for 10 days in the presence of IL-2 (400 U/ml) (upper tracings and closed symbols). FIG. 4A is a graph illustrating �Ca2+ �i changes induced by IP-10 or Mig. IP-10 or Mig were each added at 1, 10, and 100 nM to Fura-2/AM loaded cultured cells (arrowhead), and �Ca2+ �i -dependent fluorescence changes were recorded (upper tracings). Freshly isolated cells (lower tracings) were stimulated with IP-10 or Mig at 100 nM under the same conditions. FIG. 4B is a graph illustrating chemotaxis of PBL in response to increasing concentrations of IP-10 (filled circles) or Mig (filled squares) (mean numbers ( +- SD) of migrating cells per five high power fields are presented).
      <br/>
      FIGS. 5A-5B are graphs illustrating the binding of radiolabeled IP-10 to either L1.2 cells transfected with CXCR3 DNA (FIG. 5A) and to activated T cells (FIG. 5B). Cells were incubated with 0.05 nM 125 I-labeled IP-10 in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled IP-10. Scatchard analysis (inset) indicated 37,000 receptors per cell (Kd of 614 pM) for CXCR3 L1.2 transfectants, and 17,000 receptors per cell (Kd of 156 pM) for CD3 blasts.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 is an illustration of the specificity of anti-CXCR3 antibody 1C6 as assessed by staining of stable L1.2 transfectants expressing either CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3 or CXCR4 by anti-CXCR3 peptide mAb 1C6. Negative control staining for all the L1.2 transfectants (not shown) resembled the staining shown for 1C6 on untransfected L1.2 cells (L1.2 wt).
      <br/>
      FIGS. 7A-7C are fluorescence histograms illustrating the expression of CXCR3 on neutrophils (FIG. 7A), lymphocytes (FIG. 7B), and activated T cells (FIG. 7C). Leukocyte subsets were identified in whole blood by their forward angle and side scatter, and were gated accordingly. To generate CD3 blasts, PBMC were activated with anti-CD3 mAb for 3 days, and were then maintained in media containing IL-2 for 7 days. In each plot, the blackened profile represents staining with anti-CXCR3 mAb 1C6, and the unfilled profile represent staining with an isotype-matched control mAb.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 8A-8C are plots illustrating CXCR3 expression on populations of blood lymphocytes. A two color staining protocol was used to assess expression of CXCR3 on T cells (CD3), B cells (CD20), and NK cells (CD56).
      <br/>
      FIGS. 9A-9I are plots illustrating CXCR3 expression versus various markers on the CD3+ subset of blood lymphocytes, as analyzed by three color analysis of immunofluorescence. Anti-CD3 Cy-Chrome was used to stain T cells, and these cells were gated electronically for analysis. Quadrants were set according to the staining of control mAbs. The staining shown was representative of five donors analyzed.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 is a histogram illustrating inhibition of IP-10- or MCP-1-mediated chemotaxis of activated T cells by a panel of anti-CXCR3 mAbs. 1 * 106 human CD3 blasts were placed in the top chamber of a transwell and chemokine (12.5 nM) was placed in the bottom chamber. Various anti-CXCR3 mAbs (in tissue culture supernatant, without FCS) were placed in the top well with cells at the beginning of the assay. After 1.5 hours the cells migrating to the bottom chamber were counted using flow cytometry. The percentage inhibition of chemotaxis was calculated using the number of cells that migrated in the absence of mAb as 100%. The results are representative of at least four separate experiments.
      <br/>
      FIG. 11 is a graph illustrating the inhibition of IP-10 mediated chemotaxis by purified anti-CXCR3 mAb 1C6. Various concentrations of 1C6 mAb were placed in the top well, and the assay was performed as described for FIG. 10. mAb 1C6 inhibited 50% total chemotaxis at a concentration of 856 ng/ml (IC50 =856 ng/ml).
      <br/>
      FIG. 12 is a graph illustrating the inhibition of 125 I-IP-10 binding to activated T cells by mAb 1C6. CD3 blasts were incubated with 0.05 nM 125 I-IP-10 in the presence of increasing concentrations of 1C6 as indicated. After 60 minutes at room temperature, cell pellets were washed and counted. Data was analyzed by KaleidaGraph, which gave an IC50 of 0.16  MU g/ml.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 13A-13H illustrate the inhibition by mAb 1C6 of �Ca2+ �i by human T cells in response to IP-10, but not Mig. Anti-CD3 activated, IL-2-stimulated human T cells were labeled with Fura-2, and were stimulated sequentially with the indicated chemokines (FIGS. 13A-13B), or with mAb followed 40 seconds later by the indicated chemokine (FIGS. 13C-13H). �Ca2+ �i fluorescence changes were recorded using a spectrofluorimeter. The tracings were representative of five separate experiments. Antibody was used at a final concentration of either 50  MU g/ml (FIGS. 13C-13D); 25  MU g/ml (FIG. 13E); 12.5  MU g/ml (FIG. 13F); 6.125  MU g/ml (FIG. 13G); or 3.0625  MU g/ml (FIG. 13H). Chemokines were used at 2 nM.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 14A-14D are fluorescence histograms illustrating the results of a flow cytometry analysis in which CXCR3-expressing transfectants were stained with mAb 1C6 in the presence of P1 peptide (FIG. 14B), P2 peptide (FIG. 14C), P3 peptide (FIG. 14D), or in the absence of peptide (FIG. 14A). In each plot, the profile defined by the heavy line represents mAb 1C6 staining, and the profile defined by the dotted line represents staining with an isotype-matched irrelevant control mAb.
      <br/>
      FIG. 15 is a histogram illustrating the percent inhibition of binding of radiolabeled IP-10 to CXCR3 transfectants by 40 nM cold IP-10, mAb 1C6, monoclonal antibodies raised against CXCR3 transfectants (2F8, 3A12, 3E2, 4B4, 4D2, 5B12, 7B8, or 8D5), or by anti-CXCR2 mAb.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      As described herein, a nucleic acid encoding a novel chemokine receptor that is selective for the CXC chemokines IP-10 and Mig was cloned and characterized.
      <br/>
      The clone, which was isolated from a human CD4+ T cell library, was not detected in monocyte- or granulocyte-derived cDNA libraries.
      <br/>
      Sequence analysis of the clone revealed an open reading frame of 1104 base pairs (FIG. 1, SEQ ID NO:1), encoding a predicted protein of 368 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 40,659 daltons (FIG. 2, SEQ ID NO:2).
      <br/>
      The amino acid sequence includes seven putative transmembrane segments which are characteristic of G-protein coupled receptors and are found in other chemoattractant receptors.
      <br/>
      Consistent with this observation, the receptor mediates Ca2+ (calcium ion) mobilization and chemotaxis in response to IP-10 and Mig (Example 2).
      <br/>
      No significant response to the CXC chemokines IL-8, GRO ALPHA , NAP-2 (neutrophil-activating protein-2), GCP-2 (granulocyte chemotactic protein-2), ENA78 (epithelial-derived neutrophil-activating peptide 78), PF4 (platelet factor 4), or the CC chemokines MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1), MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MIP-1 ALPHA  (macrophage inflammatory protein-1 ALPHA ), MIP-1 BETA , RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), I309, eotaxin or lymphotactin was detected under similar conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The restricted expression of human CXCR3 in activated T lymphocytes and the ligand selectivity of the receptor for IP-10 and Mig are noteworthy.
      <br/>
      The human receptor is highly expressed in IL-2 activated T lymphocytes, but was not detected in resting T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes or granulocytes under the conditions used in Example 2.
      <br/>
      Additional studies of receptor distribution indicate that it is mostly CD3+ cells that express CXCR3, including cells which are CD95+, CD45RO+, and CD45RAlow, a phenotype consistent with previous activation, although a proportion of CD20+ (B) cells and CD56+ (NK) cells also express this receptor.
      <br/>
      The selective expression in activated T lymphocytes is of interest, because other receptors for chemokines which have been reported to attract lymphocytes (e.g., MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MIP-1 ALPHA , MIP-1 BETA  and RANTES) are also found in granulocytes, such as neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils, as well as monocytes.
      <br/>
      These results suggest that the IP-10/Mig receptor designated CXCR3 is involved in the selective recruitment of effector T cells.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The receptor recognizes two unusual CXC chemokines, designated IP-10 and Mig.
      <br/>
      Although IP-10 and Mig both belong to the CXC subfamily, in contrast to IL-8 and other CXC chemokines which are potent chemoattractants for neutrophils, the primary targets of IP-10 and Mig are lymphocytes, particularly effector cells such as activated or stimulated T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells (Taub, D. D. et al., J. Exp. Med., 177: 18090-1814 (1993); Taub, D. D. et al., J. Immunol., 155: 3877-3888 (1995)). (NK cells are large granular lymphocytes, which lack a specific T cell receptor for antigen recognition, but possess cytolytic activity against cells such as tumor cells and virally infected cells.) Consistently, IP-10 and Mig lack the ELR motif, an essential binding epitope in those CXC chemokines that efficiently induce neutrophil chemotaxis (Clark-Lewis, I. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266: 23128-23134 (1991); Hebert, C. A. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266: 18989-18994 (1991); and Clark-Lewis, I. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90: 3574-3577 (1993)).
      <br/>
      In addition, both recombinant human Mig and recombinant human IP-10 have been reported to induce calcium flux in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) (Liao, F. et al., J. Exp. Med., 182: 1301-1314 (1995)).
      <br/>
      While IP-10 has been reported to induce chemotaxis of monocytes in vitro (Taub, D. D. et al., J. Exp. Med., 177: 1809-1814 (1993), the receptor responsible has not been identified), human Mig appears highly selective, and does not show such an effect (Liao, F. et al., J. Exp. Med., 182: 1301-1314 (1995)).
      <br/>
      IP-10 expression is induced in a variety of tissues in inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis, fixed DRUG eruptions, cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity responses, tuberculoid leprosy, and in experimental glomerulonephritis, and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.
      <br/>
      IP-10 also has a potent in vivo antitumor effect that is T cell dependent, is reported to be an inhibitor of angiogenesis in vivo, and can induce chemotaxis and degranulation of NK cells in vitro, suggesting a role as a mediator of NK cell recruitment and degranulation (in tumor cell destruction, for example) (Luster, A. D. and P. Leder, J. Exp. Med., 178: 1057-1065 (1993); Luster, A. D. et al., J. Exp. Med. 182: 219-231 (1995); Angiolillo, A. L. et al., J. Exp. Med., 182: 155-162 (1995); Taub, D. D. et al., J. Immunol., 155: 3877-3888 (1995)).
      <br/>
      The expression patterns of IP-10 and Mig are also distinct in that expression of each is induced by interferon-gamma (IFN GAMMA ), while the expression of IL-8 is down-regulated by IFN GAMMA  (Luster, A. D. et al., Nature, 315: 672-676 (1985); Farber, J. M., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87: 5238-5242 (1990); Farber, J. M., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 192 (1): 223-230 (1993), Liao, F. et al., J. Exp. Med., 182: 1301-1314 (1995); Seitz, M. et al., J. Clin. Invest., 87: 463-469 (1991); Galy, A. H. M. and H. Spits, J. Immunol., 147: 3823-3830 (1991)).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Chemokines have been recently recognized as the long-sought mediators for the recruitment of lymphocytes.
      <br/>
      Several CC chemokines were found to elicit lymphocyte chemotaxis (Loetscher, P. et al., FASEB J., 8: 1055-1060 (1994)), but they are also active on granulocytes and monocytes (Uguccioni, M. et al., Eur. J. Immunol., 25: 64-68 (1995); Baggiolini, M. and C. A. Dahinden, Immunol.
      <br/>
      Today, 15: 127-133 (1994)).
      <br/>
      The situation is different for IP-10 and Mig, which are selective in their action on lymphocytes, including activated T lymphocytes and NK cells, and which bind CXCR3, a receptor which does not recognize numerous other chemokines and which displays a selective pattern of expression (Example 2, Example 5).
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In view of these observations, it is reasonable to conclude that the formation of the characteristic infiltrates in inflammatory lesions, such as delayed-type hypersensitivity lesions, sites of viral infection, and certain tumors is a process mediated by via CXCR3 and regulated by CXCR3 expression.
      <br/>
      Lymphocytes, particularly T lymphocytes, bearing a CXCR3 receptor as a result of activation can be recruited into inflammatory lesions, sites of infection, or tumors by IP-10 and/or Mig, which can be induced locally by interferon-gamma.
      <br/>
      Thus, CXCR3 plays a role in the selective recruitment of lymphocytes, particularly effector cells such as activated or stimulated T lymphocytes.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Proteins and Peptides</p>
    <p num="19">
      The present invention relates to isolated and/or recombinant (including, e.g., essentially pure) proteins or polypeptides designated mammalian CXCR3 proteins and variants thereof.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the isolated and/or recombinant proteins of the present invention have at least one property, activity or function characteristic of a mammalian CXCR3 protein (as defined herein), such as a banding activity (e.g., ligand, inhibitor and/or promoter binding), a signalling activity (e.g., activation of a mammalian G protein, induction of rapid and transient increase in the concentration of cytosolic free calcium �Ca2+ �i), cellular response function (e.g., stimulation of chemotaxis, exocytosis or inflammatory mediator release by leukocytes), and/or an immunological property as defined herein.
      <br/>
      For example, some proteins of the present invention can selectively bind to IP-10 and/or Mig, mediate cellular signalling and/or a response thereto in vitro and/or in vivo (e.g., calcium flux, chemotaxis and/or degranulation especially of activated T lymphocytes).
      <br/>
      For example, as shown herein, a human CXCR3 protein, produced in mammalian cells by expression of a cDNA clone, can selectively bind to CXC chemokines IP-10 and/or Mig, and mediate signalling, and a cellular response (e.g., chemotaxis).
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, proteins of the present invention can bind a CXC chemokine from the same or a different mammalian species (e.g., human IP-10, murine IP-10, human Mig, murine Mig) (human IP-10, Luster, A. D. et al., Nature, 315: 672-676 (1985); murine IP-10 (also referred to as CRG-2), Vanguri, P. and J. M. Farber, J. Biol. Chem., 265: 15049 (1990) and Luster, A. D. and P. Leder, J. Exp.

      These proteins and mammalian CXCR3 proteins having the same amino acid sequence as a naturally occurring or endogenous corresponding mammalian CXCR3, are referred to by the name of the corresponding mammal.

      "Functional variants" of mammalian CXCR3 proteins include functional fragments, functional mutant proteins, and/or functional fusion proteins (e.g., produced via mutagenesis and/or recombinant techniques).

      Antibodies which can inhibit one or more functions characteristic of a mammalian (e.g., a primate such as a human) CXCR3 protein, such as a binding activity, a signalling activity, and/or stimulation of a cellular response, are also encompassed by the present invention.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, antibodies of the present invention can inhibit binding of a ligand (i.e., one or more ligands) to a mammalian CXCR3 protein and/or can inhibit one or more functions mediated by a mammalian CXCR3 protein in response to ligand binding.
      <br/>
      In a particularly preferred embodiment, the antibodies can inhibit (reduce or prevent) the interaction of receptor with a natural ligand, such as IP-10 and/or Mig.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown herein, antibodies of the present invention can selectively inhibit the interaction of a human CXCR3 protein with IP-10 and/or selectively inhibit receptor functions in response thereto (e.g., signalling activity and/or a cellular response).
      <br/>
      An antibody designated 1C6, which displays this selectivity, can inhibit binding of IP-10 to a human CXCR3 protein as well as calcium flux and chemotaxis induced by IP-10, but does not significantly inhibit calcium flux induced by Mig under the same conditions.

      As shown herein, additional antibodies can inhibit IP-10 binding to CXCR3 (e.g., 3A8, 2F8, 3A12, 3E2, 4B4, 4D2, 5B12, 7B8 and 8D5) or IP-10-induced chemotaxis (e.g., 1A5, 3A8, 5F10, and 10C6), although these antibodies did not inhibit Mig-induced signalling under the conditions used, indicating that they are also selective inhibitors of the interaction of a human CXCR3 protein with IP-10 and/or of receptor functions in response thereto.

      Antibodies having an epitopic specificity which is the same as or similar to that of mAb 1C6 can be identified using one or more suitable techniques for characterizing epitopic specificity.

      For example, antibodies having an epitopic specificity which is the same as or similar to that of mAb 1C6 can be identified by their ability to compete with murine mAb 1C6 for binding to a human CXCR3 protein or portion thereof (e.g., to cells bearing human CXCR3, including lymphocytes such as activated T cells, NK cells, or recombinant host cells comprising a nucleic acid of the present invention).
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, antibodies having an epitopic specificity which is the same as or similar to that of mAb 1C6 are further characterized by the ability of a polypeptide having a sequence which is the same as that of residues 1-15 ("P1") of SEQ ID NO:2 to inhibit binding of the antibodies to a human CXCR3 protein in a suitable assay (see e.g., Example 8).

      Accordingly, the present invention relates to a humanized antibody (including antigen-binding fragments thereof) having binding specificity for a mammalian CXCR3 protein (e.g., a human CXCR3 protein), comprising antigen binding regions of nonhuman origin (e.g., rodent) and at least of portion of an immunoglobulin of human origin (e.g., a human framework region, a human constant region, or portions thereof).

      Functional fragments of foregoing antibodies retain at least one binding function and/or modulation function of the full-length antibody from which they are derived.
      <br/>
      For example, antibody fragments capable of binding to a mammalian CXCR3 protein or portion thereof, including, but not limited to, Fv, Fab, Fab' and F(ab')2 fragments are encompassed by the invention.
      <br/>
      Such fragments can be produced by enzymatic cleavage or by recombinant techniques.

      For instance, antibodies can act as inhibitors to inhibit (reduce or prevent) (a) binding (e.g., of a ligand, a second inhibitor or a promoter) to the receptor, (b) receptor signalling, and/or (c) a cellular response.
      <br/>
      Antibodies which act as inhibitors of receptor function can block ligand or promoter binding directly or indirectly (e.g., by causing a conformational change in the receptor).
      <br/>
      For example, antibodies can inhibit receptor function by inhibiting binding of a ligand, or by desensitization (with or without inhibition of binding of a ligand).
      <br/>
      Antibodies of the present invention can be used as antagonists of effector cells such as activated or stimulated T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and find use in methods of therapy (including prophylaxis) of diseases or conditions which can be treated with inhibitors of CXCR3 function as described herein.

      Antibodies which can selectively inhibit the interaction of a human CXCR3 protein with IP-10 and/or selectively inhibit receptor functions in response thereto (e.g., mAb 1C6, antibodies having an epitopic specificity similar to that of mAb 1C6) are particularly useful in the treatment of diseases or disorders mediated by IP-10-CXCR3 interaction.

      <br/>
      When used in methods of therapy or prophylaxis as described herein, such antibodies can have the added advantage of inhibiting further T cell activation.

      Antibodies which bind receptor can also act as agonists of receptor function, triggering or stimulating a receptor function, such as signalling and/or a cellular response (e.g., calcium flux, chemotaxis, exocytosis or pro-inflammatory mediator release) upon binding to receptor.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, such antibodies can be used as agonists of effector cells such as activated or stimulated T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and find use in methods of therapy (including prophylaxis) of diseases or conditions which can be treated with promoters of CXCR3 function as described herein.

No. 5,284,746, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, a biological response of the host cell (triggered by binding to hybrid receptor) can be monitored, detection of the response being indicative of the presence of ligand in the test sample.
      <br/>
      For example, a method of detecting the presence of a ligand in a test sample is described, wherein the ligand is an agent which is capable of being bound by the ligand-binding domain of a receptor.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment of the method, yeast host cells are transformed with a DNA construct capable of directing the expression of a biologically active hybrid G protein-coupled receptor (i.e., a fusion protein).
      <br/>
      The hybrid receptor comprises a mammalian G protein-coupled receptor having at least one domain other than the ligand-binding domain replaced with a corresponding domain of a yeast G protein-coupled receptor, such as a STE2 gene product.
      <br/>
      The yeast host cells containing the construct are maintained under conditions in which the hybrid receptor is expressed, and the cells are contacted with a test sample under conditions suitable to permit binding of ligand to the hybrid receptor.
      <br/>
      A biological response of the host cell (triggered by binding to hybrid receptor) is monitored, detection of the response being indicative of a signalling function.
      <br/>
      For instance, binding to a hybrid receptor derived from STE2 gene product can lead to induction of the BAR1 promoter.
      <br/>
      Induction of the promoter can be measured by means of a reporter gene (e.g.,  BETA -gal), which is linked to the BAR1 promoter and introduced into host cells on a second construct.
      <br/>
      Expression of the reporter gene can be detected by an in vitro enzyme assay on cell lysates or by the presence of blue colonies on plates containing an indicator (e.g., X-gal) in the medium, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      In another embodiment, the assay can be used to identify potential inhibitors of receptor function.
      <br/>
      The inhibitory activity of an agent can be determined using a ligand or promoter in the assay, and assessing the ability of the test agent to inhibit the activity induced by ligand or promoter.

    <p num="106">
      Variants of known ligands can also be screened for reduced ability (decreased ability or no ability) to stimulate activity of a coupled G protein.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, although the agent has ligand binding activity (as determined by another method), engagement of the receptor does not trigger or only weakly triggers activity of a coupled G protein.

      Such agents are potential antagonists, and can be further assessed for inhibitory activity.

    <p num="107">Chemotaxis and Other Assays of Cellular Responses</p>
    <p num="108">
      Chemotaxis assays can also be used to assess receptor function.
      <br/>
      These assays are based on the functional migration of cells in vitro or in vivo induced by an agent, and can be used to assess the binding and/or effect on chemotaxis of ligands, inhibitors, or promoters.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      The use of an in vitro chemotaxis assay to assess the response of cells to IP-10 and Mig is described in Example 2.
      <br/>
      Springer et al. describe a transendothelial lymphocyte chemotaxis assay (Springer et al., WO 94/20142, published Sep. 15, 1994, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference; see also Berman et al., Immunol Invest., 17: 625-677 (1988)).
      <br/>
      Migration across endothelium into collagen gels has also been described (Kavanaugh et al., J. Immunol, 146: 4149-4156 (1991)).
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      Generally, chemotaxis assays monitor the directional movement or migration of a suitable cell capable of chemotaxis, such as a leukocyte (e.g., T lymphocytes, NK cells, monocytes), stable transfectants of Jurkat cells, mouse L1-2 pre-B cells or of other suitable host cells, for example, into or through a barrier (e.g., endothelium, a filter), toward increased levels of an agent, from a first surface of the barrier toward an opposite second surface.
      <br/>
      Membranes or filters provide convenient barriers, such that the directional movement or migration of a suitable cell into or through a filter, toward increased levels of an agent, from a first surface of the filter toward an opposite second surface of the filter, is monitored.
      <br/>
      In some assays, the membrane is coated with a substance to facilitate adhesion, such as ICAM-1, fibronectin or collagen.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      For example, one can detect or measure the migration of cells in a suitable container (a containing means), from a first chamber into or through a microporous membrane into a second chamber which contains an agent to be tested, and which is divided from the first chamber by the membrane.
      <br/>
      A suitable membrane, having a suitable pore size for monitoring specific migration in response to the agent, including, for example, nitrocellulose, polycarbonate, is selected.
      <br/>
      For example, pore sizes of about 3-8 microns, and preferably about 5-8 microns can be used.
      <br/>
      Pore size can be uniform on a filter or within a range of suitable pore sizes.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      To assess migration, the distance of migration into the filter, the number of cells crossing the filter that remain adherent to the second surface of the filter, and/or the number of cells that accumulate in the second chamber can be determined using standard techniques (e.g., by microscopy).
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the cells are labeled with a detectable label (e.g., radioisotope, fluorescent label, antigen or epitope label), and migration can be assessed by determining the presence of the label adherent to the membrane and/or present in the second chamber using an appropriate method (e.g., by detecting radioactivity, fluorescence, immunoassay).
      <br/>
      The extent of migration induced by an agent can be determined relative to a suitable control (e.g., compared to background migration determined in the absence of the agent, to the extent of migration induced by a second agent (i.e., a standard), compared with migration of untransfected cells induced by the agent).
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      Chambers can be formed from various solids, such as plastic, glass, polypropylene, polystyrene, etc.
      <br/>
      Membranes which are detachable from the chambers, such as a Biocoat (Collaborative Biomedical Products) or Transwell (Costar, Cambridge, Mass.) culture insert, facilitate counting adherent cells.
      <br/>
      In the container, the filter can be situated so as to be in contact with fluid containing cells in the first chamber, and the fluid in the second chamber.
      <br/>
      Other than the test agent or additional ligand, inhibitor, or promoter present for the purpose of the assay, the fluid on either side of the membrane is preferably the same or substantially similar.
      <br/>
      The fluid in the chambers can comprise protein solutions (e.g., bovine serum albumin, fetal calf serum, human serum albumin) which may act to increase stability and inhibit nonspecific binding of cells, and/or culture media.

    <p num="114">
      In one embodiment, transendothelial migration is assessed.
      <br/>
      In addition to lower background (signal to noise ratio), transendothelial migration models in vivo conditions in which leukocytes emigrate from blood vessels toward chemoattractants present in the tissues at sites of inflammation by crossing the endothelial cell layer lining the vessel wall.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, transmigration through an endothelial cell layer assessed.
      <br/>
      To prepare the cell layer, endothelial cells can be cultured on a microporous filter or membrane, optionally coated with a substance such as collagen, fibronectin, or other extracellular matrix proteins, to facilitate the attachment of endothelial cells.
      <br/>
      Preferably, endothelial cells are cultured until a confluent monolayer is formed.
      <br/>
      A variety of mammalian endothelial cells can are available for monolayer formation, including for example, vein, artery or microvascular endothelium, such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Clonetics Corp, San Diego, Calif.) or a suitable cell line, such as the ECV 304 cell line used (European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, Porton Down, Salisbury, U.K.).
      <br/>
      To assay chemotaxis in response to a particular mammalian receptor, endothelial cells of the same mammal are preferred; however endothelial cells from a heterologous mammalian species or genus can also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      Generally, the assay is performed by detecting the directional migration of cells into or through a membrane or filter, in a direction toward increased levels of an agent, from a first surface of the filter toward an opposite second surface of the filter, wherein the filter contains an endothelial cell layer on a first surface.
      <br/>
      Directional migration occurs from the area adjacent to the first surface, into or through the membrane, towards an agent situated on the opposite side of the filter.
      <br/>
      The concentration of agent present in the area adjacent to the second surface, is greater than that in the area adjacent to the first surface.

      However, one or more ligands or promoters having chemoattractant function may be present.

      A reduction in the extent of migration induced by the ligand or promoter in the presence of the test agent, is indicative of inhibitory activity.

      Standard methods of screening for a defective gene can be employed, for instance.
      <br/>
      A defective gene can be isolated and expressed in a suitable host cell for further assessment as described herein for mammalian CXCR3 proteins.
      <br/>
      A number of human diseases are associated with defects in the function of a G-protein coupled receptor (Clapham, D. E., Cell, 75: 1237-1239 (1993); Lefkowitz, R. J., Nature, 365: 603-04 (1993)).
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      The nucleic acids of the present invention provide reagents, such as probes and PCR primers, which can also be used to assess expression of receptor (e.g., by detecting transcription of mRNA) by cells in a sample (e.g., by Northern analysis, by in situ hybridization).
      <br/>
      For example, expression in activated T lymphocytes or other cell types can be assessed.
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      The antibodies of the present invention have application in procedures in which receptor can be detected on the surface of cells.
      <br/>
      The receptor provides a marker of the leukocyte cell types in which it is expressed, particularly of activated T cells.
      <br/>
      For example, antibodies raised against a receptor protein or peptide, such as the antibodies described herein (e.g., mAb 1C6), can be used to detect and/or quantify cells expressing receptor.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the antibodies can be used to sort cells which express receptor from among a mixture of cells (e.g., to isolate activated T cells, such as CD4+ T cells).
      <br/>
      Suitable methods for counting and/or sorting cells can be used for this purpose (e.g., flow cytometry, fluorescence activated cell sorting).
      <br/>
      Cell counts can be used in the diagnosis of diseases or conditions in which an increase or decrease in leukocyte cell types (e.g., activated T cells) is observed.
      <br/>
      The presence of an increased level of activated T cells in a sample obtained from an individual can be indicative of infiltration due to an inflammatory disease or condition, such as a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction, allograft rejection, or a pathologic condition, including bacterial or viral infection.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      Furthermore, the antibodies can be used to detect or measure expression of receptor.
      <br/>
      For example, antibodies of the present invention can be used to detect or measure receptor in a sample (e.g., tissues or body fluids from an individual such as blood, serum, leukocytes (e.g., activated T lymphocytes), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, saliva, bowel fluid).
      <br/>
      For example, a sample (e.g., tissue and/or fluid) can be obtained from an individual and a suitable assay can be used to assess the presence or amount of CXCR3 protein.
      <br/>
      Suitable assays include immunological methods such as FACS analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), including chemiluminescence assays, radioimmunoassay, and immunohistology.
      <br/>
      Generally, a sample and antibody of the present invention are combined under conditions suitable for the formation of an antibody-receptor complex, and the formation of antibody-receptor complex is assessed (directly or indirectly).
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      The presence of an increased level of receptor reactivity in a sample obtained from an individual can be indicative of inflammation and/or leukocyte (e.g., activated T cell) infiltration and/or accumulation associated with an inflammatory disease or condition, such as allograft rejection, delayed type hypersensitivity reaction, or an infection such as a viral or bacterial infection.
      <br/>
      The level of expression of a mammalian CXCR3 protein or variant can also be used to correlate increased or decreased expression of a mammalian CXCR3 protein with a particular disease or condition, and in the diagnosis of a disease or condition in which increased or decreased expression of a mammalian CXCR3 protein occurs (e.g., increased or decreased relative to a suitable control, such as the level of expression in a normal individual).
      <br/>
      Similarly, the course of therapy can be monitored by assessing CXCR3 immunoreactivity in a sample from a patient.
      <br/>
      For example, antibodies of the present invention can be used to monitor the number of cells bearing CXCR3 in a sample (e.g., blood, tissue) from a patient being treated with an anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive agent.

    <p num="134">Transgenic Animals</p>
    <p num="135">
      Transgenic animals, in which the genome of the animal host is altered using recombinant DNA techniques, can be constructed.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the alteration is not heritable (e.g., somatic cells, such as progenitor cells in bone marrow, are altered).
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the alteration is heritable (the germ line is altered).
      <br/>
      Transgenic animals can be constructed using standard techniques or other suitable methods (see e.g., Cooke. M. P. et al., Cell, 65: 281-291 (1991) regarding alteration of T lymphocytes; Hanahan, D., Science, 246: 1265-1275, (1989); Anderson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,346).
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      In one aspect, an endogenous mammalian CXCR3 gene can be inactivated or disabled, in whole or in part, in a suitable animal host (e.g., by gene disruption techniques) to produce a transgenic animal.
      <br/>
      Nucleic acids of the present invention can be used to assess successful construction of a host containing an inactivated or disabled CXCR3 gene (e.g., by Southern hybridization).
      <br/>
      In addition, successful construction of a host containing an inactivated or disabled CXCR3 gene can be assessed by suitable assays which monitor the function of the encoded receptor.
      <br/>
      Such animals can be used to assess the effect of receptor inactivation on inflammation and host defenses against cancer and pathogens (e.g., a viral pathogen).
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      In another embodiment, a nucleic acid encoding a mammalian CXCR3 protein or polypeptide is introduced into a suitable host to produce a transgenic animal.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, endogenous CXCR3 receptor genes present in the transgenic animals are inactivated (e.g., simultaneously with introduction of the nucleic acid by homologous recombination, which disrupts and replaces the endogenous gene).
      <br/>
      For example, a transgenic animal (e.g., a mouse, guinea pig, sheep) capable of expressing a nucleic acid encoding a mammalian CXCR3 receptor of a different mammalian species (e.g., a human CXCR3 such as the CXCR3 encoded by SEQ ID NO:1) in leukocytes (such as lymphocytes (e.g., activated T lymphocytes), natural killer cells) can be produced, and provides a convenient animal model for assessing the function of the introduced receptor.
      <br/>
      In addition, a test agent can be administered to the transgenic animal, and the effect of the agent on a receptor-mediated process (e.g., inflammation) can be monitored as described herein or using other suitable assays.
      <br/>
      In this manner, agents which inhibit or promote receptor function can be identified or assessed for in vivo effect.
    </p>
    <p num="138">Methods of Therapy</p>
    <p num="139">
      Modulation of mammalian CXCR3 function according to the present invention, through the inhibition or promotion of at least one function characteristic of a mammalian CXCR3 protein, provides an effective and selective way of inhibiting or promoting receptor-mediated functions.
      <br/>
      As CXC chemokine receptors selectively expressed on activated lymphocytes, responsive to chemokines such as IP-10 and Mig whose primary targets are lymphocytes, particularly effector cells such as activated or stimulated T lymphocytes and NK cells, mammalian CXCR3 proteins provide a target for selectively interfering with or promoting lymphocyte function in a mammal, such as a human.
      <br/>
      Once lymphocytes are recruited to a site, other leukocyte types, such as monocytes, may be recruited by secondary signals.
      <br/>
      Thus, agents which inhibit or promote CXCR3 function, including ligands, inhibitors (e.g., 1C6) and/or promoters, such as those identified as described herein, can be used to modulate leukocyte function (e.g., leukocyte infiltration including recruitment and/or accumulation), particularly of lymphocytes, for therapeutic purposes.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      In one aspect, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting or promoting an inflammatory response in an individual in need of such therapy, comprising administering an agent which inhibits or promotes mammalian CXCR3 function to an individual in need of such therapy.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, a compound which inhibits one or more functions of a mammalian CXCR3 protein (e.g., a human CXCR3) is administered to inhibit (i.e., reduce or prevent) inflammation.
      <br/>
      For example, antibodies of the present invention, including mAb 1C6 can be used in the method.
      <br/>
      As a result, one or more inflammatory processes, such as leukocyte emigration, chemotaxis, exocytosis (e.g., of enzymes) or inflammatory mediator release, is inhibited.
      <br/>
      For example, leukocytic infiltration of inflammatory sites (e.g., in a delayed-type hypersensitivity response) can be inhibited according to the present method.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      In another embodiment, an agent (e.g., receptor agonist) which promotes one or more functions of a mammalian CXCR3 protein (e.g., a human CXCR3) is administered to induce (trigger or enhance) an inflammatory response, such as leukocyte emigration, chemotaxis, exocytosis (e.g., of enzymes) or inflammatory mediator release, resulting in the beneficial stimulation of inflammatory processes.
      <br/>
      For example, natural killer cells can be recruited to combat viral infections or neoplastic disease.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      The term "individual" is defined herein to include animals such as mammals, including, but not limited to, primates (e.g., humans), cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, rats, mice or other bovine, ovine, equine, canine, feline, rodent or murine species.
      <br/>
      Diseases and conditions associated with inflammation, infection, and cancer can be treated using the method.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the disease or condition is one in which the actions of lymphocytes, particularly effector cells such as activated or stimulated T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, are to be inhibited or promoted for therapeutic (including prophylactic) purposes.

      <br/>
      infectious diseases, such as bacterial infections and tuberculoid leprosy, and especially viral infections;
      <br/>
      immunosuppression, such as that in individuals with immunodeficiency syndromes such as AIDS, individuals undergoing radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or other therapy which causes immunosuppression; immunosuppression due congenital deficiency in receptor function or other causes.
      <br/>
      Promoters of CXCR3 function can also have protective effects useful to combat stem cell depletion during cancer chemotherapy (Sarris, A. H. et al., J. Exp. Med., 178: 1127-1132 (1993)).

    <p num="146">Modes of Administration</p>
    <p num="147">
      According to the method, one or more agents can be administered to the host by an appropriate route, either alone or in combination with another drug.
      <br/>
      An effective amount of an agent (e.g., a receptor peptide which inhibits ligand binding, an anti-CXCR3 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof) is administered.
      <br/>
      An effective amount is an amount sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect, under the conditions of administration, such as an amount sufficient for inhibition or promotion of CXCR3 receptor function, and thereby, inhibition or promotion, respectively, of a receptor-mediated process (e.g., an inflammatory response).
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      A variety of routes of administration are possible including, but not necessarily limited to oral, dietary, topical, parenteral (e.g., intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, subcutaneous injection), and inhalation (e.g., intrabronchial, intranasal or oral inhalation, intranasal drops) routes of administration, depending on the agent and disease or condition to be treated.
      <br/>
      For respiratory allergic diseases such as asthma, inhalation is a preferred mode of administration.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      Formulation of an agent to be administered will vary according to the route of administration selected (e.g., solution, emulsion, capsule).
      <br/>
      An appropriate composition comprising the agent to be administered can be prepared in a physiologically acceptable vehicle or carrier.
      <br/>
      For solutions or emulsions, suitable carriers include, for example, aqueous or alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media.
      <br/>
      Parenteral vehicles can include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's or fixed oils, for instance.
      <br/>
      Intravenous vehicles can include various additives, preservatives, or fluid, nutrient or electrolyte replenishers and the like (See, generally, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th Edition, Mack Publishing Co., Pa., 1985).
      <br/>
      For inhalation, the agent can be solubilized and loaded into a suitable dispenser for administration (e.g., an atomizer, nebulizer or pressurized aerosol dispenser).
    </p>
    <p num="150">
      Furthermore, where the agent is a protein or peptide, the agent can be administered via in vivo expression of the recombinant protein.
      <br/>
      In vivo expression can be accomplished via somatic cell expression according to suitable methods (see, e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,346).
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, nucleic acid encoding the protein can be incorporated into a retroviral, adenoviral or other suitable vector (preferably, a replication deficient infectious vector) for delivery, or can be introduced into a transfected or transformed host cell capable of expressing the protein for delivery.

    <p num="164">
      A cDNA was isolated from a human CD4+ T cell library by searching for T lymphocyte-specific chemokine receptors (FIG. 1, SEQ ID NO:1).
      <br/>
      This cDNA was not recovered in the course of searching a commonly used monocyte-derived cDNA library or granulocyte (HL60)-derived cDNA library for novel chemokine receptor cDNAs; however, a direct search of the libraries specifically for CXCR3 cDNA has not been conducted.
      <br/>
      The CXCR3 cDNA, which was shown to encode an IP-10/Mig receptor (see below), and has an open reading frame (ORF) of 1104 bp beginning at residue 69 which encodes a protein of 368 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 40,659 daltons.
      <br/>
      The amino acid sequence (FIG. 2, SEQ ID NO:2) includes seven putative transmembrane segments, which are characteristic of G-protein coupled receptors, and three potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn22, Asn32, and Asn199) (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      In addition, one threonine and nine serine residues, which are potential phosphorylation sites for receptor kinases (Palczewski, K. and J. L. Benovic, Trends Biochem.

    <p num="165">
      The 368 amino acid sequence of the receptor (IP-10/MigR, FIG. 2, SEQ ID NO:2) was aligned with the amino acid sequences of other human chemokine receptors, including IL-8R1 (CXCR1), IL-8R2 (CXCR2), CC-CKR1 (CCR1), CC-CKR2A (CCR2a), CC-CKR3 (CCR3) and CC-CKR4 (CCR4).
      <br/>
      Multiple protein alignment was performed according to Higgins and Sharp (Higgins, D. G. and P. M. Sharp, "Description of the method used in CLUSTAL," Gene, 73: 237-244 (1988)).
      <br/>
      Double-underlined residues in FIG. 2 represent regions of identity between IP-10/MigR and at least two other chemokine receptors.
      <br/>
      Hyphens indicate gaps in the alignment.
      <br/>
      The alignment revealed several conserved motifs, particularly in the transmembrane domains and the second intracellular loop.
      <br/>
      Significant sequence identity with CXC receptors IL-8R1 and IL-8R2, but not with the CC chemokine receptors, was observed in the third and the sixth transmembrane domains (FIG. 2).
    </p>
    <p num="166">
      The sequence shares 40.9% and 40.3% amino acid identity overall with the IL-8R1 and IL-8R2 receptors, respectively, and 34.2 to 36.9% identity with the five known CC chemokine receptors (Table 1).
      <br/>
      A lower degree of similarity was found with seven-transmembrane-domain receptors that are expressed in T cells, but which do not bind chemokines, e.g., 27.2% identity with the thrombin receptor (Vu, T.-K. H. et al., Cell, 64: 1057-1068 (1991)).
      <br/>
      A truncated clone of unidentified function, with an incomplete coding sequence which can be aligned with that of FIG. 2, was previously isolated from a human genomic DNA library (Marchese, A. et al., Genomics, 29: 335-344 (1995)).

    <p num="171">
      In view of the observed chemokine selectivity, the occurrence of the IP-10/MigR in leukocytes and related cell lines was examined by Northern blot analysis. 10  MU g samples of total RNA were examined from freshly isolated human blood monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes (PBL), nylon-wool purified T cells, and from cultured cells including cloned human CD4+ T cells (KT30) and CD8+ T cells (ERCD8), cloned NK cells (ERNK57), and PBL cultured for 10 days (1-2.5 * 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mM glutamine, 1 * non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100  MU g/ml kanamycin, 5 * 10-5 M 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% human serum) in the presence of 400 U/ml hrIL-2. (human recombinant IL-2 was a gift of Dr. A. Lanzavecchia, Basel Institute of Immunology, Basel, Switzerland).
      <br/>
      Agarose gels were stained with ethidium bromide to check the integrity and amount of total RNA on the gel prior to blotting.
      <br/>
      RNA samples were analyzed with 32 P-labeled 5'-fragment of the IP-10/MigR DNA (109 cpm/ MU g DNA) at 5 * 106 cpm/ml hybridization solution as described (Loetscher, M. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269: 232-237 (1994)).
      <br/>
      The 5'-fragment used as a Northern probe was prepared by digestion of CXCR3 cDNA in pBK-CMV vector (Stratagene GMBH, Zurich, Switzerland) with PstI yielding the 724 bp 5'-end of the CXCR3 cDNA (FIG. 1).
    </p>
    <p num="172">Results</p>
    <p num="173">
      Abundant expression of mRNA of the expected size was found in the cloned CD4+ T cells, KT30, that were used for isolation of the receptor cDNA.
      <br/>
      Similar levels of expression were observed in the CD8+ T cell clone, ERCD8, and the NK cell clone, ERNK57.
      <br/>
      In contrast, in freshly isolated blood lymphocytes and nylon-wool purified T cells, IL10/MigR transcripts were barely detectable.
      <br/>
      However, when these cells were cultured in the presence of IL-2, a strong upregulation was obtained, and the level of receptor mRNA approached that of T and NK cell clones.
      <br/>
      No IP-10/MigR transcripts were detected under these conditions in freshly isolated blood monocytes, neutrophil leukocytes, or eosinophil leukocytes.
      <br/>
      Additional leukocyte-related cells that did not express IP-10/MigR mRNA include the mast cell line, HMC-1, the promyelocytic leukemia line, HL60, the histiocytic lymphoma, U937, the chronic myelogenous leukemia line, K562, the acute T cell leukemia line, Jurkat, the acute lymphoblastic leukemia line, Molt, the B-lymphoblastic cell lines Daudi and Raji, lymphocytes from patients with chronic and acute B-lymphoid leukemia (B-CLL and B-ALL), mature basophils from a patient with basophilic leukemia, and the erythroleukemia cell line, HEL.
      <br/>
      By contrast, the receptors for chemokines which have been shown previously to attract lymphocytes, i.e. MCP-1 MCP-2, MCP-3, MIP-1 ALPHA , MIP-1 BETA  and RANTES (Loetscher, P. et al., FASEB J., 8: 1055-1060 (1994); Carr, M. W. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91: 3652-3656 (1994); Taub, D. D. et al., Science, 260: 355-358 (1993); Schall, T. J. et al., J. Exp. Med., 177: 1821-1825 (1993); Schall, T. J. et al., Nature, 347: 669-672 (1990)), are also found in monocytes and granulocytes.
      <br/>
      The restricted expression of IP-10/MigR in activated T lymphocytes and a natural killer cell line suggests that this novel receptor can mediate selective lymphocyte recruitment.

      Activation of chemokine receptors leads to a transient rise in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration (�Ca2+ �i), and this assay was used to monitor signalling in the transfected cells.

    <p num="180">Changes in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration (�Ca2+ �i) were measured in cells loaded with fura-2 by incubation for 30 minutes at 37 (degree)  C. with 0.1 nmol fura-2 acetoxymethylester per 106 cells in a buffer containing 136 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM glucose, and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. After centrifugation, loaded cells were resuspended in the same buffer (106 cells/ml), stimulated with the indicated chemokine at 37 (degree)  C., and the �Ca2+ �i -related fluorescence changes were recorded (von Tscharner, V. et al., Nature, 324: 69-372 (1986)).</p>
    <p num="181">Results</p>
    <p num="182">
      A rapid �Ca2+ �i rise was observed in response to IP-10 and Mig.
      <br/>
      The chemokine IP-10 has been shown to be expressed in cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions (Luster, A. D. et al., Nature, 315: 672-676 (1985); Kaplan, G. et al., J. Exp. Med., 166: 1098-1108 (1987)).
      <br/>
      The chemokine designated Mig was recently identified (Farber, J. M., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87: 5238-5242 (1990); Farber, J. M., Biophys. Res. Commun., 192: 223-230 (1993)).
      <br/>
      Both chemokines have the CXC arrangement of the first two cysteines like IL-8, but are not chemotactic for neutrophil leukocytes.
      <br/>
      It was recently reported that IP-10 attracts T lymphocytes (Luster, A. D. and P. Leder, J. Exp. Med., 178: 1057-1065 (1993); Taub, D. D. et al., J. Exp. Med., 177: 1809-1814 (1993)), and that Mig is chemotactic for tumor-associated lymphocytes (Liao, F. et al., J. Exp. Med., 182: 1301-1314 (1995)).
    </p>
    <p num="183">
      FIGS. 3A-3C summarize the effects of IP-10 and Mig on cells transfected with the cDNA and expressing the functional IP-10/MigR.
      <br/>
      As shown by the �Ca2+ �i changes (FIG. 3A), the action of IP-10 and Mig was concentration dependent and already detectable at 1 nM, indicating that both chemokines have high affinity for the novel receptor.
      <br/>
      The IP-10/MigR transfectants, by contrast, did not respond to any of 16 other potential agonists at concentrations up to 100 nM, including the CXC chemokines IL-8, GRO ALPHA , NAP-2, GCP-2, ENA78, PF4, the CC chemokines MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MIP-1 ALPHA , MIP-1 BETA , RANTES, I309, eotaxin or the chemokine related lymphotactin (not shown).
      <br/>
      Identical results were obtained with the murine and the human transfected cells.
      <br/>
      These observations demonstrate that the novel receptor is highly selective for IP-10 and Mig.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the receptor is referred to herein as an IP-10/Mig receptor (IP-10/MigR), or as "CXCR3", reflecting its specificity for CXC chemokines.
    </p>
    <p num="184">
      As shown in FIG. 3B, repeated stimulation with IP-10 or Mig resulted in desensitization typical of chemokine receptors.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, cross-desensitization occurred when the cells were stimulated with IP-10 followed by Mig or vice versa, confirming that the receptor has high affinity for both chemokines.
      <br/>
      At 100 nM concentration, it became evident that Mig was more potent in cross-desensitization than IP-10, suggesting higher affinity or binding stability of the IP-10/Mig receptor for Mig.
    </p>
    <p num="185">
      While expression of functional IP-10/MigR was demonstrated, binding experiments using radioactive ligands revealed non-specific binding between 60 and 80% of the total, preventing determination of binding parameters.
      <br/>
      Since IP-10 and Mig are highly cationic (pI values of 10.8 and 11.1), nonspecific interaction with cell surface proteoglycans may explain these results.
      <br/>
      Indeed, chemokine receptor-unrelated, heparinase-sensitive binding sites for IP-10 (and PF4) have been detected on a variety of blood and tissue cells (Luster, A. D. et al., J. Exp. Med., 182: 219-231 (1995)), and heparan sulfate binds IP-10 and Mig and prevents lymphocyte chemotaxis (not shown).
      <br/>
      The heparin binding site is probably not involved in CXCR3 receptor binding, and inclusion of a suitable heparin derivative such as chondroitin sulfate in the reaction (e.g., in binding buffer) can be used to inhibit non-specific binding to cells through the heparin binding site.

      Cell migration was assessed in 48-well chambers (Neuro Probe, Cabin John, Md., USA) using polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membranes (Nucleopore) with 5- MU m pores for IP-10/MigR transfected cells (Loetscher, P. et al., FEBS Lett. 341: 187-192 (1994)) or with 3- MU m pores for human PBL (Loetscher, P. et al., FASEB J., 8: 1055-1060 (1994)).
      <br/>
      RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1% pasteurized plasma protein solution (Swiss Red Cross Laboratory, Bern, Switzerland) was used to dissolve the chemokines (lower wells), and to dilute the cells (100,000 receptor transfectants or PBL in the upper well).
      <br/>
      After 60 minutes at 37 (degree)  C., the membrane was removed, washed on the upper side with PBS, fixed and stained.
      <br/>
      All assays were done in triplicate, and the migrated cells were counted in five randomly selected fields at 1,000-fold magnification.
      <br/>
      Spontaneous migration was determined in the absence of chemoattractant.

    <p num="190">Results--Transfected Cells</p>
    <p num="191">
      Transfected cells expressing the IP-10/MigR readily migrated toward IP-10 or Mig, while the non-transfected, parental cells did not respond (FIG. 3C).
      <br/>
      Both agonists showed a typically biphasic concentration dependence.
      <br/>
      IP-10 induced migration at concentrations above 1 nM, whereas the response of Mig became detectable above 10 nM.
      <br/>
      The efficacy, which is measured by the maximum number of migrating cells, was about twice as high for Mig as for IP-10.
      <br/>
      These results demonstrate that the IP-10/MigR, like all known chemokine receptors in leukocytes, mediates chemotaxis in response to ligand.

      In agreement with the cellular distribution of the IP-10/MigR, activated human T lymphocytes were found to be highly responsive to IP-10 and Mig (FIGS. 4A-4B).
      <br/>
      The activity of IP-10 and Mig as inducers of �Ca2+ �i changes (FIG. 4A) and in vitro chemotaxis (FIG. 4B) was consistent with the effects observed using transfected cells expressing the IP-10/MigR, with IP-10 being more potent but less efficacious than Mig.
      <br/>
      Activation of the T lymphocytes by culturing in the presence of IL-2 was required for induction of calcium flux and chemotaxis, and no response was observed with freshly isolated blood lymphocytes under the conditions used.

USA, 91(9):3652-3656 (1994)), which has been described previously (Ponath, P. D., et al., J. Clin.

      The results for mAbs designated 1A5, 1C6, 3A8, 5F10, 10C6 and 10G12 are illustrated in FIG. 10. One mAb, 1C6, was superior to the other mAbs in its ability to block the chemotaxis of T cells to IP-10. mAb 1C6 was able to inhibit completely the chemotaxis of T cells to IP-10 in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of .about 0 (slashed zero) 8  MU g/ml (FIG. 11).
      <br/>
      A concentration of 2-5  MU g/ml was achieved 100% inhibition, using an optimal concentration of IP-10 (12.5 nM) in the bottom of the transwell. 1C6 was unable to significantly inhibit T cell chemotaxis to MCP-1 under the conditions used (FIG. 10), which occurs through the chemokine receptor CCR2b.

      Between 1 and 10  MU g/ml of antibody gave complete inhibition.
      <br/>
      The complete inhibition of both IP-10 binding and chemotaxis by mAb 1C6 indicates that activated T cells do not express another receptor that binds this chemokine.

    <p num="235">
      Northern blot analysis indicated that CXCR3 was expressed in activated T cells.
      <br/>
      Using a panel of specific mAbs, CXCR3 was found to be expressed on a subset of blood T cells, as well as on other leukocyte types (B cells and NK cells).
      <br/>
      CXCR3 expressing T cells had a phenotype consistent with previous activation, i.e. CD45RO+, CD26+ (Example 5).
      <br/>
      Staining of T cells was markedly increased when T cells were activated by CD3 and IL-2, which correlated with increased cell migration in response to IP-10 and readiolabeled ligand binding.

    <p num="236">
      The poor responsiveness of blood T cells to IP-10 or Mig, at least in chemotaxis assays, appears anomalous.
      <br/>
      A possible explanation is that factors other than receptor expression may determine cellular responsiveness to chemoattractants.
      <br/>
      Appropriate G protein coupling may be necessary for signalling.
      <br/>
      Another possibility is that the blood separation procedure disrupts this receptor, as has been observed for IL-8 receptors on T cells and NK cells (C. R. Mackay).
      <br/>
      Injection of IP-10 into the skin of in appropriate experimental animal can address the significance of CXCR3 expression on blood T cells.
      <br/>
      On activated T cells, IP-10 is one of the most potent chemoattractants.
      <br/>
      Activation of T cells may induce the receptor signalling molecules or coupling needed for signal transduction.

      A titration of the chemokines revealed that maximal �Ca2+ �i was achieved with as little as 2 nM IP-10 or 2 nM Mig.
      <br/>
      To examine the agonist/antagonist function of mAb 1C6, activated T cells were assessed for �Ca2+ �i following injection of mAb 1C6, or an irrelevant isotype-matched control mAb.
      <br/>
      T cells injected with an irrelevant isotype-matched control mAb showed a robust �Ca2+ �i response to subsequent injection of IP-10 (not shown).
      <br/>
      However, T cells treated with mAb 1C6 showed no �Ca2+ �i upon stimulation with 2 nM IP-10. �Ca2+ �i in activated T cells in response to IP-10 was completely suppressed by 12.5 mg of 1C6.
      <br/>
      However, as much as 50  MU g/ml of 1C6 had no effect on the response of T cells to 2 nM Mig (FIG. 13D), indicating that the two ligands were differentially affected by this mAb.
      <br/>
      As a control, mAb 1C6 was tested for its effects on the �Ca2+ �i of T cells in response to MIP-1 ALPHA  or RANTES, which occurs through receptors other than CXCR3 (not shown).

      mAb 1C6, which inhibits IP-10 binding and IP-10-induced chemotaxis, also inhibited calcium flux by activated T cells, but did not inhibit Mig-induced calcium flux under these conditions.

      These results suggest the IP-10 and Mig bind and/or signal through different regions of CXCR3, and that mAb 1C6 was able to block the IP-10 binding site and subsequent signalling.

      Thus, it is possible to develop receptor antagonists which selectively inhibit the effects of individual chemokines, illustrated here using mAb 1C6.

      <br/>
      Based upon the inability of 1C6 to inhibit Mig-induced calcium flux under the conditions used, the epitope recognized by mAb 1C6, which appears to be important for IP-10 binding and signalling, does not appear to be involved in Mig binding and/or signalling.

      P3 peptide did not block staining with any of these antibodies, indicating that none of these antibodies bound the peptide representing amino acids 31-45 of CXCR3 (residues 31-45 of SEQ ID NO:2).
      <br/>
      Staining using the three remaining mAbs could not be significantly inhibited by any of the peptides under the conditions used, suggesting that these mAbs my bind epitopes comprising overlapping segments of the peptides, conformational epitopes displayed on the cell surface or epitopes on other parts of the receptor.
      <br/>
      These data also suggest that mAbs against various portions of CXCR3 can be obtained by immunizing mice with receptor transfectants.

    <p num="256">Immunohistochemical Analysis of Normal and Inflamed Tissues Using mAb 1C6</p>
    <p num="257">Tissues</p>
    <p num="258">
      Human tissues (normal and inflamed) were obtained from the National Disease Research Institute, a service organization funded by the National Institutes of Health.
      <br/>
      Normal macaque (Macaca mulatta) tissues were obtained from the New England Regional Primate Research Center, Southboro, Mass.
    </p>
    <p num="259">Immunohistochemistry</p>
    <p num="260">
      Alkaline Phosphatase Technique.
      <br/>
      Tissue was sectioned at a thickness of 4  MU m, desiccated, and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/0.5 * PBS for 10 minutes at 40 (degree)  C. After PBS washing, nonspecific antibody binding sites were blocked with 10% normal goat serum/5% human AB serum/PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature.
      <br/>
      Next, the purified, anti-CXCR3 murine mAb 1C6, was diluted to a concentration of 10  MU g/ml in 0.3% Triton X 100/0.2% Tween 20/1% FCS/5% human AB serum, and 0.1% sodium azide, and applied to tissue sections which were incubated overnight at 4 (degree)  C. An isotype-matched irrelevant monoclonal antibody was used as a negative control on step sections of tissues (IgG1, MOPC-21, Sigma, St.
      <br/>
      Louis, Mo.).
      <br/>
      Subsequently, biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (Vector, Burlingame, Calif.) and avidin-biotin-alkaline phosphatase complexes (Biogenex, San Ramon, Calif.) were added in sequence.
      <br/>
      Fast Red (Biogenex, San Ramon, Calif.), containing levamisol to block endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity, was used as the chromogen and Mayers hematoxylin as the counterstain.
    </p>
    <p num="261">Results</p>
    <p num="262">Human and macaque normal lymph node: In both species, staining was limited to 70-80% of lymphocytes within the paracortex and medullary cords, consistent with CXCR3 expression on T lymphocytes.</p>
    <p num="263">
      Human and macaque spleen: In both species, staining was limited to lymphocytes along the periphery of lymphoid follicles of white pulp and scattered lymphocytes within splenic sinusoids.
      <br/>
      This pattern is consistent with CXCR3 expression on T lymphocytes.
    </p>
    <p num="264">Human thymus: The thymic medulla contained scattered CXCR3 immunoreactive mononuclear cells morphologically consistent with lymphocytes.</p>
    <p num="265">
      This analysis revealed that macaque CXCR3 is recognized by mAb 1C6.
      <br/>
      Separate studies showed that CXCR3 is upregulated by culturing macaque cells T lymphocytes with concanavalin A and IL-2, macaque T cell blasts can chemotax in response to human IP-10, mAb 1C6 can block this chemotaxis, and prior incubation with human IP-10 desensitizes macaque blasts as assessed by chemotaxis.
    </p>
    <p num="266">
      In the following discussion, variable numbers of CXCR3 immunoreactive "mononuclear cells" were identified in both normal and inflamed tissues.
      <br/>
      These mononuclear cells are most likely T lymphocytes for the following reasons: a) flow cytometry revealed that the majority of CXCR3+ cells are T lymphocytes, although CXCR3 has been detected on some B cells and NK cells, but not on other mononuclear cells; b) within the lymph node and spleen, lymphocytes in regions known to be populated by T cells are the only cells that are immunoreactive for CXCR3; and c) the CXCR3 immunoreactive mononuclear cells in the tissues listed below are morphologically consistent with lymphocytes.
    </p>
    <p num="267">
      Non-inflamed human tissues: In non-inflamed human tissues including heart, liver, kidney, lung, skin, breast, skeletal muscle, salivary gland, pancreas, vagina, uterus, and ovary, CXCR3 expression was limited to rare, scattered interstitial mononuclear cells.
      <br/>
      In sections of small and large intestine, mononuclear cells expressing CXCR3 were observed within the lamina propria and Peyer's patches.
      <br/>
      In liver, periductal lymphocytes were also stained and hepatocytes were lightly stained.
    </p>
    <p num="268">Human brain: No staining was observed.</p>
    <p num="269">
      Inflamed human tissues: Several sections of chronically inflamed tissue characterized by interstitial and perivascular accumulation of mononuclear cells were examined for CXCR3 expression.
      <br/>
      In these tissues, including tissue from human patients with interstitial nephritis (1 case, kidney tissue), ulcerative colitis (1 case, colon tissue), enteritis (1 case, small intestine) and chronic vaginitis (4 cases, vagina), about 50%-90% of mononuclear cells were immunoreactive for CXCR3.
      <br/>
      Thus, compared to normal tissues, chronically inflamed tissues contained a greater number of interstitial mononuclear cells, and a greater percentage of these cells were immunoreactive for CXCR3.
    </p>
    <p num="270">
      Analysis of inflamed tissues revealed that about 50-90% of lymphocytes expressed CXCR3, whereas much lower percentages of lymphocytes in the corresponding normal tissue expressed CXCR3.
      <br/>
      These observations suggest specific recruitment of lymphocytes expressing CXCR3, most likely T lymphocytes expressing CXCR3, to sites of chronic inflammation.
      <br/>
      CXCR3 appears to mark T cells with a predilection for homing or migration to inflammatory sites.
