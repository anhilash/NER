      A thermally insulating coating system for curved and/or hardened glass panes includes at least one layer of noble metal enclosed by a lower and an upper blocker layer.
      <br/>
      An underoxidic NiCrOx layer with a thickness between one Å and two nm is embedded into the noble-metal layer.
      <br/>
      The advantage is that the optical qualities of the coating system are not influenced by the tempering and curving of the glass pane.

    <p num="2">In another aspect, the present invention relates to the method of depositing the heat insulating layers onto a glass pane or panel and the production of glass products, such as automotive glass therefrom.</p>
    <p num="3">
      It is known in the art that coating systems can be applied to flat glass panes, that is, onto the flat glass.
      <br/>
      The coated flat glass is then heated up to just below its softening temperature and hardened by a shock-like cooling off.
      <br/>
      The curving or bending of the glass panes takes place between the heating and the quenching.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Thermally reflecting coating systems are known in which the glass panes are curved and/or hardened after the application of the coating system.
      <br/>
      For heat reflection one or several coatings of noble metal, e.g. silver on account of its good selective reflection capacity even at low coating thicknesses, is customarily used.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It is furthermore generally known that highly refractive dielectric layers can be arranged above and below the silver layer in order to improve the optical qualities.
      <br/>
      During the application of, for example, a metal-oxide layer on the silver and during the curving and/or hardening of the coated glass substrates with the associated heating, oxidation of the silver coating and diffusion of the silver into the metal-oxide coating tends to occur.
      <br/>
      The oxidation is caused by the fact that during the reactive application of the metal-oxide layer the oxygen that leaks in reacts with the silver.
      <br/>
      Also, during the heating of the coated glass panes the oxygen of the metal-oxide layer is activated and also unites with the silver.
      <br/>
      In addition, the diffusion of the silver is increased, as a result of which the thickness of the silver layer decreases.
      <br/>
      The reflection power of the coated glass panes is reduced by the oxidation and diffusion that takes place.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A coating system for curved and/or hardened glass panes is known (DE 196 32 788) which consists of dielectric layers, intermediate layers and at least one noble-metal layer.
      <br/>
      A dielectric layer, a metallic intermediate layer, a silver layer, another metallic intermediate layer and a dielectric layer following the coating system are successively sputtered by atomization onto the flat glass pane and the metallic intermediate coatings consist of an alloy of AlMgMn.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Furthermore, a multi-layer structure is known with selective light transmittency (EP 0,035,906) consisting of a substrate layer A, with a transparent laminar structure which carries a layer D which contains silver metal, has a thickness of 50 to 300  Angstrom  and reflects infrared waves, as well as a transparent thin layer B1, with a high degree of refraction between layers A and D and/or a transparent thin layer B2 with a high index of refraction for layer D and, selectively, a transparent cover layer E on layer B2 (if present) or layer D; a layer C, consisting of a material which was selected from the group consisting of Ti, Zr, In, Si, C, Co and Ni and has a thickness of 3 to 100  Angstrom , on layer D stands in contact with the latter on its side opposite layer A.</p>
    <p num="8">
      A glass pane with a transparent film is also known (EP 0,304,234) which film comprises a metal coating sensitive to tarnishing in the presence of an agent which causes tarnishing, and which film comprises a separate blocking layer which is further removed from the surface of the glass pane than is the metal layer.
      <br/>
      The blocking layer comprises metal-oxide layers including a layer of an oxide of a metal Me 1 which is located between layers of an oxide of a metal Me 2.
      <br/>
      Me 1 is titanium, zirconium or hafnium or a mixture of them and Me 2 is zinc, tin, indium or bismuth or a mixture of them.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Finally, a glass object, coated by sputtering a glass substrate is known (EP 0,722,913) which has a system consisting of the following layers, oriented outward from the glass:</p>
    <p num="10">A layer coating of Si3 N4 with a thickness of 300 to 500  Angstrom ;</p>
    <p num="11">
      a layer of nickel or nickel chromium with a thickness of approximately 7  Angstrom  or less;
      <br/>
      a layer of silver with a thickness of approximately 70 to 130  Angstrom ;
      <br/>
      a layer of nickel or nickel chromium with a thickness of approximately 7  Angstrom  or less; and
      <br/>
      a layer of Si3 N4 with a thickness of 700 to 1100  Angstrom ;
      <br/>
      a layer of nickel or nickel chromium with a thickness of approximately 7  Angstrom  or less;
      <br/>
      a layer of silver with a thickness of approximately 70 to 90  Angstrom ;
      <br/>
      a layer of nickel or nickel chromium with a thickness of approximately 7  Angstrom  or less; and
      <br/>
      a layer of Si3 N4 with a thickness of 350 to 700  Angstrom .
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      An object of the present invention is to enable the deposition by sputtering of a thermally insulating layer and the tempering and curving of a glass substrate without significantly changing the optical qualities of the combination of the layers.
      <br/>
      In particular, the haze (diffuse scatter) should be less than 0.5 after the tempering.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">The above and other objects of the invention can be achieved by forming a suboxidic layer of NiCrOx with a thickness between 0.1 and 3.0 nm embedded into the noble metal layer in the combination of thermally insulating layers.</p>
    <p num="14">The blocker layers enclosing the noble metal layers are preferably formed from suboxidic NiCrOx or suboxidic NiCrOx, and TiO2.</p>
    <p num="15">A silver layer is advantageously selected as the noble metal layer, which silver layer is preferably applied by sputtering with a small amount of oxygen amounting to 0 to 10 sccm at a cathode output of 1.5 KW.</p>
    <p num="16">
      Layers (e.g. Si3 N4, TiO2) produced by sputtering with the TwinMag apparatus in which two cathodes are connected in such a manner to an alternating voltage that they are alternatingly cathode and anode of a gas discharge are, as a result of a strong ion bombardment during the sputtering process, very compact, have a very high density, are very hard and mechanically and chemically very stable.
      <br/>
      As a result of the high density, the sputtered layers constitute a very effective diffusion barrier for foreign atoms (oxygen, sulfur and others).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the TwinMag technology makes possible the production of layers with a very smooth surface.
      <br/>
      This effect significantly improves the electric qualities of an Ag layer applied to them.
      <br/>
      All these qualities are desirable in the manufacture of coating systems which are capable of being tempered or curved.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">The following coating systems were produced in a vacuum system with four cathodes--a TwinMag cathode with metallic Si target, a TwinMag cathode with Ti target, a DC magnetron with Ag target and a DC magnetron with NiCr target:</p>

    <p num="19">TiO2 was sputtered with a Ti target in a reactive atmosphere of O2 and Ar.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The process was carried out in the metallic mode of the cathode characteristic.
      <br/>
      For the preparation of pure metallic layers, a pure metallic target is used in the sputtering process, wherein as the process gas a pure inert gas, such as argon is used.
      <br/>
      If the inert gas contains any oxygen mixed therein, then the resulting layer is no longer purely metallic, but is partially metal oxidic.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Si3 N4 was sputtered with a Si target in a reactive atmosphere of N2 and Ar.</p>
    <p num="22">
      NiCrOx was deposited by sputtering with a NiCr target in a reactive gaseous atmosphere of argon and a very small amount of O2.
      <br/>
      The process was carried out in the metallic mode of the cathode characteristic.
      <br/>
      The amount of oxygen present in the gas was just sufficient to produce an oxide layer which contains no unbound oxygen atoms.
      <br/>
      The amount of oxygen was determined in such a manner that the cathode burned very close to the transitional area.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The Ag target was sputtered in a reactive atmosphere of O2 and Ar.
      <br/>
      The amount of oxygen was selected in such a manner that the resistance of the Ar layer did not rise by more than 10%.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In the second coating system the second TiO2 layer was eliminated.
      <br/>
      The effect of the TiO2 blocker layer was thereby able to be shown.
      <br/>
      The task of this layer is to suppress the light scattering of the system after the tempering.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      A third coating system was produced as a further comparison in which system the Ag layer was not divided up.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the Ag layer is equal here to the sum of the Ag layers in the first system.
    </p>
    <p num="26">The fourth coating system, which represents a normal Low-e coating, was sputtered as a further test.</p>
    <p num="27">These coating systems were exposed to a temperature of 700 (degree)  C. for up to 6 min.</p>
    <p num="28">
      The following measurements were performed on the examined coating systems before and after the tempering:
      <br/>
      1.
      <br/>
      Optical transmission Ty (Ty=transmission taking into consideration the eye sensitivity .apprxeq.550 nm) and reflection Ry (Ry=reflection)

      In coating system 1 identified in the preceding tables the lower and the upper layers have the function of traditional low-e layers.
      <br/>
      These coatings should be very dense in order to avoid the diffusion of oxygen or of other atoms into the silver layer.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The upper and the lower NiCr blocker layers provide the desired temperature stability of the coating system.
      <br/>
      The are purposefully sputtered on in the metallic mode of the cathode characteristic as close as possible to the area of the transition into the oxidic mode.
      <br/>
      The NiCr blockers between the two Ag layers bring about the wiping resistance after the tempering.
      <br/>
      Their service life is a function of their thickness and the degree of their oxidation: the thicker the blockers are, the less sensitive the combination packet is mechanically.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The second TiO2 layer reduces the fogging and light scattering after the heat treatment of the coated substrate.
      <br/>
      The precisely measured amount of oxygen in the silver layer brings about the temperature resistance as well as the mechanical resistance of the coating combination.
      <br/>
      The upper limit of the amount of oxygen determines the stability of the silver layer and should be below 3%.

      In the foregoing, the symbol "x" is a variable number and for example, when used to define NiCrOx it can indicate NiCrO2 as well as NiCrO4.
