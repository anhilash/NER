      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      This invention relates to an electron-emitting device that is free from degradation due to long use and the undesired phenomenon of electric discharge under a voltage applied thereto and can emit electrons stably and efficiently for a long time.
      <br/>
      It also relates to an electron source and an image forming apparatus such as a display apparatus or an exposure apparatus comprising such devices as well as a method of manufacturing the same.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      There have been known two types of electron-emitting device; the thermionic cathode type and the cold cathode type.
      <br/>
      Of these, the cold cathode emission type refers to devices including field emission type (hereinafter referred to as the FE type) devices, metal/insulation layer/metal type (hereinafter referred to as the MIM type) electron-emitting devices and surface conduction electron-emitting devices.
      <br/>
      Examples of FE type device include those proposed by W. P. Dyke &amp; W. W. Dolan, "Field emission", Advance in Electron Physics, 8, 89 (1956) and C. A. Spindt, "PHYSICAL Properties of thin-film field emission cathodes with molybdenum cones", J. Appl. Phys., 47, 5284 (1976).
    </p>
    <p num="6">Examples of MIM devices are disclosed in papers including C. A. Mead, "The tunnel-emission amplifier", J. Appl. Phys., 32, 646 (1961).</p>
    <p num="7">
      Examples of surface conduction electron-emitting devices include one proposed by M. I. Elinson, Radio Eng.
      <br/>
      Electron Phys., 10 (1965).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      A surface conduction electron-emitting device is realized by utilizing the phenomenon that electrons are emitted out of a small thin film formed on a substrate when an electric current is forced to flow in parallel with the film surface.
      <br/>
      While Elinson proposes the use of an SnO2 thin film for a device of this type, the use of an Au thin film is proposed in G. Dittmer: "Thin Solid Films", 9, 317 (1972) whereas the use of In2 O3 /SnO2 and of carbon thin film is discussed respectively in �M.

      Reference numeral 4 denotes an electroconductive thin film normally prepared by producing an H-shaped thin metal oxide film by means of sputtering, part of which eventually makes an electron-emitting region 5 when it is subjected to an electrically energizing process referred to as "energization forming" as described hereinafter.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 33, the thin horizontal area of the metal oxide film separating a pair of device electrodes has a length L of 0.5 to 1 mm and a width W of 0.1 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Conventionally, an electron emitting region 5 is produced in a surface conduction electron-emitting device by subjecting the electroconductive thin film 4 of the device to an electrically energizing preliminary process, which is referred to as "energization forming".
      <br/>
      In the energization forming process, a constant DC voltage or a slowly rising DC voltage that rises typically at a rate of 1V/min. is applied to given opposite ends of the electroconductive thin film 4 to partly destroy, deform or transform the film and produce an electron-emitting region 5 which is electrically highly resistive.
      <br/>
      Thus, the electron-emitting region 5 is part of the electroconductive thin film 4 that typically contains a gap or gaps therein so that electrons may be emitted from the gap.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      After the energization forming process, the electron-emitting device is subjected to an "activation" process, where a film (carbon film) of carbon and/or one or more than one carbon compounds is formed in the vicinity of the gap of the electron source in order to improve the electron-emitting performance of the device.
      <br/>
      The process is normally carried out by applying a pulse voltage to the device in an atmosphere that contains one or more than one organic substances so that carbon and/or one or more than one carbon compounds may be deposited in the vicinity of the electron-emitting region.
      <br/>
      Note that a deposited carbon film is found mainly on the anode side of the electroconductive thin film and only poorly, if any, on the cathode side.
      <br/>
      In some cases, a "stabilization" process may be carried out on the electron-emitting device in order to prevent carbon and/or one or more than one carbon compounds from being excessively deposited and the device may show a stabilized performance in the operation of electron emission.
      <br/>
      In the stabilization process, any organic substances that have been adsorbed in the peripheral areas of the device and those that are remaining in the atmosphere are removed.
    </p>
    <p num="12">For a surface conduction electron-emitting device to operate satisfactorily in practical applications, it has to meet a number of requirements including that it needs to show a large emission current Ie and a high electron emission efficiency  ETA  (=Ie/If, where If is the current that flows between the two device electrodes, which is referred to as device current), that it must operate stably for electron emission after a long use and that no electric discharge phenomenon should be observed on it if a voltage is applied to the device (between the two device electrodes and between the device and an anode).</p>
    <p num="13">While the performance of an electron-emitting device is affected by a number of factors, the inventors of the present invention has discovered that the performance is strongly correlated with the shape and the distribution of the carbon film formed on the electron-emitting gap and its vicinity in the activation process as well as the conditions under which the activation process is carried out.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">It is, therefore, the object of the present invention to provide an electron-emitting device that performs well for electron emission by selecting optimal conditions for the carbon film in terms of its distribution, its properties and the conditions under which it is treated before producing the device as a finished product.</p>

      <br/>
      While the device of FIGS. 1A and 1B does not practically carry any carbon film outside the gap, a carbon film may also be formed outside the gap.
      <br/>
      Although graphite is a crystalline substance containing only carbon atoms, its crystallinity may be accompanied, to certain extent, by "distortions" of various types.
      <br/>
      For the purpose of the invention, however, a carbon film of highly crystalline graphite is formed in the inside of the gap of the electron-emitting region.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="21">
      For the purpose of the invention, the crystallinity of graphite is qualitatively and quantitatively determined by observing the crystal lattice of the specimen by means of a transmission electron microscope and Raman spectrometric analysis.
      <br/>
      In the examples as will be described hereinafter, a Laser Raman Spectrometer provided with a laser source of Ar laser having a wavelength of 514.5 nm and designed to produce a laser spot having a diameter of about 1  MU m on the specimen was used.
      <br/>
      When the laser spot was located near the electron-emitting region of the electron-emitting device being tested and the scattered light was observed, a spectrum having peaks in the vicinity of 1,335 cm-1 (P1) and in the vicinity of 1,580 cm-1 (P2) was obtained to prove the existence of a carbon film.
      <br/>
      The obtained spectrum was artificially well reproduced by assuming a Gauss type peak profile and the existence of a third peak in the vicinity of 1,490 cm-1.
      <br/>
      The particle size of the graphite of each specimen can be estimated by comparing the intensity of light at the peaks and the estimations in the examples agreed fairly well with the results obtained through TEM observation.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The P2 peak is attributable to the phenomenon of electron transition that takes place in the graphite structure, whereas a PI peak is given rise to by distortions in the crystallinity of graphite.
      <br/>
      Thus, although only the P2 peak is supposed to be observable in an ideal graphite single crystal, a P1 peak appears and becomes observable when the crystalline particles of graphite are very small and/or the crystal lattice of graphite is defective.
      <br/>
      The P1 peak grows as the crystallinity of graphite is reduced and the half widths of the peaks increase if the periodicity of the graphite crystal structure is disturbed.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Since a graphite film used for the purpose of the present invention is not necessarily made of ideal single crystal graphite, a P1 peak is typically observed there and the half width of the peak can effectively be used to quantitatively estimate the crystallinity of the graphite.
      <br/>
      As will be described in detail hereinafter, a value of about 150 cm-1 seems to provide a limit for the stability of the electron-emitting performance of an electron-emitting device according to the invention.
      <br/>
      For an electron-emitting device according to the invention to operate properly, either the half width has to show a value smaller than 150 cm-1 or the P1 peak has to be sufficiently low.
    </p>
    <p num="24">An electron-emitting device that meets the above requirements has the following effects.</p>
    <p num="25">Degradation of an electron-emitting device with time in terms of its electron-emitting performance is attributable, among others, to an unnecessarily growing or, conversely, decreasing deposit of carbon film.</p>
    <p num="26">
      Such an unnecessary growth of the deposit can be effectively suppressed by eliminating any carbon compounds from the atmosphere in which the device is driven to operate.
      <br/>
      A "stabilization process" as referred to earlier is carried out mainly for the purpose of realizing an atmosphere that is free from carbon compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      While many reasons may be conceivable for a possible decrease of the carbon deposit, a specific cause may be that the carbon film is gradually etched away by O2 and/or H2 O remaining in the atmosphere surrounding the device.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is also necessary to remove such gasses out of the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The electron-emitting performance of an electron-emitting device may also be affected by a phenomenon that the opposite ends of the electroconductive thin film defining the gap of the electron-emitting region gradually retreat from each other to widen the gap.
      <br/>
      It has been discovered that such a phenomenon can be suppressed to a certain extent if a carbon film is formed on each of said ends of the electroconductive thin film and that the effect of suppressing the widening of the gap is particularly remarkable if the carbon film is made of highly crystalline graphite.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The above effect can also be achieved by forming a graphite film on each of the anode and cathode side ends of the gap of the electron-emitting region.
      <br/>
      Note that the graphite has to show the above defined degree of crystallinity.
      <br/>
      It should also be noted that, if an electron-emitting device is subjected to an ordinary stabilization process, a carbon film is formed only on the anode side end of the gap and not on the cathode side end.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the end of the electroconductive thin film shows a gradually retraction at the cathode side end of the gap and a widened gap over a long period of time of electron-emitting operation, that cannot be suppressed completely unless a graphite film is formed on each end of the gap.
      <br/>
      As for the electric performance of the device, the leak current and hence the device current If of the device can be reduced and, at the same time, the electron emission current Ie of the device can be raised by applying a relatively high voltage for an activation process so that consequently a high electron emission efficiency  ETA =Ie/If may be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Now, an electric discharge phenomenon appears as a voltage is applied between the device electrodes and/or the device and an anode and can damage the electron-emitting device.
      <br/>
      Therefore, such a phenomenon should be thoroughly suppressed.
      <br/>
      Although electric discharge can occur when gas molecules surrounding the electron-emitting device are ionized, the pressure of the gas surrounding the device is normally too low for electric discharge to take place.
      <br/>
      So, if electric discharge occurs while the electron-emitting device is being driven to operate, it implies that gas has been generated somewhere around the device for some reason or other.
      <br/>
      Of possible gas sources, the most important one is the carbon film deposited on the device for activation.
      <br/>
      Of course, since the carbon film located in the gap of the electron-emitting region of the device is constantly exposed to Joule's heat and electrons that can collide with it, no gas can normally remain around the film to become ionized.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      On the other hand, the carbon film outside the gap of the electron-emitting region of the device can contain hydrogen lingering in the space surrounding the crystalline particles of graphite and, if the film is made of amorphous carbon or a carbon compound, the film may contain hydrogen as a component thereof, which can eventually be released to become hydrocarbon gas.
      <br/>
      Although the electric discharge phenomenon that can take place on an electron-emitting device has not been fully accounted for to date, it can be satisfactorily suppressed by adopting reasonable counter measures, taking the above explanations into consideration.
    </p>
    <p num="32">More specifically, a surface conduction electron-emitting device according to the invention may comprise a graphite film of a desired crystallinity in the gap and does not substantially comprise a carbon film outside the gap in order to avoid the electric discharge phenomenon.</p>
    <p num="33">
      If a possible source of gas exists outside the gap of the electron-emitting region in the electroconductive thin film of a surface conduction electron-emitting device, electrons emitted from the device and directed toward an anode arranged outside the device may partly be attracted by the anode of the device and come into the gap and partly collide with molecules of the gas remaining in the gap, which by turn produce positive ions and attracted by the cathode of the device.
      <br/>
      A net result will then be that the carbon film produces gas and eventually gives rise to an electric discharge phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Thus, if the electroconductive thin film gets rid of any carbon film outside the gap, the device can effectively suppress the generation of gas and the occurrence of electric discharge.
      <br/>
      In fact, the measures taken by the inventors of the present invention to remove any carbon film outside the gap of the electron-emitting region have been proven to be very effective as will be described in greater detail hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      A surface conduction electron-emitting device according to the invention may be configured differently to get rid of the electric discharge phenomenon.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the electric discharge phenomenon can be effectively suppressed by improving the crystallinity of the carbon film existing outside the gap of the electron-emitting region.
    </p>
    <p num="36">It should also be noted that any of the above described configurations can also improve the electron-emitting performance of a surface conduction electron-emitting device according to the invention.</p>
    <p num="37">Now, a method of manufacturing a surface conduction electron-emitting device according to the invention will be described.</p>
    <p num="38">FIGS. 1A and 1B are schematic views showing a plane type surface conduction electron-emitting device according to the invention, of which FIG. 1A is a plan view and FIG. 1B is a sectional side view.</p>
    <p num="39">Referring to FIGS. 1A and 1B, the device comprises a substrate 1, a pair of device electrodes 2 and 3, an electroconductive thin film 4 and an electron-emitting region 5 having a gap formed therein.</p>
    <p num="40">Materials that can be used for the substrate 1 include quartz glass, glass containing impurities such as Na to a reduced concentration level, soda lime glass, glass substrate realized by forming an SiO2 layer on soda lime glass by means of sputtering, ceramic substances such as alumina.</p>
    <p num="41">While the oppositely arranged device electrodes 2 and 3 may be made of any highly conducting material, preferred candidate materials include metals such as Ni, Cr, Au, Mo, W, Pt, Ti, Al, Cu and Pd and their alloys, printable conducting materials made of a metal or a metal oxide selected from Pd, Ag, RuO2, Pd--Ag and glass, transparent conducting materials such as In2 O3 --SnO2 and semiconductor materials such as polysilicon.</p>
    <p num="42">
      The distance L separating the device electrodes, the length W of the device electrodes, the contour of the electroconductive film 4 and other factors for designing a surface conduction electron-emitting device according to the invention may be determined depending on the application of the device.
      <br/>
      The distance L separating the device electrodes 2 and 3 is preferably between hundreds nanometers and hundreds micrometers and, still preferably, between several micrometers and tens of several micrometers depending on the voltage to be applied to the device electrodes and the field strength available for electron emission.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The length W of the device electrodes 2 and 3 is preferably between several micrometers and hundreds of several micrometers depending on the resistance of the electrodes and the electron-emitting characteristics of the device.
      <br/>
      The film thickness d of the device electrodes 2 and 3 is between tens of several nanometers and several micrometers.
    </p>
    <p num="44">A surface conduction electron-emitting device according to the invention may have a configuration other than the one illustrated in FIGS. 1A and 1B and, alternatively, it may be prepared by laying a thin film 4 including an electron-emitting region on a substrate 1 and then a pair of oppositely disposed device electrodes 2 and 3 on the thin film.</p>
    <p num="45">
      The electroconductive thin film 4 is preferably a fine particle film in order to provide excellent electron-emitting characteristics.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the electroconductive thin film 4 is determined as a function of the stepped coverage of the electroconductive thin film on the device electrodes 2 and 3, the electric resistance between the device electrodes 2 and 3 and the parameters for the forming operation that will be described later as well as other factors and preferably between a tenth of a nanometer and hundreds of several nanometers and more preferably between a nanometer and fifty nanometers.
      <br/>
      The electroconductive thin film 4 normally shows a resistance per unit surface area Rs between 102 and 107 OMEGA /cm2.
      <br/>
      Note that Rs is the resistance defined by R=Rs(l/w), where t, w and l are the thickness, the width and the length of the thin film respectively.
      <br/>
      Also note that, while the forming process is described by way of an energization forming process for the purpose of the present invention, it is not limited thereto and may be selected from a number of different physical or chemical processes, with which a gap can be formed in a thin film to produce a high resistance region there.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The electroconductive thin film 4 is made of fine particles of a material selected from metals such as Pd, Ru, Ag, Au, Ti, In, Cu, Cr, Fe, Zn, Sn, Ta, W and Pb, oxides such as PdO, SnO2, In2 O3, PbO and Sb2 O3, borides such as HfB2, ZrB2.

      A graphite film 6 is arranged in the gap of the electron emitting region 5.

    <p num="58">A surface conduction type electron emitting device according to the invention and having an alternative profile, or a step type surface conduction electron-emitting device, will now be described.</p>
    <p num="59">FIG. 3 is a schematic sectional side view of a step type surface conduction electron emitting device, to which the present invention is applicable.</p>
    <p num="60">
      In FIG. 3, those components that are same or similar to those of FIGS. 1A and 1B are denoted respectively by the same reference symbols.
      <br/>
      Reference symbol 7 denotes a step-forming section.
      <br/>
      The device comprises a substrate 1, a pair of device electrodes 2 and 3 and an electroconductive thin film 4 including an electron emitting region 5 having a gap, which are made of materials same as a flat type surface conduction electron-emitting device as described above, as well as a step-forming section 7 made of an insulating material such as SiO2 produced by vacuum deposition, printing or sputtering and having a film thickness corresponding to the distance L separating the device electrodes of a flat type surface conduction electron-emitting device as described above, or between several hundred nanometers and tens of several micrometers.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the film thickness of the step-forming section 21 is between tens of several nanometers and several micrometers, although it is selected as a function of the method of producing the step-forming section used there, the voltage to be applied to the device electrodes and the field strength available for electron emission.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      As the electroconductive thin film 4 including the electron emitting region is formed after the device electrodes 2 and 3 and the step-forming section 21, it may preferably be laid on the device electrodes 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      While the electron-emitting region 5 is formed in the step-forming section 7 in FIG. 3, its location and contour are dependent on the conditions under which it is prepared, the energization forming conditions and other related conditions are not limited to those shown there.
    </p>
    <p num="62">While various methods may be conceivable for manufacturing a surface conduction electron-emitting device, FIGS. 4A through 4D illustrate a typical one of such methods.</p>
    <p num="63">
      Now, a method of manufacturing a flat type surface conduction electron-emitting device according to the invention will be described by referring to FIGS. 1A and 1B and 4A through 4D.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 4A through 4D, those components that are same or similar to those of FIGS. 1A and 1B are denoted respectively by the same reference symbols.
    </p>
    <p num="64">1) After thoroughly cleansing a substrate 1 with detergent and pure water, a material is deposited on the substrate 1 by means of vacuum deposition, sputtering or some other appropriate technique for a pair of device electrodes 2 and 3, which are then produced by photolithography (FIG. 4A).</p>
    <p num="65">
      2) An organic metal thin film is formed on the substrate 1 carrying thereon the pair of device electrodes 2 and 3 by applying an organic metal solution and leaving the applied solution for a given period of time.
      <br/>
      The organic metal solution may contain as a principal ingredient any of the metals listed above for the electroconductive thin film 4.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the organic metal thin film is heated, baked and subsequently subjected to a patterning operation, using an appropriate technique such as lift-off or etching, to produce an electroconductive thin film 4 (FIG. 4B).
      <br/>
      While an organic metal solution is used to produce a thin film in the above description, an electroconductive thin film 4 may alternatively be formed by vacuum deposition, sputtering, chemical vapor phase deposition, dispersed application, dipping, spinner or some other technique.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      3) Thereafter, the device electrodes 2 and 3 are subjected to a process referred to as "forming".
      <br/>
      Here, an energization forming process will be described as a choice for forming.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the device electrodes 2 and 3 are electrically energized by means of a power source (not shown) until an electron emitting region 5 having a gap is produced in a given area of the electroconductive thin film 4 to show a modified structure that is different from that of the electroconductive thin film 4 (FIG. 4C).
      <br/>
      FIGS. 5A and 5B show two different pulse voltages that can be used for energization forming.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The voltage to be used for energization forming preferably has a pulse waveform.
      <br/>
      A pulse voltage having a constant height or a constant peak voltage may be applied continuously as shown in FIG. 5A or, alternatively, a pulse voltage having an increasing height or an increasing peak voltage may be applied as shown in FIG. 5B.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      In FIG. 5A, the pulse voltage has a pulse width Ti and a pulse interval T2, which are typically between 1  MU sec. and 10 msec. and between 10  MU sec. and 100 msec. respectively.
      <br/>
      The height of the triangular wave (the peak voltage for the energization forming operation) may be appropriately selected depending on the profile of the surface conduction electron-emitting device.
      <br/>
      The voltage is typically applied for tens of several minutes.
      <br/>
      Note, however, that the pulse waveform is not limited to triangular and a rectangular or some other waveform may alternatively be used.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      FIG. 5B shows a pulse voltage whose pulse height increases with time.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 6B, the pulse voltage has an width T1 and a pulse interval T2 that are substantially similar to those of FIG. 6A. The height of the triangular wave (the peak voltage for the energization forming operation) is increased at a rate
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      The energization forming operation will be terminated by measuring the current running through the device electrodes when a voltage that is sufficiently low and cannot locally destroy or deform the electroconductive thin film 2 is applied to the device during an interval T2 of the pulse voltage.
      <br/>
      Typically the energization forming operation is terminated when a resistance greater than 1M ohms is observed for the device current running through the electroconductive thin film 4 while applying a voltage of approximately 0.1V to the device electrodes.
    </p>
    <p num="71">4) After the energization forming operation, the device is subjected to an activation process.</p>
    <p num="72">
      In an activation process, a pulse voltage may be repeatedly applied to the device in a vacuum atmosphere.
      <br/>
      In this process, carbon or a carbon compound contained in the organic substances existing in a vacuum atmosphere at a very minute concentration is deposited on the device to give rise to a remarkably change in the device current If and the emission current Ie of the device.
      <br/>
      The activation process is normally conducted, while observing the device current If and the emission current Ie, and terminated when the emission current Ie gets to a saturated level.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      The atmosphere may be produced by utilizing the organic gas remaining in a vacuum chamber after evacuating the chamber by means of an oil diffusion pump and a rotary pump or by sufficiently evacuating a vacuum chamber by means of an ion pump and thereafter introducing the gas of an organic substance into the vacuum.
      <br/>
      The gas pressure of the organic substance is determined as a function of the profile of the electron-emitting device to be treated, the profile of the vacuum chamber, the type of the organic substance and other factors.
      <br/>
      Organic substances that can be suitably used for the purpose of the activation process include aliphatic hydrocarbons such as alkanes, alkenes and alkynes, aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, amines, organic acids such as, phenol, carbonic acids and sulfonic acids.
      <br/>
      Specific examples include saturated hydrocarbons expressed by general formula Cn H2n+2 such as methane, ethane and propane, unsaturated hydrocarbons expressed by general formula Cn H2n such as ethylene and propylene, benzene, toluene, methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, methylethylketone, methylamine, ethylamine, phenol, formic acid, acetic acid and propionic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="74">A rectangular pulse voltage as shown in FIG. 6B may be used as the pulse voltage applied to the device in an activation process.</p>
    <p num="75">There may be a number of methods that can be used to produce a graphite film out of the carbon film in the gap of the electron-emitting region.</p>
    <p num="76">With a first method, the device is subjected to an etching operation for removing unnecessary portions of the carbon film after the end of the activation process.</p>
    <p num="77">The etching operation is carried out by applying a voltage to the device in an atmosphere containing a gas that has an etching effect on carbon.</p>
    <p num="78">
      A gas having an etching effect is typically expressed by a general formula of XY (where X and Y represent H or a halogen atom).
      <br/>
      The carbon film obtained by deposition in the activation process is etched by the etching gas at a rate that is a function of the crystallinity of the carbon.
      <br/>
      Outside the gap of the electron-emitting region, the carbon film is mostly etched out since it is mainly constituted of fine graphite crystals, amorphous carbon and one or more than one carbon compounds that contain hydrogen and other atoms and, therefore, the carbon film remains only inside the gap.
      <br/>
      Even inside the gap, those portions that are poorly crystalline are etched out so that only a graphite film 6 that is highly crystalline will remain (FIG. 4D).
      <br/>
      It may be safely assumed that the etching gas produces hydrogen radicals and other radicals as electrons emitted from the electron-emitting device collide with molecules of the gas.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      With a second method, an etching operation is carried out in parallel with an activation process.
      <br/>
      This may be done by introducing simultaneously or alternately an etching gas such as hydrogen gas and an organic substance into a vacuum chamber to be used for an activation process.
      <br/>
      The etching operation may be started from the very beginning of the activation process or somewhere in the middle of the activation process.
      <br/>
      The substrate may be heated during the etching process.
    </p>
    <p num="80">If a lowly crystalline carbon film is formed with this second method, it may be removed immediately so that consequently only a highly crystalline graphite film may be allowed to grow, although, unlike the first method, a graphite may also be formed outside the gap. (See FIG. 24A.)</p>
    <p num="81">
      With a third method, a bipolar pulse voltage as illustrated in FIG. 6A is used as an activation pulse voltage.
      <br/>
      With this method, a carbon film is deposited on both sides of the gap of the electron-emitting region. (See FIG. 24B.) Then, without any etching operation, the carbon films in the gap will make highly crystalline graphite films.
      <br/>
      This phenomenon of a carbon film growing not simply from the anode side but from the two opposite sides of the gap may be attributable to the strong electric field generated by the voltage because such a phenomenon is not observable with either of the above two methods.
      <br/>
      Note that the substrate may be heated during the etching operation and the height and the width of the positive side may or may not be equal to those of the negative side of the pulse voltage and appropriate values may be selected for them depending on the application of the device.
    </p>
    <p num="82">The third method may be used with the first or second method.</p>
    <p num="83">
      5) An electron-emitting device that has been treated in an energization forming process and an activation process is then preferably subjected to a stabilization process.
      <br/>
      This is a process for removing any organic substances remaining in the vacuum chamber.
      <br/>
      The vacuuming and exhausting equipment to be used for this process preferably does not involve the use of oil so that it may not produce any evaporated oil that can adversely affect the performance of the treated device during the process.
      <br/>
      Thus, the use of a sorption pump and an ion pump may be a preferable choice.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      If an oil diffusion pump and a rotary pump are used for the activation process and the organic gas produced by the oil is also utilized, the partial pressure of the organic gas has to be minimized by any means.
      <br/>
      The partial pressure of the organic gas in the vacuum chamber is preferably lower than 1 * 10-6 Pa and more preferably lower than 1 * 10-8 Pa if no carbon or carbon compound is additionally deposited.
      <br/>
      The vacuum chamber is preferably evacuated after heating the entire chamber so that organic molecules adsorbed by the inner walls of the vacuum chamber and the electron-emitting device(s) in the chamber may also be easily eliminated.
      <br/>
      While the vacuum chamber is preferably heated to 80 to 250 (degree)  C. for more than 5 hours in most cases, other heating conditions may alternatively be selected depending on the size and the profile of the vacuum chamber and the configuration of the electron-emitting device(s) in the chamber as well as other considerations.
      <br/>
      The pressure in the vacuum chamber needs to be made as low as possible and it is preferably lower than 1 to 4 * 10-5 Pa and more preferably lower than 1 * 10 -6 Pa.
    </p>
    <p num="85">After the stabilization process, the atmosphere for driving the electron-emitting device or the electron source is preferably same as the one when the stabilization process is completed, although a lower pressure may alternatively be used without damaging the stability of operation of the electron-emitting device or the electron source if the organic substances in the chamber are sufficiently removed.</p>
    <p num="86">By using such an atmosphere, the formation of any additional deposit of carbon or a carbon compound can be effectively suppressed to consequently stabilize the device current If and the emission current Ie.</p>
    <p num="87">The performance of a electron-emitting device prepared by way of the above processes, to which the present invention is applicable, will be described by referring to FIGS. 7 and 8.</p>
    <p num="88">
      FIG. 7 is a schematic block diagram of an arrangement comprising a vacuum chamber that can be used for the above processes.
      <br/>
      It can also be used as a gauging system for determining the performance of an electron-emitting device of the type under consideration.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 7, the gauging system includes a vacuum chamber 15 and a vacuum pump 16.
      <br/>
      An electron-emitting device is placed in the vacuum chamber 15.
      <br/>
      The device comprises a substrate 1, a pair of device electrodes 2 and 3, a thin film 4 and an electron-emitting region 5 having a gap.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, the gauging system has a power source 11 for applying a device voltage Vf to the device, an ammeter 10 for metering the device current If running through the thin film 4 between the device electrodes 2 and 3, an anode 14 for capturing the emission current Ie produced by electrons emitted from the electron-emitting region of the device, a high voltage source 13 for applying a voltage to the anode 14 of the gauging system and another ammeter 12 for metering the emission current Ie produced by electrons emitted from the electron-emitting region 5 of the device.
      <br/>
      For determining the performance of the electron-emitting device, a voltage between 1 and 10 kV may be applied to the anode, which is spaced apart from the electron-emitting device by distance H which is between 2 and 8 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      Instruments including a vacuum gauge and other pieces of equipment necessary for the gauging system are arranged in the vacuum chamber 15 so that the performance of the electron-emitting device or the electron source in the chamber may be properly tested.
      <br/>
      The vacuum pump 16 is provided with an ordinary high vacuum system comprising a turbo pump and a rotary pump or an oil-free high vacuum system comprising an oil-free pump such as a magnetic levitation turbo pump and a dry pump and an ultra-high vacuum system comprising an ion pump.
      <br/>
      The vacuum chamber containing an electron source therein can be heated to 250 (degree)  C. by means of a heater (not shown).
      <br/>
      Thus, all the processes from the energization forming process on can be carried out with this arrangement.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      FIG. 8 shows a graph schematically illustrating the relationship between the device voltage Vf and the emission current Ie and the device current If typically observed by the gauging system of FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      Note that different units are arbitrarily selected for Ie and If in FIG. 8 in view of the fact that Ie has a magnitude by far smaller than that of If.
      <br/>
      Note that both the vertical and transversal axes of the graph represent a linear scale.
    </p>
    <p num="91">As seen in FIG. 8, an electron-emitting device according to the invention has three remarkable features in terms of emission current Ie, which will be described below.</p>
    <p num="92">
      (i) Firstly, an electron-emitting device according to the invention shows a sudden and sharp increase in the emission current Ie when the voltage applied thereto exceeds a certain level (which is referred to as a threshold voltage hereinafter and indicated by Vth in FIG. 8), whereas the emission current Ie is practically undetectable when the applied voltage is found lower than the threshold value Vth.
      <br/>
      Differently stated, an electron-emitting device according to the invention is a non-linear device having a clear threshold voltage Vth to the emission current Ie.
    </p>
    <p num="93">(ii) Secondly, since the emission current Ie is highly dependent on the device voltage Vf, the former can be effectively controlled by way of the latter.</p>
    <p num="94">
      (iii) Thirdly, the emitted electric charge captured by the anode 35 is a function of the duration of time of application of the device voltage Vf.
      <br/>
      In other words, the amount of electric charge captured by the anode 14 can be effectively controlled by way of the time during which the device voltage Vf is applied.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      Because of the above remarkable features, it will be understood that the electron-emitting behavior of an electron source comprising a plurality of electron-emitting devices according to the invention and hence that of an image-forming apparatus incorporating such an electron source can easily be controlled in response to the input signal.
      <br/>
      Thus, such an electron source and an image-forming apparatus may find a variety of applications.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      On the other hand, the device current If either monotonically increases relative to the device voltage Vf (as shown by a solid line in FIG. 8, a characteristic referred to as "MI characteristic" hereinafter) or changes to show a curve (not shown) specific to a voltage-controlled-negative-resistance characteristic (a characteristic referred to as "VCNR characteristic" hereinafter).
      <br/>
      These characteristics of the device current are dependent on a number of factors including the manufacturing method, the conditions where it is gauged and the environment for operating the device.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      Now, some examples of the usage of electron-emitting devices, to which the present invention is applicable, will be described.
      <br/>
      An electron source and hence an image-forming apparatus can be realized by arranging a plurality of electron-emitting devices according to the invention on a substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="98">Electron-emitting devices may be arranged on a substrate in a number of different modes.</p>
    <p num="99">
      For instance, a number of electron-emitting devices may be arranged in parallel rows along a direction (hereinafter referred to row-direction), each device being connected by wirings at opposite ends thereof, and driven to operate by control electrodes (hereinafter referred to as grids) arranged in a space above the electron-emitting devices along a direction perpendicular to the row-direction (hereinafter referred to as column-direction) to realize a ladder-like arrangement.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a plurality of electron-emitting devices may be arranged in rows along an X-direction and columns along an Y-direction to form a matrix, the X- and Y-directions being perpendicular to each other, and the electron-emitting devices on a same row are connected to a common X-directional wiring by way of one of the electrodes of each device while the electron-emitting devices on a same column are connected to a common Y-directional wiring by way of the other electrode of each device.
      <br/>
      The latter arrangement is referred to as a simple matrix arrangement.
      <br/>
      Now, the simple matrix arrangement will be described in detail.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      In view of the above described three basic characteristic features (i) through (iii) of a surface conduction electron-emitting device, to which the invention is applicable, it can be controlled for electron emission by controlling the wave height and the wave width of the pulse voltage applied to the opposite electrodes of the device above the threshold voltage level.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the device does not practically emit any electron below the threshold voltage level.
      <br/>
      Therefore, regardless of the number of electron-emitting devices arranged in an apparatus, desired surface conduction electron-emitting devices can be selected and controlled for electron emission in response to an input signal by applying a pulse voltage to each of the selected devices.

      These wirings are so designed in terms of material, thickness and width that, if necessary, a substantially equal voltage may be applied to the surface conduction electron-emitting devices.

      While the fluorescent film 34 comprises only a single fluorescent body if the display panel is used for showing black and white pictures, it needs to comprise for displaying color pictures black conductive members 38 and fluorescent bodies 39, of which the former are referred to as black stripes or members of a black matrix depending on the arrangement of the fluorescent bodies.
      <br/>
      Black stripes or members of a black matrix are arranged for a color display panel so that the fluorescent bodies 39 of three different primary colors are made less discriminable and the adverse effect of reducing the contrast of displayed images of external light is weakened by blackening the surrounding areas.
      <br/>
      While graphite is normally used as a principal ingredient of the black stripes, other conductive material having low light transmissivity and reflectivity may alternatively be used.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      A precipitation or printing technique is suitably be used for applying a fluorescent material on the glass substrate regardless of black and white or color display.
      <br/>
      An ordinary metal back 35 is arranged on the inner surface of the fluorescent film 34.
      <br/>
      The metal back 35 is provided in order to enhance the luminance of the display panel by causing the rays of light emitted from the fluorescent bodies and directed to the inside of the envelope to turn back toward the face plate 36, to use it as an electrode for applying an accelerating voltage to electron beams and to protect the fluorescent bodies against damages that may be caused when negative ions generated inside the envelope collide with them.
      <br/>
      It is prepared by smoothing the inner surface of the fluorescent film (in an operation normally called "filming") and forming an Al film thereon by vacuum deposition after forming the fluorescent film.
    </p>
    <p num="114">A transparent electrode (not shown) may be formed on the face plate 36 facing the outer surface of the fluorescent film 34 in order to raise the conductivity of the fluorescent film 34.</p>
    <p num="115">Care should be taken to accurately align each set of color fluorescent bodies and an electron-emitting device, if a color display is involved, before the above listed components of the envelope are bonded together.</p>
    <p num="116">An image-forming apparatus as illustrated in FIG. 10 may be manufactured in a below described manner.</p>
    <p num="117">
      The envelope 37 is evacuated by means of an appropriate vacuum pump such as an ion pump or a sorption pump that does not involve the use of oil, while it is being heated as in the case of the stabilization process, until the atmosphere in the inside is reduced to a degree of vacuum of 10-5 Pa containing organic substances to a sufficiently low level and then it is hermetically and airtightly sealed.
      <br/>
      A getter process may be conducted in order to maintain the achieved degree of vacuum in the inside of the envelope 37 after it is sealed.
      <br/>
      In a getter process, a getter arranged at a predetermined position in the envelope 37 is heated by means of a resistance heater or a high frequency heater to form a film by vapor deposition immediately before or after the envelope 37 is sealed.
      <br/>
      A getter typically contains Ba as a principal ingredient and can maintain a degree of vacuum between 1 * 10-4 and 1 * 10-5 by the adsorption effect of the vapor deposition film.
      <br/>
      The processes of manufacturing surface conduction electron-emitting devices of the image-forming apparatus after the forming process may appropriately be designed to meet the specific requirements of the intended application.

      Now, a drive circuit for driving a display panel comprising an electron source with a simple matrix arrangement for displaying television images according to NTSC television signals will be described by referring to FIG. 12. In FIG. 13, reference numeral 41 denotes a display panel.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, the circuit comprises a scan circuit 42, a control circuit 43, a shift register 44, a line memory 45, a synchronizing signal separation circuit 46 and a modulation signal generator 47.
      <br/>
      Vx and Va in FIG. 12 denote DC voltage sources.
    </p>
    <p num="119">The display panel 41 is connected to external circuits via terminals Dox1 through Doxm, Doy1 through Doym and high voltage terminal Hv, of which terminals Dox1 through Doxm are designed to receive scan signals for sequentially driving on a one-by-one basis the rows (of N devices) of an electron source in the apparatus comprising a number of surface conduction type electron-emitting devices arranged in the form of a matrix having M rows and N columns.</p>
    <p num="120">
      On the other hand, terminals Doy1 through Doyn are designed to receive a modulation signal for controlling the output electron beam of each of the surface-conduction type electron-emitting devices of a row selected by a scan signal.
      <br/>
      High voltage terminal Hv is fed by the DC voltage source Va with a DC voltage of a level typically around 10 kV, which is sufficiently high to energize the fluorescent bodies of the selected surface-conduction type electron-emitting devices.
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      The scan circuit 42 operates in a manner as follows.
      <br/>
      The circuit comprises M switching devices (of which only devices S1 and Sm are specifically indicated in FIG. 13), each of which takes either the output voltage of the DC voltage source Vx or 0�V� (the ground potential level) and comes to be connected with one of the terminals dox1 through Doxm of the display panel 41.
      <br/>
      Each of the switching devices S1 through Sm operates in accordance with control signal Tscan fed from the control circuit 43 and can be prepared by combining transistors such as FETs.
    </p>
    <p num="122">The DC voltage source Vx of this circuit is designed to output a constant voltage such that any drive voltage applied to devices that are not being scanned due to the performance of the surface conduction electron-emitting devices (or the threshold voltage for electron emission) is reduced to less than threshold voltage.</p>
    <p num="123">
      The control circuit 43 coordinates the operations of related components so that images may be appropriately displayed in accordance with externally fed video signals.
      <br/>
      It generates control signals Tscan, Tsft and Tmry in response to synchronizing signal Tsync fed from the synchronizing signal separation circuit 46, which will be described below.
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      The synchronizing signal separation circuit 46 separates the synchronizing signal component and the luminance signal component from an externally fed NTSC television signal and can be easily realized using a popularly known frequency separation (filter) circuit.
      <br/>
      Although a synchronizing signal extracted from a television signal by the synchronizing signal separation circuit 46 is constituted, as well known, of a vertical synchronizing signal and a horizontal synchronizing signal, it is simply designated as Tsync signal here for convenience sake, disregarding its component signals.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a luminance signal drawn from a television signal, which is fed to the shift register 44, is designed as DATA signal.
    </p>
    <p num="125">The shift register 44 carries out for each line a serial/parallel conversion on DATA signals that are serially fed on a time series basis in accordance with control signal Tsft fed from the control circuit 43. (In other words, a control signal Tsft operates as a shift clock for the shift register 44.) A set of data for a line that have undergone a serial/parallel conversion (and correspond to a set of drive data for N electron-emitting devices) are sent out of the shift register 44 as N parallel signals Id1 through Idn.</p>
    <p num="126">
      The line memory 45 is a memory for storing a set of data for a line, which are signals Id1 through Idn, for a required period of time according to control signal Tmry coming from the control circuit 43.
      <br/>
      The stored data are sent out as I'd1 through I'dn and fed to modulation signal generator 47.
    </p>
    <p num="127">Said modulation signal generator 47 is in fact a signal source that appropriately drives and modulates the operation of each of the surface-conduction type electron-emitting devices and output signals of this device are fed to the surface-conduction type electron-emitting devices in the display panel 41 via terminals Doy1 through Doyn.</p>
    <p num="128">
      As described above, an electron-emitting device, to which the present invention is applicable, is characterized by the following features in terms of emission current Ie.
      <br/>
      Firstly, there exists a clear threshold voltage Vth and the device emit electrons only a voltage exceeding Vth is applied thereto.
      <br/>
      Secondly, the level of emission current Ie changes as a function of the change in the applied voltage above the threshold level Vth, although the value of Vth and the relationship between the applied voltage and the emission current may vary depending on the materials, the configuration and the manufacturing method of the electron-emitting device.
      <br/>
      More specifically, when a pulse-shaped voltage is applied to an electron-emitting device according to the invention, practically no emission current is generated so far as the applied voltage remains under the threshold level, whereas an electron beam is emitted once the applied voltage rises above the threshold level.
      <br/>
      It should be noted here that the intensity of an output electron beam can be controlled by changing the peak level Vm of the pulse-shaped voltage.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the total amount of electric charge of an electron beam can be controlled by varying the pulse width Pw.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      Thus, either modulation method or pulse width modulation may be used for modulating an electron-emitting device in response to an input signal.
      <br/>
      With voltage modulation, a voltage modulation type circuit is used for the modulation signal generator 47 so that the peak level of the pulse shaped voltage is modulated according to input data, while the pulse width is held constant.
    </p>
    <p num="130">With pulse width modulation, on the other hand, a pulse width modulation type circuit is used for the modulation signal generator 47 so that the pulse width of the applied voltage may be modulated according to input data, while the peak level of the applied voltage is held constant.</p>
    <p num="131">Although it is not particularly mentioned above, the shift register 44 and the line memory 45 may be either of digital or of analog signal type so long as serial/parallel conversions and storage of video signals are conducted at a given rate.</p>
    <p num="132">
      If digital signal type devices are used, output signal DATA of the synchronizing signal separation circuit 46 needs to be digitized.
      <br/>
      However, such conversion can be easily carried out by arranging an A/D converter at the output of the synchronizing signal separation circuit 46.
      <br/>
      It may be needless to say that different circuits may be used for the modulation signal generator 47 depending on if output signals of the line memory 45 are digital signals or analog signals.
      <br/>
      If digital signals are used, a D/A converter circuit of a known type may be used for the modulation signal generator 47 and an amplifier circuit may additionally be used, if necessary.
      <br/>
      As for pulse width modulation, the modulation signal generator 47 can be realized by using a circuit that combines a high speed oscillator, a counter for counting the number of waves generated by said oscillator and a comparator for comparing the output of the counter and that of the memory.
      <br/>
      If necessary, an amplifier may be added to amplify the voltage of the output signal of the comparator having a modulated pulse width to the level of the drive voltage of a surface-conduction type electron-emitting device according to the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      If, on the other hand, analog signals are used with voltage modulation, an amplifier circuit comprising a known operational amplifier may suitably be used for the modulation signal generator 47 and a level shift circuit may be added thereto if necessary.
      <br/>
      As for pulse width modulation, a known voltage control type oscillation circuit (VCO) may be used with, if necessary, an additional amplifier to be used for voltage amplification up to the drive voltage of surface conduction type electron-emitting device.

    <p num="134">
      With an image forming apparatus having a configuration as described above, to which the present invention is applicable, the electron-emitting devices emit electrons as a voltage is applied thereto by way of the external terminals Dox1 through Doxm and Doy1 through Doyn.
      <br/>
      Then, the generated electron beams are accelerated by applying a high voltage to the metal back 35 or a transparent electrode (not shown) by way of the high voltage terminal Hv.
      <br/>
      The accelerated electrons eventually collide with the fluorescent film 34, which by turn glows to produce images.

    <p num="135">
      The above described configuration of image forming apparatus is only an example to which the present invention is applicable and may be subjected to various modifications.
      <br/>
      The TV signal system to be used with such an apparatus is not limited to a particular one and any system such as NTSC, PAL or SECAM may feasibly be used with it.
      <br/>
      It is particularly suited for TV signals involving a larger number of scanning lines (typically of a high definition TV system such as the MUSE system) because it can be used for a large display panel comprising a large number of pixels.

      Firstly referring to FIG. 13, reference numeral 21 denotes an electron source substrate and reference numeral 24 denotes a surface conduction electron-emitting device arranged on the substrate, whereas reference numeral 26 denotes common wirings Dx1 through Dx10 for connecting the surface conduction electron-emitting devices.
      <br/>
      The electron-emitting devices 22 are arranged in rows along the X-direction (to be referred to as device rows hereinafter) to form an electron source comprising a plurality of device rows, each row having a plurality of devices.
      <br/>
      The surface conduction electron-emitting devices of each device row are electrically connected in parallel with each other by a pair of common wirings so that they can be driven independently by applying an appropriate drive voltage to the pair of common wirings.
      <br/>
      More specifically, a voltage exceeding the electron emission threshold level is applied to the device rows to be driven to emit electrons, whereas a voltage below the electron emission threshold level is applied to the remaining device rows.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, any two external terminals arranged between two adjacent device rows can share a single common wiring.
      <br/>
      Thus, of the common wirings Dx2 through Dx9, Dx2 and Dx3 can share a single common wiring instead of two wirings.

      The image forming apparatus differs from the image forming apparatus with a simple matrix arrangement of FIG. 10 mainly in that the apparatus of FIG. 14 has grid electrodes 27 arranged between the electron source substrate 21 and the face plate 36.

      Note that, however, while stripe-shaped grid electrodes are shown in FIG. 14, the profile and the locations of the electrodes are not limited thereto.

      An Ar laser having a wavelength of 514.5 nm was used for the light source, which produced a light spot with a diameter of about 1  MU m on the surface of the specimen.
    </p>
    <p num="221">
      When the spot was placed on or around the electron-emitting region, a spectrum having peaks in the vicinity of 1,335 cm-1 (P1) and 1,580 cm-1 (P2) was obtained to prove the existence of a carbon film.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 schematically illustrates the spectrum.
      <br/>
      The peaks could be separated by assuming the existence of a third peak in the vicinity of 1,490 cm-1 for the devices of the above Examples and Comparative Examples.
    </p>
    <p num="222">
      Of the peaks, P2 is attributable to electronic transition in the atomic bond of graphite that characterizes the substance, whereas P1 is attributable to a disturbed periodicity in the graphite crystal.
      <br/>
      Thus, while only P2 would appear on a pure graphite single crystal, P1 becomes remarkable if graphite contains a large number of small crystals or it has defective lattice structures.
      <br/>
      As the crystallinity of graphite is reduced, P1 grows further in terms of both the height and the width.
      <br/>
      P1 may shifts its location, reflecting the crystal conditions in the inside.
    </p>
    <p num="223">
      It may be correct to assume that the existence of peaks other than P2 was attributable to the small crystal size of graphite in any of the devices of the above Examples and Comparative Examples.
      <br/>
      In the discussions below, the half width of P1 is used to indicate the crystallinity of graphite for Examples and Comparative Examples because the intensity of light was sufficiently strong at P1.

      P1 showed different profiles inside the gap and behind the gap of the device of Comparative Example 2.

      <br/>
      No significant peak was observed outside the gap in any of the devices of Examples 2 through 5 and the half width of P1 indicated that a crystallinity higher than those of Comparative Examples had been achieved in it.

      For example, the CPU 76 sends control signals to the multiplexer 73 and appropriately selects or combines signals for images to be displayed on the display screen.
      <br/>
      At the same time it generates control signals for the display panel controller 72 and controls the operation of the display apparatus in terms of image display frequency, scanning method (e.g., interlaced scanning or non-interlaced scanning), the number of scanning lines per frame and so on.
    </p>

      On the other hand, the display controller 72 generates control signals for controlling the operation of the drive circuit 71 according to the image signals for the images to be displayed on the display panel 70.
