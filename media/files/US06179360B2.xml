      The bottom panel is designed for resting on a tailgate of a load bed of a vehicle.
      <br/>
      First and second side panels are pivotally coupled to the back panel.
      <br/>
      Each of the side panels is designed for detachable attachment to an adjacent side wall of a vehicle when the tailgate of the vehicle is generally horizontal.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to tailgate attachments and more particularly pertains to a new tailgate attachment for extending the cargo space of a load bed of a vehicle.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The use of tailgate attachments is known in the prior art.
      <br/>
      More specifically, tailgate attachments heretofore devised and utilized are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Known prior art includes U.S. Pat. No. 4,472,639; U.S. Pat. No. 5,154,470; U.S. Pat. No. Des. 327,044; U.S. Pat. No. 4,023,850; U.S. Pat. No. 4,778,213; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,531,773.</p>
    <p num="6">
      While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objectives and requirements, the aforementioned patents do not disclose a new tailgate attachment.
      <br/>
      The inventive device includes a back panel pivotally coupled to a bottom panel.
      <br/>
      The bottom panel is designed for resting on a tailgate of a load bed of a vehicle.
      <br/>
      First and second side panels are pivotally coupled to the back panel.
      <br/>
      Each of the side panels is designed for detachable attachment to an adjacent side wall of a vehicle when the tailgate of the vehicle is generally horizontal.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In these respects, the tailgate attachment according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of extending the cargo space of a load bed of a vehicle.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of tailgate attachments now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new tailgate attachment construction wherein the same can be utilized for extending the cargo space of a load bed of a vehicle.</p>

      The reflectors 41 each have a generally rectangular configuration.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the reflectors 41 are recessed into the outer face 26 of the respective side panel so that the reflectors 41 do not hinder folding of the attachment.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In use, the attachment helps increase the cargo space of the load bed when the bottom panel rests of the tailgate and the back panel is in the raised position and the side panels are in their deployed positions and attached to the side walls of the load bed.
      <br/>
      This positioning of the attachment also prevents items on the load bed from fall off of the tailgate.
      <br/>
      When the tailgate is raised to its closed position, the back and side panels may be folded to their lowered and folded positions so that the attachment does not occupy a large space of the load bed.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      As to a further discussion of the manner of usage and operation of the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above description.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of usage and operation will be provided.
    </p>
    <p num="41">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</p>
