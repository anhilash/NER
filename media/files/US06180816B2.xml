      Influenza viruses cause an infectious disease for which there is no adequate therapeutic agent.
      <br/>
      The disadvantages of existing treatments include the onset of clinical resistance within thirty six hours and the ineffectiveness of the agents against influenza B. Killed influenza virus vaccines have been available for over sixty years.
      <br/>
      However, these vaccines have not lessened the morbidity, mortality or severe financial loss caused by this disease.
      <br/>
      It follows that an agent which treats or prevents an influenza infection or is effective at preventing the clinical symptoms associated with an influenza infection will result in a significant benefit to society.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Currently, the only compounds approved for the therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of influenza infections are the adamantanes: amantadine and rimantadine.
      <br/>
      These compounds inhibit influenza A by inhibiting the function of the M2 ion channel activity of the virus.
      <br/>
      Amantadine is a potent in vitro inhibitor of influenza A virus as demonstrated by standard antiviral assays such as the plaque reduction assay.
      <br/>
      Amantadine is effective in reducing the duration of fever and other systemic complaints including but not limited to myalgia (muscular ache) and fatigue when administered to individuals infected with influenza A within forty-eight hours of the onset of clinical symptoms.
      <br/>
      It has also been observed that amantadine results in a one hundred-fold decrease of virus titer in the nasal washes of human volunteers infected with wild-type influenza virus which correlates with a dramatic decrease in fever score.
      <br/>
      Thus, in vitro influenza inhibition is predictive of useful in vivo effects, i.e. a reduction of the clinical symptoms associated with the influenza infection.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The present invention derives from the fact that influenza is an enveloped virus which dictates that the virus envelope must be fused with the endosomal membrane of the host cell in order to initiate the process of introducing its genetic information into the cell.
      <br/>
      Because this process is common to all enveloped viruses, it is an attractive target for antiviral chemotherapy.
      <br/>
      Examples of envelope viruses which are inhibited according to the present invention include influenza, bovine diarrheal, hepatitis C, tick borne encephalitis and the like.
      <br/>
      The fusion domain of the envelope glycoprotein of influenza, hemagglutinin (HA) has been well-characterized.
      <br/>
      See, White J. M., Annu. Rev. Physiol. vol. 52, pages 675-697 (1990) which is herein incorporated by reference.

    <p num="5">
      Influenza virus HA provides at least two distinct functions: 1) recognition of the host cell receptor, i.e., sialic acid residues on glycoconjugates, and 2) fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane.
      <br/>
      Both functions are essential for the propagation of influenza virus in vitro and in vivo.
      <br/>
      During viral maturation, monomeric HA is inserted into a lipid bilayer, post-translationally modified and oligomerized into a trimer of identical subunits (trimeric HA).
      <br/>
      The infectivity of the progeny virus is contingent upon a site-specific cleavage of HA by host cell protease(s).
      <br/>
      This cleavage results in the formation of two polypeptide chains, HA1 and HA2, which remain associated by non-covalent interactions as well as by an intermolecular and intramolecular disulfide bonds.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It has been established that influenza HA has two functionally relevant conformations.
      <br/>
      One conformation (Form A) exists as a metastable structure at neutral pH and mediates receptor recognition.
      <br/>
      Following receptor mediated binding to the host cell, the virus is transported to the endosomal compartment where it encounters an acidic environment.
      <br/>
      The low pH triggers a dramatic structural rearrangement of HA (Form A) which results in the formation of the other, more stable conformation of HA (Form B).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Form B of HA is required for fusion of the virus envelope with the endosomal membrane.
      <br/>
      It is the structural rearrangement from Form A to Form B of HA that allows the fusion domain of HA to directly interact with the endosomal membrane enabling the release of viral genetic information into the host cell cytoplasm.
      <br/>
      These considerations lend themselves to the development of a strategy for antiviral intervention based on the abrogation of HA-mediated fusion of virus-host membranes.

      As noted above, the compounds of the present invention are useful for inhibiting an envelope virus that undergoes hemagglutinin-mediated fusion with a host cell.
      <br/>
      Thus, the claimed compounds may be used to treat or prevent a viral infection where the virus is an envelope virus that undergoes hemagglutinin-mediated fusion which comprises administering to an virus-infected cell, a cell susceptible to infection or a mammal in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
      <br/>
      The claimed compounds may also be used to inhibit viral replication in an envelope virus that undergoes hemagglutinin-mediated fusion which comprises administering to a virus-infected cell, a cell susceptible to infection or a mammal in need thereof, an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="280">
      The term "effective amount" as used herein, means an amount of a compound of the present invention which is capable of inhibiting the hemagglutinin mediated fusion of the virus with the host cell.
      <br/>
      The inhibition contemplated by the present method includes both therapeutic and prophylactic treatment, as appropriate.
      <br/>
      The specific dose of compound administered according to this invention to obtain therapeutic and/or prophylactic effects will, of course, be determined by the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, for example, the compound administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated and the individual being treated.
      <br/>
      A typical daily dose (administered in single or divided doses) will contain a dosage level of from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg of body weight of an active compound of this invention.
      <br/>
      Preferred daily doses generally will be from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg and ideally from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg.
    </p>
    <p num="281">
      The compounds can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular and intranasal.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the present invention are preferably formulated prior to administration.
      <br/>
      Therefore, another embodiment of the present invention is a pharmaceutical formulation comprising an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient therefor.
    </p>
    <p num="282">
      The active ingredient in such formulations comprises from 0.1% to 99.9% by weight of the formulation.
      <br/>
      By "pharmaceutically acceptable" it is meant that the carrier, diluent or excipient is compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="283">
      The present pharmaceutical formulations are prepared by known procedures using known and readily available ingredients.
      <br/>
      In making the compositions of the present invention, the active ingredient will usually be admixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a carrier which may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container.
      <br/>
      When the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semi-solid or liquid material which acts as a vehicle, excipient or medium for the active ingredient.
      <br/>
      Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols, (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, sterile packaged powders and the like.

    <p num="284">The following experiments were carried out to demonstrate the ability of the compounds of the present invention to inhibit influenza.</p>
    <p num="285">In vitro CPE/XTT Assay</p>
    <p num="286">
      MDCK cells were dispersed in a microtiter plate (96 wells) at 10,000 cells per well with Medium 199 containing Earl's balanced salt solution (EBSS), 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100  MU g/ml).
      <br/>
      After standing overnight at 37 (degree)  C. in a carbon dioxide (CO2) incubator, the MDCK cells were infected with .about 0 (slashed zero) 1 mol (mutiplicity of infection) of influenza virus (i.e. A/Kawasaki/89 or B/Hong Kong and B/Great Lakes) at 0.03 moi. After allowing the virus to adsorb to the cells for 1-2 hours, medium containing serial dilutions of drug or medium alone was added to the wells.
      <br/>
      The resultant mixtures were incubated for 2-3 days (until extensive cpe was apparent in medium alone wells).
      <br/>
      The antiviral effect of a test compound was assessed by performing the following XTT assay.
    </p>
    <p num="287">
      A fresh solution (0.4 mg/ml) of XTT �2,3-bis(methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetraazolium-5-carboxanilide, inner salt, sodium salt� in warm medium without FBS was prepared.
      <br/>
      For each 5 ml of the XTT solution, 25  MU l of 5 mM PMS (phenazine methosulfate) in phosphate buffer saline was added.
      <br/>
      After withdrawing the cultured supernatant, 100  MU l of the freshly prepared XTT/PMS mixture was added to each of the microtiter wells.
      <br/>
      The wells were then incubated at 37 (degree)  C. (under CO2) for 3-4 hours or until color change is prominent.
      <br/>
      The absorbance at 450 nm (ref. 650 nm) was read in a spectrophotometer.
      <br/>
      The concentration of test compound required to cause 50% cytotoxic effect (TC50) relative to a control with no drug and no virus present and which inhibits the development of virus cytopathic effect (cpe) by 50% (IC50) or 90% (IC90) was determined from the linear portion of each dose response curve.
    </p>
    <p num="288">Using this CPE/XTT assay, the IC50 of the compounds of formula I was determined to be less than 0.1  MU g/ml for influenza A/Kawasaki/89 and greater than 100  MU g/ml for influenza B/Lee.</p>
    <p num="289">Plague Reduction Assay</p>
    <p num="290">
      Susceptible MDCK cells were grown in 6 well tissue culture treated cluster plates at 1 * 106 cells/well in Minimum 199 with 1 percent fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100  MU g/ml).
      <br/>
      After overnight incubation at 37 (degree)  C., the growth medium was removed and 0.2 ml/well of an appropriate dilution of virus was added.
      <br/>
      After adsorption for 1-2 hour at room temperature, the infected cell sheet was overlaid with equal parts of 1.5% sterile agarose solution and a twofold concentration of medium 199 (with 2% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin and 100  MU g/ml streptomycin) containing varying concentrations of compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="291">
      The compounds were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 20 mg/ml and an aliquot was diluted to the desired concentration in DMSO and then added to the agar medium mixture.
      <br/>
      The plates were incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37 (degree)  C. until the DMSO control wells contained plaques of optimal size.
      <br/>
      Then, a solution containing 10 percent formalin and 2 percent sodium acetate was added to each well to inactivate the virus and fix the cell sheet to the plastic surface.
      <br/>
      The fixed cell sheets were stained with 0.5 percent crystal violet and the plaques were counted.
      <br/>
      Results from duplicate wells at each concentration were averaged and compared with DMSO control wells.
      <br/>
      The inhibition of plaque formation by 50 or 90 percent (IC50 or IC90) was calculated from the linear region of the inhibition concentration curve using the method of Reed and Muench Am. J. Hyg., vol. 27, pages 493-497 (1958).
    </p>
    <p num="292">Using this plaque reduction assay, the IC50 of the compounds of formula I was determined to be in the range of 0.01-5.9  MU g/ml for influenza A/Kawasaki and was determined to be in the range of 3.3  MU g/ml to 19  MU g/ml for influenza B/Lee.</p>
