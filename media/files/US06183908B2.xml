    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a negative electrode material for a lithium ion nonaqueous electrolyte secondary battery having a high capacity and an improved charge-discharge characteristics and a lithium ion nonaqueous secondary battery using the negative electrode material.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In recent years, the demand for the capacity increase and size reduction of the secondary batteries has been growing with the spread of portable personal computers and portable telephones.
      <br/>
      To this end, the development of lithium ion secondary batteries having a high capacity has been widely made.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      As positive electrode materials for a lithium ion secondary battery there have been widely used LiCoO2, LiCo1-x Nix O2, LiNiO2, and LiMn2 O4 which are positive electrode materials for the secondary battery having a high potential.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, as negative electrode materials there have been normally used carbonaceous materials.
      <br/>
      Such the carbonaceous material acts as an electrode active material which reversibly intercalate and deintercalate lithium ion during charging and discharging and thus constitutes a so-called rocking chair type secondary battery electrochemically connected with a nonaqueous electrolytic solution or solid electrolyte.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Examples of carbonaceous materials to be commonly used as negative electrode materials include graphite-based carbon material, pitch coke, fibrous carbon, and high capacity type soft carbon calcined at a low temperature.
      <br/>
      However, carbonaceous materials are disadvantageous in that they have a low specific gravity of 2.26 (graphite).
      <br/>
      Therefore, if they are used in an amount such that lithium intercalating capacity reaches the stoichiometric limit (372 mAh/g), it is difficult to design the battery capacity as high as desirable.
      <br/>
      As negative electrode active materials having a high capacity density surpassing the carbonaceous materials there have been disclosed negative electrode active materials made of a composite oxide mainly composed of tin oxide in JP-A-6-60867, JP-A-7-220721, JP-A-7-122274, and JP-A-7-288123 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application").
      <br/>
      Processes for preparing these negative electrode active materials are also disclosed in the above cited patents.
    </p>
    <p num="5">These composite oxide negative electrode materials are synthesized by calcining at a high temperature of 1,000 (degree)  C. or more.</p>
    <p num="6">
      However, the foregoing synthesis process has a handling problem in production due to corrosion on the synthesis container.
      <br/>
      Further, the contamination by impurities eluted from the container causes variation of the physical properties of the electrodes.
      <br/>
      The material prepared by a melting method is ground to adjust its particle diameter before use as an active material for the battery.
      <br/>
      However, the material thus ground is liable to wide distribution of particle diameter that can be-a factor for instabilizing the battery performance.
      <br/>
      Further, since the group of particles having such the wide diameter distribution has a relatively small surface area, the effective surface area taking place in the intercalating reaction of lithium ion decreases, reducing the high current charge-discharge (high rate) efficiency and capacity of the battery.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in the melting method, various starting material powders, i.e., metal oxide powders are each melted, and then mixed in the form of dispersion.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is difficult to uniform the metal elements on a molecular basis, making it difficult to uniformilize the composition distribution in the particle.
      <br/>
      There have been an apprehension that such a uniformity problem can affect the stability of charge-discharge characteristics of negative electrode materials.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">In the present invention, a sol-gel method is used to prepare a negative electrode material comprising a composite oxide.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The sol-gel method involves the preparation of a sol, i.e., colloid dispersion before the production of a group of solid particles having properly-controlled particle size and particle size distribution.
      <br/>
      Modern techniques for the production of a sol containing a metal oxide are described in E. Matijevic, "Surface and Colloid Science", Vol. 6, John Wiley and Sons, 1973.
      <br/>
      The production of a metal oxide sol normally involves prolonged heat treatment of a metal salt in the presence of a strong acid such as sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid that causes hydrolysis of the metal salt, resulting in the precipitation of an oxide fine particle.
      <br/>
      As a method for causing gelation of the amorphous metal oxide to be used herein there has been known a process for the preparation of glass by a sol-gel method.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Representative examples of the process for the preparation of glass by a sol-gel method include a process which comprises hydrolyzing a metal alkoxide in the presence of an acid or alkali catalyst to prepare the metal alkoxide gelatinized in the form of sol; a process which comprises adding water to a particulate starting material such as silica to obtain a hydrosol which is then allowed to stand to obtain gel; and a process which comprises adding a particulate starting material to a sol solution of the foregoing hydrolyzate of metal alkoxide to adjust the pH value of the sol close to neutrality so that the sol is subjected to gelation.
      <br/>
      In the case of preparation of glass made of a composite oxide of a plural metals, an alkoxide containing various metal elements and an acid or alkali salt may be subjected to reaction in an aqueous solution in the stoichiometric proportion to give a product which is then pH adjusted in the form of gel.
      <br/>
      The glass fine particle of composite metal oxide thus prepared is a product synthesized by a reaction on a molecular basis and thus has a uniform composition as compared with a product obtained by the melt method.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Another process for the preparation of a fine particle by a sol-gel method comprises forming a sol into droplets at an oil-water interface developed by addition of a surface active agent, and then treating the droplets with an alkali to cause gelation as disclosed in JP-A-64-42316.</p>
    <p num="20">
      In the hydrolysis of a metal alkoxide generally known as sol-gel method, an acidic catalyst is used as a sol-forming catalyst.
      <br/>
      As the gelation catalyst there may be used a basic catalyst.
      <br/>
      Examples of the acidic catalyst include sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, formic acid, propionic acid, benzoic acid, glycolic acid, maleic acid, citric acid, and toluenesulfonic acid.
      <br/>
      In general, the pH value of the reaction system is adjusted to not more than 3 with such the acidic catalyst before sol formation.
      <br/>
      As the basic catalyst for gelation there may be effectively used sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, quaternary ammonium salt, amine, formamide, oxalic acid or the like.
      <br/>
      The basic catalyst may be added in an amount required to adjust the pH value of the reaction system to not less than 7 after hydrolysis.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The composite oxide fine particle formed by a sol-gel method according to the present invention is preferably in the form of sphere for increasing its packing density in the thin electrode material layer to prevent the ambient members from scratching due to the particle.</p>
    <p num="22">
      In order to prepare a spherical particle, an interfacial reaction described in the above described JP-A-64-42316 is preferably employed.
      <br/>
      The size of the spherical particle is preferably from 0.005 to 1.0  MU m, particularly preferably from 0.01 to 0.5  MU m for a primary particle and from 0.1 to 50  MU m, particularly preferably from 0.5 to 10  MU m for a secondary particle (aggregate particle) as calculated in terms of average particle diameter.
      <br/>
      The secondary particle is an aggregate of a fine particle and thus has a great specific surface area for the size thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The fine particle may be in amorphous, tabular, acicular or fibrous form other than spherical form.</p>
    <p num="24">The composite oxide fine particle formed by a sol-gel method according to the present invention preferably has a specific surface area according to a BET method of at least 2 m2 /g, more preferably not less than 5 m2 /g, most preferably not less than 10 m2 /g in order to increase an effective surface area of the particle influencing on the intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ion as an electrode material and thus act efficiently in rapid intercalation/deintercalation reaction (i.e., rapid charge-discharge).</p>
    <p num="25">
      In order to obtain a group of particles having a great BET specific surface area, the composite oxide fine particle of the present invention has a porous surface structure.
      <br/>
      The presence or absence of such a porous structure can be examined by observation of particles under an electron microscope.
      <br/>
      The diameter of micropores in the surface of the porous particles preferably falls within the range of from 10  Angstrom  to 1,000  Angstrom .
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The composite metal oxide to be used as an electrode material for a lithium ion secondary battery synthesized by a sol-gel method according to the present invention has an amorphous structure, which comprises at least one functional element, as a metal, effecting the electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation of lithium ion, selected from the group consisting of tin, lead, germanium and transition metals; and at least one element effective for obtaining amorphous structure selected from the group consisting of aluminum, boron, phosphorus, silicon, elements belonging to the groups I, II, XIII, XIV and XV in the periodic table, and halogen elements.
      <br/>
      The composite metal oxide synthesized by a sol-gel method is incorporated in a negative electrode material for a lithium ion secondary battery (i.e., negative electrode active material or precursor thereof) at least partly, preferably in an amount of not less than 10% by weight based on the weight thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Particularly effective among the foregoing functional elements is tin.
      <br/>
      A preferred example of the composite oxide is a composite oxide containing an amorphous structure which comprises tin as a main component and at least one element selected from the group consisting of elements belonging to the groups I, II, XIII, XIV and XV in the periodic table, transition metal, and halogen elements.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the composite oxide contains an amorphous structure which comprises tin as a main component and at least one element selected from the group consisting of lead, germanium, boron, phosphorus, silicon, aluminum, and elements belonging to the groups I and II in the periodic table.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Particularly preferably, the composite oxide does not contain substantially aluminum, as described hereafter.</p>
    <p num="29">
      The composite metal oxide containing an amorphous structure which comprises tin as a main component preferably has a chemical structure represented by formula (I):
      <br/>
      Snx M11-x M2y O2  (I)
    </p>
    <p num="30">wherein M1 represents at least one element selected from the group consisting of Mn, Fe, Pb and Ge; M2 represents two or more elements selected from the group consisting of Al, B, P, Si, elements belonging to the groups I, II and III in the periodic table, and halogen elements; and x, y and z satisfy the following relationships, 0&lt; *  &lt;= 1, 0.1 &lt;= y &lt;= 3 and 1 &lt;= z  &lt;= 8.</p>
    <p num="31">
      Referring to a more desirable composition according to the foregoing structural formula, M1 is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Pb and Ge, and M2 's are two or more elements selected from the group consisting of B, P, Si, and elements belonging to the groups I and II in the periodic table.
      <br/>
      In particular, M2 's are preferably elements other than Al.
      <br/>
      A material containing Al in a large amount is liable to generate problems such as decrease of capacity as a negative electrode material.
      <br/>
      Further, a material to be calcined by a melt process can be easily contaminated by Al produced by erosion of the material of the calcining container.
      <br/>
      The contamination by Al often has an adverse effect on performance of electrode.
    </p>
    <p num="32">It is known that the tin element contained in the negative electrode material of the present invention has an electronic oxidation-reduction state to three kinds of zero-, di- and tetra-valent elements.</p>
    <p num="33">
      In the present invention, the state of tin contained in the negative electrode material is mainly di-valence or tetra-valence.
      <br/>
      That is, the state of the di-valence or tetra-valence means at least 80% or more (preferably at least 90% or more) of the total amount of tin contained in the negative electrode material is di-valence or tetra-valence.
    </p>
    <p num="34">The valence of tin can be measured by an oxidation-reduction titration method and the Mossbauer spectral analysis method.</p>
    <p num="35">The oxidation-reduction titration method is carried out as follows.</p>
    <p num="36">For example, the composite oxide material is dissolved with an inorganic acid such as sulfuric acid and fluoric acid, the total amount of the dissolved composite oxide material is oxidized with the determined amount of potassium bichromate, and then the residual amount (i.e., the amount of the unreacted potassium bichromate) of the potassium bichromate is subjected to the back-titration with sodium thiosulfate using a starch solution as an indicator.</p>
    <p num="37">
      The foregoing composite oxide of the present invention contains an amorphous structure in its structure or is amorphous.
      <br/>
      The term "containing an amorphous structure" as used herein means that the composite oxide of the present invention has a diffraction scattering zone having a broad peak with a weak intensity in the range of from 20 (degree)  to 40 (degree)  in terms of a 2 THETA  value as determined by X-ray diffractometry with CuK ALPHA  rays.
      <br/>
      This broad-scattering zone may have crystalline diffraction lines.
      <br/>
      This crystalline line reflects a structural portion having a little order in the amorphous structure.
      <br/>
      If crystalline diffraction lines are observed in the range of from 40 (degree)  to 70 (degree)  in terms of a 2 THETA  value, the strongest intensity of these crystalline diffraction lines is preferably not more than 500 times, more preferably not more than 100 times, particularly preferably not more than 5 times that of the peak diffraction line in the foregoing broad scattering-zone observed in the range of from 20 (degree)  to 40 (degree)  in terms of a 2 THETA  value.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, this broad scattering zone has no crystalline diffraction lines.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The composite oxide of the present invention preferably is amorphous.
      <br/>
      However, the amorphous structure produced by a sol-gel method is not completely amorphous but contains a small amount of crystalline components.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the composite oxide of the present invention may contain crystalline components as far as it goes.
    </p>
    <p num="39">

    <p num="46">Representative method for synthesizing the negative electrode material using the water-soluble polymer in the present invention is as follows.</p>
    <p num="47">
      First, a sol of the composite oxide particle containing tin and at least one element selected from the group consisting of elements belonging to the groups I, II, XIII, XIV and XV in the periodic table, transition metal and halogen elements is synthesized by a sol-gel method using a tin-containing compound as a kind of starting material in a solution.
      <br/>
      Second, the obtained sol is added dropwise to an aqueous solution containing a water-soluble polymer while stirring to proceed a sol-reaction in an aqueous solution in which the water-soluble polymer is present as a protective colloid.
      <br/>
      As a result, a granular gel comprising a tin-composite oxide (i.e., a tin-containing composite oxide) is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="48">Then, by heat-drying the obtained gel, the composite metal oxide particle containing an amorphous structure which comprises tin as a main component and at least one element selected from the group consisting of elements belonging to the groups I, II, XIII, XIV and XV in the periodic table, transition metal, and halogen elements is synthesized as the negative electrode material.</p>

      <br/>
      Representative among these materials are hydrolyzate of tetraethoxysilane and tetraethoxysilane from the standpoint of storage stability.

      Examples of tin starting materials which can be used herein include diethoxytin, dimethoxytin, tetraethoxytin, tetramethoxytin, and tetrapropoxytin.

      The negative electrode material in the form of gel synthesized according to the present invention is heated and dried so that it is dehydrated.

      The heating and drying treatment is normally effected at a temperature of from 200 (degree)  C. to 400 (degree)  C., preferably in an atmosphere of inert gas such as nitrogen and argon, for 1 to 3 days.
      <br/>
      By controlling the atmosphere (partial oxygen pressure, pressure, etc.) in which the drying is effected, the properties (e.g., oxidizability, reducibility) of the final product as a negative electrode material can be improved.

      <br/>
      The length of the negative electrode sheet was predetermined such that the sheet can be housed in the battery can in view of the thickness thereof.

      92% by weight of LiCoO2 as a positive electrode active material, 3% by weight of acetylene black, 3% by weight of a water dispersion of a polytetrafluoroethylene, 1% by weight of sodium polyacrylate and 1% by weight of sodium bicarbonate as binders, and water as a medium were kneaded to obtain a slurry.
      <br/>
      The slurry thus obtained was applied to a 20  MU m thick aluminum foil on both sides thereof by the same method as used above, and then dried.
      <br/>
      The coated aluminum foil was pressed, and then cut.
      <br/>
      As a result, a belt-like positive electrode sheet having an electrode material mixture thickness of 220  MU m was prepared.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      A nickel lead plate and an aluminum lead plate were then spot-welded to an end of the foregoing negative electrode sheet and positive electrode sheet, respectively.
      <br/>
      These sheets were then subjected to dehydration and drying at 230 (degree)  C. in dried air having a dew point of not higher than -40 (degree)  C. for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      The positive electrode sheet (8) thus dehydrated and dried, a microporous polypropylene film separator, the negative electrode sheet (9) thus dehydrated and dried, and a separator (10) were then laminated in this order.
      <br/>
      The laminate was the spirally wound by a winding machine.
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      The wound element thus obtained was then inserted in a closed-end cylindrical nickel-plated iron battery can (11) which also serves as a negative electrode terminal.
      <br/>
      A 1 mol/l LiPF6 solution (in a 2:8 (by volume) mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate) was then injected into the battery can as an electrolyte.
      <br/>
      The open end of the battery can was then cramped on a battery lid (12) having a positive electrode terminal with a gasket (13) provided interposed therebetween to prepare a cylindrical battery.
      <br/>
      The positive electrode terminal (12) and the battery can (11) had previously been connected to the positive electrode sheet (8) and the negative electrode sheet (9), respectively, via a lead terminal.

      The properties of the battery thus prepared are shown in Table 2.
      <br/>
      As is apparent from the results in Table 2, the negative electrode sheet comprising the spherical particulate negative material F of the present invention exhibits an enhanced packing density of negative material as compared with the negative electrode sheet comprising the comparative negative electrode material.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the negative electrode material of the-present invention is applied in the same amount and manner as the comparative negative electrode material, its layer thickness can be reduced.
      <br/>
      As a result, the maximum length of the electrode which can be inserted into the battery can could be increased.
