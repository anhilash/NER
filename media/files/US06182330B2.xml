    <heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 60/066,208, filed Nov. 20, 1997.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a hinge assembly for rotatably coupling first and second members together, and more particularly, to a position holding, self-latching hinge for holding first and second members at any specified angle of rotation relative to each other and which provides an additional latching force at a specified angle of rotation.</p>
    <p num="3">
      In certain hinge applications, it is often desirable to control the angular position of a first member which is rotatably coupled to a second member by using the hinge itself for both rotatable coupling and positional control.
      <br/>
      One such application is for the field of laptop, notebook and palmtop computers in order to allow a user to rotatably position the liquid crystal display screen at a selected ergonomic viewing angle.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In a notebook computer, the liquid crystal display is typically connected to one side of a friction hinge assembly and the base of the computer is connected to the other side.
      <br/>
      The display is held in any angular position by frictional torque generated by the hinge.
      <br/>
      One preferred hinge arrangement is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,874, which is assigned to the assignee of the present application and which is incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The presently known notebook computers generally include some form of latching mechanism.
      <br/>
      For example, a pair of latching mechanisms 11 can be located at the sides of the display 17, as shown in FIG. 1, or a single latching mechanism 14 can be located at the top of the display 17, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      These latching mechanisms are required in order to maintain a minimum gap between the display 17 and the processor housing 18 of the computer 10 at all times during storage and transportation to prevent inadvertent opening of the display 17.
      <br/>
      When the computer display 17 is rotated downwardly to the closed position, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, either the pair of side latching elements 11 are engaged in receiving slots 12 shown in FIG. 1, or the front latching element 18 is engaged in the receiving slot 15 shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In order to open the computer display 17, the user must either slide both latching elements 11 toward the front or rear of the computer while rotating the display counterclockwise, as indicated in FIG. 3, or unlatch the latching mechanism 18 by pressing downwardly or inwardly to release the mechanism 18 while rotating the display upwardly, as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      In both cases, the user must actuate one or more latching mechanisms prior to opening the display.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One problem with the known latches is that they are easily broken and have a relatively short life.
      <br/>
      This often means that broken latches must be replaced by the manufacturer or the purchaser one or more times during the notebook computer's life.
      <br/>
      Additionally, due to the larger size display screens which are becoming available for computers, it would be desirable to eliminate the need for latches either at the sides or center of the display in order to utilize that space for a larger display without the need for increasing the overall size of the computer housing.
      <br/>
      Additionally, it would be beneficial to decrease the complexity and cost of the display bezel by eliminating the need for separate latch mechanisms altogether.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      Briefly stated, the present invention provides a self-latching hinge for rotatably coupling a first member to a second member.
      <br/>
      The hinge comprises a hinge housing connected to one of the first and second members.
      <br/>
      A shaft is rotatably disposed in the hinge housing, with the shaft being connected to the other of the first and second members.
      <br/>
      A cam is located on the shaft.
      <br/>
      A rotatable roller is located in the housing adjacent to the cam such that as the shaft is rotated, the cam contacts and rotates the roller.
      <br/>
      Contact between the roller and the cam at a specified angle of rotation causes interference between the roller and the cam to create an increased latching torque which must be overcome for movement of the shaft.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In another aspect, the present invention provides a self-latching hinge for rotatably coupling a first member to a second member.
      <br/>
      The hinge comprises a hinge housing connected to the first member and a shaft rotatably disposed in the hinge housing.
      <br/>
      The shaft is connected to the second member.
      <br/>
      A cam is located on the shaft, and the cam includes an outer surface having a plurality of projections.
      <br/>
      A rotatable roller is located in the hinge housing such that as the shaft is rotated the cam contacts and rotates the roller.
      <br/>
      Contact between the roller and the cam at a specified angle of rotation causes interference between the roller and at least one of the plurality of projections on the cam to create an increased latching torque which must be overcome for movement of the shaft.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In another aspect, the present invention provides a portable computer which includes a display housing, a processor housing, and a hinge pivotably connecting the display housing to the processor housing.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      A shaft is rotatably disposed in the hinge housing.
      <br/>
      The shaft is connected to the other of the processor housing and the display housing.
      <br/>
      A frictional torque applying element is located in the housing for applying frictional torque to the shaft as the shaft is rotated.
      <br/>
      A cam is located on the shaft.
      <br/>
      A rotatable roller is located in the housing such that as the shaft is rotated the cam contacts and rotates the roller.
      <br/>
      Contact between the roller and the cam at a specified angle of rotation causes interference between the roller and the cam to create an increased latching torque which must be overcome for movement of the shaft.

      However, it will be recognized by those skilled in the art from the present disclosure that the frictional torque applying elements 36a-36d can be manufactured from other materials, such as stainless steel, other suitable metals, or polymeric materials, such as reinforced engineering plastics.
      <br/>
      While in the preferred embodiment four frictional torque applying elements 36a-d are used, it will be recognized by those skilled in the art that more or less frictional torque applying elements 36a-d may be used, if desired in order to apply a greater or lesser frictional torque, as needed.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      It will also be recognized by those skilled in the art from the present disclosure that the frictional elements 36a-d may be arranged so as to produced equal frictional torque in both directions of rotation.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished by alternating the orientation of the frictional elements 36a-36d, as is understood by those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Different frictional torques can be created on the shaft 30 depending on the direction of rotation by having a majority or all of the friction elements oriented in the same direction, with greater frictional torque being produced in the self-braking direction of rotation (counterclockwise in FIG. 7 based on the orientation of the friction element 36a) as compared to when the shaft 30 is rotated in the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring now to FIGS. 5, 6, 9 and 11, a cam 40 is located on the shaft 30.
      <br/>
      The cam 40 is generally cylindrical in shape and rotates about the axis 31 with the shaft 30.
      <br/>
      As shown in detail in FIG. 11, preferably the cam 40 has an outer surface 42 defined by radii which vary circumferentially to a point of maximum outer surface displacement 44.
      <br/>
      The point of maximum outer surface displacement 44 is preferably located at a specified angle of rotation between the first and second members 22, 24, which are preferably the processor or display housings 22, 24, such that the first and second members 22, 24 are held in a closed position, as explained in detail below.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Referring to FIG. 11, the outer cylindrical surface 42 of the cam 40 varies in radius from the rotational axis 31 such that the upper 180 (degree)  segment 46 has a generally constant radius while the lower 180 (degree)  segment contains tapered cylindrical surfaces 48, 49 that continue to an extended semi-cylindrical section 50.
      <br/>
      The extended semi-cylindrical section 50 preferably also includes tapered cylindrical surfaces 52, 53 which extend to the point of maximum outer surface displacement 44.
      <br/>
      However, it will be recognized by those skilled in the art from the present disclosure that the configuration of the cam 40 can be varied to any desired shape which includes an area of maximum protrusion which is adapted to be located at a specified angle of rotation between the first and second members 22, 24 such that the first and second members 22, 24 are held in a closed position, as explained below.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Preferably, the cam 40 and the shaft 30 are made as a unitary structure and are machined from steel or stainless steel.
      <br/>
      However, it will recognized by those skilled in the art from the present disclosure that other suitable metallic or polymeric materials having the desired strength can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      As shown in FIG. 8, preferably the end of the shaft 30 opposite to the friction elements 36a-d is supported by a bushing 38 pressed into an opening 39 in an end support of the hinge housing 26.
      <br/>
      This prevents the shaft 30 from being deflected as the self-latching hinge 20 is used.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Referring to FIGS. 5, 6, 9 and 10, a rotatable roller 60 is located in the housing 26 adjacent to the cam 40 such that as the shaft 30 is rotated the cam 40 contacts and rotates the roller 60.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the roller 60 is located in a cavity 62 in the housing 26.
      <br/>
      The cavity 62 has an opening 64 adjacent to the cam 40.
      <br/>
      Contact between the roller 60 and the cam 40 at a specified angle of rotation causes interference between the roller 60 and the cam 40 to create an increased latching torque which must be overcome for movement of the shaft 30.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In the preferred embodiment, the roller 60 is made of a polymeric material which deflects upon interference between the roller 60 and the cam 40.
      <br/>
      The roller 60 preferably also includes a recess 66 which is located in a complementary position to the point of maximum outer surface displacement 44 on the outer surface 42 of the cam 40.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Preferably, the cavity 62 has a longitudinal axis 68 which coincides with the longitudinal axis of the roller 60, and the cavity 62 is sized to allow the roller 60 to rotate within the cavity 62.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the longitudinal axis 68 of the cavity 62 is generally parallel to the axis 31 of the shaft 30.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Referring now to FIGS. 12a-12c, the interaction of the cam 40 and the roller 60 during latching is shown.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 12a, the cam 40 is rotated without contacting the roller 40 to the position shown, where the cam 40 just engages by the roller 60.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the cam 40 is aligned with the recess 66.
      <br/>
      As the second member 24 is closed relative to the first member 22, the extended cylindrical section 50 which includes the point of maximum outer surface displacement 44 engages the roller 60 and drives the roller 60 in a counterclockwise direction in the cylindrical cavity 62.
      <br/>
      The roller 60 and the cam 40 are sized such that the extended cylindrical section 50 with the maximum outer surface displacement 44 on the cam 40 rotates into the recess 66 in the roller 60, as shown in FIG. 12b, and compresses the roller 60 in the area of the recess 66 to a point of maximum deflection at the position shown in FIG. 12b. As the cam 40 continues moving in the clockwise direction for the latched position shown in FIG. 12c, the pressure exerted by the extended cylindrical section 50 on the roller 60 is relieved and the roller 60 is allowed to expand in the contact area as the second member 24, preferably the display 24, comes to a closed position with respect to the first member 22, which is preferably the processor housing 22.
      <br/>
      Only a portion of the tapered cylindrical surface 53 remains in contact with the roller 60 such that the surface pressure exerted by the cam 40 on the roller 60 is less than the maximum allowable load for elastic deflection of the polymeric material used to make the roller 60.
      <br/>
      Thus, even if the self-latching hinge is closed for an extended period of time, no permanent deformation occurs on the outside surface of the roller 60.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In order to open the self-latching hinge 20, the cam 40 is rotated in the opposite (counterclockwise) direction forcing the clockwise rotation of the roller 60 such that the recess 66 returns to the angular position shown in FIG. 12a. Once the cam 40 has been rotated sufficiently, it no longer is engaged with the roller 60 and the latching torque drops to zero.
      <br/>
      As shown, the latching action of the self-latching hinge 20 is only active during the final 30-45 (degree)  of closure of the self-latching hinge 20.
    </p>
    <p num="27">FIGS. 13a, b and c correspond generally to FIGS. 12a, b and c and show the display housing 24 of the portable computer 21 being closed against the processor housing 22 with the self-latching hinge 20 acting as a latch for holding the display housing 24 in a closed position relative to the processor housing 22.</p>
    <p num="28">
      Referring now to FIG. 14, a second embodiment of a self-latching hinge 120 is illustrated schematically.
      <br/>
      The second embodiment 120 is identical to the first embodiment except for the configuration of the cam 140 and the roller 160.
      <br/>
      In the second embodiment of the self-latching hinge 120, the cam 140 includes a plurality of projections 150 and the roller 160 includes a corresponding number of parallel recesses 166.
      <br/>
      As the cam 140 is rotated relative to the roller 160, the projections 150 engage the corresponding recesses 166 in the roller 160 and cause a multi-step latching which can hold the self-latching hinge in a plurality of "latched" positions where the projections 150 contact the roller 160 but no projection is in a position where it applies a maximum force against a recess 166 in the roller 160, similar to the position shown in FIG. 12b.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Preferably, as shown in FIGS. 13a-13c, the self-latching hinges of the present invention 20, 120 are used in conjunction with the portable computer 21 for holding the display housing 24 in a closed position relative to the processor housing 22.
      <br/>
      This eliminates the need for a separate latching element, as in the prior art portable computers shown in FIGS. 1-4 which allows the display housing 24 to be made more compactly or allows a larger display to be used.
