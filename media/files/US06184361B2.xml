    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Many of the procedures presently conducted in the field of nuclear medicine involve radiopharmaceuticals which provide diagnostic images of blood flow (perfusion) in the major organs and in tumors.
      <br/>
      The regional uptake of these radiopharmaceuticals within the organ of interest is proportional to flow; high flow regions will display the highest concentration of radiopharmaceutical, while regions of little or no flow have relatively low concentrations.
      <br/>
      Diagnostic images showing these regional differences are useful in identifying areas of poor perfusion, but do not provide metabolic information of the state of the tissue within the region of apparently low perfusion.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      There is a need for new radiopharmaceuticals which specifically localize in hypoxic tissue, i.e., tissue which is deficient in oxygen, but still viable.
      <br/>
      These compounds should be retained in regions which are hypoxic, but should not be retained in regions which are normoxic.
      <br/>
      A radiopharmaceutical with these properties will display relatively high concentrations in such hypoxic regions, with low concentrations in normoxic and infarcted regions.
      <br/>
      Diagnostic image with this radiopharmaceutical should readily allow the identification of tissue which is at risk of progressing to infarction, but still salvagable in, for example, the heart and brain.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      It is well known that tumors often have regions within their mass which are hypoxic.
      <br/>
      These result when the rapid growth of the tumor is not matched by the extension of tumor vasculature.
      <br/>
      A radiopharmaceutical which localizes preferentially within regions of hypoxia could also be used to provide images which are useful in the diagnosis and management of therapy of tumors as suggested by Champman, "Measurement of Tumor Hypoxia by Invasive and Non-Invasive Procedures--A Review of Recent Clinical Studies", Radiother.
      <br/>
      Oncol., 20(S1), 13-19 (1991).
      <br/>
      Additionally, a compound which localizes within the hypoxic region of tumors, but is labeled with a radionuclide with suitable  ALPHA - or  BETA -emissions could be used for the internal radiotherapy of tumors.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      As reported by Martin et al. ("Enhanced Binding of the Hypoxic Cell Marker �3 H� Fluoro-misonidazole", J. Nucl. Med., Vol. 30, No. 2, 194-201 (1989)) and Hoffman et al. ("Binding of the Hypoxic Tracer �H-3� Misonidazole in Cerebral Ischemia", Stroke, Vol. 18, 168 (1987)), hypoxia-localizing moieties, for example, hypoxia-mediated nitroheterocyclic compounds (e.g., nitroimidazoles and derivatives thereof) are known to be retained in hypoxic tissue.
      <br/>
      In the brain or heart, hypoxia typically follows ischemic episodes produced by, for example, arterial occlusions or by a combination of increased demand and insufficient flow.
      <br/>
      Additionally, Koh et al., ("Hypoxia Imaging of Tumors Using �F-18�Fluoronitroimidazole", J. Nucl. Med., Vol. 30, 789 (1989)) have attempted diagnostic imaging of tumors using a nitroimidazole radiolabeled with 18 F. A nitroimidazole labeled with 123 I has been proposed by Biskupiak et al. ("Synthesis of an (iodovinyl)misonidazole derivative for hypoxia imaging", J. Med. Chem., Vol. 34, No. 7, 2165-2168 (1991)) as a radiopharmaceutical suitable for use with single-photon imaging equipment.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      While the precise mechanism for retention of hypoxia-localizing compounds is not known, it is believed that nitroheteroaromatic compounds, such as misonidazole, undergo intracellular enzymatic reduction (for example, J. D. Chapman, "The Detection and Measurement of Hypoxic Cells in Tumors", Cancer, Vol. 54, 2441-2449 (1984)).
      <br/>
      This process is believed to be reversible in cells with a normal oxygen partial pressure, but in cells which are deficient in oxygen, further reduction can take place.
      <br/>
      This leads to the formation of reactive species which bind to or are trapped as intracellular components, providing for preferential entrapment in hypoxia cells.
      <br/>
      It is necessary, therefore, for hypoxia imaging compounds to possess certain specific properties; they must be able to traverse cell membranes, and they must be capable of being reduced, for example, by reductases such as xanthine oxidase.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The hypoxia imaging agents mentioned above are less than ideal for routine clinical use.
      <br/>
      For example, the positron-emitting isotapes (such as 18 F) are cyclotron-produced and short-lived, thus requiring that isotope production, radiochemical synthesis, and diagnostic imaging be performed at a single site or region.
      <br/>
      The costs of procedures based on positron-emitting isotopes are very high, and there are very few of these centers worldwide.
      <br/>
      While 123 I-radiopharmaceuticals may be used with widely-available gamma camera imaging systems, 123 I has a 13 hour half-life (which restricts the distribution of radiopharmaceuticals based on this isotope) and is expensive to produce.
      <br/>
      Nitroimidazoles labeled with 3 H are not suitable for in vivo clinical imaging and can be used for basic research studies only.

      The preferred radioisotope for medical imaging is 99m Tc.
      <br/>
      Its 140 keV  GAMMA -photon is ideal for use with widely-available gamma cameras.
      <br/>
      It has a short (6 hour) half life, which is desirable when considering patient dosimetry. 99m Tc is readily available at relatively low cost through commercially-produced 99 Mo/99m Tc generator systems.
      <br/>
      As a result, over 80% of all radionuclide imaging studies conducted worldwide utilize this radioisotope.
      <br/>
      To permit widespread use of a radio-pharmaceutical for hypoxia imaging, it is necessary that the compound be labeled with 99m Tc.

      Although these complexes are believed to be useful for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, it would be desirable to obtain higher levels of the rhenium or technetium radionuclide in the targeted area, than are achieved with this class of capped-dioxime nitroimidazole complexes.
      <br/>
      It was demonstrated that the compounds disclosed in EP 411,491 possess reduction potentials similar to 2-nitroimidazole derivatives known to localize in hypoxic regions.

      In addition, the complexes described in EP 411,491 require a heating step to form the hypoxia-localizing radiolabeled compounds.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="29">
      It has now been found that metal complexes having a permeability through cell membranes greater than that of 14 C-sucrose provide enhanced products when linked to a hypoxia localizing moiety.
      <br/>
      Depending upon the metal used, complexes employing such hypoxia-localizing moiety-containing ligands are useful as imaging agents, therapeutic agents, radiosensitizers and hypoxic tissue cytotoxins.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Cell permeability is a property of a cell membrane which describes the mobility of extraneous molecules (permeants) within the internal structure of the membrane (W. D. Stein, "Transport and Diffusion Across Cell Membrane", New York Academic Press Inc. (1986); A. Kotyk, K. Janacek, J. Koryta, Biophysical Chemistry of Membrane Functions, Chichester, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons, (1988)).
      <br/>
      Molecules to which the membrane is permeable are able to penetrate through the membrane to reach the environment on the opposite side.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The examples which follow utilize a model of cell permeability based on the studies of Audus and Borchardt ("Bovine Brain Microvessel Endothelial Cell Monolayers as a Model System for the Blood-Brain Barrier", Ann.
      <br/>
      New York Accad.
      <br/>
      Sci., 1988; 9-18). the model consists of a cultured monolayer of bovine brain endothelial cells, which form tight intercellular junctions.
      <br/>
      Transit of compounds across the monolayer reflects the ability of such compounds to cross the intact cell membrane by passive, active and/or facilitated diffusion mechanisms.
      <br/>
      The rate of transit is compared with 3 H2 O (a highly permeable tracer) and 14 C-sucrose (a non-permeable tracer).
      <br/>
      As discussed above, in accordance with the present invention, it has been found that complexes containing a hypoxia localizing moiety and having cell permeability greater than that of sucrose provide benefits to diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures employing such complexes.
    </p>
    <p num="32">The present complexes, when used with a radioactive metal, provide levels of radionuclide within hypoxic tissue sufficient to enhance diagnostic and therapeutic methods employing such complexes.</p>

      Any radioactive metal can be employed in the present complexes, for example, technetium or rhenium for the complexes of Ib', and technetium for the complexes of Ia'. Rhenium includes Re-186 and Re-188 radionuclides and mixtures thereof, and may also include Re-185 and Re-187.
      <br/>
      Technetium includes Tc-99m, Tc-94m and Tc-96.

    <p num="37">
      Complexes of the present invention have not been heretofore disclosed and are useful in that they utilize the properties of the hypoxia localizing group to provide imaging or treatment of hypoxic tissue at a particular site.
      <br/>
      The complexes of the present invention wherein M is technetium provide highly effective, relatively easy to use diagnostic imaging products which are characterized by a covalent bond between the radionuclide complex and the hypoxia localizing group while substantially retaining the retention properties of the free hypoxia localizing group.
      <br/>
      It can be appreciated that typical examples of diagnostic uses for the complexes of the present invention when M is technetium include, but are not limited to, imaging of hypoxic tissue, present under pathological conditions in e.g., the heart, brain, lungs, liver, kidneys or in tumors.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In addition to being useful in imaging hypoxic tissue, the present complexes can also be used as blood flow markers, i.e., for perfusion imaging.
      <br/>
      The initial distribution of the novel complexes is proportional to blood flow and therefore imaging carried out soon after administration is an indicator of perfusion.
      <br/>
      A short time later, as the present complexes wash out of the normoxic tissue but are retained in the hypoxic tissue, imaging of the hypoxic tissue is realized.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Additionally, the present invention provides stably bound complexes when M is Re for radio-therapeutic indications.
      <br/>
      To the extent that hypoxic tissue is known to be present in tumors, Re complexes of the present invention are suitable for radiotherapy.
      <br/>
      The compounds of this invention when M is Re for use in radiotherapy can be injected into humans and concentrate in hypoxic tissue.
      <br/>
      This allows for the targeting of radionuclides to the desired sites with great specificity.
      <br/>
      It is understood, however, that radiotherapy will only be possible in those areas where a sufficient quantity of hypoxic tissue is present so as to provide therapeutic levels of rhenium to the area needing treatment.

      Examples of hypoxia localizing groups are hypoxia-mediated nitro-heterocyclic groups, (i.e., nitro-heterocyclic groups that can be trapped by hypoxia-mediated reduction of the nitro moiety).

      These compounds comprise a nitro-heterocyclic group which may include a sidechain, (A)p, which can serve as the linking group connecting the nitro-heterocyclic portion to the rest of the complex of formula I of this invention.

      The references, above, regarding hypoxia localizing moieties serve to illustrate that the present thinking in the art is that the reduction potential of the nitro-heterocyclic group directly affects its retention in hypoxic tissue.

      All of the examples and the process description below where M is rhenium involve the use of "carrier rhenium" except as otherwise noted.
      <br/>
      The phrase "carrier rhenium" means that the rhenium compounds used contain non-radioactive rhenium at concentrations of &gt;10-7 M.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      Preparation of the complexes of this invention where M is rhenium can be accomplished using rhenium in the +5 or +7 oxidation state.
      <br/>
      Examples of compounds in which rhenium is in the Re(VII) state are NH4 ReO4 or KReO4.
      <br/>
      Re(V) is available as, for example, �ReOCl4 �(NBu4), �ReOCl4 �(AsPh4), ReOCl3 (PPh3)2 and as ReO2 (pyridine)4. Other rhenium reagents known to those skilled in the art can also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      Preparation of the complexes of this invention wherein M is technetium can best be accomplished using technetium in the form of the pertechnetate ion.
      <br/>
      For Tc-99m, the pertechnetate ion can best be obtained from commercially available technetium-99m parent-daughter generators; such technetium is in the +7 oxidation state.
      <br/>
      The generation of the pertechnetate ion using this type of generator is well known in the art, and is described in more detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,369,121 and 3,920,995.
      <br/>
      These generators are usually eluted with saline solution and the pertechnetate ion is obtained as the sodium salt.
      <br/>
      Pertechnetate can also be prepared from cyclotron-produced radioactive technetium using procedures well known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      The formation of the technetium complexes proceeds best if a mixture of pertechnetate ion in normal saline is mixed with the appropriate ligand containing at least one R group of the form --(A)p --R2 where (A)p is a linking group and R2 is a hypoxia-localizing moiety.
      <br/>
      An appropriate buffer or physiologically acceptable acid or base may be used to adjust the pH to a value suitable for labeling the ligand.
      <br/>
      This will vary dependent upon the nature of the ligand; for example, for ligands of type Ia, a pH in the range between .about.5.5 to .about.9.5 should be used, and preferably a pH value in the range 7.0-8.5. For ligands of the type IIb, a pH value in the range 3-8 should be used, with a pH of .about.6.0 being preferred.
      <br/>
      A source of reducing agent is then added to bring the pertechnetate down to the oxidation state of Tc(V) for chelation with the ligand.
      <br/>
      Stannous ion is the preferred reducing agent, and may be introduced in the form of a stannous salt such as stannous chloride, stannous fluoride, stannous tartrate, stannous diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid or stannous citrate, but other suitable reducing agents are known in the art.
      <br/>
      The reaction is preferably run in an aqueous or aqueous/alcohol mixture, at or about room temperature, using a reaction time of about 1 minute to about 1 hour.
      <br/>
      The reducing agent should be present at a concentration of 5-50  MU g/ml.
      <br/>
      The ligand should optimally be present in a concentration of 0.5-2 mg/ml.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      Alternatively, the technetium complexes of this invention van be prepared by ligand exchange.
      <br/>
      A labile Tc(V) complex is prepared by the reduction of TcO4- in the presence of a ligand which forms a labile technetium complex, such as mannitol, the hydroxycarboxylate ligands glucoheptonate, gluconate, citrate, malate or tartrate at a pH value that is appropriate for the exchange ligand in question (usually 5-8).
      <br/>
      A reducing agent such as the stannous salts described above is added, which causes the formation of a labile reduced complex of Tc with the exchange ligand.
      <br/>
      This reduced Tc complex is then mixed with the ligand containing --(A)p --R2 at an appropriate pH value (as described above).
      <br/>
      The labile exchange ligand is displaced from the metal by the ligand containing the hypoxia-localizing moiety, thus forming the desired technetium complexes of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      It is convenient to prepare the complexes of this invention at, or near, the site where they are to be used.
      <br/>
      A single, or multi-vial kit that contains all of the components needed to prpare the complexes of this invention (other than the Rhenium or Technetium ion) is an integral part of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      A single-vial kit would contain ligand, a source of stannous salt, or other pharmaceutically acceptable reducing agent, and be appropriately buffered with pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base to adjust the pH to a value as indicated above.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the kit contents be in the lyophilized form.
      <br/>
      Such a single vial kit may optionally contain exchange ligands such as glucoheptonate, gluconate, mannitol, malate, citric or tartaric acid and can also contain reaction modifiers, such as diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid or ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid.
      <br/>
      Additional additives, such as solubilizers (for example  ALPHA -,  BETA - or  GAMMA -cyclodextrin), antioxidants (for example ascorbic acid), fillers (for example, NaCl) may be necessary to improve the radiochemical purity and stability of the final product, or to aid in the production of the kit.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      A multi-vial kit could contain, in one vial, the ingredients except pertechnetate that are required to form a labile Tc(V) complex as described above.
      <br/>
      The quantity and type of ligand, buffer pH and amount and type of reducing agent used would depend highly on the nature of the exchange complex to be formed.
      <br/>
      The proper conditions are well known to those that are skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Pertechnetate is added to this vial, and after waiting an appropriate period of time, the contents of this vial are added to a second vial that contains a source of the ligand containing the hypoxia-localizing moiety, as well as buffers appropriate to adjust the pH to its optimal value.
      <br/>
      After a reaction time of about 1 to 60 minutes, the complexes of the present invention are formed.
      <br/>
      It is advantageous that the contents of both vials of this multi-vial kit be lyophilized.
      <br/>
      As described for the single vial kit, additional additives may be necessary to improve the radiochemical purity and stability of the final product, or to aid in the production of the kit.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      Alternatively, the multi-vial kit may contain a source of ligand containing the hypoxia localizing moiety in one vial and a source of stannous ion in the second vial.
      <br/>
      Pertechnetate is added to the vial containing ligand, and then the contents of the second vial are added to initiate labeling.
      <br/>
      As above, the quantity and type of ligand, buffer pH and reducing agent used would depend on the nature of the hypoxia-localizing ligand and reducing agent used.

      Again, it is advantageous that the contents of both vials be lyophilized.

    <p num="243">Determination of Reduction Potential</p>
    <p num="244">
      The reduction potentials of misonidazole, 99 TcO(PnAO), and 99 Tc-hypoxia-localizing tracers were determined by cyclic voltammetry (C.V.) in dimethylformamide. C.V. experiments employed a Princeton Applied Research (P.A.R.) Model 174A Polarographic Analyzer with a Model 303 static Mercury Drop Electrode and were recorded on a Model RE0074 X-Y Recorder.
      <br/>
      The reference electrode was Ag/AgNO3 with an acetonitrile filling solution saturated with LiCl.
      <br/>
      The counter electrode was a platinum wire.
      <br/>
      Voltammograms at mercury were determined at scan rates of 50, 100, 200, and 500 mV/s.
    </p>
    <p num="245">
      The solutions used in C.V. studies contained test sample at a concentration of 0.2-0.7 mM and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4 NBF4) or tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4 NPF6) supporting electrolyte at a concentration of 0.1M. The solution was deoxygenated by bubbling solvent-saturated nitrogen or argon through the solution for 15 minutes.
      <br/>
      Variations in the reference potential were accounted for by determining the C.V. of a Ru(acac)3 standard on a daily basis.
      <br/>
      All measured potentials were corrected according to an absolute peak reduction potential for Ru(acac)3 of -1.210 V vs. Ag/AgNO3 at Hg.
      <br/>
      The results are shown in the table below:

      These results demonstrate that both the ligands of this invention and the technetium complexes thereof are reduced electrochemically at potentials that are similar to that of the bioreducible 2-nitro-imidazole compound misonidazole, and are thus expected to undergo bioreduction in vivo.
      <br/>
      In contrast, electrochemical reduction of the non-nitroimidazole control Tc(V) Oxo 3,3,9,9-tetra-methyl-4-8-diazaundecane-2,10-dione-dioxime (TcO(PnAO) prepared by the method of Jurisson et al., Inorg. Chem., 1986, 25, 543) occurred at a potential that was far more negative than that of the first reduction wave observed for the compound of Example 6

    <p num="248">EXAMPLE 8a</p>
    <p num="249">Demonstration of Efficacy: Reduction of the Tc Nitroimidazole Complexes by Xanthine Oxidase</p>
    <p num="250">
      The enzyme xanthine oxidase (in the presence of xanthine or hypoxanthine) is known to reduce the nitro group of such nitroimidazole-containing compounds as misonidazole and metronidazole (see for example P. D. Josephy, B. Palcic and L. D. Skarsgard, "Reduction of Misonidazole and its Derivatives by Xanthine Oxidase", Biochem.
      <br/>
      Pharmacol., 1981, 30, 849), and it has been postulated that such nitro reduction under anaerobic conditions is responsible for the selective trapping of these compounds in hypoxic tissue.
      <br/>
      Thus, a technetium or rhenium containing nitroimidazole complex should be capable of being reduced by xanthine oxidase under anaerobic conditions in the presence of hypoxanthine.
      <br/>
      The results from the enzyme assay below demonstrate that the Tc-nitroimidazole complexes of this invention are recognized as suitable substrates by xanthine oxidase.
    </p>
    <p num="251">
      To a 2.5 mL quartz cuvette was added 0.25 micromoles of the 99 Tc-nitroimidazole complex of Example 6 or 6b in 125  MU L of dimethylformamide, 1 mL of 0.01M hypoxanthine in pH 7.4 sodium phosphate buffer (0.1M), and 0.875 mL of 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) that contained 20 mg/L of disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA).
      <br/>
      The cuvette was sealed with a rubber septum, and purged with argon for 15 minutes to remove oxygen.
      <br/>
      To this was added 1.25 units of the enzyme xanthine oxidase (Boeringer) in 0.5 mL of deoxygenated pH 7.4 phosphate buffer.
      <br/>
      The cuvette was inverted to mix, and the UV/visible spectrum of the solution was recorded from 280 to 600 nm at 15 minute intervals.
    </p>
    <p num="252">
      The absorbance peak at approximately 320 nm, which is characteristic of the nitroimidazole functionality, decreased in intensity.
      <br/>
      It is believed that the disappearance of this nitro absorbance is due to reduction of the nitro group by xanthine oxidase.
      <br/>
      In a control reaction that contained no enzyme, no spectral changes were observed over a period of 7 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="253">
      In a parallel control reaction, the reagents above were mixed in the same fashion, but the 99 Tc complex of 3,3,9,9-tetramethyl-4,8-diazaundecane-2,10-dione dioxime (prepared by the method of Jurisson et al., Inorg. Chem., 1986, 25, 543) was substituted for the technetium complexes of Examples 6 or 6b.
      <br/>
      In this reaction, which did not contain a bioreducible nitroimidazole functionality, no spectral changes were observed over a period of 7 hours.

    <p num="255">Demonstration of the Ability of Cross Endothelial Monolayers</p>
    <p num="256">
      Bovine brain microvessel endothelial cells were isolated using a modification of the Audus-Borchardt method (K. L. Audus et al., Ann. New York Acad.
      <br/>
      Sci., 1988; 9-18).
      <br/>
      The measurements of bovine brain microvessel endothelial permeability in vitro were adapted for models by Audus and Borchardt (K. L. Audus et al., J. Neurochem., 1986; 47:484-488 and M. V. Shah et al., Pharm. Res. 1989; 6:624-627) and W. M. Pardridge et al. (J. Pharmacol. Exptl. Therap., 1990; 253:884-891) except that Anocell inserts were used in place of Transwells containing polycarbonate filters, or polycarbonate filters placed into a side-by-side apparatus.
      <br/>
      The use of electrical resistance as an indication of tight junction formation (P.
      <br/>
      Artursson et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 1990; 79:595-600 and S. G. Milton et al., J. Cell. Physiol., 1990; 144:498-504) was applied by using the Millicell-ERS resistance system from Millipore.
      <br/>
      An asymptotic level of high electrical resistance (.about.600 Ohms-cm2) at morpho-logical confluence indicated tight junction formation.
      <br/>
      Only those wells with resistance  &gt;= 500 Ohms-cm2 were used.
      <br/>
      Further modifications of the Audus-Borchardt method were the use of DMEM/F-12 media with 10% plasma derived horse serum as the experimental medium inside the Anocell insert and in the outer well.
    </p>
    <p num="257">A study of the permeability of a single test compound utilized 12 Anocell inserts:</p>
    <p num="258">
      4 wells containing monolayers, 0.4 mL of media with 10% plasma-derived horse serum, 5  MU Ci of 3 H-water, 2  MU Ci of 14 C-sucrose, and 20  MU Ci of the Tc-99 m complex;
      <br/>
      4 wells containing the same as above, but without the monolayers;
      <br/>
      and 4 wells containing the same but with neither monolayers nor the 10% plasma-derived horse serum.
    </p>
    <p num="259">
      This system was placed into a 37 (degree)  C., 5% CO2 incubator which contains as orbiting tissue culture plate shaker for agitation and 10  MU L samples, from both inside (donor) and outside (acceptor) compartments, were taken simultaneously from a set of 4 Anocell inserts.
      <br/>
      These samples were counted first in a Gamma counter then, after 72 hours, in a scintillation counter with dual channel capabilities.
      <br/>
      The fraction of radio-activity transported from the donor to the acceptor wells at each time point over the first 10 minutes of the study was calculated.
      <br/>
      The average percent of radioactivity transported was plotted vs. time and the slope was estimated by linear regression analysis.
      <br/>
      The slope of the clearance curve with filter alone is equal to PSf, where PS=permeability surface are a product.
      <br/>
      The slope of the clearance curve of the wells containing the filter plus endothelial cells was denoted PSm.
      <br/>
      The slope of the clearance curve was linear up to 10 minutes for all agents tested.
      <br/>
      The corrected PS value for the endothelial monolayer, called PSe, was computed as follows (according to Pardridge et al., J. Pharmacol. Exptl. Therap. 1990, 253, 884-891):  (Equation image '1' not included in text)

    <p num="271">Demonstration of Efficacy in the Rabbit Focal Myocardial Ischemia Model</p>
    <p num="272">
      A model of focal myocardial ischemia in the rabbit was developed, using permanent ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery.
      <br/>
      The model consisted of two studies.
      <br/>
      In the first, relative regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) and relative regional myocardial rate of glucose metabolism (MMRRg1) were determined by autoradiography using a double-label study with the flow tracer 99m TcCl(CDO)3 MeB (R. K. Narra et al., J. Nucl. Med., 1989; 30:1830-1837) and 14 C-deoxy-glucose for MMRg1 (L.
      <br/>
      Sokoloff et al., J. Neurochem., 1977, 28, 897-916). 14 C-deoxyglucose and the 99m Tc-hypoxia-localizing tracer were administered to a second group of rabbits with LAD coronary artery occlusion.
    </p>
    <p num="273">
      After the surgical preparation and 20 minutes of LAD occlusion, 14 C-deoxyglucose (130-150  MU Ci) was injected as an intravenous bolus, and timed arterial blood samples were obtained.
      <br/>
      Twenty-five minutes later, 99m TcCl(CDO)3 MeB (10-12 ) mCi) was administered intravenously.
      <br/>
      Five minutes later, the rabbits were sacrificed by intravenous injection of Nembutal and potassium chloride.
      <br/>
      The heart was excised, frozen in liquid Freon-22, and 20  MU m coronal sections obtained with a Microtome.
      <br/>
      Autoradiographs were obtained on all sections.
      <br/>
      For the first exposure (.about.14 hours duration) of Kodak XAR film, extra heavy duty aluminum foil was interposed between the tissue and film to block completely the radiation emanating from 14 C to obtain the MBF information derived from 99m TcCl-(CDO)3 MeB alone.
      <br/>
      After three days (to allow for decay of 99m Tc), a second autoradiograph was obtained without foil.
      <br/>
      The second exposure lasted 6-8 days, and provided an image of the regional distribution of 14 C-deoxyglucose.
      <br/>
      These images established that there is a zone of increased glycolysis bordering on the ischemic territory.
      <br/>
      This region of increased glycolysis, induced by reduced tissue pO2, marks the hypoxic ischemic border zone.
    </p>
    <p num="274">In a second group of animals, the protocol was similar, except that the 99m Tc complex of the ligand described in Example 1 was co-injected with 14 C-deoxyglucose, and the animal sacrificed 30 minutes later.</p>
    <p num="275">
      Autoradiography revealed an isomorphic relationship between the regional myocardial distribution pattern of this complex and that for 14 C-deoxyglucose.
      <br/>
      Both tracers displayed high uptake in the ischemic border zone, with low levels of radioactivity in the regions of normal perfusion, and virtually no radioactivity in the region of no flow.
      <br/>
      The microregional distribution of both the tracers was virtually identical.
      <br/>
      By comparison, the ischemic zone in the study with the 99m Tc-flow tracer showed little accumulation of radioactivity, while regions of normal perfusion displayed high levels of radioactivity.
    </p>
    <p num="276">
      The 99m Tc-complex of 3,3,6,9,9-pentamethyl-4,8-diazaundecane-2,10-dione dioxime was examined in this model as an example of a 99m Tc-PnAO-complex which does not possess a hypoxia-localizing functionality.
      <br/>
      The autoradiograms obtained with this tracer showed no differentiation of ischemic and non-ischemic regions indicating that a hypoxia-localizing moiety such as 2-nitroimidazole is essential for specific localization of these complexes within hypoxic regions.
    </p>
    <p num="277">
      In a separate experiment using the rabbit LAD occlusion model and the double-label auto-radiography procedures described above, the performance of the 99m Tc complex of the ligand described in Example 1 was compared to that of 14 C-misonidazole.
      <br/>
      The microregional distribution of both agents was virtually identical and was similar to that found previously for 14 C-deoxy-glucose: high uptake in the hypoxic border zone of the ischemic territory and low uptake in normoxic regions and in the center of the ischemic territory where flow is limiting.

    <p num="278">EXAMPLE 10a</p>
    <p num="279">Demonstration of Efficacy in a Rat Focal Cerebral Ischemia Model</p>
    <p num="280">
      A model of focal cerebral ischemia involving tandem occlusion of the internal carotid artery and the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was characterized using the double-label autoradiography procedure described in Example 10.
      <br/>
      In this case, 99m TcCl(DMG)3 2MP (Narra et al., J. Nucl. Med., 1990, 31(8), 1370-1377) was used as the indicator for cerebral blood flow (CBF) and, as before, 14 C-deoxyglucose was used to demonstrate areas of increased glycolysis indicative of tissue hypoxia.
      <br/>
      Following surgery, which was performed under Halothane anestesia, the rats were allowed to recover and one hour after the MCA occlusion, 14 C-deoxyglucose was injected as an IV bolus and timed arterial samples were obtained.
      <br/>
      Twenty-five minutes after 14 C-deoxyglucose injection, 99m TcCl-(DMG)3 2MP was injected as an IV bolus and the rat was sacrificed 15 second later.
      <br/>
      The brain was rapidly removed and sections and autoradiograms were obtained as described in Example 10.
      <br/>
      As found in Example 10 for the rabbit LAD occlusion model, the ischemic territory was bordered by a rim of tissue in which glycolysis was elevated.
      <br/>
      Unlike the previously cited example of myocardial ischemia, the hypoxic region in the brain did not have as great an increase in glycolysis compared to normoxic regions because the brain uses glucose as the preferred substrate for oxidation in normoxic tissue.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, it was clear that the ischemic region is surrounded by a border zone of increased glycolysis.
      <br/>
      In a second series of experiments, the 99m Tc complex of the ligand described in Example 1 and 14 C-deoxyglucose were co-injected 1 hour or five days after MCA occlusion.
      <br/>
      Autoradiograms were obtained as described above and revealed, for both time points, that both agents displayed an increased uptake in the hypoxic border zone relative to surrounding normoxic tissue.
      <br/>
      Moreover computer assisted image analysis showed that, in the case of 99m Tc complex of the ligand described in Example 1, the hypoxic-normoxic optical density ratio was 7:1.
      <br/>
      These findings demonstrate the efficacy of the 99m Tc complex of the ligand described in Example 1 for both acute and chronic episodes of focal cerebral ischemia.

      The perfusate contained �in mM� NaCl �118�, KCl �4.7�, CaCl2 �1.8�, Na2 EDTA �0.5�, KH2 PO4 �1.2�, MgSO4 �1.2�, NaHCO3 �25�, glucose �11�, pyruvate �0.2�, and insulin (12 IU/L) and was equilibrated with O2 :CO2 (95:5) (global normoxia) or N2 :CO2 (95:5) (global hypoxia).
      <br/>
      The hearts were paced continuously at 5 Hz.
      <br/>
      Perfusion pressure was maintained at 72 cm H2 O for 20 minutes in order to allow the hearts to adjust to the isolated state.
      <br/>
      After this initial adjustment period, perfusate flow was maintained constant at a level similar to that obtained at the end of the adjustment period, i.e., 7-8 mL/min/g wet weight, using a peristaltic pump.

    <p num="284">
      For determination of oxygen consumption, a cannula was placed in the right ventricle via the pulmonary artery.
      <br/>
      A pump removed a small fraction of the coronary effluent at 1 mL/min., and its oxygen concentration was monitored continuously by an in-line Clark-type electrode.
      <br/>
      In the normoxic state, the influent oxygen concentration was maintained at 956  MU M. Coronary flow was measured by collecting the effluent from the right and left pulmonary arteries in a 10 mL graduated cylinder.
      <br/>
      Oxygen consumption was calculated from the product of the influent-effluent oxygen concentration difference and the coronary flow.
      <br/>
      During perfusion with hypoxic medium, only the effluent oxygen concentration was recorded.
      <br/>
      Typically, effluent oxygen concentration was 505  MU M in the normoxic studies and 17  MU M in the hypoxic studies.

      The heart was perfused with either normoxic or hypoxic medium for 30 minutes prior to the administration of the test compound.

      The Tc-99 m tracer was administered over 20 minutes by infusion into the perfusate, and radioactivity in the perfused heart was detected by a collimated NaI crystal positioned 3-4 cm from the right ventricle and perpendicular to the vertical axis of the heart.
      <br/>
      The radioactivity remaining in the heart at 40 minutes after the end of the infusion period was divided by the peak level of radioactivity to give a measure of retention.

      These data demonstrate that the Tc-99 m complex of the compound in Example 1 shows retention in the sequence anoxia&gt;hypoxia&gt;normoxia.
      <br/>
      Since a significant proportion of tracer was retained in normoxic myocytes, a separate study with isolated myocytes was undertaken.
    </p>
    <p num="296">
      Addition of an uncoupler of  BETA -oxidative phosphorylation, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoro-methoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), which completely oxidizes the mitochondrial electron transport chain (NADH/NAD+ ratio and the redox potential of the cells decrease) but decreases the phosphorylation potential (�ATP�/�ADP��Pi�) to levels similar to that found in hypoxia, had no effect n the retention of the Tc-99 m complex of the compound in Example 1 in normoxic cells.
      <br/>
      Moreover, addition of cyanide to separate cell suspensions (n=3), which inhibits electron transport between cytochrome oxidase and oxygen (NADH/NAD+ ratio and redox potential increase) but also decreases the phosphorylation potential to very low levels, had no effect on retention in normoxic cells.
      <br/>
      These results suggest that:
      <br/>
      1) retention of the Tc-99 m complex of the compound in Example 1 in normoxic cells is not dependent on the redox state of the intramitochonrial pyridine nucleotides and is most likely due to its lipophilicity or other molecular interactions affecting binding to cellular material.
      <br/>
      If the amount retained in normoxic cells was dependent upon the redox state, retention would have been expected to decrease upon addition of FCCP.
      <br/>
      2) Significant retention of the Tc-99 m complex of the compound in Example 1 requires an oxygen-free or low oxygen milieu.
      <br/>
      An increase in the redox potential (cyanide) is not sufficient to affect the level of retention.
      <br/>
      The latter results were confirmed using Na Amobarbital which also inhibits electron flux but at site I of the respiratory chain (NADH/NAD+ ratio increases).
      <br/>
      3) Most importantly, by uncoupling the cells and by addition of cyanide, the energy state of the cells was reduced to levels that were likely similar to that obtained with oxygen deprivation.
      <br/>
      Thus, any changes in cellular permeability, geometry and viability were also similar, suggesting that retention was due to reduction of the nitro moiety of the Tc-99 m complex of the compound in Example 1 in the absence of oxygen.
      <br/>
      These data indicate that, in hypoxia, the Tc-99m complex of the compound in Example 1 becomes trapped within the hypoxic cells.

    <p num="297">
      When cellular integrity was disrupted by freezing and thawing the cells (3X) before incubation with the Tc-99m complex of the compound in Example 1 under normoxic and hypoxic (glucose oxidase) conditions, the percentage of activity associated with the protein/membrane fragments was similar (normoxic=23.3.+- 0 (slashed zero) 8%, anoxic=25.3 +- 2.5%, n=3).
      <br/>
      The latter indicates than an intact cell is required for trapping of the compound.

    <p num="461">The 99m Tc complexes of the ligands prepared in Examples 30 to 33 above were prepared as follows:</p>
    <p num="462">
      Ligand (2-4 mg) was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl saline (1.0 mL) and 0.1 M HCl (0.1 mL) in a 5 mL glass vial, and 0.1 M sodium hydrogen carbonate buffer (0.5 mL), saline, and 99 Mo/99m Tc generator eluate (total saline/eluate volume=0.5 mL) was added.
      <br/>
      The vial was sealed, and a saturated solution of stannous tartrate in saline (50  MU L) was added to the vial.
      <br/>
      The vial was shaken to mix the reagents, and allowed to stand at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The radiochemical purities (RCP) of the 99m Tc complexes were measured by reversed phase HPLC as described above.
      <br/>
      All technetium complexes formed with RCP&gt;94% after 3 minutes, except for the 99m Tc complex of the ligand of Example 32, which formed more slowly (at 5 minutes the RCP was 68%; at 91 minutes the RCP had increased to 86%).
