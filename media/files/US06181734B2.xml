    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      Commercial and military radios often need to communicate or could benefit by having the capability of communicating with two or more radio networks, each of which is of a different type.
      <br/>
      One example of this need is found in the cellular telephone market where different modes of operation are presently available leading to the present need for so-called "dual mode" cellular phones.
      <br/>
      The dual modes refer to different waveforms.
      <br/>
      As used herein, "waveform" refers to functional transformation of information such as speech to a modulated rf carrier and encompasses the entire process of going from speech to antenna and/or vice versa.
      <br/>
      To operate over multipole waveforms has in the past required that various pieces of equipment be utilized.
      <br/>
      As new waveform technologies develop, existing equipment becomes unusable with such waveforms.
    </p>
    <p num="2">It is desirable to provide a radio which is useable as a generic radio platform with existing waveforms and yet to be developed waveforms.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      The invention is directed to a software radio in which operation is, for the most part, effected by a software program that runs on a generic radio platform.
      <br/>
      Interoperable waveform modes are added as software applications in a manner similar to adding applications to a personal computer.
      <br/>
      In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the radio user or operator selects stored waveforms on demand as communications requirement dictate.
      <br/>
      As is described below, one embodiment of the invention utilizes nonvolatile storage to implement a plurality of waveforms.
      <br/>
      The operator may place one or more of the waveforms in cache random access memory such that rapid switching between the selected waveforms can occur.
      <br/>
      In addition, the operator may switch from one waveform mode to another to communicate over different radio networks, such as the Iridium satellite communication network manufactured by Motorola, Inc., TDMA and/or CDMA cellular networks, or other land mobile two-way radio systems such as the IDEN system by Motorola, Inc., or can broadcast on all or a number of them simultaneously.

    <p num="5">
      Turning now to FIG. 1, a functional flow diagram of a transmitter in accordance with the invention is shown.
      <br/>
      In the arrangement of FIG. 1, speech is applied to a voice conditioning function 101 that includes speech compression.
      <br/>
      In some instances, the waveform to be generated may not require compression in which event the speech compression portion of function 101 is not utilized.
      <br/>
      The conditioned and possibly compressed speech is subjected to an encryption function 103.
      <br/>
      The encrypted speech is provided to a modulation function 105.
      <br/>
      The modulation function provides any of a plurality of modulation types.
      <br/>
      The types of modulation which may be utilized includes frequency modulation (fm), amplitude modulation (am), frequency shift keying (fsk), phase shift keyed, (psk) quadrature amplitude modulation (qam), time division multiplexing (tdma), code division multiplexing (cdma) and other modulation functions.
      <br/>
      The various modulation types identified above are known, as are specifics with respect to the functionality of these and other modulation types.
      <br/>
      The modulation may be analog in nature or it may be digital.
      <br/>
      The modulation output is fed to a radio frequency (rf) up-conversion function 107.
      <br/>
      Function 107 utilizes the baseband modulation output of modulation function 105 and converts the baseband modulation to an rf carrier.
      <br/>
      Function 107 provides for selectable rf up-conversion and the resulting modulated rf carrier is applied to antenna 109.
      <br/>
      Although one antenna is shown, antenna 109 may include one or more antennas each of which is operable over one or more specific frequency bands.

      FIG. 2 illustrates in block diagram form an implementation of the transmitter of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Speech is applied to an analog to digital converter or digitizer 201 to produce digital information.
      <br/>
      All processing of the digital information is performed in software.
      <br/>
      The output of digitizer 201 is a digital data stream that enters one or more microprocessor blocks shown illustratively as processors 203.
      <br/>
      Any number of separate processors may be disposed between the two processors 203 shown to perform the various functions shown in the functional diagram of FIG. 1 such as voice conditioning and compression functions 101, encryption functions 103 and modulation functions 105.
      <br/>
      The output of the final or nth processor 203 is applied to a digital to an analog conversion block comprising digital to analog converters 207, 208.
      <br/>
      Each of digital to analog converters 207, 208 generates a baseband representation of the modulated signal in phase and quadrature components I and Q, respectively.
      <br/>
      I and Q are applied to respective mixers 209, 211.
      <br/>
      Mixers 209, 211 receive cosine and sine carrier signals generated by an rf synthesizer 213.
      <br/>
      The outputs of mixers 209, 211 are combined in adder 215 to produce a modulated rf signal which is applied to a power amplifier 217 to amplify the output signal to a desired level.
      <br/>
      The rf output of power amplifier 217 is applied to antenna 109.

    <p num="7">
      In the transmitter of FIG. 2, each of processors 203 is utilized to provide a portion of the processing power needed to implement any desired waveform so that changing a waveform changes the software that processors 201 execute.
      <br/>
      Although multiple processors are shown, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that multiple processors, each specific to a waveform may be utilized in some embodiments of the invention.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments of the invention, multitasking of a fewer number of processors can accomplish the same result.
      <br/>
      In yet other embodiments of the invention, certain processors may be provided which are dedicated to the production of certain waveforms and other processors may be multitasked.
      <br/>
      In one implementation of the invention, the structure of FIG. 2 is replicated for each rf channel.

    <p num="8">
      The analog to digital converters 201 are of conventional design and are of a type that is commercially available.

      <br/>
      Alternatively, a common antenna may be used and conventional techniques and apparatus may be used to provide isolation between transmit and receive portions of a transceiver in accordance with the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Signals are received by antenna 301 and down converted to baseband signals by rf down converter 303.
      <br/>
      A demodulation function 305 demodulates the baseband signals using any one of a plurality of modulation formats such as the various modulation formats described in conjunction with the modulation function 105 shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The modulation format utilized depends upon the particular modulation format employed by the particular waveform that is received.
      <br/>
      The demodulation function 305 outputs a demodulated data stream to decryption function 307 that performs the decryption, if any, required.
      <br/>
      The output of decryption function 307 is provided to voice decompression function 309 that decompresses the speech signals and provides a decompressed speech output.
      <br/>
      The functional diagram of FIG. 3 is for a single channel.

      <br/>
      The output of lna 401 is applied to an rf down converter 303 which includes an rf down converter 411 of conventional design which for example generates phase and quadrature signals I and Q. The outputs I and Q are applied to analog to digital converters 407, 409 which are of conventional design.
      <br/>
      The I and Q outputs are applied to processors 403.

      FIG. 8 illustrates an arrangement for use with processors which permits the rapid switching of waveform functionality.
      <br/>
      In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the functionality of a processor is obtained from a collection of waveform software accessible to each processor.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 8 three processors 807, 809, 811 each have associated therewith cache memory 813, 815, 817 respectively.
      <br/>
      A memory 801 accessible to each of processors 807, 809, 811 contains waveform software 803, 805, 806 for the various waveforms that may be processed.
      <br/>
      The memory 801 is for example a disk drive.
      <br/>
      To permit the rapid switching between waveforms, high-speed memory such as ram or random access memory is used for the caches 813, 815, 817.
      <br/>
      In operation, if a user of the system utilizing the processors selects a waveform to be utilized, the system processors 807, 809, 811 retrieve the appropriate waveform software from hard disk memory 801 and causes the appropriate software to be stored in the cache memories 813, 815, 817.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, if waveform 1 is selected, waveform 1 vocoder software 819 is retrieved from memory 801 and stored in cache 813; waveform 1 encryption software 821 is retrieved from memory 801 and stored in cache 815; and waveform 1 modulator software 823 is retrieved from memory 801 and stored in cache 817.
      <br/>
      Similarly, software for other waveforms is retrieved from memory 801 and stored in caches 813, 815, 817 for other selected waveforms.
      <br/>
      Thus in accordance with one aspect of the invention, all of the constituent parts of a wave form application function are distributed to the processors that need to execute them.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 8, no designation is made as to whether the system is operating as receiver or as transmitter.
      <br/>
      The operation of the system of FIG. 8 is the same whether operating as receiver, transmitter or transceiver.
      <br/>
      Operation of the system structure of FIG. 8 is shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      In step 901, the user selects the waveform or waveforms that are to be used.
      <br/>
      In response to such selection, the system retrieves the waveform application routines from memory 801 as indicated at step 903.
      <br/>
      The waveform applications are stored in the cache memories 813, 815, 817 for the processors 807, 809, 811 as indicated at step 905.
      <br/>
      In step 905, the waveform application is disseminated to each processor cache as necessary to process the related waveform.
      <br/>
      At step 907, waveform programmable information such as bandwidth, sample rates and frequencies of operation are provided.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In operation of the system one or more of the waveform software is stored in dedicated memory which is rapidly accessed at power up of the radio.
      <br/>
      By adding flash memory 841, 843, 845 to each of the processors 807, 809, 811 respectively, the last number of waveforms used by the radio user prior to power down are stored in memory 841, 843, 845 and are instantly loaded at next power up.
      <br/>
      This permits the software radio to power up for substantially instantaneous use.
