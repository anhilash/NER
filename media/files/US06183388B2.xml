    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates generally to the design and construction of a gear reduction gearbox for a gas turbine engine.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention has one embodiment wherein the gear reduction gearbox utilizes an epicyclic face gear drive unit connected to a gas turbine engine to reduce shaft speed and increase the output torque.
      <br/>
      Although the present invention was developed for use in a gas turbine engine, certain applications may be outside of this field.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Gas turbine engine designers generally integrate a gear reduction gearbox with the engine in order to reduce the output shaft speed, and increase the torque delivered to an output device, such as a fan.
      <br/>
      It is well known that gas turbine engines are high speed rotary equipment having components including an output shaft revolving at speeds from about 5,000 to 50,000 revolutions per minute.
      <br/>
      Sometimes, in order to harness the power from the output shaft of the gas turbine engine a main gear reduction gearbox is coupled to the engine to decrease shaft rotation speed and increase output torque.
      <br/>
      Main gear reduction gearboxes include gear sets therein for reducing the shaft speed during the transmission of power from the gas turbine engine to the output devices, such as a fan.
      <br/>
      The transmission of power from the gas turbine engine to the output device imparts substantial loads on the bearings and gears of the gearbox.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Historically, designers of main gear reduction gearboxes for gas turbine engines have relied upon multi-stage reduction gearboxes not having bevel gear sets.
      <br/>
      A limitation associated with bevel gear sets is the inability to efficiently share the load transmitted through the gearbox.
      <br/>
      Absent load sharing within the gearbox there is an increase in stress on the individual gear and the bearing associated with the gear, therefore often requiring an increase in the bearing and gear size.
      <br/>
      The technological difficulties associated with load sharing in bevel gear drives stems directly from having to precisely align the mating gears of the set, and therefore the use of multiple pinion gears on a common shaft can create conflicts in alignment.
      <br/>
      Alignment conflicts serve to increase the complexity of manufacturing and servicing the gearbox.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The application of gas turbine engines as a propulsion means for an aircraft often creates design parameter conflicts, such as the need for a durable long life gear train and the necessity to minimize the volume and weight of the respective engine.
      <br/>
      Prior designers of gas turbine engine gear reduction gearboxes have generally used multi-stage gearboxes to effectuate significant shaft speed reduction.
      <br/>
      One common limitation associated with bevel gear sets is that their gear reduction ratio is below 8:1 due to manufacturing constraints.
      <br/>
      Therefore in order to obtain a higher gear reduction ratio involves adding additional stages that add weight, unit manufacturing costs, and often complicates construction and causes alignment problems between gear sets.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Apart from kinematic limitations associated with bevel gear sets there are additional constraints that designers of gear reduction gearboxes must address.
      <br/>
      One additional constraint is that bevel gear sets require precision alignment in the axial and radial direction.
      <br/>
      The alignment precision between the pinion and meshing gear often creates assembly difficulties, thereby increasing the cost to manufacture and service the gearbox.
      <br/>
      Further, the precision alignment parameter often limits the designers flexibility in gear set arrangements.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In many gas turbine engine gear reduction gearboxes the individual gears are not stress limited, but in reality the bearings are the limiting factor due to fatigue failure.
      <br/>
      Thus, in many prior gear reduction gearbox designs the bearing fatigue life dictates increasing the size of the bearing, which thereby increased the gear size.
      <br/>
      Further, many prior gearbox designs must fit within a prespecified volume and the utilization of bevel gear arrangements often precludes using larger bearings because of their impact on volume, thereby limiting the service life of the components.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Even with the variety of prior gas turbine gear reduction gearboxes there remains a need for an improved gear reduction gearbox.
      <br/>
      The present invention satisfies this need in a novel and unobvious way.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="12">
      For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiment illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same.
      <br/>
      It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated device, and such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Referring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated an internal combustion engine 10.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment the internal combustion engine is an aircraft flight propulsion engine.
      <br/>
      It is understood that an aircraft is generic and includes helicopters, tactical fighters, trainers, missiles and other related apparatuses.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment the flight propulsion engine 10 defines a gas turbine engine 12 including a compressor, a combustor, and a power turbine.
      <br/>
      It is important to realize that there are a multitude of ways in which the components can be linked together.
      <br/>
      Additional compressors and turbines could be added with intercoolers connected between the compressors and reheat combustion chambers could be added between the turbines.
      <br/>
      Further, a gas turbine engine is equally suited to be used for industrial applications.
      <br/>
      Historically, there has been wide spread use of industrial gas turbine engines, such as pumping sets for gas and oil transmission lines, electricity generation and naval propulsion.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      A mechanical gear reduction gearbox 11 is coupled to an output shaft (not illustrated) of the gas turbine engine 12.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the gearbox transmit a minimum of about fifty shaft horsepower therethrough.
      <br/>
      A typical output shaft speed of many gas turbine engines is in the range of about 5,000 to 50,000 revolutions per minute.
      <br/>
      Therefore it is often necessary to connect the output shaft of the gas turbine engine 12 to a gear reduction gearbox 11 in order to reduce the rotational speed transmitted to a motive power device 13.
      <br/>
      In one form of the present invention motive power device 13 is connected to the output shaft of the gearbox 11.
      <br/>
      The motive power device 13 can be a propeller, a fan, or such other devices that function to impart energy from the gas turbine engine 12 to the surrounding environment to facilitate propulsion of the aircraft.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      With reference to FIG. 2, there is illustrated a typical face gear set 15, (contrate gear pair).
      <br/>
      The face gear set 15 illustrated in FIG. 2, is not intended to be limiting but rather is intended to facilitate a further understanding of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment of gear reduction gearbox 11 there is utilized at least one face gear set to transmit power from the gas turbine engine 12 to the motive power device 13.
      <br/>
      A typical face gear set 15 is comprised of a pinion gear 16 (cylindrical gear) that meshes with a face gear 17 (contrate gear).
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the pinion gear of the set is a spur or helical gear that is not substantially different from their parallel axis counterpart except for the fact that it meshes with a face gear.
      <br/>
      Face gears generally have teeth that are formed such that the axis of the teeth lie in a plane perpendicular to the shaft axis.
      <br/>
      It is contemplated herein that an alternate embodiment of the present invention includes a face gear having teeth positioned in a plane at a taper angle relative to the shaft axis.
      <br/>
      Further, the face gear tooth generally changes shape from one end of the tooth to the other.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Individuals having ordinary skill in the art will be generally familiar with face gears, and a relatively recent manufacturing improvement by Crown Gear B.V., of Holland has enabled the manufacturing of a more cost efficient, high capacity, high accuracy face gear set.
      <br/>
      The process utilized by Crown Gears B.V., allows for the finishing of hardened face gears through skiving.
      <br/>
      The resulting face gear sets are precision high capacity gears having hardened surfaces.
      <br/>
      In one form of the present invention the face gear sets are surfaced hardened to a range of about Rockwell C 58-62.
      <br/>
      Surface hardness is very desirable necessary in a gas turbine engine gearbox to withstand the high pitch line velocity and loads transmitted from the engine through the gearbox to the motive power device.
      <br/>
      One form of the present invention comprises a gear reduction gearbox being designed and constructed to operate at an average pitch line velocity of 20,000 feet per minute and to withstand a maximum pitch line velocity of 40,000 feet per minute.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      With reference to FIG. 3, there is illustrated one embodiment of the gear reduction unit 20 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The gear reduction unit 20 is contained within a mechanical housing 21 that forms a portion of the gear reduction gearbox 11.
      <br/>
      The mechanical housing 21 being sealed such that lubrication can be maintained therein for cooling and lubricating the components.
      <br/>
      An input shaft 22 being connected to a power output shaft of the gas turbine engine 12.
      <br/>
      The input shaft 22 is rotatably mounted to a fixed carrier 24 and is supported by a bearing 23.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment the bearings 23 are oil cooled tapered roller bearings.
      <br/>
      Other bearings such as a ball and roller bearing, or fluid film bearing are contemplated herein.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In the preferred embodiment the fixed carrier 24 is connected to the mechanical housing 21 and provides mechanical structure for supporting bearing 23 and the components described hereinafter for the gear reduction unit 20.
      <br/>
      In an alternate form of the present invention fixed carrier 24 is fabricated integrally with the mechanical housing 21.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment the fixed carrier 24 includes upstanding members 25 having apertures 26 therethrough for receiving a bearing 27 therein.
      <br/>
      The bearings 27 are positioned parallel to the longitudinal centerline X and a pinion shaft 28 rotates freely on the bearings.
      <br/>
      The pinion shaft 37 being located transverse to the longitudinal centerline X and extending radially outward between a pair of spaced upstanding members 25.
