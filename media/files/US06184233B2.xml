    <p num="19">The monohydrate crystals of Compound (I) in the present invention can be produced as follows.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Generally, the method of producing Compound (I) is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      For example, this compound can be produced as schematically shown below using known reactants, reagents and reactions.  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Compound (I) is dissolved in a mixed solvent of water with alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran or acetone, and then crystallizing this compound through cooling or the like.
      <br/>
      At this point, the water content of the mixed solvent is preferably between about 2 and 50% by weight.
      <br/>
      The thus-obtained wet crystals are dried to obtain  ALPHA -type anhydride crystals.
      <br/>
      Then when  ALPHA -type anhydride crystals are kept under an appropriate temperature and appropriate humidity, dry monohydrate crystals can be obtained.
      <br/>
      At the humidity-controlling, the temperature is between 20 and 100 (degree)  C., preferably between about 25 and 90 (degree)  C., and the relative humidity is between about 10 and 100%, preferably between about 50 and 90%.
      <br/>
      The time utilized is between about 30 minutes and 48 hours, more preferably between about 2 hour and 30 hours.
      <br/>
      The phrase "humidity-control" means that crystals are kept or maintained under a certain temperature and humidity as defined herein.
    </p>
    <p num="22">The  ALPHA -type anhydride crystals can be obtained by heat-drying the above-mentioned monohydrate crystals, or by dissolving the same crystals in the above-mentioned mixed solvent having a water content of less than 2% by weight, crystallizing the mixture, and drying the resulting crystals, or by dispersing the amorphous substance in a solvent such as ethyl acetate or acetone, treating the dispersion at from 10 to 50 (degree)  C. for from 10 minutes to 48 hours, and after conversion to crystals, drying the crystals.</p>
    <p num="23">
      Further, the trihydrate crystals of Compound (I) of the present invention are hardly precipitated directly from the solvent.
      <br/>
      However, the trihydrate crystals can be obtained by precipitating the crystals from an aqueous solution, and humidity-controlling the resulting  BETA -type anhydride crystals at an appropriate temperature and appropriate humidity.
      <br/>
      For the humidity-controlling, the temperature is between about 20 and 100 (degree)  C., preferably between about 25 and 90 (degree)  C., and the relative humidity is between about 30 and 100%, preferably between 50 and 90%.

      2-Aminoethylbromide hydrobromide (35.77 g, 174.6 mmols) and 22.80 g (104.8 mmols) of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate were added to a mixed solvent of 300 ml of ether and 300 ml of water.

      Subsequently, 44.00 g (523.8 mmols) of sodium hydrogencarbonate were gradually added thereto, and the solution was stirred overnight at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The ether layer was washed with 80 ml of 1 N hydrochloric acid and then with 80 ml of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, and dried over magnesium sulfate to obtain 21.57 g of 2-tert-butoxycarbonylaminoethyl bromide.
