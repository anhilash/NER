    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a biaxially oriented film made from a wholly aromatic polyamide and to a magnetic recording medium comprising the same as a base film.
      <br/>
      More specifically, it relates to a biaxially oriented film made from a wholly aromatic polyamide, which is excellent in handling properties such as strength, slipperiness and winding property and has excellent abrasion resistance, and to a magnetic recording medium comprising the same as a base film.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in high-density magnetic recording, as exemplified by the development and practical implementation of a thin layer coated magnetic recording medium in which a needle-like magnetic powder material such as metal powders or iron oxide powders is coated on a coated magnetic recording medium to a thickness of 2  MU m or less.
      <br/>
      For example, an extremely thin layer coated magnetic recording medium for high-density magnetic recording is known (refer to technical report MR 94-78 issued by the Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers (1995-02)).
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Since a coated magnetic recording medium of the prior art (a magnetic recording medium in which a mixture of magnetic powders and an organic polymer binder is coated on a non-magnetic base film) has a low recording density and a long recording wavelength, it has a large thickness of about 2  MU m or more.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in the case of an extremely thin layer coated magnetic recording medium, there is proposed a magnetic layer as extremely thin as 0.13  MU m, though it has a non-magnetic under-layer.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Along with a reduction in the size of a recording medium itself, it is desired to reduce the thickness of a base film itself in order to increase recording capacity.</p>
    <p num="5">An aromatic polyamide film is a material which is excellent in strength, heat resistance and the like due to high Young's moduli as a thin film and suitable for use in a high-density magnetic recording medium.</p>
    <p num="6">JP-A 51-129201 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application") discloses a magnetic recording medium which comprises a magnetic layer and an aromatic polyamide film in which 70% or more of all the bonds are para bonds and at least 15% of phenyl nuclei have at least one substituent of halogen and nitro groups at the ortho-positions of an amide bond.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In the high-density magnetic recording medium, the surface condition of a non-magnetic base film greatly influences the surface properties of a magnetic layer, and surface irregularities cause noise in recording and reproduction signals.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is desirable that the surface of the non-magnetic base film be as smooth as possible.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      On the other hand, from a viewpoint of the formation of a non-magnetic base film and handling properties such as transportation, damaging, wind-up and wind-off in the process of film formation, when the surface of the film is too smooth, slipperiness between films deteriorates, a blocking phenomenon occurs, roll formation becomes difficult, and the yield of products lowers, thereby inducing an increase in production costs.
      <br/>
      Therefore, from a viewpoint of production costs, it is desirable that the surface of the non-magnetic base film be as rough as possible.
    </p>
    <p num="9">As means for satisfying the above antinomic requirements, there is proposed a method for forming protrusions which are appropriate in terms of height and density and derived from particles having optimal particle diameters on the surface of the base film.</p>
    <p num="10">As a method for forming protrusions on the surface of an aromatic polyamide film, there have been proposed a) one in which a predetermined amount of inorganic particles are added and b) one in which organic polymer particles or inorganic particles whose surface is treated with an organic polymer are added.</p>
    <p num="11">
      JP-A 61-246919 discloses a film which is essentially composed of an aromatic polyamide or aromatic polyimide containing 0.01 to 10 wt % of inorganic particles as a film produced by a method a).
      <br/>
      The film has protrusions derived from the inorganic particles and specified as follows.
      <br/>
      The heights Rm of fine protrusions range from 30 to 500  Angstrom , the area average diameter DA of the fine protrusions ranges from 0.01  MU m or more to less than 0.3  MU m, the average flatness DA /Rm of the protrusions is 15 or less, the number NA of fine protrusions having a maximum diameter of 0.01  MU m or more is 104 to 109 /mm2, the number of fine protrusions having a long diameter/short diameter ratio a/b (a: maximum diameter of fine protrusion, b: diameter intersecting the maximum diameter at a right angle) of 2 or more is 0.2 * NA or less, and the number of fine protrusions having a circularity  PI DN /CN (DN : area diameter of fine protrusion, CN : circumference of fine protrusion,  PI : ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter) of 0.7 or less is 0.2 * NA or less.
    </p>
    <p num="12">JP-A 8-203064 discloses a film made from an aromatic polyamide or an aromatic polyimide, which contains organic polymer particles having an average particle diameter of 10 to 500 nm or inorganic particles surface-treated with an organic polymer, has a center line surface roughness Ra of one surface of 0.5 to 50 nm and an Ra of the other surface of 10 nm or less.</p>
    <p num="13">However, the above methods using externally added particles involve such a defect that the particles fall off from the protrusion on the film surface by friction between the guide pin and the surface of the film in the calendering step after the coating of a magnetic layer or during actual use and contaminate the step because the externally added particles easily agglomerate in the added slurry.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Particularly, in the calendering step after the application of a magnetic coating, extremely high shearing force is applied to the base film.
      <br/>
      Therefore, large voids formed around the agglomeration of the particles produce a great amount of abrasion dust due to the fall-off of the particles, thereby contaminating the calender roll with the result of a great reduction in productivity.
    </p>
    <p num="15">It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel biaxially oriented wholly aromatic polyamide film.</p>
    <p num="16">It is another object of the present invention to provide a biaxially oriented wholly aromatic polyamide film for a magnetic recording medium, which is excellent in handling properties such as strength, slipperiness and winding property and has high abrasion resistance.</p>
    <p num="17">It is still another object of the present invention to provide a magnetic recording medium which comprises the biaxially oriented wholly aromatic polyamide film of the present invention as a base film, has excellent electromagnetic conversion characteristics and is suitable for high-density recording.</p>
    <p num="18">Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description.</p>
    <p num="19">According to the present invention, firstly, the above objects and advantages of the present invention can be attained by a biaxially oriented film made from a wholly aromatic polyamide produced by an acid chloride process, which contains at least one member of inorganic particles having an average particle diameter of 5 to 2,000 nm and selected from the group consisting of hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates of metals of groups Ia and IIa of the periodic table, the inorganic particles being derived from inorganic particles which are added as a neutralizing agent to a reaction system to neutralize hydrogen chloride by-produced by the acid chloride reaction and its content corresponding to an excess portion added to the reaction system over the amount required for neutralizing the hydrogen chloride stoichiometrically.</p>
    <p num="20">The wholly aromatic polyamide constituting the biaxially oriented film of the present invention is not particularly limited as far as its main chain comprises an aromatic nucleus and an amide bonding group as main constituents.</p>
    <p num="21">

      In view of this, to make the inorganic particles having an average particle diameter of 5 to 2,000 nm existent in the film, the average particle diameter of the inorganic particles to be added to the reaction system is preferably in the range of 150 to 20,000 nm, more preferably 150 to 15,000 nm.

      <br/>
      Physical properties and characteristic properties in the present invention were measured and defined as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="131">(1) pH of polymer solution</p>
    <p num="132">After 5 g of a polymer solution was collected, added to 300 ml of water and stirred for 2 minutes, pH of the resulting aqueous solution was measured.</p>
    <p num="133">(2) logarithmic viscosity</p>

    <p num="139">
      Particles were measured for diameters using the centrifugal particle size analyzer Model CP-50 of Shimadzu Corporation.
      <br/>
      A particle diameter equivalent to 50 weight percent was read from a cumulative curve of diameters of the individual particles and the amount thereof calculated based on the obtained centrifugal sedimentation curve, and the obtained value was taken as an average particle diameter (refer to "Particle Size Measurement Technique" issued by Nikkan Kogyo Press, pp. 242-247, 1975).
    </p>
    <p num="140">(b) average particle diameter of particles contained in film</p>
    <p num="141">The film was dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone (may be abbreviated as NMP hereinafter) containing 3 wt % of lithium chloride by stirring at 100 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes and the residual film undissolved in NMP was measured in the same manner as in (a).</p>

    <p num="146">
      The film was etched to a depth of 500 nm from the surface using a plasma reactor (PR31 of Yamato Kagaku Co., Ltd.). 25 Photos of the surface of the etched sample were taken at random at an angle of 0 (degree)  and a magnification of 5,000 *  using a scanning electron microscope (T-300 of JEOL Ltd.) to measure the long diameter of a particle which appeared on the surface and the long diameter of a void around the particle.

      Meanwhile, calcium hydroxide having an average particle diameter of 8,000 nm (a product of Inoue Sekkai Co., Ltd.) was dispersed in NMP by a homogenizer, ground to an average particle diameter of 2,300 nm by a sand grinder and filtered with a filter (HDCII of 50  MU m meshes manufactured by Nihon Pall Ltd.) to prepare an NMP slurry of calcium hydroxide having an average particle diameter of 1,500 nm.
      <br/>
      This slurry was added to the above polymer to ensure that an amount of calcium hydroxide became 50.3 mol % based on 50 mol % of terephthalic acid chloride, whereby a stock solution for film formation was obtained.
      <br/>
      This stock solution had a pH of 4.7. The polymer had a logarithmic viscosity of 3.5.

      <br/>
      This unoriented film was separated from the belt continuously and introduced into a water tank to remove the solvent and the salt, and then dried at 150 (degree)  C. for 15 minutes.

      The obtained unoriented film was stretched to 2.5 times between low-speed and high-speed rolls at a film temperature of 350 (degree)  C., and then supplied to a stenter to be stretched to 3.0 times at 400 (degree)  C. to give a biaxially oriented film.
      <br/>
      This biaxially oriented film was heat set at 400 (degree)  C. for 1 minute to give an aromatic polyamide film having a final thickness of 4.0  MU m.

      25 mol % of paraphenylenediamine and 25 mol % of 3,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether as amine components and 50 mol % of terephthalic acid dichloride as an acid component were polymerized in NMP (N-methylpyrrolidone).

      Meanwhile, calcium hydroxide having an average particle diameter of 8,000 nm (a product of Inoue Sekkai Co., Ltd.) was dispersed in NMP by a homogenizer, ground to an average particle diameter of 1,000 nm by a sand grinder and filtered with a filter (HDCII of 5  MU m meshes manufactured by Nihon Pall Ltd.) to prepare an NMP slurry of calcium hydroxide having an average particle diameter of 200 nm.
      <br/>
      This slurry was added to the above polymer to ensure that an amount of calcium hydroxide became 51.2 mol % based on 50 mol % of terephthalic acid dichloride, whereby a stock solution for film formation was obtained.
