      An electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus for computing electromagnetic field intensity of an electric circuit device in a moment method obtains according to the electric current distribution an electric current of a ground layer and models a transmission line, ground layer, dielectric portion, etc. to be analyzed.
      <br/>
      When a plate to be analyzed is divided into a plurality of patches, the regularity in given structure data is automatically extracted to compute the mutual impedance among a portion of patches and apply the computation result to other portions.
      <br/>
      When elements to be analyzed meet the conditions that the electric length of the elements is short and the elements are distant from each other, the mutual impedance can be computed in an approximation obtained under various conditions.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, approximating a portion near a pigtail portion of a coaxial cable using a polygon allows a vertical electric current to be properly connected to each unit.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to an electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus for computing the intensity of the electromagnetic field of an electric circuit device based on the moment method.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Since an unnecessary electric wave emitted by an electric circuit device interferes with TV, radio, or other electric waves, various strict restrictions have been put in place in many countries.
      <br/>
      For example, Japan has issued the VCCI Standard, the U.S. has issued the FCC Standard, and Germany has issued the VDE Standard.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      To meet such electric wave restrictions, various actions should be taken using shielding technologies, filtering technologies, etc.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is necessary to quantitatively simulate these actions to determine the extent to which extent the electric wave can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Since the simulation of the electromagnetic analysis requires a long process time using a computer, it is necessary to prepare a high-speed and high-precision computing apparatus to compute the intensity of the electromagnetic field of an electric circuit device.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In a method of computing the electromagnetic field intensity, the electromagnetic field intensity of an object can be easily computed by a well-known logic equation, given a current flowing through each portion of the object.
      <br/>
      The current value can be logically obtained by solving the Maxwell equations (electromagnetic wave equations) under given conditions.
      <br/>
      However, no exact solution has been obtained by equations under complicated boundary conditions on an object of an optional shape.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Therefore, any solution for obtaining the current used by the electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus refers to, more or less, an approximation.
      <br/>
      A typical approximate computation can be a small loop antenna approximation, a distributed constant line approximation, or a moment method.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In the small loop antenna approximation method, the wiring connecting the wave source circuit and the load circuit is treated as a loop antenna.
      <br/>
      In this approximation, the current through the loop is assumed to be flat and computed by the method of computing the concentrated constant circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="10">FIGS. 1A and 1B illustrate the small loop antenna approximation.</p>
    <p num="11">FIG. 1A shows a circuit model comprising a driver 10 that is a wave source circuit; a receiver 11 that is a load circuit; a wiring 14 connecting the driver 10 to the receiver 11, and a dielectric portion 12 inserted between the grounding wire layer 13 and wiring 14.</p>
    <p num="12">In FIG. 1A, the distance between the driver 10 and receiver 11 is l and the distance between the wiring 14 and the grounding wire layer 13 is h.</p>
    <p num="13">FIG. 1B is a diagram showing the equalizing circuit of the circuit model shown in FIG. 1A.</p>
    <p num="14">
      In FIG. 1B, the driver 10 is represented by an equalizing circuit comprising a power source V, resistor R1, and capacitor C1.
      <br/>
      The receiver 11 can be represented by an equalizing circuit comprising a capacitor C2.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      A line current I flows as a loop as shown in FIG. 1B. The area of the loop is represented by S (=lh).
      <br/>
      The straight line below the line current I shown at the upper portion in FIG. 1B indicates that the line current I is constant (flat) regardless of the position of the line.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The line current I can be computed through a concentrated constant circuit comprising the equalizing circuit of the driver 10 and receiver 11 by the following equation (1).  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="17">Then, using the line current I computed by the above equation (1), a radial electromagnetic field E is computed by the following approximation (2).  (Equation image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="18">As described above, the computation according to the small loop antenna approximation involves a very simple equation, and the computation can be performed at a high speed.</p>
    <p num="19">However, since the line current I is assumed to be constant on the line, the current distribution on the line varies when the frequency f refers to a high frequency, thereby considerably lowering the precision.</p>
    <p num="20">Thus, the computation using the small loop antenna approximation is the simplest method of all the above listed approximations, but in practice it is not used at all because it is inferior in precision if the size of the loop cannot be ignored when compared with the wave length of the electromagnetic wave.</p>
    <p num="21">The distributed constant circuit approximation refers to a method of considering the current distribution to improve the precision.</p>
    <p num="22">The distributed constant circuit approximation refers to a method of obtaining a current value by applying the equation of the distributed constant line to an object to be represented as a one-dimensional structure by an approximation.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The computation can be easily done in this method.
      <br/>
      The computation time and storage capacity are increased in proportion to the number of analysis elements.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the analysis is made including the reflection and resonance of a line, etc.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the distributed constant circuit approximation, a high-speed and high-precision analysis can be made on an object to which a one-dimensional approximation can be applied.
    </p>
    <p num="24">FIGS. 2A and 2B show the above described distributed constant line approximation.</p>
    <p num="25">The circuit model shown in FIG. 2A is the same as that shown in FIG. 1A, and the detailed description is omitted here.</p>
    <p num="26">FIG. 2B shows the equalizing circuit of the circuit shown in FIG. 2A.</p>
    <p num="27">In FIG. 2B, the equalizing circuit of the driver 10 and receiver 11 is the same as that shown in FIG. 1B.</p>
    <p num="28">
      When the frequency f becomes high and the wave length I becomes shorter than the line length l in FIG. 2A, a standing wave current flows through the line and the distribution of the current varies with the line position.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2B, for instance, the value of the line current I is larger on the driver 10 side while the value of the line current I is smaller on the receiver 11 side.
      <br/>
      The value of the line current I at a certain point is represented by I(x) while the voltage at a certain point is represented by V(x), where x indicates a variable representing the distance from the receiver 11, that is, the origin (x=0).
      <br/>
      The driver 10 refers to (x=L).
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In FIG. 2B, "Zo" indicates a characteristic impedance in a distributed constant line. "ZL " indicates a characteristic impedance at the receiver 11. ` BETA ` indicates a wave number and is represented by ( BETA = OMEGA /c=2 PI / LAMBDA ).
      <br/>
      The wave length  LAMBDA  is represented by ( LAMBDA =c/f).
      <br/>
      The `c` indicates the velocity of light.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The current distribution I(x) of the line can be obtained by the following equation (3).  (Equation image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="31">As described above, the computation done using the distributed constant line approximation allows a high-speed and high-precision analysis to be made on an object to be processed as a one-dimensional structure by an approximation.</p>
    <p num="32">However, some objects that cannot be processed as one-dimensional structures by an approximation are not analyzed.</p>
    <p num="33">
      The moment method is one of the solutions of an integral equation derived from the Maxwell electromagnetic wave equations, and can process a 3-dimensional object.
      <br/>
      In this method, an object is divided into small elements to compute an electric current.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Thus, since a 3-dimensional object can be processed by the moment method, an electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus for computing the electromagnetic field intensity of an electric circuit device does computation mainly by the moment method.</p>
    <p num="35">
      In the computation by the moment method, a metal portion to be analyzed is divided into a mesh form to obtain a mutual impedance Zij among the divided metal portions.
      <br/>
      Then, the following moment equation, which governs the mutual impedance Zij, wave source Vi, and electric current Ii flowing through the divided metal portions, is solved to obtain a current value
      <br/>
      �Zij� �Ii�=�Vi�  (4)
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Using the computation result, the electromagnetic field intensity can be obtained.
      <br/>
      The "��" in equation (4) indicates a matrix.
    </p>
    <p num="37">The following reference 1 describes the above mentioned moment method.</p>
    <p num="38">H. N. Wang, J. H. Richmond and M. C. Giilreath:</p>

    </p>
    <p num="40">
      As described above, a current value cannot be obtained in the distributed constant line approximation when an object cannot be processed as a one-dimensional structure.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the entire device including the printed board and the housing cannot be analyzed.
    </p>
    <p num="41">In the moment method, the entire electric circuit device including the printed board and the housing can be analyzed.</p>
    <p num="42">However, the method has the following problems (1) through (5).</p>
    <p num="43">
      (1) When the size of the device to be analyzed becomes large, the amount of computation also becomes large.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the analysis cannot be made within a practical period of time using a current computer.
      <br/>
      (2) The conventional electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus uses the moment method with dielectric portions on the printed board in the electric circuit device divided into a mesh form to obtain simultaneous equations using, and with the equalizing current and magnetic current flowing on the surface set as unknown values.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Therefore, a greater number of patches forming a mesh requires a longer time in solving the simultaneous equations in the moment method and also requires a large memory capacity.
      <br/>
      (3) A long time is required in computing the immittance matrix elements among the divided surface patches in a mesh form.
      <br/>
      (4) The above mentioned mutual impedance Zij has been computed using a double-precision real number to perform a high-speed operation.
      <br/>
      However, this computation cannot output an exact value of the mutual impedance Zij.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In detail, in the computation using the double-precision real numbers, lower-order significant numbers are lost when performing multiplication.
      <br/>
      Therefore, computing the mutual impedance Zij in this method may result in the loss of digits when the electric length (length in emitted magnetic wave length units) of the metallic mesh becomes short.
      <br/>
      As a result, the mutual impedance Zij cannot be obtained exactly.
      <br/>
      (5) The cable pigtail portion (terminating unit of a cable) applicable to the moment method has not been appropriately developed to analyze the electromagnetic radiation from the cable pigtail.
    </p>
    <p num="46">To solve the above listed problem (1), in the Japanese Patent Application Number 6-27109, the Applicant of the present invention has suggested a method of computing current distribution by dividing an electric circuit device to be analyzed into a portion to which the distributed constant line approximation can be applied and a portion to which the approximation cannot be applied, and by computing the current distribution in the distributed constant line approximation for the applicable portion and computing the current distribution in the moment method for the inapplicable portion.</p>
    <p num="47">
      To solve the problem (2), in the Japanese Patent Application Number 6-95363, the Applicant of the present invention has suggested a computing method in which a capacitance model of a transmission line is designed and a dielectric portion is converted into a capacitor having the capacity  DELTA C=C0 ( EPSILON eff-1) per unit length.
      <br/>
      In this method, C0 indicates the capacity per unit length, in a vacuum, of the metallic pattern having the dielectric portion inserted. " EPSILON  eff" indicates an effective dielectric constant.
    </p>
    <p num="48">The method (Japanese Patent Application Number 6-27109) obtained by combining the above described distributed constant line approximation with the moment method, and the method (Japanese Patent Application Number 6-95363) for the capacitance model of a transmission line have been only effective in a circuit of an electric current through a transmission line.</p>
    <p num="49">As a method of reducing the computation time for immittance matrix elements among the surface patches, the method disclosed by the following reference 2 has been conventionally used.</p>

    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In the above mentioned reference 2, if relative positions are equal to each other between the surface patches on a plate to be analyzed, then the mutual impedances are also equal to each other.
      <br/>
      Thus, the mutual impedance is computed between the patches having unique relative positions.
      <br/>
      The result is used for the matrix elements having similar relative positions.
    </p>
    <p num="52">However, in the method described by the reference 2, only the relative positions of the patches on a single board are referred to, but this method does not disclose the reduction of the amount of computation by analyzing the relative positional relationships among the patches on a plurality of plates.</p>
    <p num="53">
      Since the plate to be analyzed can be in various forms, the method of extracting the patches having equal relative positional relationships on one or more plates and then automatically detecting from among them the patches having unique relative positional relationships has not been developed yet.
      <br/>
      Therefore, much time and labor have been required to check the relative positional relationships among the patches and extract the relative positions.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      To solve the problem (4), in the Japanese Patent Application Number 6-95362, the Applicant of the present invention has suggested a computing method in which a normal computing unit and high-precision computing unit are provided to compute the mutual impedance to obtain the electromagnetic field intensity.
      <br/>
      The high-precision computing unit is used when it is anticipated by checking the wave length, element length, and distance that there is a possibility to lose digits.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The above described high-precision computation can be done using real numbers of multiple-precision and using multiple-length integers.
      <br/>
      In either computation, since the number of digits increases, the computation time is greatly extended.
    </p>
    <p num="56">Finally, the above described problem (5) is explained in detail.</p>
    <p num="57">
      An object to be analyzed by the electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus can be a housing, a printed substrate and a cable of an electric circuit device.
      <br/>
      The electric wave radiation from the cable is mainly caused by the pigtail, that is, the terminal processing unit of a cable.
    </p>
    <p num="58">FIGS. 3A through 3C show the radiation mechanism from the pigtail.</p>
    <p num="59">In FIG. 3A, 20 is a coaxial cable, and 21 is a housing of the electric circuit device.</p>
    <p num="60">When the read wire of a pigtail portion is long and the pigtail portion is not shielded, a common mode current I3 is induced when the electromagnetic field generated by line currents I1 and I2 as shown in FIG. 3A is radiated onto the shielded portion of the coaxial cable 20.</p>
    <p num="61">
      In this case, the line current I1 is almost equal to the line current I2 (I1.apprxeq.I2), and the differential mode offsets the electric wave radiation.
      <br/>
      However, the common code current I3 is not offset.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the common code current I3 causes a serious electric wave.
    </p>
    <p num="62">In the case shown in FIG. 3A, the conventional method of computing the electromagnetic field intensity is the method shown in FIG. 3B. In this method, the value of the electric wave radiation is computed by equivalently computing the voltage V generated on the lead line of the pigtail portion and designing an antenna to be inserted between the housing 21 and the coaxial cable 20.</p>
    <p num="63">
      The equivalent circuit is shown in FIG. 3C. In FIG. 3C, Zin indicates an impedance in the coaxial cable 20.
      <br/>
      Z1 indicates the impedance in a pigtail lead line.
      <br/>
      Ra indicates the radiation resistor from the coaxial cable 20.
      <br/>
      An antenna structure is generated using the housing 21 of the electric circuit device as a ground to generate an electric wave.
    </p>
    <p num="64">FIGS. 4A and 4B show the problems in calculating the electromagnetic field intensity of the pigtail portion.</p>
    <p num="65">
      As shown in FIG. 4A, when a load Z0 is connected to the tip of the coaxial cable 20 of a device, the device has a pigtail portion also at a load unit.
      <br/>
      This may cause further electromagnetic wave radiation.
      <br/>
      In this case, no housing is provided at the tip of the coaxial cable 20.
      <br/>
      Therefore, no antenna model can be produced.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Thus, the electric current flowing through the lead line may be analyzed by the moment method without producing an antenna model.
      <br/>
      At this time, the following problems (a) through (c) should be solved.
      <br/>
      (a) How is the shield of the thick and cylindrical coaxial cable 20 connected to a thin pigtail lead line 22?

      (b) How is the coaxial cable 20 connected to the housing 21 if the coaxial cable 20 is directly connected to the housing?
      <br/>
      (c) The electric current through the shield of the coaxial cable 20 normally flows in parallel with the cable, but flows toward a pigtail lead line 22 when the current approaches the pigtail, and changes its flow from the parallel to vertical direction as shown in FIG. 4B. How is the current represented and processed?

    <p num="67">
      As described above, the electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus for computing the electromagnetic field intensity of an electric circuit device according to the moment method conventionally has the above listed problems (1) through (5).
      <br/>
      To solve the problems, the Applicant of the present invention has suggested the above described solution.
    </p>
    <p num="68">However, the suggested solution has been insufficient to precisely compute the electromagnetic field intensity at a high speed.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="69">
      The present invention aims at providing an electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus for precisely calculating the electromagnetic field intensity of the electric circuit device at a high speed according to the moment method.
      <br/>
      It also aims at precisely calculating the electromagnetic field intensity by producing a model of a cable terminal unit.
    </p>
    <p num="70">The first electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus comprises a data input unit for receiving the structure information about the electric circuit device to be analyzed; a ground electric current distribution computing unit for obtaining the ground electric current distribution of the ground layer according to the structure information about the electric circuit device received from the data input unit; a model generating unit for generating a model of a transmission line and a ground layer or a dielectric portion according to the ground electric current distribution obtained by the ground electric current distribution computing unit; and an electromagnetic field intensity computing unit for computing the electromagnetic field intensity of the electric circuit device by the moment method according to the information about the model generated by the model generating unit.</p>
    <p num="71">With the above described configuration, the first electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus obtains the electric current distribution in the ground layer and generates a model to be analyzed according to the ground electric current distribution so that a precise model can be generated and analyzed and the electromagnetic field intensity can be computed precisely.</p>
    <p num="72">The second electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus comprises a data input unit for receiving the structure information about the electric circuit device to be analyzed; an analysis-object dividing unit for assigning a series of patch numbers to patches obtained by dividing at least one plate to be analyzed into smaller elements, that is, the patches; and an electromagnetic field intensity computing unit for computing the mutual impedance between patches having unique relative positions to each other among the patches assigned patch numbers by the analysis-object dividing unit, obtaining for the other patches the mutual impedances between the patches according to the computed mutual impedance, and then computing the electromagnetic field intensity of the electric circuit device by the moment method according to the obtained mutual impedances.</p>
    <p num="73">With the above described configuration, the second electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus automatically extracts the regularity in given structure data and applies the computation results of the mutual impedances of a portion of patches to other portions, thereby considerably reducing the amount of computation when computing the electromagnetic field intensity at a high speed.</p>
    <p num="74">The third electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus comprises a data input unit for receiving the structure information about the electric circuit device to be analyzed; a mutual impedance computing unit for computing the mutual impedance by a predetermined approximation equation obtained according to the characteristics of the object whose mutual impedance is computed and whose elements have short electric length and are relatively distant from each other; an electric current computing unit for producing simultaneous equations for the moment method using the mutual impedance computed by the mutual impedance computing unit, and for computing the value of the electric current flowing through each element; and an electromagnetic field intensity computing unit for computing the electromagnetic field intensity according to the electric current value computed by the electric current computing unit.</p>
    <p num="75">
      With the above described configuration, the third electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus can use more simple equations than the conventional method and therefore can do computation at a high speed by obtaining an approximation equation according to the characteristics of an object whose mutual impedance is computed and whose elements have short electric lengths and are relatively distant from each other when the elements of the analysis-object meet the conditions that the elements have short electric lengths and are distant from each other.
      <br/>
      Since the computation includes no exponential integral in the above described approximation equation, there is a smaller possibility of losing digits, thereby successfully preventing the computation from being deteriorated in precision.
    </p>
    <p num="76">The fourth electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus comprises a data input unit for receiving the structure information about the electric circuit device to be analyzed; a cable pigtail portion extracting unit for extracting the pigtail portion at the end of the coaxial cable according to the structure information about the electric circuit device received from the data input unit; a polygon modelling unit for approximating a coaxial cable shield near the end of the cable using a polygonal cylinder according to the structure information about the pigtail portion extracted by the cable pigtail portion extracting unit, connecting the pigtail lead unit to the approximated polygon, and generating a model obtained by connecting the polygon to the housing of the electric circuit device; and an electromagnetic field intensity computing unit for computing the electromagnetic field intensity of the electric circuit device by the moment method according to the information modelled by the modelling unit.</p>
    <p num="77">With the above described configuration, the fourth electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus approximates the portion near the cylindrical coaxial cable pigtail portion into a polygon to realize the vertical flow of the electric current for connection to each unit, thereby performing precise computation.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="79">The embodiment of the present invention is described by referring to the attached drawings.</p>
    <p num="80">FIGS. 5 through 14 show the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="81">As described above, the conventional method has been effective for a circuit of an electric current, etc., through a transmission line.</p>
    <p num="82">However, when the inventor considers the radiation characteristics of electric waves, the electric wave radiation pattern greatly changes depending on the distribution of the return current of the transmission line flowing through the ground.</p>
    <p num="83">In reverse, if the ground current distribution can be exactly represented, then the precision in radiation characteristics can be considerably improved.</p>
    <p num="84">FIG. 5 is a block diagram showing the configuration of the electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus 100 according to the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="85">
      In FIG. 5, the electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus 100 computes the electromagnetic field intensity of the electric circuit device to be analyzed in the moment method.
      <br/>
      For example, the electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus 100 can be a CPU, memory, etc., as hardware.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      The electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus 100 comprises a data input unit 110; a model generating unit 111; and an electromagnetic field intensity computing unit 116.
      <br/>
      The model generating unit 111 comprises a ground electric current distribution computing unit 112 through a two-dimensional analysis; a computation model selecting unit 113; a distributed constant line modelling unit 114; and a capacitance modelling unit 115.
    </p>
    <p num="87">The data input unit 110 inputs the structure information about the electric circuit device to be analyzed.</p>
    <p num="88">The model generating unit 111 generates a model according to the structure information about the electric circuit device received from the data input unit 110.</p>
    <p num="89">The model generating unit 111 comprises the ground electric current distribution computing unit 112, computation model selecting unit 113, distributed constant line modelling unit 114, and capacitance modelling unit 115.</p>
    <p num="90">The ground electric current distribution computing unit 112 obtains, through two-dimensional analysis other than the moment method, the ground electric current distribution in the ground layer according to the structure information about the electric circuit device to be modelled.</p>
    <p num="91">The computation model selecting unit 113 makes a selection according to the input data or at the instruction of an external unit, for example, from the operator, etc., as to whether a model is generated by the distributed constant line modelling unit 114 or the capacitance modelling unit 115.</p>
    <p num="92">The distributed constant line modelling unit 114 represents a transmission line and a ground layer using a plurality of wires or surface patches, obtains a total value of the return current flowing through the ground layer by the distributed constant line approximation, and generates a model in a way that the current value obtained by the distributed constant line approximation is assigned to each wire or surface patch according to the current distribution obtained by the two-dimensional analysis.</p>
    <p num="93">The capacitance modelling unit 115 represents a ground layer with a plurality of wires or surface patches, adjusts the characteristic impedance between each wire or surface patch and a transmission line so that the ground electric current distribution computed by the ground electric current distribution computing unit 112 through the two-dimensional analysis can be obtained, and generates a model by converting a dielectric portion therebetween into a capacitor having an equal capacity.</p>
    <p num="94">The electromagnetic field intensity computing unit 116 calculates the electromagnetic field intensity of the electric circuit device by the distributed constant line approximation or moment method according to the information modelled by the distributed constant line modelling unit 114 or capacitance modelling unit 115.</p>
    <p num="95">Described below is the operation of the electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus 100 with the above described configuration.</p>
    <p num="96">First, the ground electric current distribution computing unit 112 obtains the ground electric current distribution through two-dimensional analysis other than the moment method.</p>
    <p num="97">The two-dimensional analysis is described later (FIGS. 12, 13, and 14) in the outline of the method, and the detailed description is omitted here.</p>
    <p num="98">
      Then, using the ground electric current distribution obtained through the above described two-dimensional analysis, the moment method is followed.
      <br/>
      Since the two-dimensional analysis can normally be performed within a short time, the precision in radiation characteristics can be improved without a large-scale increase in analysis time.
    </p>
    <p num="99">Then, the distributed constant line modelling unit 114 or the capacitance modelling unit 115 performs a modelling process.</p>
    <p num="100">
      When a model is generated by the distributed constant line modelling unit 114, the sum of the return current flowing through the ground layer is obtained by the distributed constant line approximation.
      <br/>
      The ground electric current distribution is represented by a value obtained through the above described two-dimensional analysis.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      The ground electric current distribution is represented by a plurality of wires.
      <br/>
      Each wire is assigned the value of the ground electric current distribution obtained through the distributed constant line approximation and the two-dimensional analysis.
      <br/>
      It also can be represented by a surface patch instead of wire.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      When a transmission line is modelled by the capacitance modelling unit 115, the characteristic impedance is adjusted between each wire and the transmission line so that the ground electric current distribution obtained through the above described two-dimensional analysis can be obtained.
      <br/>
      The characteristic impedance can be set to a desired value by changing the distance between each wire and the transmission line, and the diameter of each wire.
      <br/>
      In this case, surface patches can replace the wire.
    </p>
    <p num="103">After performing the modelling process by the distributed constant line modelling unit 114 or the capacitance modelling unit 115, the electromagnetic field intensity computing unit 116 computes the electromagnetic field intensity.</p>
    <p num="104">Described below are the surface patches.</p>
    <p num="105">
      In the moment method, the surface of a metallic conductor is divided into a plurality of rectangular or triangular patches that are referred to as surface patches.
      <br/>
      When a model is generated using the surface patches, the size of the surface patches changes with the ground electric current distribution obtained through the two-dimensional analysis.
      <br/>
      To obtain the optimum patch size with precision, the size of the patches is reduced at a portion where changes are made frequently, while it is enlarged at a portion where changes are made moderately.
    </p>
    <p num="106">FIGS. 6A, 6B, and 7A through 7D show examples of modelling processes performed by the model generating unit 111 shown in FIG. 5.</p>
    <p num="107">
      According to the present embodiment, a metallic element is modelled.
      <br/>
      In this example, a ground 122 is distant by h from a transmission line 120 as shown in FIG. 6A. When a capacitance is modelled, a dielectric portion 121 having the dielectric constant  EPSILON r exists between the ground 122 and transmission line 120.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      When the electromagnetic field intensity is computed, the horizontal electric current of the ground 122 is regarded as distribution.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, using the two-dimensional vertical section as shown in FIG. 6B, the horizontal current distribution of the ground 122 is computed by the two-dimensional analysis.
    </p>
    <p num="109">FIG. 6B shows a larger current value near the transmission line 120 in a current distribution as an example of the horizontal current distribution of the ground 122.</p>
    <p num="110">
      The ground electric current distribution can be computed through two-dimensional analysis using various methods excluding the moment method.
      <br/>
      There are several methods as two-dimensional analysis.
      <br/>
      The detailed explanation is given later by referring to FIGS. 12A through 14, and therefore is omitted here.
      <br/>
      The explanation relates to computation within a short time.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      FIGS. 7A and 7B show examples of modelling the objects to be modelled shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B into distributed constant line approximation models.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 7C and 7D show examples of capacitance models.
    </p>
    <p num="112">According to the present embodiment, distributed constant line models and capacitance models are generated.</p>
    <p num="113">
      As shown in FIG. 7A, the distributed constant line models can be line models 130 which are wire-modelled from the transmission lines 120 and wires 132a through 132e which are approximated from the ground 122 to a plurality of wires.
      <br/>
      The number of wires can be optionally determined.
      <br/>
      A greater number of wires results in higher precision, but a longer computation time.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      If the electric current of 1 flows through the transmission line 120, the electric current value is distributed to each wire in a way that a total electric current of 1 flows through the wires 132a through 132e.
      <br/>
      At this time, the electric current value is assigned to each of the wires 132a through 132e according to the ground electric current distribution shown in FIG. 6B.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      In the example shown in FIG. 7A, the electric current value 0.4 is assigned to the wire 132c closest to the transmission line 120.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the electric current value 0.2 is assigned to the wires 132b and 132d.
      <br/>
      The electric current value 0.1 is assigned to the wires 132a and 132e farthest from the transmission line 120.
    </p>
    <p num="116">As shown in FIG. 7B, the ground 122 can be processed as surface patches 142a through 142e, and not approximated to the wires.</p>
    <p num="117">The electric current flowing through each of the surface patches 142a through 142e is, as with the case shown in FIG. 7A, assigned such that the total electric current value is 1.</p>
    <p num="118">
      When the moment method is used, it is also effective to change the patch size depending on the electric current distribution.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 7B, the size of the surface patch 142a closest to the transmission line 120 is set to "small".
      <br/>
      The size of the surface patches 142b and 142d second closest to the transmission line 120 is set to "medium".
      <br/>
      Then, the size of the farthest surface patches 142a and 142e is set to "large".
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      When a capacitance model of a transmission line is generated, the ground layer 122 is modelled into each of the wires 133a through 133e as shown in FIG. 7C. In FIG. 7A, each wire is assigned an electric current value.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 7C, the characteristic impedance is adjusted by changing the distance between each wire and the transmission line 120 and the diameter d1 through d5 of each of the wires 133a through 133e.
    </p>
    <p num="120">A dielectric portion 121 between the transmission line 120 and ground 122 is converted into capacitors C1 through C5 having equal capacity to simplify the simultaneous equations of the moment method.</p>
    <p num="121">As shown in FIG. 7D, the ground layer can be computed as the surface patches 142a through 142e instead of being converted into each of the wires 133a through 133e.</p>
    <p num="122">FIG. 8 is the flowchart showing the process performed by the electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus according to the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="123">
      In FIG. 8, an input data file 150 is used to manage the structure information, etc., about the electric circuit device to be analyzed.
      <br/>
      An output data file 151 stores the data of the electromagnetic field intensity obtained as a computation result.
    </p>
    <p num="124">The processes are described by referring to FIG. 8.</p>
    <p num="125">When the electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus 100 is activated, it reads the structure information about the electric circuit device from the input data file 150, and sets metallic elements and other data (frequency, etc.) as a structure and an array (step S0).</p>
    <p num="126">
      According to the input structure information about the electric circuit device, a model is generated and converted for a portion to be analyzed to compute the electromagnetic radiation (step S1).
      <br/>
      The detailed processes in step S1 are described in detail by referring to FIG. 9.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      When a model is generated or converted in step S1, it is determined whether or not the process for all entered frequencies has been completed by counting the processed frequencies (step S2).
      <br/>
      When the process has been completed (yes in step S2), all processes of computing the electromagnetic field intensity terminate.
      <br/>
      When an unprocessed frequency is detected (no in step S2), the frequency to be processed next is selected from among unprocessed frequencies.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      Then, it is determined whether the object to be analyzed is a portion of a device (hereinafter referred to as simply "a device") to which the distributed constant line approximation is applied, or a device to which the moment method is applied according to the indications in the structure information read in step S0 or the modelling information generated in step S1 (step S3).
      <br/>
      When the distributed constant line approximation is applied, control is passed to step S4.
      <br/>
      When the moment method is applied, control is passed to step S6.
    </p>
    <p num="129">The determination can be made according to the indicators or directly according to the shape of an analysis object and dimensional information, etc.</p>
    <p num="130">
      If it is determined that the distributed constant line approximation is applied in step S3, then the input impedance Zk (k=1.about.n) of each wire is computed (step S4).
      <br/>
      The computation of the input impedance Zk (.tbd.Zin) is performed by the distributed constant line approximation as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      Zin=Z0 (ZL cosh GAMMA  L+Z0 sinh GAMMA L)/(Z0 cosh GAMMA  L+ZL sinh GAMMA  L)

      where Z0 indicates line characteristics impedance,  GAMMA  indicates a propagation constant, L indicates a line length, and ZL indicates a load impedance in the down stream.
    </p>
    <p num="132">The input impedance Zin of the line in the up stream of the line is computed by using as a new ZL the computed input impedance Zin of the line in the down stream.</p>
    <p num="133">For example, if the line is branched into the two impedances Z1in and Z2in, then an impedance is computed according to Ohm's Law as follows.</p>
    <p num="134">Zin=(Z1i*Z2in)/(Z1in+Z2in)</p>
    <p num="135">Then, using the wave source of the uppermost stream and the computed input impedance Zk, the electric current Ik (=Vk/Zk)(k=1.about.n) of each line is computed in order from the up stream for n lines regarded as a device to which the distributed constant line approximation is applied in step S3.</p>
    <p num="136">The computation of the electric current Ik is performed as follows in the distributed constant line approximation.</p>
    <p num="137">
      IB=(VA cosh GAMMA L+Z0 IA sinh GAMMA L)/ZBin

      where Z0 indicates the line characteristic impedances,  GAMMA  indicates a propagation constant, L indicates a line length, ZAin indicates the impedance in the up stream of the line, ZBin indicates the impedance in the down stream of the line, IA indicates the electric current in the up stream of the line, IB indicates the electric current in the down stream of the line, and VA (=ZAin * IA) indicates the wave source in the up stream of the line.
    </p>
    <p num="138">In the computation in steps S4 and S5, the computation result (computed in step S1) of the distributed constant line model shown in FIG. 7A can be used.</p>
    <p num="139">
      For the device to which it is determined in step S3 that the moment method is applied, the mutual impedance Zij (i=1.about.m, j=i.about.m) among m devices determined in step S3 to be the devices to which the moment method is applied is computed using a Green function (step S6).
      <br/>
      The mutual impedance Zik (i=1.about.m, k=i.about.m) is computed between m devices to which it is determined in step S3 that the moment method is applied and n lines to which it is determined in step S3 that the distributed constant line approximation is applied.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      Then, solving the integral equation in the moment method using the value computed in steps 5 and 6 the electric current Ii (i=1.about.m) of the device to which a Moment method is applied (step S7) is calculated.
      <br/>
      That is, the electric current Ii (i=1.about.m) of the device to which the moment method is applied is computed by solving the integral equation by the moment method using the electric current Ik computed in step S5 for the device to which the distributed constant line approximation is applied, the mutual impedances Zij and Zik computed in step S6, and the voltage value Vi (i=1.about.m) that is the wave source of the moment method specified by the structure information.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      In the above described computation process, the mutual impedance Zik is used only in a matrix operation with the electric current Ik computed in step S5.
      <br/>
      The electric current Ik is used only in computing the wave source induced in the device to which the moment method is applied.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      That is, when the moment method is applied to the entire electric circuit device to be analyzed in the conventional method, integral equations are solved according to the moment method using a mutual impedance of "(n+m) * (n+m)". On the other hand, the present invention solves integral equations according to the moment method using only the mutual impedance Zin of "m * m".
      <br/>
      Therefore, the integral equations can be solved at a high speed.
      <br/>
      Since the mutual impedance is a symmetrical matrix, the amount of computation can be actually reduced by half.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      Thus, the electric current Ik of the device to which the distributed constant line approximation is applied is computed in step S5.
      <br/>
      When the electric current Ii of the device to which the moment method is applied is computed in step S7, it is determined by counting the process observation points whether or not the processes associated with all entered observation points have been completed (step S8).
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      If the processes are not completed, the electromagnetic field intensity provided for the observation points by the electric current Ik computed in step S5 and the electric current Ii computed in step S7 is computed using the electric currents Ik and Ii, and the computation result is stored in the output data file 151 (step S9).
      <br/>
      Then, control is returned to the process in step S8, and the processes in steps S8 and S9 are repeatedly performed until the processes associated with all the observation points have been completed.
    </p>
    <p num="145">If the computation of the electromagnetic field has been completed for all observation points, then control is returned to the process in step S2, and the processes are likewise repeated for the next frequency.</p>

      In most cases, the grounding layer of a multi-layer printed plate, the top plate, bottom plate, side plate, etc., of a personal computer housing, etc., of the electric circuit device to be analyzed can be modelled as a regular array of rectangular patches.

      Therefore, if the regularity of given structure data is automatically extracted and a portion of the computation results can be transferred to other portions, then the amount of computation can be considerably reduced.

      From the above described viewpoint, the electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus according to the second embodiment reduces the amount of computation by actively providing the regularity for the three-dimensional structure of a device to be analyzed.

      Assuming that a metallic plate 221 is divided into surface patches 220 of "m rows * n columns", the number of 2-patch sets of all patches is computed as follows.

      (m * n) * (m * n)=m2 n2

    <p num="231">
      According to the second embodiment, the mutual impedance is computed, by detecting the regularity, only for the sets of the patches whose relative positions are unique, not for all of the above described sets.
      <br/>
      For example, if the mutual impedance between the surface patch 220a and the m * n patches (including the patch) is computed, the result can be used as the mutual impedance among the patches having the same relative positions.
      <br/>
      For example, the mutual impedance between the surface patch 220b and other patches (including the patch, that is, including the self-impedance) can be obtained by changing, if necessary, the order and symbol of the value of the mutual impedance between the surface patch 220a and other patches.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the amount of computation is m * n, and it is reduced to one mn-th (=mn/m2 n2).

      <br/>
      The number of sets of all patches between one patch in the metallic plate 221c and one patch in the metallic plate 221d is obtained by the following equation.

      (m * n) * (m * k)=m2 nk

      When the mutual impedance is computed between each of the surface patches 220d, 220e, and 220f in the metallic plate 221d and each patch in the metallic plate 221c, a set of one patch in the metallic plate 221c and one patch in the metallic plate 221d necessarily indicate equal relative positions.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the mutual impedance computed for the surface patches 220d through 220f can be applied, and the amount of computation can be reduced from m2 nk to mnk.

      The amount of computation is one m-th (mnk/m2 nk) of the original amount.

      That is, the patch numbers are assigned in ascending order from the leftmost patch of the metallic plate 221 toward the right.

      The above described patch attribute is patch information, for example, a patch shape, material, etc., relating to what has an influence on the electromagnetic field intensity.
      <br/>
      In the example shown in FIG. 19B, the patch attribute of the patch 220-1 assigned the patch number 1 is read.
    </p>
    <p num="247">
      The patch attribute of the patch assigned the next patch number (for example, 2) (step S33).

    <p num="248">
      Then, it is determined whether or not the current patch is horizontally adjacent to the next patch. (step S34).

      If it is not (no in step S34), control is passed to step S38.
      <br/>
      If it is (yes in step S34), then it is determined whether or not the current patch as the same patch attribute as the next patch (step 35).
      <br/>
      That is, it is determined whether or not they have the same attribute, for example, the same shape, material, etc.
      <br/>
      If they do not (no in step S35), then control is passed to step S38.

    <p num="249">
      If they have the same patch attribute (yes in step S35), then 1 is added to the horizontal counter n (step S36).
      <br/>
      Then, adding 1 to the current patch number (adding 1 to 1 in the present example) (step S37) returns control to the process in step S33 with the next patch set as the current patch.
      <br/>
      Then, the above described processes are repeated.
    </p>
    <p num="250">
      Thus, the patches 220-1 through 220-4 are sequentially checked in order of patch numbers as shown in FIG. 19B. Since the patch assigned the number 220-4 has no adjacent patch (the next patch is not adjacent to the current patch), control is passed from step S34 to step S38.
      <br/>
      If the same attribute is not detected, control is passed from step S35 to step S38.
    </p>
    <p num="251">In the process in step S38, it is determined whether or not the next patch is vertically adjacent to the leftmost patch of the current patch.</p>
    <p num="252">If it is not (no in step S38), then control is passed to step S43.</p>
    <p num="253">If it is (yes in step S38), it is determined whether or not they have the same attribute (step S39).</p>
    <p num="254">If they do not (no in step S39), then control is passed to step S43.</p>
    <p num="255">
      If they do (yes in step S39), then it is checked whether or not the value of the horizontal counter n is accepted, and the value is stored (step S40).
      <br/>
      Then the value is initialized again to n=l.
      <br/>
      For example, when the value n stored in the previous horizontal scanning is smaller than the value n obtained in the current scanning, the smaller value n is stored to recognize the regular area as a rectangle, thereby simplifying the management.
    </p>
    <p num="256">
      Next, 1 is added to the vertical counter m (step S41) and to the current patch number to set the next patch as the current patch (step S42).

      Thus, the next row is scanned as shown in FIG. 19C.

    <p num="257">
      If the patch next to the patch assigned the number 12 is not adjacent to the patch 12 or 9 as shown in FIG. 19D, or does not have the same attribute as the patches, the process in step S43 is performed.
      <br/>
      That is, it is recognized that regular patches exist in the range of m rows by n columns and the regularity management numbers are assigned to the patches.
      <br/>
      A regularity number comprises a structure identification number uniquely assigned to a regular portion and an internal identification number uniquely assigned to each of the patches.

      In the example shown in FIG. 19D, a patch having the regularity of 3 rows by 4 columns is detected.

      That is, an area encompassed by a polygon and its inscribed circle (cylinder) is generated, and a bridge current flows toward the center of the cylinder in the area.
      <br/>
      Since the bridge current at the boundary is assumed to be even and vertical to the electric current flowing through the polygon/cylinder, it is not counted in the computation of the mutual impedance.

      In FIGS. 34A and 34B, the coaxial cable 440 is an octagonal model generated in the exact modelling process and directly connected to the housing 441 by a clamp 450.

      As shown in FIG. 34B, the clamp 450 is also approximated by a polygon as an object of the moment method, thereby realizing a precise computation.

    <p num="419">FIGS. 35A and 35B show an example of the simple modelling process according to the fourth embodiment.</p>
    <p num="420">The simple modelling unit 424 shown in FIG. 32 models a coaxial cable pigtail portion as shown in FIGS. 35A and 35B.</p>
    <p num="421">The exact modelling process as shown in FIGS. 33A through 34B is expected to yield a considerably high precision, but processes a number of surface patches and has complicated input of data.</p>
    <p num="422">On the other hand, when the simple modelling process is performed using only wires as shown in FIGS. 35A and 35B, the computation time is short and data input can be simplified.</p>
    <p num="423">In the simple modelling process, a coaxial cable shield 460 is connected to the pigtail lead line 442 through a vertical electric current wire 461 with a small clearance of, for example, 0.001 m through 0.01 m as shown in FIG. 35A. Thus, the pigtail lead line 442 is connected to the coaxial cable shield 460, and the vertical electric current can be properly represented.</p>
    <p num="424">
      As shown in FIG. 35B, the coaxial cable shield 460 is connected to the housing 441 through a housing cable connecting wire 462.
      <br/>
      When the coaxial cable 440 is directly connected to the housing 441, the length of the housing cable connecting wire 462 is shortened (for example, 0.001 m through 0.01 m), and the diameter of the wire is made equal to that of the coaxial cable shield 460.

    <p num="426">FIG. 36 is a flowchart showing the operations of the electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus 400 according to the fourth embodiment.</p>
    <p num="427">
      In FIG. 36, an input data file 470 manages the structure information, etc., about the electric circuit device to be analyzed.
      <br/>
      An output data file 480 stores computation results for electromagnetic field intensity.
    </p>
    <p num="428">When the electromagnetic field intensity computing apparatus 400 is activated, it first reads the structure information about the electric circuit device from the input data file 470, and sets metallic elements and other data (frequency, etc.) as a structure and an array (step S91).</p>
    <p num="429">
      Then, according to the input structure information about the electric circuit device, a model is generated and converted to compute the electric wave radiation from a pigtail portion (step S92).
      <br/>
      This process is described later by referring to FIG. 37.
    </p>
    <p num="430">Then, it is determined by counting the processed frequency whether or not the process has been completed for all entered frequencies (step S93).</p>
    <p num="431">If it has (yes in step S93), the electromagnetic field intensity computing process terminates.</p>
    <p num="432">When unprocessed frequencies exist (no in step S93), one frequency to be processed next is selected from among the unprocessed frequencies, and the wave length  LAMBDA  of the selected frequency is computed (step S94).</p>
    <p num="433">Then, a set of element i (i=1 through m) and element j (j=1 through m) is generated from m metallic elements to sequentially compute the mutual impedance Zij (step S95), and the mutual impedance Zij is computed for use in the simultaneous equation in the moment method (step S96).</p>
    <p num="434">Then, it is determined whether or not the computation of the mutual impedance Zij has been completed for all element sets (step S97).</p>
    <p num="435">If it has not (no in step S97), then the processes in step S95 and S96 are repeated.</p>
    <p num="436">
      If it has (yes in step S97 ), then the following simultaneous equation in the moment method is derived using the computed mutual impedance Zij and the wave source Vi read from the input data file 470.

      <br/>
      where the electric current Ii flowing through the metallic elements is unknown.
      <br/>
      The electric current Ii flowing through the metallic elements is obtained by solving the above described equation.
    </p>
    <p num="437">Then, after counting the processed observation points, it is determined whether or not the process has been completed for all entered observation points (step S99).</p>

      If it has not (no in step S99), then the electromagnetic field intensity of the computed electric current Ii is computed by a predetermined equation (step S100).
      <br/>
      The computation result is stored in the output data file 480, and then control is returned to the process in step S99 and the processes in steps S99 and S100 are repeated until the electric and magnetic fields have been computed for all the observation points.
    </p>
    <p num="439">If the above described processes have been completed for all the observation points (yes in step S99), then control is returned to step S93 and the similar processes are repeated for the next unprocessed frequency.</p>
    <p num="440">The mutual impedance Zij in step S96 and the electric and magnetic fields in step S98 are computed by the conventional methods and the detailed explanation is omitted here.</p>
    <p num="441">FIG. 37 is a flowchart showing in detail the model generating and converting process in step S92 shown in FIG. 36.</p>
    <p num="442">In FIG. 37, a pigtail portion at the end of a coaxial cable is extracted according to the input structure information about the electric circuit device (step S110).</p>
    <p num="443">
      Then, an exact model or a simple model using a wire is selected according to input data or external specification (step S111).
      <br/>
      If an exact model is selected, control is passed to step S112.
      <br/>
      If a simple model using a wire is selected, control is passed to step S116.
    </p>
    <p num="444">
      If an exact model is selected, a polygon is generated as a polygonal model enclosing the cylinder of the coaxial cable 440 shown in FIG. 33A (step S112).
      <br/>
      The polygon can be a hexagon, octagon, etc.
      <br/>
      It may be selected according to the external input.
    </p>
    <p num="445">Next, the polygon is connected to the cylinder coaxial portion (step S113).</p>
    <p num="446">
      Then, the transmission line is connected to the polygon (step S114).
      <br/>
      That is, as shown in FIG. 33A, the pigtail lead line 442 is connected to one side of the polygonal model of the coaxial cable 440.
      <br/>
      The polygon is also connected to the housing 441.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, if the coaxial cable 440 is directly connected to the housing 441 with a clamp, the housing 441 is connected to the clamp patch (the clamp 450 approximated using a polygon) as shown in FIGS. 34A and 34B (step S115).
    </p>
    <p num="447">
      If a simple model using a wire has been selected in step S111, then the vertical electric current wire 461 is generated as shown in FIGS. 35A and 35B (step S116).
      <br/>
      Then, the vertical electric current wire 461 is connected to the coaxial cable shield 460 (step S117).
      <br/>
      The vertical electric current wire 461 is also connected to the transmission line (pigtail lead line 442) (step S118).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the housing cable connecting wire 462 is generated to connect the coaxial cable shield 460 to the housing 441 (step S119).
    </p>
    <p num="448">The above described modelling process is performed on all cable pigtail portions extracted from the input data.</p>
    <p num="449">According to the fourth embodiment of the present invention, the moment method can be applied not only to all portions of an electric circuit device but also to only a portion of the device.</p>
    <p num="450">As described above, the electric wave radiation from a pigtail portion can be simulated with high precision in computing the electromagnetic field intensity by the moment method according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention, thereby computing the electromagnetic field intensity of an electric circuit device at a high speed and with high precision.</p>
