    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to cartridges for guns and, more particularly, to a cartridge case former and method of forming a cartridge case for a cartridge.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      It is known to provide cartridges for guns.
      <br/>
      Typically, the cartridge includes a cylindrical case made from a brass cylinder, which has a rim with a primer pocket, extractor groove, body, tapered shoulder, neck and mouth.
      <br/>
      The cartridge also includes a primer disposed in the primer pocket, powder disposed within the body and a bullet disposed in the end of the neck.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The cartridge cases are manufactured in standard sizes.
      <br/>
      However, some gun operators desire non-standard or "special" cartridges for shooting.
      <br/>
      To make such cartridges, a standard cartridge case is put into a cartridge-resizing die and the neck is expanded or contracted.
      <br/>
      The neck may then be reamed internally or externally with a reamer to a desired size.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Although the above special cartridge cases have worked well, they suffer from the disadvantage that several dies and reamers are required to size the neck.
      <br/>
      Another disadvantage is that the resizing is labor intensive and relatively costly.
      <br/>
      As a result, there is a need in the art to provide a device and method for forming a neck of a cartridge case to a desired size.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">It is, therefore, one object of the present invention to provide a cartridge case former.</p>
    <p num="8">It is another object of the present invention to provide a cartridge case former which roll forms a neck of a cartridge case to a predetermined size.</p>
    <p num="9">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method of roll forming a neck of a cartridge case.</p>
    <p num="10">
      To achieve the foregoing objects, the present invention is a cartridge case former.
      <br/>
      The cartridge case former includes a front arbor plate, a back arbor plate and a plurality of arbors extending between the front arbor plate and the back arbor plate.
      <br/>
      The cartridge case former also includes a rotatable roller die disposed about each arbor for roll forming a neck of a cartridge case.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Additionally, the present invention is a method of roll forming a neck of a cartridge case.
      <br/>
      The method includes the steps of providing a cartridge case, providing a plurality of roller dies and rotating at least either the cartridge case or the roller dies.
      <br/>
      The method also includes the steps of moving the cartridge case between the roller dies and reducing the neck of the cartridge case to a predetermined size.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      One advantage of the present invention is that a cartridge case former is provided for forming a cartridge case.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of the present invention is that the cartridge case former forms a neck of a standard cartridge case to a non-standard predetermined size.
      <br/>
      Yet another advantage of the present invention is that the cartridge case former roll forms a standard cartridge case to make a non-standard or special cartridge case.
      <br/>
      Still another advantage of the present invention is that a method is provided of roll forming a neck of a cartridge case.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood after reading the subsequent description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p>
