    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a glass clear heavy gauge sheet with copolyester which has excellent transparency and all properties with cheap production cost.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Polyethyleneterephthalate (hereinafter called "PET") resin having been utilized in PET bottle, garment fiber, film and other vast fields due to its excellence of properties, processing, and economical aspects.
      <br/>
      It has been radically increased to use the PET resin as packing material based on its excellent mechanical properties, chemical resistance and recyclability.
      <br/>
      Sheet is one prevalently used among other fields, especially thin sheet(thinner than 1 mm) for vacuum forming.
      <br/>
      The polyester sheet thicker than 1 mm, however, is not easy for producing due to its crystallization and melt viscosity.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      In order to produce thick sheet(hereinafter called "thick sheet") with polymeric material, the polymeric material needs to have properties of low crystallization speed and low crystallization degree with proper high melting viscosity in order to maintain forming stability in melting condition.
      <br/>
      A new trial for the purpose of satisfying these properties, was to produce a modified polyester by copolymerization.
    </p>
    <p num="6">There are two methods in producing the modified polyester as follow:</p>
    <p num="7">
      First of all, substitute the some part of terephthalate moiety used as acid component during PET polymerization, such as Dimethylterephthalate (hereinafter called "DMT") or Terephthalic Acid (hereinafter called "TPA") with Diacid or Diacidester.
      <br/>
      As for Diacid or Diacidester, Isophthalic Acid (hereinafter called "IPA") or Dimethylisophthalate (hereinafter called "DMI") are applied mainly.
      <br/>
      This method, in other words, is producing polyester copolymer by polymerizing �i� DMT or TPA, �ii� DMI or EPA and �iii� Ethyleneglycol (hereinafter called "EG").
    </p>
    <p num="8">As expressed in following formula (I) and (II), TPA and IPA are same in their structure only except the position of functioning radical attached to Benzene chain.  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="9">�Formula (I) means TPA and formula (II) means IPA�</p>
    <p num="10">Since the reactivity of EPA in reaction circle during PET polymerization is fairly good, it reacts very well to some extent mol %. Since the copolyester, polymerized by some mol % of IPA or DMI, has the structure of formula (IV), it is different from homo PET which has the structure of formula (III).  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="11">According to the structural differences, the copolyester of formula (IV) has the effects of decreasing crystallization speed and crystallization degree since the interference to regularity of molecular chain during crystallization.</p>
    <p num="12">
      However, in proportion to the increase of EPA or DMI content, some properties of resin shall be suddenly deteriorated.
      <br/>
      In case, minimizing the IPA or DMI content for the purpose of preventing the deterioration of properties, it would not be possible to have the effects of sufficiently low crystallization rate.
      <br/>
      Because of this problem, the copolyester of formula (IV) constituted of around 3 mol % of EPA or DMI, is used only for producing thick bottle or thin sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The second method is to substitute the some part of Ethyleneglycol used as one of the essential monomer applied during PET production with 1,4-Cyclohexandimethanol (hereinafter called "CHDM").
      <br/>
      In other words, after preparing polyester copolymer by polymerizing �i� DMT or TPA, �ii� EG and �iii� CHDM, produce transparent and thick copolyester sheet by utilizing this polyester copolymer.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Since the length of CHDM molecule, having the structure of formula (V), is longer than that of EG, it disturbs the regularity of the molecule chain, and then decrease the crystallization rate and the crystallinity.</p>
    <p num="15">Furthermore, as the molecular chain of CHDM, like EPA, is not clamped, the reactivity and properties of polymer would not be deteriorated, and has high melt viscosity required for producing thick sheet even though the CHDM content increases  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="16">In order to obtain the properties, which enable to form the transparent and thick sheet, such as low crystallization rate, low crystallinity and high melt viscosity, it is necessary to use CHDM up to of 30 mol %. As a result, the producing cost comes to be very expensive and this is the limit in practical use.</p>
    <p num="17">
      Although, it is indispensable to have high molecular weight in order to obtain enough mechanical properties, if CHDM is polymerized in large quantity, there is no way except to raise molecular weight in the melt polymerization due to its amorphous phase by CHDM.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in order to obtain the high molecular weight, fairly good effort is needed to use with specially designed polymerization plant.
      <br/>
      Eastman Chemical Co. produces polyester copolymer by the second method, and sells them as common name "PETG" and also as trademark "SPECTAR".

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="18">The present invention relates to a glass clear heavy gauge sheet with copolyester, having excellent transparency and all properties with cheap production cost, suitable for transparent soundproof wall and window glass substitute of the buildings.</p>
    <p num="19">More particularly, the present invention relates to a glass clear heavy gauge sheet with copolyester, having over than 83% of lights transmittance and lower than 5% of Haze, prepared by copolymer wherein polymerized �A� the acid component comprising (i) terephthalate moiety as major component and (ii) essentially including 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate moiety, and (iii) selectively including isophthalate moiety with �B� the glycol component of (i) ethyleneglycol (EG) itself or (ii) the mixture of ethyleneglycol (EG) and 1,4-cyclohexandimethanol (CHDM).</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="20">The present invention is characterized by essentially applying 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate moiety as a part of acid component during polymerization, and at the same time selectively using isophthalate moiety in order to control specific thermodynamic requirements for forming transparent and thick sheet.</p>
    <p num="21">The present invention also characterized by selectively applying 1,4-cyclohexandimethanol (CHDM) as a part of glycol component.</p>
    <p num="22">
      In the present invention, dimethylterephthalate (DMT) or terephthalic acid (TPA) is mainly used as terephthalate moiety.
      <br/>
      Also, dimethyl-2, 6-Naphthalenedicarboxylate (hereinafter called "NDC") or 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid (hereinafter called "NDA") is mainly used as dimethyl-2, 6-naphthalenedicarboxylate moiety.
      <br/>
      As for isophthalate moiety, isophthal acid (IPA) or dimethylisophthalate (DMI) is used mainly.
    </p>
    <p num="23">For the purpose of producing transparent and thick sheet with polymer such as copolyester, following fundamental properties are required:</p>
    <p num="24">Firstly, thermal stability that molecular chain is not easily decomposed in melting condition is required since the material is processed in melting condition.</p>
    <p num="25">
      Secondly, high melt viscosity for maintaining the form as thick sheet in melting condition is required.
      <br/>
      However, if the melt viscosity is too high, it will be difficult to process.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the melting viscosity shall be high enough within the possible extent of processing.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Thirdly, sufficiently low crystallization is required.
      <br/>
      The thicker thickness sheet gets, the harder sheet cools.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in order to prevent the crystallizing which deteriorates the transparency of sheet, low crystallization rate is favorable and it is better if the material itself has low crystallinity.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In case, certain material partly meets the requirements among above, it is difficult to produce thick sheet.
      <br/>
      So, material needs to meet all possible properties.
    </p>
    <p num="28">The present invention will be illustrated more particularly hereunder.</p>
    <p num="29">After preparing the copolyester resin by melt polymerization �A� the acid component comprising (i) terephthalate moiety TPA or DMT is used as major component, (ii) essentially contains 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate moiety NDC or NDA, and (iii) selectively contains isophthalate moiety IPA or DMI with �B� the glycol component of (i) EG itself or (ii) the mixture of EG and CHDM, then produce thick sheet by extrusion of prepared copolyester.</p>
    <p num="30">In the present invention, dimethyl-2, 6-naphthalenedicarboxylate (NDC) used as acid component, has the structure of formula (VI), and 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxyl acid (NDA) has the structure of formula (VII).  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="31">NDC or NDA, as shown above, is mostly used to prepare polyethylenenaphthalate (hereinafter called "PEN") by polycondensation with EG.  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="32">
      PEN shows very excellent characteristics than PET in almost all properties such as heat resistance, UV protection, gas barrier, mechanical strength and hydrolysis resistance.
      <br/>
      However, the price of NDC or NDA, the main material, is expensive, and the difficulty in producing, the practical application of PEN is limited to the area such as high performance film of video tape and special purpose container.
      <br/>
      Recently, a method of copolymerization or blending with PET were introduced to secure the competitiveness against price, but the scope of invention is restricted to some fields yet.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Meanwhile, the purpose of present invention is not to improve the existing characteristics such as heat resistance or UV protection, but to use NDC or NDA as comonomer for the purpose of controlling the thermodynamic peculiarity which is necessary for forming the transparent and thick sheet.
      <br/>
      That is to say, NDC or NDA is used as comonomer in order to decrease crystallization rate and low crystallinity properly for producing transparent and thick sheet, and securing melting viscosity in maintaining intensity for ease forming in melting condition.
    </p>
    <p num="34">More particularly, the present invention is to prepare random copolyester resin, having 0.70.about 0 (slashed zero) 90 of inherent viscosity, by melt polymerization �A� the glycol component of (i) EG or (ii) mixture of EG and CHDM with �B� the acid component comprising (i) NDC or NDA and (ii) DMT or TPA, or comprising (i) NDC or NDA, (ii) DMT or TPA and (iii) IPA or DMI.</p>
    <p num="35">In case, polymerizing �A� the acid ingredient composed of (i) TPA or DMT and (ii) NDC or NDA, with �B� the glycol ingredient of (i) EG or (ii) mixture of EG and CHDM, random copolyester resin of formula (IX) shall be prepared as follow:  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="36">
      During melt copolymerization, the favorable content of 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate moiety against total acid component shall be less than 20 mol %, but the content shall not be specially restricted.
      <br/>
      However, in general, the crystallization of resin itself shall be proportionally lowered by much content of 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate moiety.
      <br/>
      It is possible to adjust the inherent viscosity of resin by solid state polymerization after melt polymerization if the crystallization rate of resin itself comes lowered due to too much 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate moiety.
    </p>
    <p num="37">During copolymerization, the favorable content of isophthalate moiety against total acid component shall be 0.5.about.5 mol %. In the mean time, if EG and CHDM is applied at the same time as glycol component, the favorable content of CHDM moiety against total acid component shall be less than 15 mol %.</p>
    <p num="38">
      In the random copolyester resin structure of formula (IX), if NDC or NDA is used instead of TPA or DMT, and CHDM is used instead of EG, then the length of unit structure will be longer but the angle of molecular chain remains unchanged.
      <br/>
      In this case, its structure is more like aforementioned PETG, the brand name of Eastman Chemical Co. rather than the structure of formula (IV).
      <br/>
      Consequently, the mechanism which affects to crystallization property shall be similar to PETG, the brand name of Eastman Chemical Co., and it is easier to form the thick copolyester sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Said partial inequality of molecular chain functions as obstruction factor in crystal forming, which requires equality, it delays the crystallization and decrease the crystallinity at the same time.
      <br/>
      Together with said effects, the reactivity shall not be deteriorated during polymerization reaction, it shall be easy to polymerize, and the properties shall be more improved because the PEN property has been added to PET or PETG property.
      <br/>
      As a result, the copolyester resin of the present invention prepared by aforesaid method is enables to form the transparent and thick copolyester sheet easily because the copolyester resin meets the all thermodynamic characteristics required in the process of glass clear heavy gauge sheet with copolyester.
    </p>
    <p num="40">In the following, put the said copolyester resin into extruder, and then produce the glass clear heavy gauge sheet with copolyester of the present invention by extrusion of the said resin.</p>
    <p num="41">The lights transmittance of the glass clear heavy gauge sheet with copolyester of the present invention is over than 83%, and its Haze is below than 5%.</p>
    <p num="42">In addition, the heat of cooling crystallization ( DELTA Hmc) of the glass clear heavy gauge sheet with copolyester of the present invention is below than 1.0 J/g, and its refractive index of visible lights is 1.35.about.1.70</p>
    <p num="43">Since the heat of cooling crystallization ( DELTA Hmc) of the glass clear heavy gauge sheet with copolyester of the present invention is high, crystallization during polymer cooling shall be proceeded actively.</p>
    <p num="44">Also, the melt viscosity, measured in Shear rate of 1,000 sec-1 at the temperature of 270 (degree)  C., of the glass clear heavy gauge sheet with copolyester of the present invention is 900.about.8,000 Poise, and the melt viscosity, measured in Shear rate of 100 sec-1 at the temperature of 270 (degree)  C. is 1,700.about.30,000 Poise, and thickness is thicker than 1 mm, more favorably thicker than 3 mm.</p>
    <p num="45">Each properties of the glass clear heavy gauge sheet with copolyester of the present invention, as illustrated above, is measured by following method:</p>
    <p num="46">Haze (%) and Lights Transmittance (%)</p>
    <p num="47">After cutting the certain part of the glass clear heavy gauge sheet with copolyester measure with Haze Meter (product of Nippon Denshoku, NDH-300A-Japan)</p>
    <p num="48">Heat of Cooling Crystallization (J/g)</p>
    <p num="49">After fixing the glass clear heavy gauge sheet with copolyester more than 3 minute at 290 (degree)  C., measure the Heat of Cooling Crystallization by DSC at the cooling speed of 20 (degree)  C. per minute.</p>

    <p num="101">
      First, ease of producing glass clear heavy gauge sheet with copolyester sheet since its possibility on controlling the melting viscosity.
      <br/>
      Based on the extensive changes in melting viscosity according to the content quantity of 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate moiety (NDC or NDA) and CHDM, and on the wide range in controlling content quantity of 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate moiety (NDC or NDA) and CHDM, the present invention can support to produce the various characteristics of copolyesters.
