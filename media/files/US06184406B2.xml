    <p num="1">The invention relates to aqueous stable emulsions which comprise organohydropolysiloxanes and to a process for preparing them.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="2">Aqueous emulsions comprising organohydropolysiloxanes and the uses thereof are widely known, such as, for example, for the preparation of antiadhesion silicone coatings on paper or film by means of crosslinking reaction (hydrosilylation), the preparation of water-repellent coatings by means of crosslinking reaction (condensation), hydrophobicizing impregnation of textiles, leather or paper, as release agents for bladder coating in tire manufacture, and for the hydrophobicization of building materials.</p>
    <p num="3">
      The stability of organohydropolysiloxane emulsions is a problem, owing to the susceptibility of the Si-H bond to hydrolysis.
      <br/>
      The reaction with water in this case frequently gives rise to silanol groups and gaseous hydrogen.
      <br/>
      Measures to improve the stability of organchydropolysiloxane emulsions and to reduce the elimination of hydrogen have already been described.
    </p>
    <p num="4">In Melliand Textilberichte 41, 1125 (1960) it is disclosed that methylhydropolysiloxane emulsions show a stability optimum at an established pH of 3.5-4 depending on the acid used.</p>
    <p num="5">
      The stabilization of specific alkylhydropolysiloxane emulsions prepared using cationic emulsifier, by adding aminocarboxylic acids and establishing a pH at 2.5-5, is described in DE-B 1 161 419 (Bayer AG, issued Jan. 16, 1964).
      <br/>
      DE-A 21 57 580 (Rhone Poulenc S.A., issued Jun. 22, 1972) and the corresponding GB-A 1336195 claim specific amino acid derivatives for stabilizing alkylhydropolysiloxane emulsions.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The addition of water-soluble, saturated aliphatic aldehydes having at least two C atoms for stabilizing emulsions containing organohydropolysiloxanes is described in DE-B 1 215 929 (Wacker-Chemie GmbH, issued May 5, 1966).
      <br/>
      EP-B-43 985 (Bayer AG, issued Oct. 3, 1984) discloses alkylhydropolysiloxane emulsions having improved low-temperature and gassing stability, which is achieved by adding trihydric alcohols and mono- or dihydric alcohols.
    </p>
    <p num="7">EP-B 314 955 (General Electric Co., issued Jan. 11, 1995) claims the stabilization of emulsions of organopolysiloxanes containing hydrogen groups by adding hydroxy-functional organopolysiloxanes, preferably at neutral pH.</p>

      The aqueous emulsions of the invention preferably comprise those which comprise
      <br/>
      (A) from 1 to 70% by weight, preferably from 5 to 60% by weight, of organopolysiloxanes, i.e. organohydropolysiloxanes alone or in a mixture with organopolysiloxanes free from Si-bonded hydrogen and organyloxy groups,

    <p num="66">The pH of the emulsions of the invention lies preferably within the neutral to acidic pH range, with particular preference at a pH of from 3 to 4.</p>
    <p num="67">The preparation of the emulsions of the invention by mixing the components (A) to (D) and, if desired, (E) can take place in a sequence which is arbitrary per se using equipment which is also used hitherto for the preparation of emulsions.</p>
    <p num="68">A further subject matter of the invention is a process for preparing emulsions, characterized in that (A) organohydropolysiloxanes alone or in a mixture with organopolysiloxanes free from Si-bonded hydrogen and organyloxy groups, (B) organopolysiloxanes containing organyloxy groups, emulsifiers, (D) water and also, if desired, (E) additives are mixed with one another.</p>
    <p num="69">
      The emulsions of the invention are preferably prepared by initially introducing the emulsifiers (C) and mixing them, if desired, with a little water and subsequently incorporating the emulsion constituents (A) and (B); finally, the (remaining) water (D) is incorporated.
      <br/>
      The additives (E) are preferably added together with the (remaining) water (D), or else if desired are already introduced initially together with the emulsifiers (C).
    </p>
    <p num="70">In connection with the preparation of the emulsions of the invention it is advantageous to use organopolysiloxanes (B), which are liquid at room temperature and contain organyloy groups, having a low viscosity, since the organopolysiloxanes containing organyloxy groups can accordingly be metered in simply during the preparation operation; the preparation of a premix of component A and organopolysiloxanes containing organyloxy groups is in this case unnecessary.</p>
    <p num="71">Examples of mixing equipment which can be used in connection with the process of the invention are stirrers, such as blade, bar, anchor, grid, screw, propeller, disk, impeller, turbine, planetary stirrers, single- and twin-screw mixers, mixing turbines, colloid mills, ultrasonic mixers, in-line mixers, crown gear dispersing equipment, pumps, homogenizers, such as high-pressure, turbine and circulation homogenizers.</p>
    <p num="72">The process of the invention is preferably carried out at a temperature of from 10 to 50 (degree)  C. and the pressure of the surrounding atmosphere, i.e. from 900 to 1100 hPa.</p>
    <p num="73">The pressure exerted on the respective components and/or mixtures is with particular preference the (atmospheric) pressure increased possibly by the action of the mixing elements; the correspondingly prevailing temperature is with particular preference the (ambient) temperature increased optionally by the action of the mixing elements.</p>
    <p num="74">The emulsions of the invention have the advantage that they exhibit an outstanding hydrolysis stability and thus reduced elimination of hydrogen.</p>
    <p num="75">The emulsions of the invention also have the advantage that the stabilizers used are highly compatible with the other components and a broad spectrum of use is accessible to the emulsions of the invention.</p>
    <p num="76">The process of the invention has the advantage that it is very simple in its implementation.</p>

      Unless specified otherwise, the following examples are conducted under a pressure of the surrounding atmosphere, i.e. at about 1000 hPa, and at ambient temperature, i.e. about 20 (degree)  C. or a temperature which is established when the reactants are combined at ambient temperature without additional heating or cooling.

      Determination of the evolution of hydrogen from the emulsions prepared in the examples and comparative examples:
      <br/>
      60.0 ml of emulsion are weighed out into a 100 ml narrow-neck glass bottle (brown) After 60 minutes' standing time in the unsealed glass bottle, the glass bottle is gastightly sealed.

      After a defined standing time (generally 9 days=216 hours, otherwise shorter in the case of high gas evolution) in a thermally conditioned water bath (25 (degree)  C.), the contents of the bottle being shaken once daily, the amount of hydrogen in the gas space (in % by volume based on the total gas space) is determined by gas chromatography.

    <p num="103">
      The emulsions from Example 5 and Comparative Example 5 are each tested as the emulsion constituent (crosslinker component) in an aqueous formulation for preparing an antiadhesion silicone coating on paper.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, 20 parts by weight each of an emulsion bearing the designation Dehesive.RTM. 410 E (commercially available from Wacker-Chemie GmbH), comprising vinyl-functional organopolysiloxane and a platinum catalyst and water, are mixed with
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      a) 3 parts by weight of emulsion whose preparation is described in Example 5 and 77 parts by weight of water, and
      <br/>
      b) 3 parts by weight of emulsion whose preparation is described in Comparative Example 5 and 77 parts by weight of water.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      The mixtures a) and b) thus obtained are each applied with a 30  MU m coating bar to paper (commercially obtainable under the designation"Bosso Buxil 925" from Bosso Carte Speciali S.p.A., I-10005 Mathi (TO)) and exposed to a temperature of 150 (degree)  C. for 30 seconds.
      <br/>
      After 30 minutes' storage at room temperature, the antiadhesive silicone coatings a) and b) obtained in each case are subjected to functional tests.
      <br/>
      In terms of release force measurements, measurement of retention of bond strength, rub-off and migration (silicone constituents not incorporated by a crosslinking), entirely identical results are obtained within the bounds of measurement accuracy.
    </p>
    <p num="106">Example 6 shows that the addition of the stabilizers of the invention has no deleterious influence on subsequent applications, such as the preparation of antiadhesive silicone coatings on paper/film.</p>
