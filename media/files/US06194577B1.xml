    <p num="4">2. Description of Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">The present inventors proposed a method for producing tert-butylhydrazine hydrohalogenic acid salt by reacting hydrazine hydrohalogenic acid salt and tert-butanol which are industrially or economically advantageous starting materials (Japanese Patent Publication No. 48823/1986).</p>
    <p num="6">However, it has not yet been known that a difunctional alcohol (diol) or an alicyclic ether compound reacts with a hydrazine hydrohalogenic acid salt to give an alicyclic hydrazine derivative hydrohalogenic acid salt.</p>
    <p num="7">
      As a method for producing an alicyclic hydrazine derivative or its hydrohalogenic acid salt, there are known a method of reacting an alkyl dihalide with hydrazine hydrate �USSR Pat. 87-4337106�, �J.
      <br/>
      Am. Chem. Soc. 88, 3959-3963 (1966)� (prior art 1), and a method of synthesizing alicyclic hydrazine by using an alicyclic amine as a starting material �U.S. Pat. No. 3,317,607� (prior art 2).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      However, the prior art 1 relating to a method of producing an alicyclic hydrazine derivative or its hydrohalogenic acid salt has a problem that an economically expensive dihalogenobutane is required as a starting material.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the prior art 2 is a general method of synthesizing alicyclic hydrazine, but the stability and toxicity of the nitroso body which is an intermediate pose a problem.
    </p>
    <p num="9">On the other hand, a known conventional method of synthesizing hexahydropyridazine includes reacting a hydrazine dicarboxylic derivative with a dihalogenobutane to obtain hexahydropyridazine-1,2-dicarboxylic derivative, and further decarboxylating the resulting product to give an intended product �Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. 224043/1995, 224044/1995 and 198853/1996� (prior art 3).</p>
    <p num="10">A method of producing hexahydropyridazine which comprises synthesizing tetrahydropyridazine from 1,4-butanedial and hydrazine and hydrogenating this tetrahydropyridazine is also known �Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 109170/1996� (prior art 4).</p>
    <p num="11">
      As a method for producing tetrahydropyridazine from 1-aminopyrrolidine, there is known a method comprising carrying out a rearrangement reaction of diazenehydrazone on silica or alumina in, for example, a chloroform-methanol solvent �Tetrahedoron Letters, No. 52, pp. 5025 to 5026� (prior art 5).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a method comprising leaving 1-aminopyrrolidine to stand at room temperature in chloroform for 2 weeks is also known �Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 250388/1989�, �Chem.

    </p>
    <p num="12">However, the prior art 3 relating to a method for producing hexahydropyridazine has a problem that the dihalogenobutane as a starting material is economically expensive, and the synthetic route up to the product is long.</p>
    <p num="13">On the other hand, in the prior art 4, 1,4-butanedial used as a starting material is not easily available, and the yield is as low as about 60%.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Furthermore, the prior art 5 relating to a method for producing tetrahydropyridazine conducts a oxidation and rearrangement reaction of the starting material while it is adsorbed on silica or alumina.
      <br/>
      However, the after-treatment after the reaction is complicated.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, in the prior art 6, the reaction time is long, and it is inadequate as an industrial method for producing tetrahydropyridazine.

    <p num="42">
      This reaction includes two cases of reactions, namely, that one nitrogen atom in the hydrazine is taken into the ring (reaction A), and that two nitrogen atoms in the hydrazine are taken into the ring (reaction B).
      <br/>
      These cases will be illustrated below.
    </p>
    <p num="43">(1) Reaction A</p>
    <p num="44">When 1,4-butanediol or tetrahydrofuran is reacted with hydrazine hydrohalogenic acid salt in the presence of an inorganic acid, 1-aminopyrrolidine hydrohalogenic acid salt will be formed as shown in the following formula (6).  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="45">When 1,5-pentanediol or tetrahydropyran is reacted with hydrazine hydrohalogenic acid salt in the presence of an inorganic acid, 1-aminopiperidine hydrohalogenic acid salt will be formed as shown by the formula (7).  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="46">When 3-methyl-1,5-pentanediol is reacted with hydrazine hydrohalogenic acid salt in the presence of an inorganic acid, 1-amino-4-methylpiperidine hydrohalogenic acid salt will be formed as shown in the formula (8).  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="47">When 1,6-hexanediol is reacted with a hydrazine hydrohalogenic acid salt in the presence of an inorganic acid, 1-aminohexamethyleneimine hydrohalogenic acid salt will be formed as shown by the formula (9).  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="48">When diethylene glycol is reacted with a hydrazine hydrohalogenic acid salt in the presence of an inorganic acid, a 4-aminomorpholine hydrohalogenic acid salt will be formed as shown by the formula (10)  (Chemical Structure image '8' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="49">(2) Reaction B</p>
    <p num="50">When 1,3-propanediol is reacted with a hydrazine hydrohalogenic acid salt in the presence of an inorganic acid, a pyrazolidine hydrohalogenic acid salt will be formed as shown by the formula (11).  (Chemical Structure image '9' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="51">As will be described later, when 1,4-butanediol is used as the st arting material, it is recogniz ed that hexahydropyridazine is also formed although its yield is low.</p>
    <p num="52">In the present invention, the mole ratio of the diol compound or alicyclic ether compound: the hydrazine hydromonohalogenic acid salt (H.HX): the excessive inorganic acid (HA) is 1:1-10:0.2-3. Preferably, this mole ratio is 1:2-5:1-2.</p>
    <p num="53">
      The reaction temperature is 100 to 150 (degree)  C., preferably 110 to 140 (degree)  C. The reaction pressure is normal pressure to 10 Kg/cm2 G, preferably about 2 to 8 Kg/cm2 G. The reaction time differs depending upon the intended alicyclic hydrazine derivative but is about 1 to 30 hours.
      <br/>
      In the case of reaction A, when the product is a 1-aminopyrrolidine hydrohalogenic acid salt, the reaction time is 3 to 10 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Water can be used as the solvent.
      <br/>
      Industrially, a method will be available in which H.HX, the diol compound or the alicyclic ether compound, and the excessive inorganic acid, or H.HX, the diol compound or the alicyclic ether compound and the hydrazine hydrodihalogenic acid salt are simultaneously charged in a reaction vessel and used in the reaction.
      <br/>
      Another method is to add the diol compound or the alicyclic ether compound, and the inorganic acid to the H.HX aqueous solution prepared from a hydrazine hydrate and a hydrohalogenic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      In this reaction, to use H.HX in an excessive amount to the diol compound or the alicyclic ether compound, H.HX must be separated from the alicyclic hydrazine derivative hydrohalogenic acid salt in order to obtain the alicyclic hydrazine derivative hydrohalogenic acid salt having a high purity.
      <br/>
      For that purpose, water used as the solvent is concentrated and an alcohol solvent such as methanol is added, and then the H.HX is crystallized and thereafter taken out as a crystal.
      <br/>
      It is then separated from the intended alicyclic hydrazine derivative hydrohalogenic acid salt.
      <br/>
      When by one operation, H.HX cannot be fully removed from the reaction solution, the separating operation of H.HX may better be repeated several times.
    </p>
    <p num="56">The reaction residue from which H.HX has been removed is left to stand at room temperature whereby the alicyclic hydrazine derivative hydrohalogenic acid salt can be isolated as a crystal.</p>
    <p num="57">Furthermore, the isolated alicyclic hydrazine derivative hydrohalogenic acid salt crystal was neutralized with a base such as sodium hydroxide and precisely distilled to obtain the desired alicyclic hydrazine derivative.</p>
    <p num="58">The reaction solution after separating H.HX is neutralized with a base such as sodium hydroxide, the resulting inorganic salt was separated by filtration, and the filtrate was precisely distilled whereby the desired alicyclic hydrazine d erivative could be isolated.</p>
    <p num="59">The amounts of by-products at the time of synthesizing the alicyclic hydrazine derivative hydrohalogenic acid salt are small, and the reaction selectivity is high.</p>
    <p num="60">For example, when 1,4-butanediol is reacted with hydrazine monohydrochloride salt in the presence of hydrochloric acid to produce 1-aminopyrrolidine hydrochloride salt, the by-products are shown in the following formula (12).  (Chemical Structure image '10' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="61">
      Based on an analysis of gas chromatography, four by-products and the reaction selectivity are shown.
      <br/>
      The 1-aminopyrrolidine 1 showed a high selectivity of more than 90%.
      <br/>
      The structures of these by-products were identified or assu med.
      <br/>
      Tetrahydropyridazine 2 and hexahydropyridazine 3 were compared and identified by GC with a standard sample.
      <br/>

      By oxidizing 1-aminopyrrolidine with an oxidizing agent, diazene-hydrazone rearrangement occurs to form tetrahydropyridazine.
      <br/>
      This tetrahydropyridazine is hydrogenated in the presence of a base to form hexahydropyridazine.

      1-Aminopyrrolidine prepared by various methods can be used.

      Among these oxidizing agents, air or oxygen is cheap in the cost of the oxidizing agent.

      The oxidizing reaction occurs only by blowing air or oxygen in the reaction system, and the operation is simple.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, no foreign matter comes into the reaction system.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the selectivity of 1-aminopyrrolidine to tetrahydropyridazine can be advantageously increased to at least 60% or more.

    <p num="82">
      The oxidation reaction of 1-aminopyrrolidine with air or oxygen can be promoted in the presence of an inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide and/or potassium hydroxide.
      <br/>
      When the oxidation reaction is carried out for a long period of time by adding an inorganic base, the reaction speed becomes gradually slow if the amount of the base added is small.
      <br/>
      At such a time, by again adding the inorganic base newly, the speed of the reaction can be increased.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      The suitable amount of the inorganic base added is 5 to 100 mole %, especially 10 to 50 mole %, based on 1-aminopyrrolidine.

    <p num="85">
      Air or oxygen is blown into a solution of 1-aminopyrrolidine in a polar solvent, and the oxidation reaction is carried out.

      In a method of using an oxidizing agent such as air or oxygen, the reaction time required will be generally about 40 to 60 hours.

      When an oxidizing agent such as aqueous hydrogen peroxide is used, the reaction temperature is 200 (degree)  C. or below, preferably 40 to 100 (degree)  C. When the oxidation reaction of 1-aminopyrrolidine with aqueous hydrogen peroxide is carried out at a low temperature such as 0 (degree)  C., the reaction may run away owing to an abrupt heat generation, and special care should be taken about the handling.
      <br/>
      However, under the above-mentioned heating conditions, the heat generation is only slight, and it is easy to control the reaction.

      <br/>
      When an oxidizing agent such as aqueous hydrogen peroxide is added to the neutralization solution in which a small amount of hydrazine hydrate remains or to the simple distillation fraction to perform an oxidation reaction, the hydrazine hydrate is oxidized and decomposed.

      In this case, an abrupt heat generation is not observed, and it is easy to control the oxidation reaction.

      Furthermore, since octahydropyridazino�1,2-a�pyridazine, and 1,1-bipyrrolidine formed as by-products in a synthesizing reaction of forming 1-aminopyrrolidine hydrohalogenic acid salt are oxidized and decomposed, it is possible to to supply tetrahydropyridazine having a high purity.

      In the presence of an inorganic acid, 1,4-butanediol was reacted with hydrazine hydrohalogenic acid salt to give 1-aminopyrrolidine.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if the same reaction proceeded in the case of 1,3-propanediol, trimethyleneimine would be presumably formed.
      <br/>
      But it could not be confirmed by a GC-MS analysis.
      <br/>
      The product was pyrazolidine in which two nitrogens of hydrazine are incorporated in a 5-membered ring.
      <br/>
      The cause of this case is ascribable to the magnitude of a distortion energy of trimethyleneimine (formula 16).  (Chemical Structure image '14' not included in text)
