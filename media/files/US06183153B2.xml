    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to the field of holders for roll type print media, roll type print media cassettes, and related printing devices, and more particularly to a system for printing on a thermal print film wound in a roll shape.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventional print media, such as printing paper and thermal print film, are often wound in the shape of a roll (hereinafter, referred to as roll-type print media).
      <br/>
      Various printing apparatuses corresponding to the roll type print media have been also manufactured.
      <br/>
      The printing apparatus has the advantage of being miniaturized entirely, since the space to load a print media (hereinafter, referred to as loading space) is small in comparison to other printing apparatuses using paper stock or print film cut into a predetermined size (e.g., A4 size).
      <br/>
      The roll-type printing apparatus also has the advantage of loading a large quantity of print media in a small loading space.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Among available roll-type print media, print film wound in the shape of a roll can be problematic in that it may easily become unwound due to the very low coefficient of friction and adhesion between adjacent surfaces on the roll.
      <br/>
      For this reason, roll-type print media can be difficult to load in a printing apparatus in such a manner that the print film does not become unwound.
      <br/>
      This problem is especially acute where roll-type print media is replaced frequently, and work efficiency for replacement is concomitantly decreased.
      <br/>
      This problem can also be especially severe where transparent print media (as for printing x-ray images) is installed, since conventional printing apparatuses requiring roll-type print media normally detect the existence of an installed roll using a light sensor, and transparent film partially unwound can go undetected when a light beam emitted from the optical sensor penetrates the transparent print layers film without detection.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One available approach to solving the above-described problem comprises a method of detecting the existence of roll type print media using a contact sensor within the printing apparatus.
      <br/>
      However, the roll-type print media is unstable in that it rolls within the loading space and changes in diameter throughout the period of its consumption.
      <br/>
      Thus, even if a contact sensor is used to detect the existence of the roll-type print media in the conventional printing apparatus, it is difficult to place the contact sensor into reliable contact with the roll type print media.
      <br/>
      As a result, efficiently and reliably detecting the existence of roll-type print media remains a challenge.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">In view of the foregoing, an advantage of the present invention is the provision of a holder for roll-type print media and a roll-type print media cassette which reliably detects the existence of, and simplifies replacement procedures for, roll-type print media.</p>
    <p num="8">
      The foregoing advantage and other advantages of the invention have been achieved by the provision of a holder for roll-type print media comprising supporting means for rotatively supporting the roll-type print media and a wind regulator for preventing roll-type print media from coming unwound.
      <br/>
      As a result, the present holder for roll-type print media makes it possible to prevent the roll-type print media from being unwound and to handle the roll-type print media easily.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The invention further provides a roll-type print media cassette comprising a roll-type print media, supporting means for rotatively supporting the roll-type print media, and regulating means for preventing the roll-type print media from coming unwound.
      <br/>
      As a result, this roll-type print media cassette makes it possible to prevent the roll-type print media from being unwound and to handle the roll-type print media easily.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The invention still further provides a printing apparatus comprising print media supporting means for rotatively supporting the roll-type print media at a predetermined position and a contact sensor for detecting the existence of the roll-type print media within the printing apparatus.
      <br/>
      As a result, the present printing apparatus maintains the roll-type print media in contact with a sensor, by maintaining the stability of the position of the roll-type print media within the printing apparatus.

      <br/>
      On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="14">(1) A Printing System According to a First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="15">
      Referring first to FIG. 1, a printing system 1 is composed of a print film cassette 2 and a printing apparatus 3.
      <br/>
      The print film cassette 2, also illustrated in FIG. 2, includes a print film part 11, comprising a print film 9 wound around a cylindrical roll core 10.
      <br/>
      Print film part 11 is rotatively supported by a holder 12.
      <br/>
      The holder 12 is actually composed of first and second sleeves 13, 14 and first and second disc-type supporting members 15, 16.
      <br/>
      Sleeves 13, 14 respectively include cylindrical parts 13A, 14A, both having the outside diameter being approximately equivalent to the inside diameter of the roll core 10.
      <br/>
      First and second disc type supporting members 15, 16 both have an outside diameter being approximately equivalent to the maximum diameter of the print film part 11.
      <br/>
      The first and second sleeves 13, 14 are respectively fixed to the print film part 11 in such a way that the cylindrical parts 13A, 14A are respectively fitted in one end or the other end of the roll core 10.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In the inner sides 15A, 16A of the first and second supporting members 15, 16, a plurality of arc-type fitting projections 15B, 16B having the outside diameter being approximately equivalent to the inside diameter of the first and second sleeves 13, 14 are provided at equivalent internals.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, fitting projections 15B, 16B of the first and second supporting members 15, 16 are fitted in the corresponding cylindrical parts 13A, 14A of the first and second sleeves 13, 14.
      <br/>
      Thus, in the print film cassette 2, the print film part 11 can be rotated integrally with the first and second sleeves 13, 14 and the roll core 10, so as to pull out the print film 9 of print film part 11 easily.
    </p>
    <p num="17">In holder 12, the first and second supporting members 15, 16 and the first and second sleeves 13, 14 are formed out of materials having a small friction coefficient such as plastics, so as to reduce the friction between the first and second sleeves 13, 14 and the corresponding first and second supporting members 15, 16 when the print film part 11 rotates, thereby avoiding generation of fine particles which might otherwise result from frictional movement.</p>
    <p num="18">
      On the outer sides of the first and second supporting members 15, 16, arc type pawls 15C, 16C are provided at at least three points, projecting into the center of the holder 12 and facing each other.
      <br/>
      The print film cassette 2 regulates the maximum diameter of the print film 9 of the print film part 11 by these pawls 15C, 16C, so as to prevent the print film 9 from being unwound to occupy a diameter greater than the outside diameter of the first and second supporting members 15 and 16.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Further, as shown in FIG. 4 and FIG. 5, a spoke 17 spans between the specific pawls 15C, 16C of the first and second supporting members 15, 16 to integratedly couple the first supporting member 15 and the second supporting member 16 while maintaining a predetermined intervening distance.
      <br/>
      A dust pad 19 being a sponge having the approximately same length as the width of the print film part 11 is provided in the spoke 17, and bound to a film 18.
      <br/>
      Film 18 is bent toward the interior of the first and second supporting members 15, 16 at the end portion where the dust pad 19 is provided, thereby pressing the dust pad 19 on the surface of the print film 9 of the print film part 11 in a manner supported by the elasticity of the film 18.
      <br/>
      Thus, in the print film cassette 2, when the print film 9 of the print film part 11 is pulled out, the dust pad 19 is rubbed on the surface of the print film 9 so that the dust attached on the surface of the print film 9 is wiped and removed by the dust pad 19.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Turning next to FIG. 3, printing apparatus 3 includes a door part 22, which is freely opened and shut, and is provided on the front of a housing 20, avoiding contact with an operation panel 21.
      <br/>
      A liquid crystal display panel 23 and a paper discharge port 22A are provided on the front of the door part 22, and as shown in FIG. 1, a paper tray 24 and a platen 25 supported rotatively are disposed inside printing apparatus 3, behind door part 22.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Turning next to FIG. 7, illustrating the interior of printing apparatus 3, print film cassette 2 is placed in a predetermined state inside paper tray 24.
      <br/>
      The print film 9 is pulled out of the print film cassette 2 and its end portion is inserted into the paper discharge port 22A.
      <br/>
      Door part 22 is then shut so as to load the print film 9, wound in the shape of a roll, into the interior of housing 20.
      <br/>
      Also within housing 20 is a mechanical part 30 comprising a door open and shut driving mechanical part 31 for opening and shutting the door part 22, a head part 33 to which a line type thermal head 32 is installed at the bottom side, a press mechanical part 34 for pressing the thermal head 32 of the head part 33 onto the platen 7 in printing, a press mechanism driving part 35 for driving the press mechanical part 34, a platen driving part (not shown) for driving the platen 7 to be rotated, and a contact sensor 36 for detecting the existence of the print film 9.
      <br/>
      During printing, mechanical part 30, under the control of a control part (not shown), positions and presses the head part 33 onto the platen 25 through the print film 9 while initially keeping the head part 33 in the state that it is placed apart from the platen 25 by the press mechanism driving part 35.
      <br/>
      Additionally, in printing system 1, as illustrated in FIGS. 1, 2, and 5, position fixing projections 15D, 16D are formed from the center of the first or second supporting member 15, 16 toward the diameter direction on the outer side of the first and second supporting members 15, 16 of the print film cassette 2, and cylindrical projections 15E, 16E are formed concentrically with the corresponding first or second supporting member 15, 16 on the position fixing projections 15D, 16D.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As is apparent from FIG. 1 and FIG. 7, position fixing cutouts 24A, 24B having the same shape as the position fixing projections 15D, 16D are provided on the both sides of the paper tray 24 of the printing apparatus 3 in the width direction such as to correspond to the position fixing projections 15D, 16D of the print film cassette 2.
      <br/>
      Also in printing system 1, as shown in FIG. 8, the position fixing projections 15D, 16D of the print film cassette 2 are respectively fitted into the corresponding position fixing cutouts 24A, 24B of the printing apparatus 3, so that the print film cassette 2 can be efficiently positioned within printing apparatus 3.
    </p>
    <p num="23">(2) Door Open and Shut Driving Mechanical Part 31 and Contact Sensor 36 of Printing Apparatus 3</p>
    <p num="24">
      As shown in FIG. 9 and FIG. 10, the door open and shut driving mechanical part 31 of the printing apparatus 3 has a motor (not shown) fixed to a side chassis 40.
      <br/>
      A gear 41 mounted on the output axis of the motor is meshed with a gear part 50A of a shaft driving part 50 through a series of gears comprising first to eighth gears 42 to 49.
      <br/>
      The shaft driving part 50 is fixed to a shaft 51 which spans rotatively from one side to the other the side chassis 40.
      <br/>
      An arm receiver 52 is fixed to the shaft 51 through a pin which is not shown.
      <br/>
      Further, one side of an arm 53 is fixedly attached to the arm receiver 52, and the other side of the arm 53 is rotatively coupled through a pin 55 with the back of an inner chassis 54 to which the paper tray 24 is fixedly attached.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      One side of a rail 57 is rotatively mounted on the center part of the side of the inner chassis 54 at the lower stage through the pin 56, and the other side of the rail 57 is supported to be freely slid in the front direction shown by an arrow x and the opposite direction by first to fourth rollers 59 to 62 which are mounted on the side chassis 40.
      <br/>
      Thus, in the door open and shut driving mechanical part 31, the arm 53 can be rotated together with the shaft driving part 50 with the shaft 51 being centered, based on the rotation power given from the motor to the shaft driving part 51 through a series of gears.
      <br/>
      On the basis of the rotation power, the portion where the pin 55 of the inner chassis 54 is planted is rotated around the centered shaft 51, and the portion where the pin 56 of the inner chassis 54 is planted is moved together with the rail 57 in a frontward and backward direction, so as to completely open and shut door part 22.
