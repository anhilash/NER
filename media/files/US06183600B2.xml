      A method of coagulating particulates, as in papermaking or water clarification applications, for example, is provided wherein a zeolite crystalloid coagulant is added to water containing the solid matter, a source of multivalent cations, and a cationic acrylamide polymer.
      <br/>
      The zeolite crystalloid coagulant is preferably prepared by admixing aqueous sodium silicate and sodium aluminate solutions to form a reaction mixture and allowing a reaction to proceed for a sufficient time to form a zeolite crystalloid coagulant particles having particle sizes of at least about 4 nm before terminating the reaction.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The invention relates generally to water treatment and, more particularly, the invention relates to the use of zeolite crystalloids as coagulants in the clarification of water or to promote improved retention, drainage, and formation in the manufacture of paper and paperboard.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of Related Technology</p>
    <p num="5">
      Considerable expenditures are made each year for materials used in water treatment, such as coagulants and flocculants used to clarify raw waters for potable and industrial use; to clarify process water streams such as deinking water in paper recycling plants and mining wash water circuits; and to clarify industrial and municipal effluent waters, for example.
      <br/>
      Coagulants and flocculants are used to improve the efficiency of the papermaking process by improving the first pass retention of fiber and filler, and formation and drainage, on the paper machine forming wire.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the demand for more efficient, inexpensive water treatment compositions for use as coagulants and flocculants is increasing.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Widely used as coagulants and flocculants in the clarification of raw waters, process waters, and effluent waters are chemicals such as alum, sodium aluminate, polyaluminum chloride, activated silica, bentonite clays, inorganic iron salts, low molecular weight organic cationic polymers, high molecular weight organic polymers, and others.
      <br/>
      Some of these coagulants and flocculants may be used by themselves; however, in many cases various combinations of these materials may produce more efficient results, depending upon the nature and requirements of the water to be clarified.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The manufacture of nearly all fine paper worldwide is now done at alkaline pH levels (about 8.0 to 8.4 pH) using calcium carbonate pigment as a filler along with bleached wood cellulose fiber (some cotton cellulose is used in specialty papers).
      <br/>
      A current favored method of obtaining good sheet formation, good first pass retention of fiber and filler on the traveling formation wire, and rapid water drainage through the wire is to add rather high dosages (often three lbs per ton of dry furnish or more) of a synthetic high molecular weight cationic retention aid polymer flocculant to the machine furnish stream at the fan pump so as to utilize the high mixing forces at that point to deflocculate.
      <br/>
      Some believe so-called microflocs are, in part, created with this technique.
      <br/>
      However, if the use of the flocculant in this manner is all that is done, the retention of fiber and filler would be poor.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      To provide superior retention, drainage, and formation, a coagulant is added before, or after the rotary screens located between the fan pump and the paper machine headbox.
      <br/>
      Generally known as microparticulates and of negative charge, these coagulants act as a bridge between the fibers, fines, and fillers.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The first such coagulant aid in wide use in papermaking was a bentonitic montmorillonite clay.
      <br/>
      Also now in use are colloidal silicas, modified colloidal silicas, polysilicate microgels, and very low molecular weight organic polymers, which are suggested to be sols on the basis of the very small water droplets emulsified in an oil carrier during the manufacturing process.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Regarding the use of microparticulates and cationic polymers as coagulation and retention aids in the manufacture of paper, U.S. Pat. No. 4,753,710 teaches that bentonite is essential. U.S. Pat. No. 4,753,710 compares bentonite to the aluminum silicate-modified surface on colloidal silica that is taught in WO 86/05826 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,025, and finds bentonite to be superior. U.S. Pat. No. 4,753,710 teaches the use of at least four pounds bentonite per ton of furnish along with as much as three pounds cationic polymer flocculant per ton of furnish.
      <br/>
      Bentonitic montmorillonites are described as being metal silicates wherein the metal may be aluminum, and the ratio of silicon atoms to metal atoms is in the range of 5:1 to 1:1.
      <br/>
      This patent does not disclose that montmorillonites are layered minerals having tetrahedra on their top and bottom layers and an octahedral layer in the center.
      <br/>
      In the case of 1:1 (atomic ratio) silicon to aluminum, most of the aluminum is in the center octahedral layer where the cationic exchange sites are not available for cationic bonding.
      <br/>
      The overall surface area of a water-swelled montmorillonite can be very large, reportedly as much as 800 m2 /gram, but most of the surface is disposed between layers where it as accessible to infused water but not available to participate in bonding to other particulates having calcium on their surfaces.

      In another use of aluminum silicate as coagulant microparticulates, U.S. Pat. No. 4,954,220 describes the use of sodium aluminate as well as acids and certain other materials added to sodium silicate solutions to cause the formation of anionic, water soluble polysilicate microgels.
      <br/>
      The goal of this disclosure is to create colloidal silica analogs that would cost considerably less than colloidal silica.
      <br/>
      This disclosure relies on the anionic charge of the polysilicate microgel to perform well along with the use of cationic polymer flocculant, and requires the use of a sodium silicate with a SiO2 /Na2 O weight ratio of about 3.3, which is the maximum currently available, apparently in order to provide the maximum commercially available amount of silica per pound in order to produce a polysilicate microgel.
      <br/>
      While a reaction time of 5% to 95% of gel time is stated, it appears the disclosure is not concerned with overall unit size, although it is claimed that the resultant reaction product consists of three dimensional strings of 3 nm particles.
      <br/>
      This disclosure (Example 5) implicitly describes the use of an Al/Si weight ratio of 0.3 and claims results equal to colloidal silica.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">An object of the invention is to overcome at least one of the problems described above.</p>
    <p num="15">
      According to the invention, methods of treating water, such as in papermaking and water clarification processes, for example, are provided, whereby a sodium or potassium zeolite crystalloid coagulant ("ZCC") is added to water that contains particulate matter (e.g., cellulosic fiber, filler, and other materials in the case of papermaking, and matter to be removed in the case of water clarification) that has multivalent ions adsorbed on the surfaces thereof.
      <br/>
      If the particulate matter does not have multivalent cations on its surfaces, a source or sources of multivalent cations may be provided to allow surface adsorption.
      <br/>
      Through the phenomenon of ion exchange, the ZCC acts as a bridging coagulant.
      <br/>
      In papermaking, a cationic polyacrylamide is added before the ZCC.
      <br/>
      In water clarification, a cationic polyacrylamide may be added before the ZCC, in certain cases.
      <br/>
      ZCC is preferably made by reacting sodium silicate or potassium silicate and sodium aluminate in specific proportions under specific conditions resulting in a stable product having particle sizes within a stated range.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from a review of the following detailed description, taking in conjunction with the appended claims.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      The invention relates to the use of zeolite crystalloids or sols as coagulants in the clarification of raw fresh waters, process waters, industrial and municipal waste waters, etc. and also as a coagulant in the manufacture of paper.
      <br/>
      The materials to be coagulated will either have a suitable amount of multivalent cations on their surfaces or a source of multivalent cations will be provided so as to allow adsorption of the cations onto the surfaces before the ZCC is added.
      <br/>
      In papermaking, a synthetic linear or branched polymer source of multivalent cations and/or cationic starch may be adsorbed onto the furnish surfaces.
      <br/>
      The adsorbed cationic polymer and/or cationic starch is essentially an extended source of multivalent cations that can displace the exchangeable sodium or potassium ions in the ZCC and so present additional bridging sites for the ZCC.
      <br/>
      This enhances the clarification of the moving stream of mixtures of cellulose fiber, inorganic filler pigments (e.g., calcium carbonate, clay, and titanium dioxide), sizing agents, starches, gums, etc., so as to promote better retention of these solids on the traveling formation wire, more rapid drainage of water through the traveling wire, and improved uniformity of formation in the dried sheet of paper.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In the invention, the presence of multivalent cations on the surface of the solids to be coagulated is essential for the superior performance of the zeolite crystalloid sols.
      <br/>
      A key to the process is the ability of the ZCC to exchange sodium ions or potassium ions for all or part of multivalent cations such as calcium, magnesium, iron, cationic starch, and cationic polymers, either alone or in combination and, accordingly, become bonded to other particulates and fibers having these multivalent cations adsorbed on their surfaces and, in so doing, cause coagulation. (In papermaking, calcium, magnesium, cationic starch, and cationic polymers are preferred cations.)
    </p>
    <p num="19">Suitable sources of multivalent cations include calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, ferrous sulfate, ferrous chloride, ferric chloride, ferric sulphate, aluminum sulfate, aluminum chloride, cationic starch, and cationic polymers. (In papermaking, preferred sources of cations are calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, cationic starch, and cationic polymers.)</p>
    <p num="20">
      The use of zeolite minerals to remove hardness ions (namely calcium and magnesium) from water is well known in the historical sense; zeolites were replaced long ago with synthetic organic, ion-exchange resins.
      <br/>
      To prepare zeolite minerals for water softening, they would be rinsed with a concentrated brine of sodium chloride.
      <br/>
      This high concentration of sodium would cause the removal of any hardness ions bonded within the crystal lattice and replace them with sodium ions.
      <br/>
      Then, the excess brine would be rinsed away, and the water to be softened would be flowed through a bed of zeolite mineral.
      <br/>
      Without the presence of excess sodium ions, the hardness ions were preferentially held by the zeolite and, accordingly, the sodium ions held in the crystal lattice would be replaced by the hardness ions, with the sodium ions remaining with the now softened water.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Zeolites consist of a three-dimensional crystal framework of SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra.
      <br/>
      The tetrahedra are joined by the sharing of oxygen atoms, so that the ratio of oxygen atoms to the total of silicon and aluminum atoms is two.
      <br/>
      Silicon is tetravalent so that if two silicon/oxygen tetrahedra were joined (two silicon atoms with four oxygen atoms), the resultant structure would be electroneutral.
      <br/>
      However, aluminum is trivalent, so that two joined tetrahedra made up of one silicon atom, one aluminum atom, and four oxygen atoms would be electronegative with one of the oxygens having only one of its charges satisfied.
      <br/>
      This deficiency must be satisfied with the inclusion of a cationic charge for each aluminum atom involved.
      <br/>
      This cation may be exchanged for another cation, e.g., sodium ions may be exchanged for calcium ions.
      <br/>
      The tetrahedra are, of course, four-sided and also have four points.
      <br/>
      The oxygen atoms are located at each point, and the silicon or aluminum atoms are located at the center of the tetrahedron.
      <br/>
      It is at an oxygen atom at one of the aluminum bearing tetrahedron points where the included exchangeable cation is located.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      According to the invention, synthetic zeolites in the sodium or potassium form can be superior coagulants for particles and fibers having multivalent ions on their surface either naturally, as is the case with calcium carbonate pigments, or adsorbed as can be the case with clays and cellulose fibers, for example.
      <br/>
      On the surface of the zeolite crystal there will be many tetrahedra points with exchangeable sodium or potassium cations associated with the otherwise electronegative oxygen.
      <br/>
      With relatively low levels of sodium or potassium ions present in the system to be clarified, these exchange points will give up their sodium cations or potassium cations to bind more strongly to the multivalent cations on the surface of the particle or fiber in the system to be clarified.
      <br/>
      Being three-dimensional, the zeolite will attach to more than one particle or fiber and, accordingly, coagulate them.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      It is well known that synthetic zeolites are made by mixing sodium silicate or potassium silicate solutions with sodium aluminate solutions.
      <br/>
      Although these have been replaced by synthetic organic ion exchange resins for water softening, various forms of them are widely used as catalysts in the petroleum industry because of their unique pore structure and the ability to control the pore sizes in the crystal lattice.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      By the use of relatively dilute solutions of sodium silicate and sodium aluminate (or potassium silicate and sodium aluminate), one can control the formation of the zeolite crystalloid sols in sizes from the 1 nm to 3 nm range, which is generally considered to be yet a solution, up to the micron size range.
      <br/>
      According to the invention, a particle size range of at least about 4 nm is used, with a range of about 4 nm to about 100 nm being preferred.
      <br/>
      Dissolved material below about 4 nm in size is effective, but the very small size of these molecules apparently restricts their three-dimensional bridging ability.
      <br/>
      This bridging ability, which is very valuable in papermaking and raw water coagulation clarification, improves dramatically at about 4 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      It is highly preferred to use soft water (i.e., water with zero or as low calcium and magnesium concentrations as possible) when diluting the sodium silicate and sodium aluminate solutions as received from the manufacturer in carrying out the coagulant preparation reaction, and in subsequent dilution.
      <br/>
      The efficacy of the invention is based in part of the presence of exchangeable sodium ions or potassium ions at the otherwise electronegative oxygen atom in the aluminum tetrahedra.
      <br/>
      If hard water is used when making the coagulant, the calcium ions and magnesium ions present in the water will have taken the place of the exchangeable sodium ions or potassium ions during formation of the sol, thereby decreasing or eliminating the essential ion exchange potential that results in the inventive coagulant's high efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In diluting the strength of the inventive coagulant salt after it has been formed, it is also desirable to use water containing as small a concentration of calcium ions or magnesium ions as possible during the quench stage that stops sol growth.
      <br/>
      The presence of significant amounts of calcium ions or magnesium ions could decrease the activity of the coagulant exchange sites needed for effective coagulation.
    </p>
    <p num="27">Thus, both in diluting the sodium silicate or potassium silicate and sodium aluminate and in quenching the sol-forming reaction, the use of ion- exchange softened water or deionized water is highly preferred.</p>
    <p num="28">
      The rate of the ZCC-formation reaction is dependent upon concentration and temperature.
      <br/>
      In the manufacture of zeolites for water softening, relatively high concentrations of sodium aluminate and sodium silicate are used because the goal is to produce strong, relatively large particles that can support one another in zeolite beds several feet high.
      <br/>
      High concentrations instantly produce a solid mass of sodium aluminum silicate (a zeolite), infused with water.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      According to the invention, one object is to react solutions of sodium aluminate and sodium silicate or potassium silicate to produce zeolite crystalloids at least about 4 nm in size.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished with reactant solution strengths of about 1.0 wt. % to about 5.0 wt. %, preferably about 1.5 wt. % to about 3.0 wt. %. At concentrations much above 3 wt. % to 5 wt. %, the reaction tends to progress too fast to be stopped at the target crystalloid size by quenching to a lower concentration.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In using an approximate 1.5 wt. % solution strength for each reactant, the opalescence that indicates a crystalloid product size in the 4 nm to 6 nm range occurs at about five minutes depending on the SiO2 /Na2 O or SiO2 /K2 O ratio of the sodium or potassium silicate used, and the temperature.
      <br/>
      At 3 wt. % solution strengths, the opalescence is apparent in as short a time as 15 seconds.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      To stop the crystalloid growth, the solution strength is immediately diluted to about 0.5% or less or a dilution sufficient to stop particle growth when the target size is reached.
      <br/>
      The crystalloid size appears to be stable for at least six days at a 0.5 wt. % concentration, depending upon temperature.
      <br/>
      If not diluted, the 1.5 wt. % reaction mixture will completely gel in a period of time (e.g., 30 minutes) dependent on temperature.
      <br/>
      Greater dilution extends stability.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      For example, a sodium ZCC was made using 3 wt. % reactant solutions, as follows.
      <br/>
      Respective 3 wt. % solutions of Nalco No. 2 sodium aluminate and PQ-M sodium silicate were made using relatively soft water supplied by the Seattle, Washington city water system.
      <br/>
      The sodium aluminate solution was added to the sodium silicate solution under vigorous agitation.
      <br/>
      The first sign of opalescence was noted at 30 seconds after mixing at which time the mixture was diluted to 0.5% by mixing with water in a previously prepared beaker.
      <br/>
      At the 3 wt. % concentration, it was important to use vigorous agitation.
      <br/>
      If the sodium aluminate solution was added without the proper agitation, the momentarily high localized concentrations that would result would have caused the generation of many crystalloids larger than the target size.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In most water clarification applications, the ZCC is added in an amount of about 0.05 lb/ton to about 50 lb/ton of dry particulate matter.
      <br/>
      In papermaking, the ZCC is generally added in an amount of at least about 0.5 lb/ton dry furnish, and preferably less than about 20 lb/ton dry furnish.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Where water is to be clarified in water clarifying apparatus such as a clarifier, a filter, a filter press, a screw press, a belt press, or a centrifuge, for example, the ZCC is preferably added to an influent stream in an amount of at least about 0.25 ppm, and generally up to about 600 ppm, depending on the level of solids, based on total influent flow.</p>
    <p num="35">
      Any suitable linear or branched cationic polyacrylamide may be used in the invention.
      <br/>
      Examples include cationic acrylamide copolymers, Mannich polymers, and modified acrylamide homopolymers, as are known in the art.
      <br/>
      The cationic polyacrylamide preferably has a cationic molar content of about 2t to about 80t (and more preferably about 3% to about 40% in papermaking applications).
      <br/>
      Polymers having molecular weights of at least about 50,000 are preferred, with molecular weights of at least about 1,000,000 being highly preferred, especially in papermaking applications.
    </p>
    <p num="36">The cationic polymer is preferably used in an amount of at least about 0.01 lb/ton and generally up to about 40 lb/ton of dry particulate matter in water clarification applications, depending on solids levels.</p>
    <p num="37">In papermaking applications, the cationic polymer (other than starch) is typically used in amounts of at least 0.4 lb/ton dry furnish, preferably up to about 4 lb/ton dry furnish.</p>
    <p num="38">
      Where cationic starch is used in papermaking applications, sufficient cationic sites are added to provide a total of about 0.18 wt. % to about 0.39 wt. % nitrogen based on starch solids.
      <br/>
      Typically, starch will be added in the range of about 1 lb/ton to about 30 lb/ton dry furnish.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In water clarification processes, cationic polymer may be used at times to create faster- settling flocs.
      <br/>
      In cases where faster coagulation and/or more dense floc is desired, for example, as in an overloaded clarifier, a filter, a filter press, a screw press, a belt press, or a centrifuge, a cationic polyacrylamide or cationic homopolymer may be added to the influent stream whose particulate surface has been treated with multivalent cation.
      <br/>
      The cationic polyacrylamide typically may be added in amounts up to about 400 ppm based on total influent flow.
      <br/>
      Conventional jar testing may be used to determine the chemical addition levels required.
    </p>
    <p num="40">Coagulation tests using a calcium-free clay soil have shown that the performance efficiencies of the zeolite crystalloids depend upon the SiO2 /Na2 O molar ratio of the sodium silicate used to prepare the crystalloid, the aluminum/silicon atomic ratio in the crystalloid, and the presence of calcium or other multivalent cations ions on the surface of the materials to be coagulated.</p>
    <p num="41">
      If the mixture of reactants is quenched to a 0.5 wt. % solution strength immediately after mixing, before signs of opalescence, the coagulation performance of the resulting crystalloid is good.
      <br/>
      The literature suggests that any size below about 3 nm is considered a solution.
      <br/>
      This solution range is effective in coagulating particulates, but by waiting for the first signs of opalescence, which indicates a crystalloid size of about 4 nm to about 6 nm, the performance improves to excellent.
      <br/>
      Growth to the micron size range decreases the performance.

    <p num="42">
      PQ Corp. offers eleven grades of sodium silicate solutions that vary primarily in their SiO2 /Na2 O molar ratios but also in concentrations and viscosities.
      <br/>
      It has been found that the performance of the zeolite crystalloids improves as the weight ratio decreases as follows: 3.25:1, 3.22:1, 2.88:1, and 2.58:1, while maintaining an Al/Si weight ratio of about 1:1.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Additional tests were run using SiO2 /Na2 O weight ratios of 2.50:1, 2.40:1, 2.0:10, and 1.80:1 (using an Al/Si weight ratio of 1:1), but all were inferior to the 2.58:1 weight ratio of PQ-M sodium silicate.
      <br/>
      PQ-Star sodium silicate, which has an SiO2 /Na2 O weight ratio of 2.50:1, was very close in coagulation performance, being nearly equal at 1 ppm, but falling to a rating of very good at a dosage of 0.5 ppm (compared to "excellent" for sol produced with PQ-M sodium silicate) in native clay slurry clarification tests.
      <br/>
      The results deteriorated as the SiO2 /Na2 O weight ratio fell below 2.58:1. Generally, the lower ratios were at least as good as colloidal silica or bentonite, but did not show the excellent performance of the ZCCs prepared using PQ-M sodium silicate.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      ZCC was also made using potassium silicate and sodium aluminate; specifically, PQ Corp.'s Kasil -1 potassium silicate and Nalco No. 2 sodium aluminate.
      <br/>
      Kasil -1 potassium silicate was chosen because its weight ratio of SiO2 /K2 O of 2.50 was the highest available and it matched the SiO2 /Na2 O ratio of the PQ-Star sodium silicate.
      <br/>
      The test results equaled those of the ZCC made from PQ-Star sodium silicate.
      <br/>
      However, because of the high cost of potassium silicate, it is not preferred.

    <p num="45">
      Because the number of exchangeable sodium cations or potassium cations present in the zeolite crystalloids are dependent upon the number of aluminum/oxygen tetrahedra, one object of the invention is to maximize the presence of aluminum ions, consistent with forming a tetrahedral complex structure amenable to bonding to other particulates.
      <br/>
      Testing indicates that a weight ratio of aluminum to silicon of 1:1 is optimum for the zeolite crystalloids of the invention in terms of performance, efficiency of dosage, persistence of effect, and broadening the range of acceptable system pH.
      <br/>
      Al:Si weight ratios investigated were 2:1, 1.3:1, 1:1, 0.79:1, 0.72:1, and 0.3:1. For the weight ratios of 2:1 and 1.3:1, an observed drop in performance was presumed to be because of an unsatisfactory crystal structure.
      <br/>
      For the weight ratios below 1:1, it is believed the observed fall-off in performance is due to the decrease in the number of cation exchange sites, which are needed to bond to calcium ions on the surface of the materials to be coagulated.
      <br/>
      The 0.3:1 weight ratio, for example, never received an excellent rating, even at dosages six times higher than usual for the weight ratio of 1:1.
      <br/>
      This 0.3:1 weight ratio was no better in performance than bentonite or colloidal silica.

      Subjecting the sodium silicate or potassium silicate solution as received from the manufacturer to high shear immediately before use in the coagulant-forming reaction is greatly beneficial in maximizing ZCC coagulating activity and persistence of effect, as well as maximizing the range of effective sol sizes.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the sodium silicate or potassium silicate solution, preferably in neat form as received from the manufacturer, is subjected to high shear in order to break up the silicate micelles that are inherent in the product, with the goal being to attain a true sodium silicate or potassium silicate ionic solution.
      <br/>
      The micelle elimination step should be undertaken immediately before the ZCC-forming reaction with the sodium aluminate, because the micelles can be expected to reform and grow upon standing.
      <br/>
      The micelles shelter some potassium oxide or sodium oxide within their structure, and also have some potassium oxide or sodium oxide on the surfaces.
      <br/>
      This can interfere with the reaction-site stoichiometry needed to produce the optimum crystal tetrahedra Al/Si ratio of 1:1.

      <br/>
      The extent of their interference with obtaining the intended inventive reaction product depends on their sizes.
      <br/>
      Relatively fresh sodium silicate or potassium silicate can produce ZCC sols of good coagulating activity, although not as good as with freshly sheared product.
      <br/>
      As the sodium silicate or potassium silicate ages and the silicate micelles grow, eventually the reaction interference is such that there is very little coagulating activity in the product sols.
      <br/>
      A high shear in-line mixer, batch mixer, or homogenizer may be employed, using sol (ZCC) activity to determine the shear required.

      According to the invention, the zeolite crystalloids offer a system of calcium or other multivalent cation "hooks" on their surfaces by virtue of having cation exchange sites offered by the aluminum tetrahedra in the crystalloid lattice structure.
      <br/>
      In some instances, it may be necessary to supply a source of multivalent cations to the system.
      <br/>
      For example, a test sample of clay soil from the Seattle, Washington area slurried in tap water, which was nearly free of calcium and magnesium, did not respond well initially in coagulation tests. (Most clay soils in the Seattle area, for example, have been rinsed free of hardness ions, perhaps thousands of years ago, because of the rainy climate.) However, when calcium chloride was added to the clay soil slurry so as to allow calcium ion adsorption on the clay soil surface, the clay soil responded very well, allowing 0.5 ppm dosages of the optimum zeolite crystalloid to produce excellent coagulation of a 9500 ppm clay soil slurry.
      <br/>
      The supernatant was sparkling clear and colorless, and the persistence of the floc was excellent, as shown by several repeated attempts to redisperse it.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The same kinds of tests were used for a sodium clay commonly used as filler in the manufacture of paper.
      <br/>
      As is, the clay did not respond well to the coagulant.
      <br/>
      With calcium chloride added so as to place calcium ions on the surface, the clay responded extremely well, as described for the tested clay soil.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Calcium carbonate pigment responds extremely well to the zeolite crystalloids.
      <br/>
      Cellulose fiber, bleached or unbleached, does not respond well without calcium being present, but when calcium ions are adsorbed onto their surface, they respond extremely well.
      <br/>
      The amount of calcium or other multivalent metal cation needed in a specific system is determined empirically, for example, in jar testing, a well-known standard test.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The use of the inventive zeolite crystalloids as coagulants according to the invention is of great value in papermaking because of the low cost of the raw materials, ease of manufacture on-site, and the great increase in efficiency of performance per unit weight.
      <br/>
      Also, the required cationic flocculant dosages may be greatly reduced (e.g., to about 0.6 lb/ton furnish or less) from the 3 lb/ton now commonly used.
      <br/>
      It is estimated that the polymer and microparticulate costs could be one-quarter or less of most current applications.

    <p num="54">Testing the efficiency of zeolite crystalloid coagulants in an alkaline papermaking process</p>
    <p num="55">Tests were run to evaluate zeolite crystalloids in an alkaline papermaking process, as follows.</p>
    <p num="56">
      Bleached hardwood and bleached softwood pulp were refined in a Waring blender at about 3 wt. % consistency for two minutes at high speed.
      <br/>
      Eighteen grams (solid basis) of a 50/50 mix of fibers were diluted to nine liters.
      <br/>
      The nine liter mix was adjusted to pH 8.2 after the addition of about 200 ppm calcium chloride.
      <br/>
      The calcium chloride was added in order to replicate, at least in part, the dissolved calcium expected to be present in an operating machine system making alkaline paper.
      <br/>
      Half-liter aliquots containing 1.0 gram of fiber were placed in a 600 ml beaker and set on a magnetic stirring device.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      One-third gram of precipitated calcium carbonate pigment (PCC) was added to this mixture, with vigorous agitation, followed by a dosage of 0.6 lb/ton furnish of a high molecular weight cationic acrylamide copolymer flocculant containing about 7 mole percent cationic monomer.
      <br/>
      Large flocs or clumps quickly formed.
      <br/>
      Vigorous agitation was continued until there was no sign of flocs present.
      <br/>
      This was meant to replicate conditions where the flocculant is added at the fan pump.
      <br/>
      At this point, the zeolite crystalloid, produced as previously described with a 2.58:1 Sio2 /Na2 O weight ratio and a 1:1 Al:Si weight ratio, was added at 0.5 lb/ton while agitation continued.
      <br/>
      Immediately upon addition, the fibers, fines, and pigment coagulated into highly desirable small, discrete flocs, producing a sparkling clear supernatant.
      <br/>
      Had the large floc clumps persisted, one would expect poor formation on a paper machine forming wire.
      <br/>
      The persistence of these small discrete flocs under agitation was outstanding, which indicates the promise of superior retention, drainage, and formation on the forming wire.
      <br/>
      These excellent results held at zeolite crystalloid dosages of up to 20 lb/ton.
      <br/>
      These very low dosages of an inexpensive material offer the potential for substantial cost savings in the manufacture of paper.
    </p>
    <p num="58">Example 2</p>
    <p num="59">Comparing the efficiency of zeolite crystalloid coagulation to colloidal silica in an alkaline papermaking process</p>
    <p num="60">
      Simulated alkaline papermaking jar tests (as in Example 1) were run using a 5 nm colloidal silica (CS) as a coagulant compared to the ZCC made with PQ-M sodium silicate solution using an Al/Si weight ratio of 1:1 and with an estimated crystal size of 5 nm to 6 nm (growth was stopped at the first sign of opalescence).
      <br/>
      With 0.6 lb/ton of CPAM (Allied Colloids Percol-175) and 1 lb/ton of ZCC, clarity and persistence were both excellent and the settling rate after agitation was stopped was fast.
      <br/>
      With dosages of two, three, and four lb/ton of ZCC the results were the same.
      <br/>
      Using the colloidal silica as the coagulant and using 0.6 lb/ton of CPAM, a one lb/ton dosage initially looked excellent but quickly deteriorated, having poor floc persistence under agitation.
      <br/>
      The activity would not be expected to hold up through the paper machine headbox and slice onto the forming table.
      <br/>
      With a two lb/ton dosage, the results were poor from the beginning.
      <br/>
      It is apparent that with the cationic flocculant and the anionic CS, the charge balance was very sensitive and had a strong effect on coagulation efficiency.
      <br/>
      To achieve the same clarity and persistence of 0.6 lb/ton CPAM and 1 lb/ton ZCC, dosages of 3 lb/ton CPAM and 4 lb/ton CS were required and the settling and compaction after agitation was stopped was not as good with the colloidal silica.

    <p num="61">Example 3</p>
    <p num="62">Comparing a bentonite coagulant to zeolite crystalloid coagulants in an alkaline papermaking process</p>
    <p num="63">
      Simulated papermaking tests (as in Example 1) were run using Allied Colloids Hydrocol (a processed bentonitic montmorillonite microparticulate coagulant commonly referred to as a bentonite in the literature and related patents).
      <br/>
      At 0.6 lb/ton CPAM plus 1 lb/ton bentonite the immediate clarity was excellent but persistence was poor, indicating that the results would not last through the paper machine headbox.
      <br/>
      With two lb/ton of bentonite, the results were the same.
      <br/>
      Using 3 lb/ton CPAM and 4 lb/ton bentonite (dosages commonly reported to be in industrial use), the results were very nearly as good as 0.6 lb/ton CPAM and one lb/ton ZCC.
      <br/>
      The clarity was excellent, and the persistence and settling rate were very good.

    <p num="64">Example 4</p>
    <p num="65">Correcting formation problems caused by severe auto-flocculation of unbleached semi-chemical fibers used in making corrugated medium</p>
    <p num="66">
      An important function of corrugating medium is to help provide strong resistance to edgewise crushing so that the weight of stacked boxes will not cause the sides to collapse.
      <br/>
      A well-formed sheet will be stronger per unit of basis weight than a sheet containing clumps of fiber separated by relatively thin areas.
      <br/>
      The thin areas are the weak links.
      <br/>
      There is a serious problem in the manufacture of corrugating medium in that the unbleached semichemical, high lignin-containing fibers tend to clump together or autoflocculate as they flow through the paper machine headbox and onto the traveling wire.
      <br/>
      Using the principles of the invention, it has been found that the addition of calcium ions helps reduce autocoagulation of the fibers by adsorbing onto them.
      <br/>
      Then the addition of 0.5 lb/ton of a cationic acrylamide copolymer flocculant caused heavy clumping at first but the fibers redispersed with high shear mixing, after which time the addition of 4 lb/ton of ZCC immediately cleared the suspension without causing clumping.
      <br/>
      The autoflocculation was eliminated and the ZCC has attached the fiber fines to the longer fibers for good retention of fines, good drainage, and good overall distribution of fibers so that a well-formed sheet may be expected.
    </p>
    <p num="67">Example 5</p>
    <p num="68">Demonstrating the efficiency of ZCC in clarifying waters with heavy clay soil loadings</p>
    <p num="69">
      The coagulants were tested for efficiency using a standard 9500 ppm native clay soil slurry augmented with calcium chloride so as to promote calcium ion adsorption on the surface of the native clay soil particles.
      <br/>
      Three ml portions of this slurry were added to respective beakers. pH levels of 6.4 and 8.2, respectively, were used.
      <br/>
      Syringes delivering 30 drops/ml were used to add the coagulants.
      <br/>
      The coagulants tested were diluted to 0.00417 wt. % solids.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, one milliliter contained about 0.0014 mg coagulant solids.
      <br/>
      Therefore, one drop added to 3 ml gave an applied dosage of 0.47 ppm or about 0.5 ppm. The coagulant activity was evaluated on the basis of type of floc, rapidity of development, clarity of supernatant, and the persistence of the floc and clarity under agitation.

      It can be seen that the Al/Si weight ratio of 1.0 significantly outperformed the other ratios when the ZCC was made using sodium silicate with an SiO2 /Na2 O weight ratio of 2.58. It is also evident when using this Al/Si weight ratio of 1.0, the ZCC made from the sodium silicate having the 2.58 weight ratio of SiO2 /Na2 O was superior to that made from sodium silicate having different SiO2 /Na2 O ratios.
      <br/>
      Also, the preferred ZCC significantly outperformed colloidal silica.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      Table 2 shows that ZCC made from Kasil -1 potassium silicate and Nalco No. 2 sodium aluminate matched the results shown in Table 1 for an SiO2 /Na2 O weight ratio of 2.50:1 and an Al/Si weight ratio of 1:1.
      <br/>
      The 2.50:1 weight ratio of SiO2 to K2 O is the highest made by PQ Corp.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      It was also observed that the addition of very small amounts of cationic flocculants to waters containing particulates with calcium ions on the surface (so as to barely begin coagulation) significantly enhanced the overall coagulation efficiency when the ZCC was added.
      <br/>
      The settling rate was much faster.
      <br/>
      This would be valuable where faster settling is desired or needed as, for example, when clarification equipment is undersized for current operational loadings.
