    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a method and package for storing a pressurized container containing a drug.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      For environmental reasons, there has been a move to replace chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) (also simply known as "fluorocarbons") such as P11, P114 and P12 with hydrofluoroalkane propellants such as HFA-134a and HFA-227.
      <br/>
      When these hydrofluoroalkane propellants are used as a propellant in a pressurized drug delivery system, various technical problems can occur with various drug formulations.
      <br/>
      Also, it is necessary to modify the construction of metered dose inhalers for optimum stability and aerosol formation.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One storing mechanism for a metered dose inhaler (MDI) uses a plastic tube which has a resealable lid to close the tube.
      <br/>
      The resealable lid for this tube employs a desiccant to absorb moisture present in the tube.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Such plastic tubes typically increase manufacturing cost and require complex and/or expensive manufacturing processes.
      <br/>
      Such tubes are frequently bulky in that they require a significant amount of storage space relative to the size of the container disposed within the plastic tube.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      Accordingly, a need in the art exists for a method and package for storing a pressurized container filled with a propellant and a drug which substantially prevents ingression of water vapor and particulate matter into the storage package while permitting egression of the propellant to increase shelf life and performance of the drug and the propellant.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a need exists in the art to provide a method and package for storing a pressurized container filled with a drug and a propellant which is cost effective and which does not require complex manufacturing processes and which in turn efficiently envelopes the container to maximize available storage space.
    </p>
    <p num="9">It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a method and package for storing a pressurized container, where the pressurized container is filled with a drug and a propellant and where the method and package substantially prevent ingression of water vapor and particulate matter into the package while permitting egression of the propellant whereby shelf life of the drug is prolonged and performance of the drug and the propellant are maintained or increased.</p>
    <p num="10">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method and package for storing a pressurized container filled with a drug and a propellant where the method and package substantially absorb residual moisture in the package enclosing the pressurized container that is sometimes present on the outer surface of the pressurized container prior to sealing pressurized container within the package.</p>
    <p num="11">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method and package for storing a pressurized container including a drug and a propellant which substantially reduces manufacturing costs while substantially reducing the complexity of the manufacturing process of the package.</p>
    <p num="12">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method and package for storing a pressurized container having a drug and a propellant which is easily opened and readily disposable.</p>
    <p num="13">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method and package for storing a pressurized container having a drug and a propellant, whereby the propellant preferably meets governmental guidelines which prohibit the use of CFCs.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Another object of the present invention is to provide a method and package for storing a pressurized container which includes a drug and a propellant that does not require complex mechanical devices to envelope or enclose the pressurized container while substantially reducing the amount of storage space needed for the pressurized container where the package substantially conforms to the shape of the pressurized container.
      <br/>
      The package is amorphous in shape due to the flexible materials from which it is made.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method and package which form an enclosed volume that stores a pressurized container in a controlled environment where the pressurized container is isolated from harmful environmental conditions such as humidity, dust, light, and water vapor and other particulate matter.</p>
    <p num="16">
      Another object of the present invention is to provide and article of manufacture comprising an integral aerosol dispensing apparatus, a drug formulation, and a flexible package.
      <br/>
      It is further an object of the present invention to provide a drug formulation and carrier with packaging material having labeling and information relating to the composition contained therein and printed thereon.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a further object of the invention is to provide an article of manufacture having a brochure, report, notice, pamphlet, or leaflet containing product information.
    </p>
    <p num="17">These and other objects of the present invention are fulfilled by providing a container storage system comprising: a drug formulation comprising a mixture of a drug and a propellant; a pressurized container filled with the drug formulation at a predetermined pressure; and a flexible package for wrapping and sealing the pressurized container providing an enclosed volume in which the pressurized container is disposed, the flexible package being impermeable to water vapor and permeable to the propellant, the flexible package substantially preventing ingression of water vapor and particulate matter into the enclosed volume while permitting egression of the propellant.</p>
    <p num="18">In addition, these and other objects of the present invention are also accomplished by providing a method of storing a container comprising the steps of: providing a flexible package material, which is impermeable to water vapor and permeable to a propellant; filling a container with a drug formulation comprising a drug and the propellant at a predetermined pressure; wrapping the container with the flexible package material to form an enclosed volume in which the container is disposed therein; and sealing the flexible package which in turn closes said enclosed volume, the flexible package substantially preventing ingression of water vapor and particulate matter into the enclosed volume while permitting egression of the propellant from the enclosed volume.</p>
    <p num="19">Moreover, these and other objects of the present invention are fulfilled by a packaged metered dose inhaler comprising: an MDI comprising a container and a drug metering valve, a pressurized drug formulation in the container comprising a propellant and a drug dispersed or dissolved in the propellant; and an overwrap of flexible material enclosing said MDI, the overwrap being made of a moisture impermeable material.</p>
    <p num="20">Also, these and other objects of present invention are accomplished by providing an article of manufacture comprising: an aerosol dispensing apparatus for dispensing metered amounts of fluid material from a reservoir, the apparatus comprising a container defining a reservoir, a dispensing valve; a drug formulation located within the aerosol dispensing apparatus comprising a safe and effective medicament and a pharmaceutically acceptable propellant; and a flexible package for wrapping and sealing the container providing an enclosed volume in which said pressurized container is disposed, the flexible package being substantially impermeable to water vapor and permeable to the propellant, the flexible package substantially preventing ingression of water vapor and particulate matter into the enclosed volume while permitting egression of the propellant.</p>
    <p num="21">These and other objects of the present invention are also accomplished by providing a method of improving a product performance comprising the steps of: providing a flexible package material made of at least one heat sealable layer, at least one layer of a metal foil, and a protective layer; the flexible package material being impermeable to water vapor and permeable to a propellant; filling a container with a drug formulation comprising a drug and the propellant at a predetermined pressure; wrapping the container with the flexible package material to form an enclosed volume in which the container is disposed therein; and sealing the flexible package which in turn closes the enclosed volume, the flexible package substantially preventing ingression of water vapor and particulate matter into the enclosed volume while permitting egression of the propellant from the enclosed volume.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="24">Pressurized Containers</p>
    <p num="25">
      The pressurized containers useful in the invention include any containers in which a drug and a propellant can be stored.
      <br/>
      Slow leakage of propellant sometimes occurs in metered dose inhalers (MDIs) and the present invention is particularly useful in connection with MDIs that may have slow leaks.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The pressurized container is preferably an MDI or an MDI car The term "metered dose inhaler" or "MDf" means a unit comprising a can, a crimped cap covering the mouth of the can, and a drug metering valve situated in the cap, while the term "MDI system" also includes a suitable channeling device.
      <br/>
      The term "MDI can" means the container without the cap and valve.
      <br/>
      The term "drug metering valve" or "MDI valve" refers to a valve and its associated mechanisms which delivers a predetermined amount of drug formulation from an MDI upon each activation.
      <br/>
      The channeling device may comprise, for example, an actuating device for the valve and a cylindrical or cone-like passage through which medicament may be delivered from the filled MDI can via the MDI valve to the nose or mouth of a patient, e.g. a mouthpiece actuator.
      <br/>
      The relation of the parts of a typical MDI is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,261,538 incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      An exemplary MDI is disclosed in WO 96/26755, the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      Other exemplary pressurized containers for use in MDIs are disclosed in WO 96/32151, WO 96/32345, WO 96/32150 and WO 96/32099.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The pressurized container 34 is preferably a vial made from aluminum.
      <br/>
      However, other materials are not beyond the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Other materials for the pressurized container 34 include, but are not limited to, ferrous alloys, non-ferrous alloys, such as stainless steel, ceramic materials, polymers, composite materials, and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Suitable containers which contain a polymeric coating on the inside thereof are disclosed in WO 96/32151.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Most often the MDI can and cap are made of aluminum or an alloy of aluminum, although other metals not affected by the drug formulation, such as stainless steel, an alloy of copper or tin plate, may be used.
      <br/>
      An MDI can may also be fabricated from glass or plastic.
      <br/>
      Preferably, however, the MDI cans employed in the present invention are made of aluminum or an alloy thereof.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, strengthened aluminum or aluminum alloy MDI cans may be employed.
      <br/>
      Such strengthened MDI cans are capable of withstanding particularly stressful coating and curing conditions, e.g., particularly high temperatures, which may be required for certain fluorocarbon polymers.
      <br/>
      Strengthened MDI cans which have a reduced tendency to malform under high temperatures include MDI cans comprising side walls and a base of increased thickness and MDI cans comprising a substantially ellipsoidal base (which increases the angle between the side walls and the base of the can), rather than the hemispherical base of standard MDI cans.
      <br/>
      MDI cans having an ellipsoidal base offer the further advantage of facilitating the coating process.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The MDI cans include MDI cans supplied by Presspart of Cary, N.C., USA or the United Kingdom, or by Neotechnic of the United Kingdom.
      <br/>
      The MDI cans typically have a neck diameter of 20 millimeters, although any suitable neck diameter may be used and can vary in height from 30 millimeters to 60 millimeters.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The drug metering valve consists of parts usually made of stainless steel, a pharmacologically inert and propellant resistant polymer, such as acetal (polyoxymethylene), polyamide (e.g., Nylon.RTM.), polycarbonate, polyester, fluorocarbon polymer (e.g., Teflon.RTM.) or a combination of these materials.
      <br/>
      Additionally, seals and "O" rings of various materials (e.g., nitrile rubbers, polyurethane, acetyl resin, fluorocarbon polymers), or other elastomeric materials are employed in and around the valve.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The preferred MDI valves have typical metering chamber volumes of 25 to 63 microliters.
      <br/>
      The valves preferably have a ferrule skirt to suit a 20 mm neck diameter can.
      <br/>
      Typical suppliers of MDI valves include Valois Pharm, France; Bespak of Europe or the United Kingdom; or Neotechnic, United Kingdom.
    </p>
    <p num="32">Drugs</p>
    <p num="33">
      Preferred drugs (also referred to as "medicaments") and drug combinations are disclosed in WO 96/32151, WO 96/32345, WO 96/32150 and WO 96/32099, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      These drugs include, for example, fluticasone propionate or a physiologically acceptable solvate thereof, beclomethasone dipropionate or a physiologically acceptable solvate thereof, salmeterol or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof and albuterol or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof.
      <br/>
      Medicaments may be selected from, for example, analgesics, e.g. codeine, dihydromorphine, ergotamine, fentanyl or morphine, anginal preparations, e.g. diltiazem; antiallergics, e.g. cromoglycate, ketotifen or nedocromil; antiinfectives e.g. cephalosporins, penicillins, streptomycin, sulphonamides, tetracyclines and pentamidine; antihistamines, e.g. methapyrilene; anti-inflammatories, e.g. beclomethasone (e.g. the dipropionate), flunisolide, budesonide, tipredane or triamcinolone acetonide; antitussives, e.g. noscapine; bronchodilators, e.g. salbutamol, salmeterol, ephedrine, adrenaline, fenoterol, formoterol, isoprenaline, metaproterenol, phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pirbuterol, reproterol, rimiterol, terbutaline, isoetharine, tulobuterol, orciprenaline, or (-)-4-amino-3,5-dichloro- ALPHA -���6-�2-(2-pyridinyl)ethoxy�hexyl�-amino�-methyl�benzenemethanol; diuretics, e.g. amiloride; anticholinergics e.g. ipratropium, atropine or oxitropium; hormones, e.g. cortisone, hydrocortisone or prednisolone; xanthines e.g. aminophylline, choline theophyllinate, lysine theophyllinate or theophylline; and therapeutic proteins and peptides, e.g. insulin or glucagon.
      <br/>
      It will be clear to a person skilled in the art that, where appropriate, the medicaments may be used in the form of salts (e.g. as alkali metal or amine salts or as acid addition salts) or as esters (e.g. lower alkyl esters) or as solvates (e.g. hydrates) to optimise the activity and/or stability of the medicament and/or to minimize the solubility of the medicament in the propellant.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Additionally, any suitable combination of drugs can be used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, Seretide (fluticasone and Serevent) can be used in the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Propellants</p>
    <p num="36">
      "Propellants" used herein mean pharmacologically inert liquids with boiling points from about room temperature (25 (degree)  C.) to about -25 (degree)  C. which singly or in combination exert a high vapor pressure at room temperature, including CFCs such as Freon and hydrofluorocarbons.
      <br/>
      Upon activation of the MDI system, the high vapor pressure of the propellant in the MDI forces a metered amount of drug formulation out through the metering valve then the propellant very rapidly vaporizes dispersing the drug particles.
      <br/>
      The propellants used in the present invention are low boiling fluorocarbons; in particular, hydrofluorocarbons or hydrofluoroalkanes such as HFA-134a and HFA-227.
      <br/>
      The invention is particularly useful with propellants (including propellant mixtures) which are more hygroscopic than P11, P114 and/or P12 such as HFA-134a and HFA-227.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Additional Components of the Drug Formulation</p>
    <p num="38">
      The MDIs taught herein are particularly useful for containing and dispensing inhaled drug formulations with hydrofluoroalkane propellants such as 134a with little, or essentially no, excipient and which tend to deposit or cling to the interior walls and parts of the MDI system.
      <br/>
      In certain cases, it is advantageous to dispense an inhalation drug with essentially no excipient, e.g., where the patient may be allergic to an excipient or the drug reacts with an excipient.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Drug formulations for use in the invention may be free or substantially free of formulation excipients, e.g., surfactants and cosolvents, etc.
      <br/>
      Such drug formulations are advantageous since they may be substantially taste and odor free, less irritant and less toxic than excipient-containing formulations.
      <br/>
      Thus, a preferred drug formulation consists essentially of a drug, or a physiologically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, optionally in combination with one or more other pharmacologically active agent, and a fluorocarbon propellant.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Further drug formulations for use in the invention may be free or substantially free of surfactant.
      <br/>
      Thus, a further preferred drug formulation comprises or consists essentially of a drug (or a physiologically acceptable salt or solvate thereof), optionally in combination with one or more other pharmacologically active agents, a fluorocarbon propellant and 0.01 to 5% w/w based on the propellant of a polar cosolvent, which formulation is substantially free of surfactant.
      <br/>
      Preferred propellants are 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane or mixtures thereof, and especially 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane.
      <br/>
      However, the drug formulation may contain any additional excipients which are necessary or desirable to prepare a suitable drug formulation.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The term "excipients" as used herein means chemical agents having little or no pharmacological activity (for the quantities used) but which enhance the drug formulation or the performance of the MDI system.
      <br/>
      For example, excipients include but are not limited to surfactants, preservatives, flavorings, antioxidants, antiaggregating agents, and cosolvents, e.g., ethanol and diethyl ether.
    </p>
    <p num="42">Suitable surfactants are generally known in the art, for example, those surfactants disclosed in European Patent Application No. 0327777. The amount of surfactant employed is desirably in the range of 0.0001% to 50% w/w ratio relative to the drug, in particular 0.05 to 5% w/w ratio.</p>
    <p num="43">
      A polar cosolvent such as C2-6 aliphatic alcohols and polyols, e.g., glycerol, ethanol, isopropanol and propylene glycol, preferably ethanol, may be included in the drug formulation in the desired amount, either as the only excipient or in addition to other excipients, such as surfactants.
      <br/>
      Suitably, the drug formulation may contain 0.01 to 5% w/w based on the propellant of a polar cosolvent, e.g., ethanol, preferably 0.1 to 5% w/w, e.g., about 0.1 to 1% w/w.
    </p>
    <p num="44">Flexible Packaging Materials</p>
    <p num="45">
      The flexible packaging material can be any material which is impervious to or substantially impervious to moisture.
      <br/>
      The packaging material is preferably permeable to propellants such as HFA-134a and/or HFA-227 whereby if the propellant slowly leaks from the pressurized container, the propellant will slowly pass, by diffusion or otherwise, through the packaging material.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      For ease of manufacturing, and in order to provide the necessary properties to the packaging material, the flexible packaging material preferably comprises a non-thermoplastic substrate (such as a metal foil) and a heat sealable layer disposed thereon, and an additional protective layer, such as a polymer film of polyester.
      <br/>
      The heat sealable layer is usually disposed on the inner surface of the assembled package.
      <br/>
      The additional protective layer is usually disposed on the surface opposite the heat sealable layer.
      <br/>
      An example of a particularly useful foil laminate is a polyester film adhesively laminated to aluminum foil adhesively laminated to Ionomer (SURLYN (tm) ) film, for example, 12 MU  polyester/9 MU  aluminum/50 MU  ionomer film supplied by Lawson Mardon Singen (LMS).
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The substrate is preferably formed from aluminum foil.
      <br/>
      However, other metals for the substrate include, but are not limited to, tin, iron, zinc, or magnesium formed on a sheet by vacuum deposition or sputtering and a carboxyl group-containing polyolefin layer formed on the metal layer by lamination.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The heat sealable layer can be formed from any thermoplastic or thermosetting material such as an ionomer resin, polyolefin, or cycloolefin copolymer.
      <br/>
      Ionomer resins typically include ionically cross-linked ethylene-methacrylic acid and ethylene acrylic acid copolymers.
      <br/>
      Properties which distinguish these ionomers resins from other polyolefin heat-sealed polymers are high clarity, high impact resistance, low haze in lamination, tear resistance, abrasion resistance, solid state toughness, and moisture imperviousness.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the heat sealable layer is made out of SURLYN (tm)  (an ionomer resin) or a form of polyethylene to provide sufficient heat sealing properties.
    </p>
    <p num="49">The outer protective layer, if present, can be formed of any material as long as the final laminate has the requisite properties.</p>
    <p num="50">Preferably, the protective layer (e.g., polyester) is adhesively laminated to the substrate (e.g., aluminum) and the substrate layer in turn is adhesively laminated to the heat sealable layer (e.g., the ionomer film or SURLYN (tm)  (an ionomer resin)).</p>
    <p num="51">
      Preferred exemplary thicknesses of the three layers include a protective layer 1 to 40, preferably 4 to 30, more preferably 10 to 23 microns, and most preferably 12 microns; a substrate layer of 1 to 100, preferably 3 to 70, more preferably 5 to 50 microns, more preferably 6 to 20 microns, and most preferably 9 microns.
      <br/>
      For the heat sealable layer, preferred exemplary thicknesses include thicknesses of 1 to 100, preferably 5 to 70, more preferably 10 to 60, more preferably 20 to 55 microns, and most preferably 50 microns.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Adhesives may be used to join the respective layers of materials together.
      <br/>
      The adhesive layers are typically substantially smaller in thickness relative to the thickness of the substrate, heat sealable and/or protective layers which they bond.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The number, size, and shape of the layers are not limited to those layers shown in the drawings.
      <br/>
      Any number of layers with relative areas of any size and predetermined thicknesses may be used so long as the flexible package forms an enclosed volume which substantially prevents ingression of water vapor and particulate matter into the enclosed volume while permitting egression out of the enclosed volume of any propellant leaving the pressurized container.
      <br/>
      The size, shape, and number of layers of the package is typically a function of the size and contents of the pressurized container which includes a drug and a propellant.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The package is believed to operate similarly to a virtual one-way valve due to the composition of the layers and due to the transmission rate of water vapor molecules into the enclosed volume relative to the transmission rate of gas molecules of a propellant, such as a hydrofluoroalkane, out of the enclosed volume.
      <br/>
      The package permits the propellant in the pressurized container to diffuse out of the enclosed volume while substantially preventing water vapor and other particulate matter from entering the enclosed volume.
      <br/>
      Excess or leakage of the propellant is permitted to egress from the package.
      <br/>
      The virtual one-way valve function of the package prevents or minimizes the chance of any sudden ruptures or prevents or minimizes unexpected expulsion of the propellant during opening of the package.
    </p>
    <p num="55">Moisture Absorbing Materials</p>
    <p num="56">
      The moisture absorbing material is preferably a silica gel desiccant sachet.
      <br/>
      However, other vapor or moisture absorbing mechanisms are not beyond the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Other vapor or moisture absorbing materials include desiccants made from inorganic materials such a zeolites and aluminas.
      <br/>
      Such inorganic materials of vapor or moisture absorbing materials have high water absorption capacities and favorable water absorption isotherm shapes.
      <br/>
      The water absorption capacity of such materials typically varies from 20 to 50 weight percent.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      In the preferred embodiment, the absorbing material is a INIPAX.RTM. supplied by Multisorb Technologies in the United States and Silgelac in Europe (silica gel packaged inside TYVEK.RTM., which is a nylon mesh bonded with a microporous polyurethane).
      <br/>
      Other exemplary moisture absorbing materials include, but are not limited to, alumina, bauxite, anhydrous, calcium sulfate, water-absorbing clay, activated bentonite clay, a molecular sieve, or other like Materials which optionally include a moisture sensitive color indicator such as cobalt chloride to indicate when the desiccant is no longer operable.
      <br/>
      While in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the package is designed to substantially prevent ingression of water vapor and particulate matter into the enclosed volume, the moisture absorbing material is placed within the enclosed volume in order to absorb any residual moisture present in the atmosphere or on the external surface of the pressurized container or mouthpiece or a combination thereof, prior to sealing the package.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The desiccant should be present in an amount sufficient to absorb any residual moisture inside the package or which might escape from inside the pressurized container.
      <br/>
      When silica gel is used, 1 g to 10 g of silica gel is sufficient for a typical MDI.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the desiccant should be present in an amount sufficient to absorb any moisture that possibly ingresses from the external environment.
    </p>
    <p num="59">It is also possible to place the desiccant inside the container, either loose in the canister or as part of an assembly attached to the canister.</p>
    <p num="60">The Container Storage System</p>
    <p num="61">
      Referring in detail to the drawings and with particular reference to FIG. 1, a container storage system (or packaged product) 20 is shown.
      <br/>
      The container storage system 20 includes a package or wrapping 22 that employs multi-layers of material 24, 26, 28. (See FIG. 4.) The package 22 further includes fin seams 30, 32 which are disposed along two parallel side edges of the package and along a single longitudinal edge of the package 22.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The number and type of fin seams 30, 32 are not limited to the types shown in the drawings.
      <br/>
      The package 22 can include additional seams or significantly fewer seams such as a continuous single seam.
      <br/>
      The orientation of the seams 30, 32 is not limited to the orientation shown in the drawings.
      <br/>
      The orientation of the seams 30, 32 is typically a function of the sealing device and such seams may be oriented in a manner which substantially increases manufacturing efficiency.
      <br/>
      During manufacture, the longitudinal seam 30 may be formed first by heat sealing and the two end seams 32 may then be formed by heat sealing to close the package.
      <br/>
      Other types of seams include, but are not limited to, gusset type seams which include excess material which provides expansibility, stitched type seams, or mechanically crimped seams, and other like structures.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The container storage system includes a pressurized container 34 which is preferably part of an MDI 36 (see FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      While the preferred pressurized container 34 is part of an MDI 36, other devices which include pressurized containers 34 are not beyond the scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The fin seams 30 and 32 are formed by a conventional heat sealing device which mechanically crimps sides of the package 22 together while simultaneously providing heat to the sides 30, 32.
      <br/>
      The heat sealing device typically has electrical heater elements shaped to produce the pattern of the fin seams 30, 32 where the fin seams include multiple ridges 38.
      <br/>
      The sealing mechanism of the container storage system 20 of the present invention is not limited to heat sealing devices.
      <br/>
      Other sealing devices include, but are not limited to, glue sealing machines, sonic welding machines, electron beam radiation machines, and other: like sealing devices.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      As seen in FIGS. 1 and 2, the package 22 preferably has a substantially rectangular configuration with a substantially elliptical cross section, however, other shapes of the package 22 are not beyond the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Other shapes include, but are not limited to circular, square, triangular, trapezoidal, pentagonal, hexagonal, octagonal, and other like shapes.
      <br/>
      The shape of the package 22 is preferably a function of the shape of the enclosed pressurized container 34 as well as the amount and type of storage space since the package 2,, is made from flexible materials as will be described in further detail below.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      As seen in FIG. 3, the package 22 provides an enclosed volume 40 in which the pressurized container 34 is disposed therein.
      <br/>
      The size of the enclosed volume 40 can be adjusted according to the size of the pressurized container 34 and related parts thereto.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the enclosed volume 40 is of a size which permits relative ease of closing respective sides and layers 24, 26 and 28 without substantial stretching of the package 22.
      <br/>
      The enclosed volume 40 may be substantially evacuated prior to formation of the fin seams 30, 32 to substantially reduce any water vapor being present in the enclosed volume 40.
      <br/>
      The enclosed volume 40 may be evacuated to such a degree that the enclosed volume 40 is a vacuum region around the pressurized container 34.
      <br/>
      While the enclosed volume 40, may remain constant, its relative shape may change according to shifting of the pressurized container 34 disposed within the enclosed volume 40.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The amorphous shape of the enclosed volume 40 is attributed to the flexible materials which make up the layers 24, 26, 28 of the package 22 which will be discussed in further detail below.
      <br/>
      The enclosed volume can be varied in size such that it substantially conforms to the shape of the pressurized container 34 and any related parts thereto or such that the enclosed volume 40 is larger than the pressurized container 34, as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      When the enclosed volume is of a size which is substantially equivalent with the surface area of the pressurized container 34 and related parts, the layers 24, 26, and 28 of material substantially conform to the shape of the pressurized canister 34 and related parts.
      <br/>
      The package is preferably placed in a separate, more rigid container, such as a paperboard or cardboard box 74 (See FIG. 6) typically used in the pharmaceutical industry.
      <br/>
      The package may expand during storage due to slow leakage of the propellant from the pressurized container.
      <br/>
      In this situation, the shape of the package may conform to some extent to the internal shape of the rigid container if the volume of the rigid container is just slightly larger than the expanded volume of the flexible package.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      In one exemplary embodiment, FIG. 3 shows the pressurized container 34 to be connected to a nozzle 42 by a valve stem 44.

      <br/>
      Other valve systems include, but are not limited to, wedge gate valve systems, double-disc gate valve systems, globe and angle valve systems, swing check valve systems, end cock valve systems, and other like valve systems.
      <br/>
      Since the pressurized container 34 is preferably part of an MDI, the valve design is typically a function of providing a predetermined dosage or amount of the drug contained within the pressurized container 34 to a user.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The nozzle 42 is typically fixably secured to the mouthpiece 46.
      <br/>
      However, other embodiments where the nozzle 42 is separate or detached from the mouthpiece 46 is not beyond the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The pressurized canister 34, the nozzle 42, and the mouthpiece 46 together comprise an MDI 36.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      As seen in FIG. 3, nozzle 42 is in fluid communication with the mouthpiece 46 so that upon movement of the pressurized container relative to the mouthpiece 46 in a direction where the pressurized container 34 moves towards the nozzle 42 fixed to one side of the mouthpiece 46, a metered dosage or predetermined amount of the drug and propellant contained within the pressurized container 34 is released.
      <br/>
      Such a combination of the fixed nozzle 42, mouthpiece 46, valve stem 44, and pressurized container 34 form an MDI 36 as outlined above.

      In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the method and package for storing a pressurized canister of the present invention, shelf-life tests were carried out upon packages 22 which contained MDIs such as salmeterol/HFA-134a inhalers, Albuterol/HFA-134a, and Fluticasone Propionate/HFA-134a inhalers.
      <br/>
      A first shelf-life test of Albuterol/HFA-134a inhalers showed that by placing an MDI into the package 22 containing silica gel desiccant or an absorbing mechanism 50, it was possible to substantially reduce the amount of moisture ingression (measured in Parts Per Million or PPM) into the inhaler after three months of storage at 40 (degree)  C. and at 85% relative humidity.

      A second test was performed and the results indicate that the reduction of moisture content within the package 22 can improve overall product performance of the liquid contained within the pressurized container 34, where the liquid includes an asthma treating drug and a propellant.

      In the second test, the experiment was performed where aged non-overwrapped salmeterol/HFA-134a inhalers were compared to MDIs provided in the package 22.
      <br/>
      The experiment included non-overwrapped inhalers which were stored for three months at either 30 (degree)  C./60% relative humidity or 40 (degree)  C./75% relative humidity.

      The non-overwrapped inhalers were then placed in a desiccator containing phosphorous pentoxide.

      The data in Table 2 shows that loss and product performance (loss in FPM, for salmeterol) is directly related to change in moisture content.
      <br/>
      The results indicated that product performance of MDIs is reversible, although not 100% reversible.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if moisture causes loss in product performance, it is possible to retrieve and improve the product performance by removing moisture from the MDI during storage.
      <br/>
      Such is the result with the package 22 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, the data shows how product performance is improved by controlling the moisture content within the MDI with the present invention.
