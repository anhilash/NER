    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to monolithic micromechanical devices and, more particularly, to monolithic micromechanical devices which include suspended microstructures and which may include circuitry.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The construction of microsensors on microchips is of great interest in many industries because of its potential to reduce size and cost of devices which require the sensing of environmental or other conditions.
      <br/>
      An accelerometer is just one example of a type of sensor which has wide application possibilities.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Acceleration sensors are known for measuring force or mass or to operate control systems responsive to acceleration.
      <br/>
      For instance, acceleration sensors may be used in automotive vehicles to deploy air bags responsive to a particular threshold deceleration rate of a vehicle.
      <br/>
      Acceleration sensors may also be used in the automotive industry as part of active suspension systems in which microcontrollers adjust suspension components responsive to the vertical acceleration of the wheels.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      An accelerometer comprises an acceleration-sensing element, or transducer, which is commonly interfaced to resolving circuitry for producing a useful output signal from the output of the transducer.
      <br/>
      Though the term "accelerometer" is sometimes used to refer to the sensor (or transducer) itself, the term is used herein to denote a complete system including a transducer as well as the resolving circuitry.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Many commercially available accelerometers employ transducers comprising a mechanical or electromechanical element (e.g., piezoelectric, piezoresistive or strain gauge).</p>
    <p num="7">
      Acceleration sensing microstructures embodied on silicon chips have been suggested in the prior art.
      <br/>
      For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 4,711,128 issued to Boura discloses an acceleration sensor formed by micromachining a fine monocrystal wafer.
      <br/>
      The sensor comprises a flat mobile mass suspended above the rest of the structure by means of two thin parallel strips situated on each side of the mass.
      <br/>
      The mass comprises at least one mobile capacitive plate which is disposed between two other capacitive plates which are not part of the suspended microstructure but are fixed on the structure.
      <br/>
      The mobile plates are charged to a voltage relative to the stationary plates.
      <br/>
      When the sensor is subjected to an acceleration, the mobile plates move relative to the fixed plates causing a change in capacitance between the mobile plates and each of the fixed plates.
      <br/>
      The change in capacitance is observed by observing the voltage between the mobile plate and the fixed plates and is a direct indication of the distance of movement of the fixed plate which, in turn, is a measurement of the acceleration.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,705,659 issued to Bernstein et al. teaches a technique of fabricating a free standing thin or thick structure such as an acceleration sensor, including the steps of providing a substrate, forming a layer of carbon on the substrate and depositing a film of polycrystalline material over the layer of carbon.
      <br/>
      The sandwich structure is heated in an oxidizing ambient to cause the oxidation of the carbon layer, leaving the polysilicon material as a free-standing film.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The prior art, however, does not teach a monolithic accelerometer in which the acceleration sensor as well as the resolving circuitry for producing a useful output are embodied on a single chip or a technique for making such a monolithic accelerometer.
      <br/>
      Thus, prior art accelerometers require a separate chip or other means containing circuitry for resolving the output of the sensor into a usable signal.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      In accordance with the invention, a monolithic capacitance-type microstructure is provided.
      <br/>
      The microstructure comprises a semiconductor substrate including a surface, a plurality of posts extending from the surface of the substrate, a bridge suspended from the posts, the bridge including an element that is movable with respect to the surface of the substrate, and an electrically-conductive substantially stationary element anchored to the substrate and positioned relative to the movable element such that the movable element and the substantially stationary element form a capacitor.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the movable element is laterally movable with respect to the surface of the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The bridge may include a central beam and a plurality of generally parallel electrically conductive movable fingers extending transversely from the beam.
      <br/>
      The substantially stationary element may comprise a plurality of generally parallel electrically-conductive, substantially stationary fingers.
      <br/>
      Each of the substantially stationary fingers may correspond to one of the movable fingers and be positioned relative to the corresponding movable finger such that the movable finger and the corresponding substantially stationary finger form a capacitor, with movement of the movable fingers relative to the substantially stationary fingers altering the capacitance between each of the movable fingers and the corresponding substantially stationary finger.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      According to a further aspect of the invention, a monolithic micromechanical apparatus may comprise a monolithic capacitance-type microstructure, as described above, and circuitry disposed on the substrate and operationally coupled to the movable fingers and the substantially stationary fingers for processing a signal based on a relative positioning of the movable fingers and the substantially stationary fingers.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the monolithic capacitance-type microstructure comprises an acceleration sensor.

      U.S. patent application No. 07/569,080 filed Aug. 17, 1990 and entitled MONOLITHIC ACCELEROMETER is assigned to the same assignee as this application, and the disclosure of that application is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      That patent application discloses a monolithic accelerometer which can be fabricated by the method disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      Further, U.S. patent application No. 071872,037 entitled METHOD FOR FABRICATING MICROSTRUCTURES, filed on Apr. 22, 1992 and assigned to the same assignee as the present application, discloses an improvement on the method disclosed herein relating to a method for preventing the suspended microstructure from becoming damaged or stuck to the substrate during the fabrication processes.
      <br/>
      The disclosure of that patent application is also incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      FIGS. 1A and 1B are top and side views, respectively, of the suspended portion 10 of an exemplary microstructure which may be fabricated by the method of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As shown in the drawings, the suspended central beam 12 has a plurality of suspended arms 14 extending transversely therefrom.
      <br/>
      The beam 12 is supported at opposite ends from support beams 16 and 18.
      <br/>
      Support beams 16 and 18 are suspended above the silicon substrate by anchors 20, 22, 24 and 26.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      FIGS. 1A and 1B show only the suspended portion of the microstructure.
      <br/>
      However, in an actual commercially usable device, the microstructure would also comprise fixed components.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Referring now to FIG. 2A, a high-level block diagram is shown of a differential-capacitor accelerometer 10 according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The accelerometer 10 comprises a signal source 1, sensor 2 having first and second differential capacitors 200 and 300, and a signal resolver 3.
      <br/>
      Differential capacitors 200 and 300 are fabricated so that one electrode of each moves when force is applied, such that one capacitance increases and the other decreases.
      <br/>
      The signal source 1 drives the capacitors 200, 300 with sinusoidal signals of equal frequency, phase and amplitude, but of opposite polarities.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the amplitude and phase of the signal at the junction 4 of the differential capacitors is a function of the difference in capacitances, which is directly related to the force-induced displacement of the capacitor electrodes due to acceleration.
      <br/>
      The signal resolver processes this signal, to generate therefrom a signal proportional to the acceleration of the capacitor plates relative to the substrate and package of the assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Each of the electrodes of a differential capacitor sensor according to the present invention is formed of a plurality of segments which are arranged in such a manner that each capacitor is built up from a plurality of smaller capacitance "cells" connected in parallel.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2B shows a top view of an exemplary differential-capacitor sensor 5 according to the invention, but with only a single capacitance cell being depicted, to avoid unnecessary obfuscation of the inventive concept.
      <br/>
      On top of a silicon substrate 8, a suspended polysilicon "beam" 6 is formed. (The method of forming this suspended structure is discussed below.) Beam 6 rests above the surface of the substrate, on four posts, or anchors, 7A-7D, indicated by the "X" symbols in the figure.
      <br/>
      Beam 6 is generally H-shaped, with two elongated, narrow legs 16 and 18, and a transverse central member 12 suspended between them.
      <br/>
      Central member 12 is typically much stiffer and more massive than legs 16 and 18.
      <br/>
      A pair of beam fingers 14A and 14B depend in parallel orientation from central member 12, transversely to the axis 93 of the beam.
      <br/>
      Finger 14A forms one electrode of a parallel plate capacitor, having a stationary member 29A as its opposite electrode, or plate.
      <br/>
      Similarly, finger 14B forms one electrode of a second parallel plate capacitor, having a stationary member 28B as its opposite plate.
      <br/>
      Note that fingers 14A and 14B are connected together both physically and electrically and are, thus, a common electrode.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Electrical connection is made to fingers 29A and 28B via a heavily n+doped region 9A and the polysilicon bridge itself.
      <br/>
      Electrical connection is made to plate 29A via a heavily n+doped region 9B, and connection to plate 28A is made via a similar region 9C.
      <br/>
      As will be shown below, regions 9B and 9C may be extended to connect together, in parallel, the similar members of other capacitance cells.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      An n+doped region 91 also is provided beneath the entire polysilicon bridge structure, including the capacitance cells, as a bootstrap diffusion for reducing parasitic capacitance from the beam to the substrate.
      <br/>
      This is necessitated, at least in part, by the very low values of the capacitance per cell.
      <br/>
      In the example of FIGS. 2B and 2C, using the dimensions provided herein, each capacitor has a nominal capacitance of about 0.002 pF. With 56 cells in parallel, the total capacitance at rest is only about 0.1 pF. A full scale measurement involves only about an eight percent change in the value of each capacitor when the sensor is operated open-loop; naturally, in closed-loop operation the change is about ten times less.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The extension of the sensor architecture of FIG. 2B to multiple cells is illustrated in FIG. 2C for a four-cell example, the four cells being labeled 62A-62D.</p>
    <p num="22">The approximate dimensions below may be used to fabricate such a sensor, the dimension labels pertaining to the features shown on FIG. 2B:</p>
    <p num="23">d1 =300 micrometers d2 =2.0 micrometers d3 =40 micrometers d4 =450 micrometers d5 =125 micrometers d6 =8 micrometers d7 =5 micrometers d8 =3 micrometers</p>
    <p num="24">For purposes of reference in the discussion below, the heavily-doped, or metallization, regions 9A, 9B, 9C, and 91 are shown as terminating at terminals 72, 74, 76, and 80, respectively, though it should be understood that no actual connection terminal need be present at those physical locations.</p>
    <p num="25">
      When a force is applied to the substrate 8, in the x-direction, the substrate and plates move in that direction while the beam 12 tends to remain in its prior condition.
      <br/>
      Motion of the beam relative to the substrate is permitted by the fact that legs 16 and 18 are not absolutely rigid and will deflect slightly.
      <br/>
      When the force is in the positive x-direction, the separation between finger 14A and plate 29A increases, decreasing the capacitance in the capacitor they form; conversely, the separation between finger 14B and plate 28B decreases, increasing the capacitance in the capacitor they form.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      FIG. 2D provides a partially block-, partially schematic circuit diagram showing, in greater detail, a first (open-loop) embodiment of signal conditioning circuitry for use with the sensor of FIGS. 2B and 2C, for an accelerometer.
      <br/>
      The oscillator 100 supplies an approximately 1 MHZ sinusoidal signal to a carrier generator 102.
      <br/>
      The carrier generator supplies therefrom two 1 MHZ sinusoidal output signals 180 degrees out of phase from each other; thus, the output signals are of the form Vc sin  OMEGA t and --Vc sin  OMEGA t, where  OMEGA  is the angular frequency of the oscillator output signal.
      <br/>
      The first carrier signal is supplied to terminal 74 of sensor 5, while the second carrier signal is supplied to terminal 76.
      <br/>
      Sensor output terminal 72 is connected to the non-inverting input of a buffer amplifier 104.
      <br/>
      The output of the buffer amplifier is connected to sensor terminal 80, the bootstrap diffusion contact.
      <br/>
      Through this connection, the parasitic capacitance is prevented from loading the common node 72.
      <br/>
      A large resistance 106 (e.g., 3M) is connected between a reference supply voltage VX and the non-inverting input of buffer 104, to establish a d.c. operating point for the bridge.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The output of the buffer feeds a synchronous switching demodulator 110.
      <br/>
      The demodulator includes a switching circuit which is connected and responsive to the output of the oscillator 100.
      <br/>
      The double-ended output from the demodulator is converted to a single-ended output Vo by a buffer amplifier 120.
      <br/>
      The value of Vo is given by the formula Vo =Vc maG/km d0, where Vc is the carrier amplitude, m is the bridge mass, a is acceleration, km is the beam's mechanical spring constant, do is the nominal capacitor gap, and G is a scaling factor which accounts for buffer, demodulator and output amplifier gains.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Turning to FIG. 2E, a second embodiment is shown for signal conditioning circuitry employing the sensor of FIGS. 2B and 2C. In contrast to the open loop approach of FIG. 2D, the apparatus of FIG. 2E is a closed-loop, force-balance accelerometer.
      <br/>
      To better illustrate the force-balance principle, the bridge/differential-capacitor assembly is modeled as a conductive mass 122 suspended between a first capacitor plate 124 and a second capacitor plate 126, which establishes first and second differential capacitances, the latter being shown as capacitors 200 and 300, respectively.
      <br/>
      In the force-balance arrangement, capacitors 200 and 300 serve two purposes.
      <br/>
      First, they provide the means whereby electrostatic balancing forces are applied to the mass 122, at the acceleration frequency.
      <br/>
      Secondly, they allow the displacement x of the mass (i.e., the bridge mass) to be measured via the differential capacitance, at the carrier frequency.
      <br/>
      The negative feedback loop adjusts the output voltage Vo so that x=0 and inertial force applied to the bridge equals the net electrostatic force which is applied.
      <br/>
      The force balance equation is as follows:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="29">where m is the mass of the bridge,  EPSILON 0 is the dielectric constant of air, A is the capacitor plate area (each capacitor, nominal), d0 is the nominal, at rest, capacitor plate separation, x is the change in the capacitor plate separation (i.e., the distance the bridge moves due to the applied force), VR is the reference or d.c. offset voltage applied to the movable plates, and Vo is the output voltage.</p>
    <p num="30">For x&lt;&lt;d0, at a large loop gain, the output voltage, Vo, due to acceleration, is as follows:  (Equation image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="31">
      The output voltage is not sensitive to the spring constant of the structure, km, since the bridge remains undeflected.
      <br/>
      Full scale adjustment to compensate for values of m, d0 and A which vary from nominal due to process variations can be made by trimming resistors R1 and R2 in FIG. 2F.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The beam geometry is designed to minimize the mechanical spring constant, km, so that a beam initially fabricated off-center will be centered automatically by a small percentage of the full scale electrostatic force.
      <br/>
      Then, a desired zero "g" output voltage level can be established by trimming the relative carrier amplitudes.
      <br/>
      Taken to the limit, the mass may be considered floating and self-centering; the mechanical spring constant does, however, prevent the mass from responding to the carrier signal.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      A more detailed design for the force-balance accelerometer of FIG. 2E is shown in FIG. 2F. The oscillator 100, carrier generator 102, buffer 104, and demodulator 110 are the same as the corresponding elements of FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      The carrier generator is, however, a.c.-coupled to the sensor through capacitors 132 and 134.
      <br/>
      Capacitors 132 and 134 may typically be about 30-50 pF each, to exhibit low impedance at the 1 MHZ carrier frequency.
      <br/>
      To establish a net electrostatic force on the sensor capacitor plates, input terminals 74 and 76 are connected, respectively, to positive and negative offset (i.e., reference) supplies VR and --VR, through resistors 136 and 137, each typically being about 300k ohms.
      <br/>
      When the sensor capacitors 200 and 300 are equal (i.e., acceleration is zero), the electrostatic potential across the capacitors is balanced and equal.
      <br/>
      By contrast, acceleration causes the capacitors to have different values and the electrostatic potential on them to be unequal, causing a net unbalancing force.
      <br/>
      The demodulator detects this imbalance, which causes a change in the signal at the non-inverting input of amplifier 104, and supplies a feedback signal through resistor 106, to create a net electrostatic force to equalize the inertial force.
      <br/>
      Thus the feedback signal providing for force-balancing is supplied by connecting the junction of resistor 106 and the second demodulator signal input at the base of transistor 108 to the output of output buffer 120, instead of to fixed source VX.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Optionally, the circuit of FIG. 2F also has a resistor 140 and switch 142 connected in series between node 74 and ground.
      <br/>
      Closure of the switch will unbalance the input signals applied to nodes 74 and 76, which will apply a momentary electrostatic force on the bridge and produce a corresponding shift in the output to recenter the bridge.
      <br/>
      The output will be different if one or both capacitors fails (i.e., the bridge is untethered--broken--or the bridge is stuck).
      <br/>
      Thus, the closure of the switch can be used to test the proper operation of both the sensor and the circuitry.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Using the fabrication method of the present invention, the sensor of FIG. 2A and the circuitry of FIG. 2B can be embodied in a single chip, thus reducing the size and cost of the accelerometer.</p>
    <p num="36">
      The fabrication method of the present invention combines processes for fabricating BIMOS circuitry and for fabricating suspended microstructures in a mutually compatible manner.
      <br/>
      The overall method comprises approximately 330 individual steps.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Many of the approximately 330 individual steps are parts of processes which are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      For instance, the process of forming a photoresist mask by means of photolithography is well known in the prior art and comprises six individual steps.
      <br/>
      The individual steps of the present invention can be considered to comprise 67 processes.
      <br/>
      Some of the 67 processes are standard processes which are known in the art.
      <br/>
      The present invention lies in a novel combination of processes so as to fabricate a monolithic sensor as well as in the fact that some of the processes are novel in and of themselves.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      On an even broader level, the overall method can be considered to comprise 20 tasks, each task comprising one or more of the processes.
      <br/>
      The detailed discussion of the invention herein is divided into 20 task headings.
      <br/>
      The section under each task heading is further divided into one or more processes.
      <br/>
      Where necessary, the individual steps of a process are discussed.
      <br/>
      However, as previously noted, many of the individual steps are well known in the prior art and thus are not described in great detail.
      <br/>
      Further, not all steps or processes are illustrated in distinct FIGS. in order to avoid obfuscation of the invention.

    <heading>STARTING MATERIAL</heading>
    <p num="39">The starting material for the method of the present invention is a p-doped silicon substrate having a thin p-doped epitaxial layer thereover of approximately 30 microns in thickness.</p>
    <p num="40">TASK 1: N-WELL IMPLANT</p>
    <p num="41">
      This task involves implanting into the substrate the n-wells within which the transistors will be formed.
      <br/>
      It comprises processes 1-5.
    </p>
    <p num="42">PROCESS 1: OXIDE 1</p>
    <p num="43">
      A thermal oxide is formed on the surface of the chip by conventional thermal means.
      <br/>
      In particular, the chip is heated to approximately 1000 (degree)  C. in an oxygen ambient environment, causing the silicon on the surface of the chip to oxidize, forming a thermal oxide, SiO2, layer.
      <br/>
      The depth of oxidation is controlled by the temperature and exposure time.
      <br/>
      This layer is formed to a depth of approximately 3600 angstroms.
    </p>
    <p num="44">PROCESS 2: N-WELL MASK</p>
    <p num="45">
      This process involves patterning the oxide layer formed in step 1 into the desired pattern of n-wells on the substrate.
      <br/>
      This process comprises standard photolithography steps followed by etching of the oxide layer in a buffered oxide etch (hydrofluoric acid) bath.
    </p>
    <p num="46">In particular, photolithography comprises the steps of (1) coating the chip with a blanket layer of organic photoresist, (2) placing a mask in the form of the desired n-well pattern over, but not in contact with, the photoresist, (3) accurately aligning the mask over the chip, preferably in a stepper, so that all layers are formed in proper position relative to all other layers, (4) shining a light of specified wavelength through the mask onto the photoresist, causing the portions of the photoresist exposed under the mask to be developed while the portions occluded by the mask are not developed, (5) removing the mask, and (6) spraying the chip with a chemical wash which washes away the developed portion of the oxide layer.</p>
    <p num="47">
      After the six photolithography steps, the underlying oxide layer is exposed beneath the developed away portion of the photoresist.
      <br/>
      The chip is then dipped in a buffered oxide etch bath of hydrofluoric acid which etches through the exposed portion of the oxide layer but does not affect the portion of the oxide layer which is still covered by photoresist.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Commonly, the photoresist layer would be removed immediately after the etching of the underlying layer.
      <br/>
      In the present process, however, the photoresist is not yet removed for reasons which will be explained shortly.
    </p>
    <p num="49">PROCESS 3: N-WELL IMPLANT</p>
    <p num="50">
      In this process, phosphorus is blanket deposited on the chip to a concentration of 5.0E12/cm2. The phosphorus is implanted into the substrate only in the areas defined by the thermal oxide mask.
      <br/>
      The phosphorus is deposited in a standard ion implantation process in which the chip is bombarded with a high energy beam of phosphorus particles (n-type particles).
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the particles are accelerated to approximately 100 kiloelectron volts (KeV) of energy.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The photoresist mask which was formed in process 1, but not yet removed, serves as an additional protective mask in this n-well implant process.
      <br/>
      After the phosphorus is deposited, the photoresist can be stripped away.
      <br/>
      This can be done by either dipping the chip in a sulfuric acid etch bath or by dry plasma stripping.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment of the invention, it is done in an acid etch.
    </p>
    <p num="52">PROCESS 4: N-WELL DRIVE</p>
    <p num="53">
      At the completion of process 3, the phosphorus implanted in process 3 is diffused into the substrate only to a very shallow depth.
      <br/>
      The phosphorus now must be diffused (or driven) into the substrate to the desired depth.
      <br/>
      The phosphorous can be diff-used deeper into the substrate in a thermal process.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the chip is exposed to approximately 1250 (degree)  C. for approximately 7 hours in an ambient environment including a small amount of oxygen (to allow for some oxidation) as well as a gas.
      <br/>
      The depth of diffusion can be controlled by both the duration and temperature of the process.
    </p>
    <p num="54">PROCESS 5: OXIDE STRIP</p>
    <p num="55">
      The n-wells having been implanted and driven to the desired depth, the protective oxide layer formed in process I can now be removed.
      <br/>
      The chip is dipped into a buffered oxide etch bath.
      <br/>
      Since the photoresist mask has been removed, all remaining oxide is etched away leaving the bare silicon with n-wells.
    </p>
    <p num="56">TASK 2: THICK OXIDE</p>
    <p num="57">
      This task relates to field threshold adjust in order to improve surface isolation between the components which will be formed in the chip.
      <br/>
      It comprises processes 6-14.
      <br/>
      Thick oxide will be formed around essentially all individual transistors to increase surface isolation.
      <br/>
      However, the dopant level must be increased beneath the thick oxide regions to reduce surface leakage.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, arsenic will be implanted in the regions of the n-wells which will be covered by thick oxide (hereinafter n-field regions) to increase n-doping.
      <br/>
      In the other areas of the chip, boron will be implanted under the regions where the thick oxide will be formed (hereinafter p-field regions) in order to increase p-doping in those areas.
    </p>
    <p num="58">PROCESS 6: PAD OXIDE</p>
    <p num="59">
      In this process, a thin layer of thermal oxide (approximately 500 angstroms) is formed by oxidizing the surface of the chip as previously described with respect to process 1.
      <br/>
      This layer of oxide is formed in order to protect the silicon from the nitride which will be deposited in process 7.
      <br/>
      Nitride will damage bare silicon.
    </p>
    <p num="60">PROCESS 7: LPCVD NITRIDE DEPOSIT</p>
    <p num="61">
      In this process, a layer of approximately 1200 angstroms of silicon nitride is deposited in a standard low pressure chemical vapor deposition process.
      <br/>
      In low pressure chemical vapor deposition, the chip is placed in a low temperature furnace containing an ambient gas.
      <br/>
      In the case of a nitride deposition step, the ambient would include NH3 and SiH2 Cl2.
      <br/>
      The vaporized particles deposit themselves onto any available surface such as the substrate surface.
    </p>
    <p num="62">PROCESS 8: THICK OXIDE MASK</p>
    <p num="63">
      In this process, a photoresist mask is formed using conventional photolithography as previously described with respect to process 2.
      <br/>
      The mask is patterned to define the field inactive regions (i.e., n-field and p-field regions) of the chip where a thick layer of oxide is to be grown in an upcoming process for increasing surface isolation.
      <br/>
      Once the photoresist mask is formed, the nitride layer is etched by a conventional plasma etch.
      <br/>
      The photoresist mask is removed and the pad oxide is then etched in a conventional buffered oxide etch.
      <br/>
      Only the portions exposed through the nitride layer are etched away.
    </p>
    <p num="64">PROCESS 9: P-FIELD MASK</p>
    <p num="65">Since p-fields and n-fields must be doped with different impurities, a conventional photoresist mask is formed defining only those areas exposed through the thick oxide mask in which p-field regions are to be formed.</p>
    <p num="66">PROCESS 10: P-FIELD IMPLANT</p>
    <p num="67">
      In this process, boron particles (p-type particles) are implanted in the p-field regions exposed under the mask of photoresist to a concentration of 5.5E13/cm2 at 50 KeV by conventional ion implantation such as was described with respect to process 3.
      <br/>
      After the boron is implanted, the photoresist mask is stripped away.
    </p>
    <p num="68">PROCESS 11: N-FIELD MASK</p>
    <p num="69">This process is similar to process 9 except the mask defines the n-field regions rather than the p-field regions of the field area.</p>

      In this process, arsenic is deposited to a concentration of 4.0E11/cm2 by an ion implantation process to form the desired n-field regions in the n-wells.

      In at least one preferred embodiment, the particles are accelerated to 100 KeV.
      <br/>

      The chip is only exposed to the buffer oxide etch for a limited period of time so that only small divots will be taken out of the top surface of the spacer LTO rather than etching completely through the spacer LTO down to the underlying nitride layer.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the microstructure is formed over the spacer LTO, there will be small bumps in its bottom surface adjacent to the position of the divots in the spacer oxide.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      These bumps, will serve to minimize surface area contact of the microstructure to the chip during and after removal of the spacer oxide.
      <br/>
      During and after the etch for removing the spacer oxide to leave the microstructure suspended, the relatively delicate microstructure can be bent such that it comes in contact with the underlying substrate.
      <br/>
      This is undesirable since the microstructure has a tendency to stick to the substrate.
      <br/>
      By placing small bumps in the bottom surface of the microstructure, if and when the bottom surface of the microstructure comes in contact with the substrate, only the bumps will contact the surface thereby minimizing the contact surface area and the likelihood of sticking.

      <br/>
      However, the portions of the photoresist which have filled in the edges of the holes and which extend under the edges of the microstructure are not developed away because these edges are occluded by the polysilicon microstructure.

      If desired, a mask can be used so as also to leave some photoresist bridges in polysilicon layer 62 in the gaps between non-contacting portions of the polysilicon microstructure, e.g., between mobile arms 14.

      Accordingly, the photoresist bridges in the gaps between non-contacting portions of the microstructure as well as the photoresist pedestals formed underneath the microstructure still remain after the spacer oxide is removed.

      The photoresist pedestals which formed at the edges of the holes beneath the microstructure vertically support the microstructure preventing it from bending and contacting the underlying substrate.

      Without the photoresist pedestals and bridges, portions of the microstructure would be extremely prone to bending and contacting the substrate and/or other portions of the microstructure during the drying procedure after the buffer oxide wet etch due to liquid surface tension effects.

      The photoresist pedestals and bridges significantly reduce the possibility of portions of the microstructure contacting the substrate or other portions of the microstructure.

      Further, even if contact occurs, the bumps formed on the bottom surface of the microstructure during process 43 significantly reduce surface area contact thus significantly reducing the possibility of sticking.
