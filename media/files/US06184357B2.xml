    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of a novel prostate-specific kallikrein and to the use of these sequences in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of disorders of the prostate, including cancer and benign hyperplasia.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a 33 kD glycoprotein synthesized in the epithelial cells of the prostate gland.
      <br/>
      It is a secreted serine protease of the kallikrein family.
      <br/>
      PSA has been shown to digest the seminal vesicle protein, semenogelin, parathyroid hormone-related protein, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (Henttu P. et al. (1994) Ann. Med. 26: 157-164; Cramer S. D. et al. (1996) J. Urol. 156: 526-531).
      <br/>
      PSA is likely to act in semen production, but may have additional functions.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Genes encoding the three human kallikreins, tissue kallikrein (KLK1), glandular kallikrein (KLK2), and APS are located in a cluster at chromosome map position 19q13.2-q13.4 (Riegmen P. H. (1992) Genomics 14: 6-11).
      <br/>
      PSA shares more extensive homology with KLK2 than with KLK1.
      <br/>
      Both PSA and KLK2 are produced by prostate epithelial cells and their expression is regulated by androgens.
      <br/>
      Three amino acid residues were found to be critical for serine protease activity, residues H65, D120, and S213 in PSA (Bridon D. P. et al. (1995) Urology 45: 801-806).
      <br/>
      Substrate specificity, described as chymotrypsinogen-like (with KLK2) or trypsin-like (with PSA) is thought to be determined by S207 in PSA and D209 in KLK2 (Bridon et al., supra).
      <br/>
      KLK1 is chymotrypsinogen-like and expressed in the pancreas, urinary system, and sublingual gland.
      <br/>
      KLK1, like the other kallikreins, is made as a pre-pro-protein and is processed into an active form of 238 amino acids by cleavage of a 24 amino acid terminal signal sequence (Fukushima D. et al. (1985) Biochemistry 24: 8037-8043).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Adenocarcinoma of the prostate accounts for a significant number of malignancies in men over 50.
      <br/>
      There are over 122,000 new cases per year in the United States.
      <br/>
      Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most sensitive marker available for monitoring cancer progression and response to therapy.
      <br/>
      Serum PSA is elevated in 25 to 92% of patients with prostatic carcinoma, depending upon tumor volume.
      <br/>
      Since PSA is also moderately elevated in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia, additional techniques are needed to distinguish between the two.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The discovery of polynucleotides encoding additional prostate specific molecules, and the molecules themselves, presents the opportunity to investigate disorders of the prostate, including benign hyperplasia and prostatic carcinoma.
      <br/>
      Discovery of molecules related to PSA satisfies a need in the art by providing new compositions useful in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of prostate cancer and hyperplasia.

      <br/>
      More rarely, a variant may have "nonconservative" changes, e.g., replacement of a glycine with a tryptophan.
      <br/>
      Similar minor variations may also include amino acid deletions or insertions, or both.
      <br/>
      Guidance in determining which amino acid residues may be substituted, inserted, or deleted without abolishing biological or immunological activity may be found using computer programs well known in the art, for example, DYNASTAR software.
    </p>
    <p num="23">A "deletion", as used herein, refers to a change in either amino acid or nucleotide sequence in which one or more amino acid or nucleotide residues, respectively, are absent.</p>
    <p num="24">An "insertion" or "addition", as used herein, refers to a change in an amino acid or nucleotide sequence resulting in the addition of one or more amino acid or nucleotide residues, respectively, as compared to the naturally occurring molecule.</p>

    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The term "agonist", as used herein, refers to a molecule which, when bound to HPSK, causes a change in HPSK which modulates the activity of HPSK.
      <br/>
      Agonists may include proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, or any other molecules which bind to HPSK.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The term "agonist" or "inhibitor", as used herein, refer to a molecule which, when bound to HPSK, blocks or modulates the biological or immunological activity of HPSK.
      <br/>
      Antagonists and inhibitors may include proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, or any other molecules which bind to HPSK. p The term "modulate", as used herein, refers to a change or an alteration in the biological activity of HPSK.
      <br/>
      Modulation may be an increase or a decrease in protein activity, a change in binding characteristics, or any other change in the biological, functional or immunological properties of HPSK.

      The two complementary nucleic acid sequences hydrogen bond in an antiparallel configuration.
      <br/>
      A hybridization complex may be formed in solution (e.g. C0 t or R0 t analysis) or between one nucleic acid sequence present in solution and another nucleic acid sequence immobilized on a solid support (e.g., membranes, filters, chips, pins or glass slides to which cells have been fixed for in situ hybridization).

    <p num="35">
      The terms "complementary" or "complementarity", as used herein, refer to the natural binding of polynucleotides under permissive salt and temperature conditions by base-pairing.
      <br/>
      For example, for the sequence "A--G--T" binds to the complementary sequence "T--C--A".
      <br/>
      Complementarity between two single-stranded molecules may be "partial", in which only some of the nucleic acids bind, or it may be complete when total complementarity exists between the single stranded molecules.
      <br/>
      The degree of complementarity between nucleic acid strands has significant effects on the efficiency and strength of hybridization between nucleic acid strands.
      <br/>
      This is of particular importance in amplification reactions, which depend upon binding between nucleic acids strands.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The term "homology", as used herein, refers to a degree of complementarity.
      <br/>
      There may be partial homology or complete homology (i.e., identity).
      <br/>
      A partially complementary sequence is one that at least partially inhibits an identical sequence from hybridizing to a target nucleic acid; it is referred to using the functional term "substantially homologous." The inhibition of hybridization of the completely complementary sequence to the target sequence may be examined using a hybridization assay (Southern or northern blot, solution hybridization and the like) under conditions of low stringency.
      <br/>
      A substantially homologous sequence or probe will compete for and inhibit the binding (i.e., the hybridization) of a completely homologous sequence or probe to the target sequence under conditions of low stringency.
      <br/>
      This is not to say that conditions of low stringency are such that non-specific binding is permitted; low stringency conditions require that the binding of two sequences to one another be a specific (i.e., selective) interaction.
      <br/>
      The absence of non-specific binding may be tested by the use of a second target sequence which lacks even a partial degree of complementarity (e.g., less than about 30% identity); in the absence of non-specific binding, the probe will not hybridize to the second non-complementary target sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      As known in the art, numerous equivalent conditions may be employed to comprise either low or high stringency conditions.
      <br/>
      Factors such as the length and nature (DNA, RNA, base composition) of the sequence, nature of the target (DNA, RNA, base composition, presence in solution or immobilization, etc.), and the concentration of the salts and other components (e.g., the presence or absence of formamide, dextran sulfate and/or polyethylene glycol) are considered and the hybridization solution may be varied to generate conditions of either low or high stringency different from, but equivalent to, the above listed conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="38">The term "stringent conditions", as used herein, is the "stringency" which occurs within a range from about Tm-5 (degree)  C. (5 (degree)  C. below the melting temperature (Tm) of the probe) to about 20 (degree)  C. to 25 (degree)  C. below Tm. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, the stringency of hybridization may be altered in order to identify or detect identical or related polynucleotide sequences.</p>
    <p num="39">
      The term "antisense", as used herein, refers to nucleotide sequences which are complementary to a specific DNA or RNA sequence.
      <br/>
      The term "antisense strand" is used in reference to a nucleic acid strand that is complementary to the "sense" strand.
      <br/>
      Antisense molecules may be produced by any method, including synthesis by ligating the gene(s) of interest in a reverse orientation to a viral promoter which permits the synthesis of a complementary strand.
      <br/>
      Once introduced into a cell, this transcribed strand combines with natural sequences produced by the cell to form duplexes.
      <br/>
      These duplexes then block either the further transcription or translation.
      <br/>
      In this manner, mutant phenotypes may be generated.
      <br/>
      The designation "negative" is sometimes used in reference to the antisense strand, and "positive" is sometimes used in reference to the sense strand.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The term "portion", as used herein, with regard to a protein (as in "a portion of a given protein") refers to fragments of that protein.
      <br/>
      The fragments may range in size from four amino acid residues to the entire amino acid sequence minus one amino acid.
      <br/>
      Thus, a protein "comprising at least a portion of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1" encompasses the full-length human HPSK and fragments thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      "Transformation", as defined herein, describes a process by which exogenous DNA enters and changes a recipient cell.
      <br/>
      It may occur under natural or artificial conditions using various methods well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Transformation may rely on any known method for the insertion of foreign nucleic acid sequences into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell.
      <br/>
      The method is selected based on the host cell being transformed and may include, but is not limited to, viral infection, electroporation, lipofection, and particle bombardment.
      <br/>
      Such "transformed" cells include stably transformed cells in which the inserted DNA is capable of replication either as an autonomously replicating plasmid or as part of the host chromosome.
      <br/>
      They also include cells which transiently express the inserted DNA or RNA for limited periods of time.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The term "antigenic determinant", as used herein, refers to that portion of a molecule that makes contact with a particular antibody (i.e., an epitope).
      <br/>
      When a protein or fragment of a protein is used to immunize a host animal, numerous regions of the protein may induce the production of antibodies which bind specifically to a given region or three-dimensional structure on the protein; these regions or structures are referred to as antigenic determinants.
      <br/>
      An antigenic determinant may compete with the intact antigen (i.e., the immunogen used to elicit the immune response) for binding to an antibody.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The terms "specific bonding" or "specifically binding", as used herein, in reference to the interaction of an antibody and a protein or peptide, mean that the interaction is dependent upon the presence of a particular structure (i.e., the antigenic determinant or epitope) on the protein; in other words, the antibody is recognizing and binding to a specific protein structure rather than to proteins in general.
      <br/>
      For example, if an antibody is specific for epitope "A", the presence of a protein containing epitope A (or free, unlabeled A) in a reaction containing labeled "A" and the antibody will reduce the amount of labeled A bound to the antibody.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The term "sample", as used herein, is used in its broadest sense.
      <br/>
      A biological sample suspected of containing nucleic acid encoding HPSK or fragments thereof may comprise a cell, chromosomes isolated from a cell (e.g., a spread of metaphase chromosomes), genomic DNA (in solution or bound to a solid support such as for Southern analysis), RNA (in solution or bound to a solid support such as for northern analysis), cDNA (in solution or bound to a solid support), an extract from cells or a tissue, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="45">The term "correlates with expression of a polynucleotide", as used herein, indicates that the detection of the presence of ribonucleic acid that is similar to SEQ ID NO:2 by northern analysis is indicative of the presence of mRNA encoding HPSK in a sample and thereby correlates with expression of the transcript from the polynucleotide encoding the protein.</p>
    <p num="46">
      "Alterations" in the polynucleotide of SEQ ID NO:2, as used herein, comprise any alteration in the sequence of polynucleotides encoding HPSK including deletions, insertions, and point mutations that may be detected using hybridization assays.
      <br/>
      Included within this definition is the detection of alterations to the genomic DNA sequence which encodes HPSK (e.g., by alterations in the pattern of restriction fragment length polymorphisms capable of hybridizing to SEQ ID NO:2), the inability of a selected fragment of SEQ ID NO:2 to hybridize to a sample of genomic DNA (e.g., using allele-specific oligonucleotide probes), and improper or unexpected hybridization, such as hybridization to a locus other than the normal chromosomal locus for the polynucleotide sequence encoding HPSK (e.g., using fluorescent in situ hybridization �FISH� to metaphase chromosomes spreads).
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      As used herein, the term "antibody" refers to intact molecules as well as fragments thereof, such as Fab, F(ab')2, and Fv, which are capable of binding the epitopic determinant.
      <br/>
      Antibodies that bind HPSK polypeptides can be prepared using intact polypeptides or fragments containing small peptides of interest as the immunizing antigen.
      <br/>
      The polypeptide or peptide used to immunize an animal can be derived from the transition of RNA or synthesized chemically, and can be conjugated to a carrier protein, if desired.
      <br/>
      Commonly used carriers that are chemically coupled to peptides include bovine serum albumin and thyroglobulin.
      <br/>
      The coupled peptide is then used to immunize the animal (e.g., a mouse, a rat, or a rabbit).

    <p num="49">The Invention</p>
    <p num="50">The invention is based on the discovery of a novel human prostate-specific kallikrein, (HPSK), the polynucleotides encoding HPSK, and the use of these compositions for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of prostate disorders including cancer.</p>
    <p num="51">
      Nucleic acids encoding the human HPSK of the present invention were first identified in Incyte Clone 1818001 from the prostate tissue cDNA library (PROSNOT20) through a computer-generated search for amino acid sequence alignments.
      <br/>
      A consensus sequence, SEQ ID NO:2, was derived from the following overlapping and/or extended nucleic acid sequences: Incyte Clones 1818001 (PROSNOT20), 786353 (PROSNOT05), 837074 (PROSNOT07), 1327152 (LPARNOT02), and 1682515 (PROSNOT15).
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      In one embodiment, the invention encompasses the novel human prostate-specific kallikrein, a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, as shown in FIGS. 1A, 1B and 1C.
      <br/>
      HPSK is 248 amino acids in length and has a potential N-glycosylation site at amino acid residue 163.
      <br/>
      HPSK has chemical and structural homology with baboon KLK1 (GI 871814; SEQ ID NO:3), human KLK1 (GI 186651; SEQ ID NO:4), and human PSA (GI 190553; SEQ ID NO:5).
      <br/>
      In particular, HPSK and baboon KLK1 share 56% identity.
      <br/>
      HPSK's amino terminal 24 amino acids are hydrophilic and closely resemble signal sequences important for kallikrein secretion (FIGS. 2, 3 and 4).
      <br/>
      HPSK sequence contains conserved residues critical for serine protease activity, H65, D110, and S201 (FIGS. 2A and 2B).
      <br/>
      Amino acid residue D195 is likely to confer on HPSK chymotrypsinogen-like activity.
      <br/>
      HPSK amino acid sequence includes 10 conserved cysteine residues (residues 31, 50, 66, 142, 161, 172, 186, 197, 207, and 222; FIGS. 2A and 2B).
      <br/>
      In all the kallikreins mentioned above these cysteins are structurally important, forming 5 disulfide bonds.
      <br/>
      As illustrated by FIGS. 3 and 4, HPSK and baboon KLK1 have rather similar hydrophobicity plots.
      <br/>
      Northern analysis reveals the expression pattern of this sequence in various libraries (FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      In addition, HPSK was found to be expressed in salivary gland tissue from a patient with cancer of the salivary gland.
      <br/>
      Of the 15 tissues in which HPSK is expressed, all but two are from the prostate gland and all but one are from cancer patients.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The invention also encompasses HPSK variants.
      <br/>
      A preferred HPSK variant is one having at least 80%, and more preferably 90%, amino acid sequence similarity to the HPSK amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:1).
      <br/>
      A most preferred HPSK variant is one having at least 95% amino acid sequence similarity to SEQ ID NO:1.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The invention also encompasses polynucleotides which encode HPSK.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, any nucleic acid sequence which encodes the amino acid sequence of HPSK can be used to generate recombinant molecules which express HPSK.
      <br/>
      In a particular embodiment, the invention encompasses the polynucleotide comprising the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 as shown in FIGS. 1A, 1B and 1C.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that as a result of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a multitude of nucleotide sequences encoding HPSK, some bearing minimal homology to the nucleotide sequences of any known and naturally occurring gene, may be produced.
      <br/>
      Thus, the invention contemplates each and every possible variation of nucleotide sequence that could be made by selecting combinations based on possible codon choices.
      <br/>
      These combinations are made in accordance with the standard triplet genetic code as applied to the nucleotide sequence of naturally occurring HPSK, and all such variations are to be considered as being specifically disclosed.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Although nucleotide sequences which encode HPSK and its variants are preferably capable of hybridizing to the nucleotide sequence of the naturally occurring HPSK under appropriately selected conditions of stringency, it may be advantageous to produce nucleotide sequences encoding HPSK or its derivatives possessing a substantially different codon usage.
      <br/>
      Codons may be selected to increase the rate at which expression of the peptide occurs in a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic host in accordance with the frequency with which particular codons are utilized by the host.
      <br/>
      Other reasons for substantially altering the nucleotide sequence encoding HPSK and its derivatives without altering the encoded amino acid sequences include the production of RNA transcripts having more desirable properties, such as a greater half-life, than transcripts produced from the naturally occurring sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The invention also encompasses production of DNA sequences, or portions therof, which encode HPSK and its derivatives, entirely by synthetic chemistry.
      <br/>
      After production, the synthetic sequence may be inserted into any of the many available expression vectors and cell systems using reagents that are well known in the art at the time of the filing of this application.
      <br/>
      Moreover, synthetic chemistry may be used to introduce mutations into a sequence encoding HPSK or any portion thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Also encompassed by the invention are polynucleotide sequences that are capable of hybridizing to the claimed nucleotide sequences, and in particular, those shown in SEQ ID NO:2, under various conditions of stringency.
      <br/>
      Hybridization conditions are based on the melting temperature (Tm) of the nucleic acid binding complex or probe, as taught in Wahl, G. M. and S. L. Berger (1987: Methods Enzymol. 152:399-407) and Kimmel, A. R. (1987; Methods Enzymol. 152:507-511), and may be used at a defined stringency.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Altered nucleic acid sequences encoding HPSK which are encompassed by the invention include deletions, insertions, or substitutions of different nucleotides resulting in a polynucleotide that encodes the same or a functionally equivalent HPSK.
      <br/>
      The encoded protein may also contain deletions, insertions, or substitutions of amino acid residues which produce a silent change and result in a functionally equivalent HPSK.
      <br/>
      Deliberate amino acid substitutions may be made on the basis of similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and/or the amphipathic nature of the residues as long as the biological activity of HPSK is retained.
      <br/>
      For example, negatively charged amino acids may include aspartic acid and glutamic acid; positively charged amino acids may include lysine and arginine; and amino acids with uncharged polar head groups having similar hydrophilicity values may include leucine, isoleucine, and valine; glycine and alanine; asparagine and glutamine; serine and threonine; phenylalanine and tyrosine.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      Also included within the scope of the present invention are alleles of the genes encoding HPSK.
      <br/>
      As used herein, an "allele" or "allelic sequence" is an alternative form of the gene which may result from at least one mutation in the nucleic acid sequence.
      <br/>
      Alleles may result in altered mRNAs or polypeptides whose structures or function may or may not be altered.
      <br/>
      Any given gene may have none, one, or many allelic forms.
      <br/>
      Common mutational changes which give rise to alleles are generally ascribed to natural deletions, additions, or substitutions of nucleotides.
      <br/>
      Each of these types of changes may occur alone, or in combination with the others, one or more times in a given sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      Methods for DNA sequencing which are well known and generally available in the art may be used to practice any embodiments of the invention.
      <br/>
      The methods may employ such enzymes as the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, SEQUENASE DNA Polymerase (US Biochemical Corp, Cleveland Ohio), Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer), thermostable T7 polymerase (Amersham, Chicago, Ill.), or combinations of recombinant polymerases and proofreading exonucleases such as the ELONGASE Amplification System (GIBCO/BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.).
      <br/>
      Preferably, the process is automated with machines such as the Hamilton MICROLAB 2200 (Hamilton, Reno, Nev.), Peltier thermal cycler (PTC200; MJ Research, Watertown, Mass.) and the ABI 377 DNA sequencers (Perkin Elmer).
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The nucleic acid sequences encoding HPSK may be extended utilizing a partial nucleotide sequence and employing various methods known in the art to detect upstream sequences such as promoters and regulatory elements.
      <br/>
      For example, one method which may be employed, "restriction-site" PCR, uses universal primers to retrieve unknown sequence adjacent to a known locus (Sarkar, G. (1993) PCR Methods Applic. 2:318-322).
      <br/>
      In particular, genomic DNA is first amplified in the presence of primer to linker sequence and a primer specific to the known region.
      <br/>
      The amplified sequences are then subjected to a second round of PCR with the same linker primer and another specific primer internal to the first one.
      <br/>
      Products of each round of PCR are transcribed with an appropriate RNA polymerase and sequenced using reverse transcriptase.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      Inverse PCR may also be used to amplify or extend sequences using divergent primers based on a known region (Triglia, T. et al. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16:8186).
      <br/>
      The primers may be designed using OLIGO 4.06 primer analysis software (National Biosciences Inc., Plymouth, Minn.), or another appropriate program, to be 22-30 nucleotides in length, to have a GC content of 50% or more, and to anneal to the target sequence at temperatures about 68 (degree)  C.-72 (degree)  C. The method uses several restriction enzymes to generates suitable fragment in the known region of a gene.
      <br/>
      The fragment is then circularized by intramolecular ligation and used as a PCR template.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      Another method which may be used is capture PCR which involves PCR amplification of DNA fragments adjacent to a known sequence in human and yeast artificial chromosome DNA (Lagerstrom, M. et al. (1991) PCR Methods Applic. 1:111-119).
      <br/>
      In this method, multiple restriction enzyme digestions and ligations may also be used to place an engineered double-stranded sequence into an unknown portion of the DNA molecule before performing PCR.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Another method which may be used to retrieve unknown sequences is that of Parker, J. D. et al. (1991; Nucleic Acids Res. 19:3055-3060).
      <br/>
      Additionally, one may use PCR, nested primers, and PROMOTERFINDER libraries to walk in genomic DNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.).
      <br/>
      This process avoids the need to screen libraries and is useful in finding intron/exon junctions.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      When screening for full-length cDNAs, it is preferable to use libraries that have been size-selected to include larger cDNAs.
      <br/>
      Also, random-primed libraries are preferable, in that they will contain more sequences which contain the 5' regions of genes.
      <br/>
      Use of a randomly primed library may be especially preferable for situations in which an oligo d(T) library does not yield a full-length cDNA.
      <br/>
      Genomic libraries may be useful for extension of sequence into the 5' and 3' non-transcribed regulatory regions.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      Capillary electrophoresis systems which are commercially available may be used to analyze the size or confirm the nucleotide sequence of sequencing or PCR products.
      <br/>
      In particular, capillary sequencing may employ flowable polymers for electrophoretic separation, four different fluorescent dyes (one for each nucleotide) which are laser activated, and detection of the emitted wavelengths by a charge coupled devise camera.
      <br/>
      Output/light intensity may be converted to electrical signal using appropriate software (e.g. GENOTYPER and SEQUENCE NAVIGATOR, Perkin Elmer) and the entire process from loading of samples to computer analysis and electronic data display may be computer controlled.
      <br/>
      Capillary electrophoresis is especially preferable for the sequencing of small pieces of DNA which might be present in limited amounts in a particular sample.

    <p num="68">
      In another embodiment of the invention, polynucleotide sequences or fragments thereof which encode HPSK, or fusion proteins or functional equivalents thereof, may be used in recombinant DNA molecules to direct expression of HPSK in appropriate host cells.
      <br/>
      Due to the inherent degeneracy of the genetic code, other DNA sequences which encode substantially the same or a functionally equivalent amino acid sequence may be produced and these sequences may be used to clone and expres HPSK.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      As will be understood by those of skill in the art, it may be advantageous to produce HPSK-encoding nucleotide sequences possessing non-naturally occurring codons.
      <br/>
      For example, codons preferred by a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic host can be selected to increase the rate of protein expression or to produce a recombinant RNA transcript having desirable properties, such as a half-life which is longer than that of a transcript generated from the naturally occurring sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      The nucleotide sequences of the present invention can be engineered using methods generally known in the art in order to alter HPSK encoding sequences for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to, alterations which modify the cloning, processing, and/or expression of the gene product.
      <br/>
      DNA shuffling by random fragmentation and PCRreassembly of gene fragments and synthetic oligonucleotides may be used to engineer the nucleotide sequences.
      <br/>
      For example, site-directed mutagenesis may be used to insert new restriction sites, alter glycosylation patterns, change codon preference, produce splice variants, or introduce mutations, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      In another embodiment of the invention, natural, modified, or recombinant nucleic acid sequences encoding HPSK may be ligated to a heterologous sequence to encode a fusion protein.
      <br/>
      For example, to screen peptide libraries for inhibitors of HPSK activity, it may be useful to encode a chimeric HPSK protein that can be recognized by a commercially available antibody.
      <br/>
      A fusion protein may also be engineered to contain a cleavage site located between the HPSK encoding sequence and the heterologous protein sequence, so that HPSK may be cleaved and purified away from the heterologous moiety.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      In another embodiment, sequences encoding HPSK may be synthesized, in whole or in part, using chemical methods well known in the art (see Caruthers, M. H. et al. (1980) Nucl. Acids Res. Symp. Ser. 7:215-223, Horn, T. et al. (1980) Nucl. Acids Res. Symp. Ser. 7:225-232).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the protein itself may be produced using chemical methods to synthesize the amino acid sequence of HPSK, or a portion thereof.
      <br/>
      For example, peptide synthesis can be performed using various solid-phase techniques (Roberge, J. Y. et al. (1995) Science 269:202-204) and automated synthesis may be achieved, for example, using the ABI 431A peptide synthesizer (Perkin Elmer).

    <p num="73">
      The newly synthesized peptide may be substantially purified by preparative high performance liquid chromatography (e.g., Creighton, T. (1983) Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles, WH Freeman and Co., New York, N.Y.) The composition of the synthetic peptides may be confirmed by amino acid analysis or sequencing (e.g., the Edman degradation procedure; Creighton, supra).
      <br/>
      Additionally, the amino acid sequence of HPSK, or any part thereof, may be altered during direct synthesis and/or combined using chemical methods with sequences from other proteins, or any part thereof, to produce a variant polypeptide.

      These include, but are not limited to, microorganisms such as bacteria transformed with recombinant bacteriophage, plasmid, or cosmid DNA expression vectors; yeast transformed with yeast expression vectors; insect cell systems infected with virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus); plant cell systems transformed with virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or with bacterial expression vectors (e.g., Ti or PBR322 plasmids); or animal cell systems.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      The "control elements" or "regulatory sequences" are those non-translated regions of the vector--enhancers, promoters, 5' and 3' untranslated regions--which interact with host cellular proteins to carry out transcription and translation.
      <br/>
      Such elements may vary in their strength and specificity.
      <br/>
      Depending on the vector system and host utilized, any number of suitable transcription and translation elements, including constitutive and inducible promoters, may be used.
      <br/>
      For example, when cloning in bacterial systems, inducible promoters such as the hybrid lacZ promoter of the BLUESCRIPT phagemid (Stratagene, LaJolla, Calif.) or PSPORT1 plasmid (Gibco BRL) and the like may be used.
      <br/>
      The baculovirus polyhedrin promoter may be used in insect cells.
      <br/>
      Promoters and enhancers derived from the genomes of plant cells (e.g., heat shock, RUBISCO; and storage protein genes) or from plant viruses (e.g., viral promoters and leader sequences) may be cloned into the vector.
      <br/>
      In mammalian cell systems, promoters from mammalian genes or from mammalian viruses are preferable.
      <br/>
      If it is necessary to generate a cell line that contains multiple copies of the sequence encoding HPSK, vectors based on SV40 or EBV may be used with an appropriate selectable marker.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be selected depending upon the use intended for HPSK.
      <br/>
      For example, when large quantities of HPSK are needed for the induction of antibodies, vectors which direct high level expression of fusion proteins that are readily purified may be used.
      <br/>
      Such vectors include, but are not limited to, the multifunctional E. coli cloning and expression vectors such as the BLUESCRIPT phagemid (Stratagene), in which the sequence encoding HPSK may be ligated into the vector in frame with sequences for the amino-terminal Met and the subsequent 7 residues of  BETA -galactosidase so that a hybrid protein is produced; pIN vectors (Van Heeke, G. and S. M. Schuster (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264:5503-5509); and the like.
      <br/>
      PGEX vectors (Promega, Madison, Wis.) may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST).
      <br/>
      In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption to glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione.
      <br/>
      Proteins made in such systems may be designed to include heparin, thrombin, or factor XA protease cleavage sites so that the cloned polypeptide of interest can be released from the GST moiety at will.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a number of vectors containing constitutive or inducible promoters such as alpha factor, alcohol oxidase, and PGH may be used.
      <br/>
      For reviews, see Ausubel et al., (supra) and Grant et al. (1987) Methods Enzymol. 153:516-544.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      In cases where plant expression vectors are used, the expression of sequences encoding HPSK may be driven by any of a number of promoters.
      <br/>
      For example, viral promoters such as the 35S and 19S promoters of CaMV may be used alone or in combination with the omega leader sequence from TMV (Takamatsu, N. (1987) EMBO J. 6:307-311).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, plant promoters such as the small subunit of RUBISCO or heat shock promoters may be used (Coruzzi, G. et al. (1984) EMBO J. 3:1671-1680; Broglie, R. et al. (1984) Science 224:838-843; and Winter, J. et al. (1991) Results Probl.
      <br/>
      Cell Differ. 17:85-105).
      <br/>
      These constructs can be introduced into plant cells by direct DNA transformation or pathogen-mediated transfection.
      <br/>
      Such techniques are described in a number of generally available reviews (see, for example, Hobbs, S. or Murry, L. E. in McGraw Hill Yearbook of Science and Technology (1992) McGraw Hill, New York, N.Y.; pp. 191-196.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      An insect system may also be used to express HPSK.
      <br/>
      For example, in one such system, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes in Spodoptera frugiperda cells or in Trichoplusia larvae.
      <br/>
      The sequences encoding HPSK may be cloned into a non-essential region of the virus, such as the polyhedrin gene, and place under control of the polyhedrin promoter.
      <br/>
      Successful insertion of HPSK will render the polyhedrin gene inactive and produce recombinant virus lacking coat protein.
      <br/>
      The recombinant viruses may then be used to infect, for example, S. frugiperda cells of Trichoplusia larvae in which HPSK may be expressed (Engelhard, E. K. et al. (1994) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 91:3224-3227).
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized.
      <br/>
      In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, sequences encoding HPSK may be ligated into an adenovirus transcription/translation complex consisting of the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence.
      <br/>
      Insertion in a non-essential E1 or E3 region of the viral genome may be used to obtain a viable virus which is capable of expressing HPSK in infected host cells (Logan, J. and Shenk, T. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81:3655-3659).
      <br/>
      In addition, transcription enhancers, such as the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) enhancer, may be used to increase expression in mammalian host cells.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Specific initiation signals may also be used to achieve more efficient translation of sequences encoding HPSK.
      <br/>
      Such signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences.
      <br/>
      In cases where sequences encoding HPSK, its initiation codon, and upstream sequences are inserted into the appropriate expression vector, no additional transcriptional or translational control signals may be needed.
      <br/>
      However, in cases where only coding sequence, or a portion thereof, is inserted, exogenous translational control signals including the ATG initiation codon should be provided.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the initiation codon should be in the correct reading frame to ensure translation of the entire insert.
      <br/>
      Exogenous translational elements and initiation codons may be of various origins, both natural and synthetic.
      <br/>
      The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of enhancers which are appropriate for the particular cell system which is used, such as those described in the literature (Scharf, D. et al. (1994) Results Probl.
      <br/>
      Cell Differ. 20:125-162).
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen for its ability to modulate the expression of the inserted sequences or to process the expressed protein in the desired fashion.
      <br/>
      Such modifications of the polypeptide include, but are not limited to, acetylation, carboxylation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, lipidation, and acylation.
      <br/>
      Post-translational processing which cleaves a "prepro" form of the protein may also be used to facilitate correct insertion, folding and/or function.
      <br/>
      Different host cells such as CHO, HeLa, MDCK, HEK293, and WI38, which have specific cellular machinery and characteristic mechanisms for such post-translational activities, may be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred.
      <br/>
      For example, cell lines which stably express HPSK may be transformed using expression vectors which may contain viral origins of replication and/or endogenous expression elements and a selectable marker gene on the same or on a separate vector.
      <br/>
      Following the introduction of the vector, cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media before they are switched to selective media.
      <br/>
      The purpose of the selectable marker is to confer resistance to selection, and its presence allows growth and recovery of cells which successfully express the introduced sequences.
      <br/>
      Resistant clones of stably transformed cells may be proliferated using tissue culture techniques appropriate to the cell type.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      Any number of selection systems may be used to recover transformed cell lines.
      <br/>
      These include, but are not limited to, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler, M. et al. (1977) Cell 11:223-32) and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy, I. et al. (1980) Cell 22:817-23) genes which can be employed in tk- or aprt- cells, respectively.
      <br/>
      Also, antimetabolite, antibiotic or herbicide resistance can be used as the basis for selection; for example, dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler, M. et al. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 77:3567-70); npt, which confers resistance to the aminoglycosides neomycin and G-418 (Colbere-Garapin, F. et al (1981) J. Mol. Biol. 150:1-14) and als or pat, which confer resistance to chlorsulfuron and phosphinotricin acetyltransferase, respectively (Murry, supra).
      <br/>
      Additional selectable genes have been described, for example, trpB, which allows cells to utilize indole in place of tryptophan, or hisD, which allows cells to utilize histinol in place of histidine (Hartman, S. C. and R. C. Mulligan (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85:8047-51).
      <br/>
      Recently, the use of visible markers has gained popularity with such markers as anthocyanins,  BETA  glucuronidase and its substrate GUS, and luciferase and its substrate luciferin, being widely used not only to identify transformants, but also to quantify the amount of transient or stable protein expression attributable to a specific vector system (Rhodes, C. A. et al. (1995) Methods Mol.
      <br/>
      Biol. 55:121-131).
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      Although the presence/absence of marker gene expression suggests that the gene of interest is also present, its presence and expression may need to be confirmed.
      <br/>
      For example, if the sequence encoding HPSK is inserted within a marker gene sequence, recombinant cells containing sequences encoding HPSK can be identified by the absence of marker gene function.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a marker gene can be placed in tandem with a sequence encoding HPSK under the control of a single promoter.
      <br/>
      Expression of the marker gene in response to induction or selection usually indicates expression of the tandem gene as well.

      Alternatively, host cells which contain the nucleic acid sequence encoding HPSK and express HPSK may be identified by a variety of procedures known to those of skill in the art.

      These procedures include, but are not limited to, DNA--DNA, or DNA-RNA hybridizations and protein bioassay or immunoassay techniques which include membrane, solution, or chip based technologies for the detection and/or quantification of nucleic acid or protein.

      <br/>
      As used herein "oligonucleotides" or "oligomers" refer to a nucleic acid sequence of at least about 10 nucleotides and as many as about 60 nucleotides, preferably about 15 to 30 nucleotides, and more preferably about 20-25 nucleotides, which can be used as a probe or amplimer.

      The protein produced by a recombinant cell may be secreted or contained intracellularly depending on the sequence and/or the vector used.
      <br/>
      As will be understood by those of skill in the art, expression vectors containing polynucleotides which encode HPSK may be designed to contain signal sequences which direct secretion of HPSK through a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell membrane.
      <br/>
      Other recombinant constructions may be used to join sequences encoding HPSK to nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide domain which will facilitate purification of soluble proteins.
      <br/>
      Such purification facilitating domains include, but are not limited to, metal chelating peptides such as histidine-tryptophan modules that allow purification on immobilized metals, protein A domains that allow purification on immobilized immunoglobulin, and the domain utilized in the FLAG extension/affinity purification system (Immunex Corp., Seattle, Wash.) The inclusion of cleavable linker sequences such as those specific for Factor XA or enterokinase (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.) between the purification domain and HPSK may be used to facilitate purification.

      One such expression vector provides for expression of a fusion protein containing HPSK and a nucleic acid encoding 6 histidine residues preceding a thioredoxin or an enterokinase cleavage site.

      Based on the chemical and structural homology among HPSK (SEQ ID NO:1), baboon and human KLK1 and northern analysis (FIG. 5) which shows that 13 of the 14 libraries containing HPSK transcripts are from prostate tissue, HPSK is believe to function in the prostate gland.

      Of the 13 prostate tissue libraries, 12 were from patients with prostate cancer.

      In particular, cells may be transformed with sequences complementary to polynucleotides encoding HPSK.

      Ribozymes, enzymatic RNA molecules, may also be used to catalyze the specific cleavage of RNA.
      <br/>
      The mechanism of ribozyme action involves sequence-specific hybridization of the ribozyme molecule to complementary target RNA, followed by endonucleolytic cleavage.
      <br/>
      Examples which may be used include engineered hammerhead motif ribozyme molecules that can be specifically and efficiently catalyze endonucleolytic cleavage of sequences encoding HPSK.

      Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within any potential RNA target are initially identified by scanning the target molecule for ribozyme cleavage sites which include the following sequences: GUA, GUU, and GUC.
      <br/>
      Once identified, short RNA sequences of between 15 and 20 ribonucleotides corresponding to the region of the target gene containing the cleavage site may be evaluated for secondary structural features which may render the oligonucleotide inoperable.

      Such DNA sequences may be incorporated into a wide variety of vectors with suitable RNA polymerase promoters such as T7 or SP6.

      <br/>
      This concept is inherent in the production of PNAs and can be extended in all of these molecules by the inclusion of nontraditional bases such as inosine, queosine, and wybutosine, as well as acetyl-, methyl-, thio-, and similarly modified forms of adenine, cytidine, guanine, thymine, and uridine which are not as easily recognized by endogenous endonucleases.

    <p num="176">III. Homology Searching of cDNA Clones and Their Deduced Proteins</p>
    <p num="177">
      After the reading frame was determined, the nucleotide sequences of the Sequence Listing as well as the amino acid sequences deduced from them were used as query sequences against databases such as GenBank, SwissProt, BLOCKS, and Pima II.
      <br/>
      These databases, which contain previously identified and annotated sequences, were searched for regions of homology (similarity) using BLAST, which stands for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (Altschul S. F. (1993) J. Mol. Evol. 36:290-300; Altschul, S. F. et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10).
    </p>
    <p num="178">
      BLAST produced alignments of both nucleotide and amino acid sequences to determine sequence similarity.
      <br/>
      Because of the local nature of the alignments, BLAST was especially useful in determining exact matches or in identifying homologs which may be of prokaryotic (bacterial) or eukaryotic (animal, fungal, or plant) origin.
      <br/>
      Other algorithms such as the one described in Smith et al. (1992, Protein Engineering 5:35-51), incorporated herein by reference, could have been used when dealing with primary sequence patterns and secondary structure gap penalties.
      <br/>
      The sequences disclosed in this application have lengths of at least 49 nucleotides, and no more than 12% uncalled bases (where N is recorded rather than A, C, G, or T).
    </p>
    <p num="179">
      The BLAST approach, as detailed in Karlin et al. (supra) and incorporated herein by reference, searched for matches between a query sequence and a database sequence.
      <br/>
      BLAST evaluated the statistical significance of any matches found, and reported only those matches that satisfy the user-selected threshold of significance.
      <br/>
      In this application, threshold was set at 10-25 for nucleotides and 10-14 for peptides.
    </p>
    <p num="180">
      Incyte nucleotide sequences were searched against the GenBank databases for primate (pri), rodent (rod), and other mammalian sequences (mam); and deduced amino acid sequences from the same clones were then searched against GenBank functional protein databases, mammalian (mamp), vertebrate (vrtp), and eukaryote (eukp) for homology.
      <br/>
      The relevant database for a particular match were reported as GIxxx +- p (where xxx is pri; rod; etc.; and if present, p=peptide.
      <br/>
      The product score is calculated as follows: the % nucleotide or amino acid identity �between the query and reference sequences� in BLAST is multiplied by the % maximum possible BLAST score �based on the lengths of query and reference sequences� and then divided by 100.
      <br/>
      Where an Incyte Clone was homologous to several sequences, up to five matches were provided with their relevant scores.
      <br/>
      In an analogy to the hybridization procedures used in the laboratory, the electronic stringency for an exact match was set at 70, and the conservative lower limit for an exact match was set at approximately 40 (with 1-2% error due to uncalled bases).
    </p>
    <p num="181">IV Northern Analysis</p>
    <p num="182">Northern analysis is a laboratory technique used to detect the presence of a transcript of a gene and involves the hybridization of a labeled nucleotide sequence to a membrane on which RNAs from a particular cell type or tissue have been bound (Sambrook et al., supra).</p>
    <p num="183">
      Analogous computer techniques using BLAST (Altschul, S. F. 1993 and 1990, supra) are used to search for identical or related molecules in nucleotide databases such as GenBank or the LIFESEQ (tm)  database (Incyte Pharmaceuticals).
      <br/>
      This analysis is much faster than multiple, membrane-based hybridizations.
      <br/>
      In addition, the sensitivity of the computer search can be modified to determine whether any particular match is categorized as exact or homologous.
    </p>
    <p num="184">The basis of the search is the product score which is defined as:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="185">
      The product score takes into account both the degree of similarity between two sequences and the length of the sequence match.
      <br/>
      For example, with a product score of 40, the match will be exact within a 1-2% error; and at 70, the match will be exact.
      <br/>
      Homologous molecules are usually identified by selecting those which show product scores between 15 and 40, although lower scores may identify related molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="186">
      The results of northern analysis are reported as a list of libraries in which the transcript encoding HPSK occurs.
      <br/>
      Abundance and percent abundance are also reported.

      Abundance directly reflects the number of times a particular transcript is represented in a cDNA library, and percent abundance is abundance divided by the total number of sequences examined in the cDNA library.

      Primers are used to facilitate the extension of the known sequence "outward" generating amplicons containing new, unknown nucleotide sequence for the region of interest.
      <br/>
      The initial primers are designed from the cDNA using OLIGO 4.06 primer analysis software (National Biosciences), or another appropriate program, to be 22-30 nucleotides in length, to have a GC content of 50% or more, and to anneal to the target sequence at temperatures about 68 (degree) -72 (degree)  C. Any stretch of nucleotides which would result in hairpin structures and primer-primer dimerizations is avoided.

      <br/>
      HPSK is incubated with coagulated semen in a buffer consisting of 50 mmol/l Tris-HCl pH 7.8 with 0.1 mol/l NaCl.
      <br/>
      Reactions are performed at 37 (degree)  C. After incubation periods of different durations (from 0 to 30 minutes) the samples are analyzed by SDS/PAGE.
      <br/>
      The resulting pattern of peptide fragments is compared and quantitated using a control sample in which HPSK was not added.

    <p num="205">X. Production of HPSK Specific Antibodies</p>
    <p num="206">
      HPSK that is substantially purified using PAGE electrophoresis (Sambrook, supra), or other purification techniques, is used to immunize rabbits and to produce antibodies using standard protocols.
      <br/>
      The amino acid sequence deduced from SEQ ID NO:2 is analyzed using DNASTAR software (DNASTAR Inc) to determine regions of high immunogenicity and a corresponding oligopolypeptide is synthesized and used to raise antibodies by means known to those of skill in the art.
      <br/>
      Selection of appropriate epitopes, such as those near the C-terminus or in hydrophilic regions, is described by Ausubel et al. (supra), and others.
    </p>
    <p num="207">
      Typically, the oligopeptides are 15 residues in length, synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer 431A using fmoc-chemistry, and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH, Sigma, St.

      <br/>
      Rabbits are immunized with the oligopeptide-KLH complex in complete Freund's adjuvant.
      <br/>
      The resulting antisera are tested for antipeptide activity, for example, by binding the peptide to plastic, blocking with 1% BSA, reacting with rabbit antisera, washing, and reacting with radioiodinated, goat anti-rabbit IgG.

    <p num="208">XI. Purification of Naturally Occurring HPSK Using Specific Antibodies</p>
    <p num="209">
      Naturally occurring or recombinant HPSK is substantially purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using antibodies specific for HPSK.
      <br/>
      An immunoaffinity column is constructed by covalently coupling HPSK antibody to an activated chromatographic resin, such as CnBr-activated SEPHAROSE (Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn).
      <br/>
      After the coupling, the resin is blocked and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions.
    </p>
    <p num="210">
      Media containing HPSK is passed over the immunoaffinity column, and the column is washed under conditions that allow the preferential absorbance of HPSK (e.g., high ionic strength buffers in the presence of detergent).
      <br/>
      The column is eluted under conditions that disrupt antibody/HPSK binding (eg, a buffer of pH 2-3 or a high concentration of a chaotrope, such as urea or thiocyanate ion), and HPSK is collected.

    <p num="211">XII. Identification of Molecules Which Interact with HPSK</p>
    <p num="212">
      HPSK or biologically active fragments thereof are labeled with 125 I Bolton-Hunter reagent (Bolton et al. (1973) Biochem. J. 133:529).
      <br/>
      Candidate molecules previously arrayed in the wells of a multi-well plate are incubated with the labeled HPSK, washed and any wells with labeled HPSK complex are assayed.
      <br/>
      Data obtained using different concentrations of HPSK are used to calculate values for the number, affinity, and association of HPSK with the candidate molecules.
