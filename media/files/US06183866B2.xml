    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a fine particle for modifying polyolefine.
      <br/>
      More particularly, it relates to a fine particle which is excellent in affinity with polyolefine, and modifies polyolefine without accompanying damage on the transparency of the polyolefine.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      When polyolefine films are overlapped, they adhere to each other and result in a so-called blocking phenomenon, which causes many problems.
      <br/>
      To restrain the blocking phenomenon, there are known methods in which the properties of polyolefine are modified by adding fine particles to polyolefine.
      <br/>
      Particularly for polyolefine films, such methods are commonly conducted with inorganic fine particles such as silica particles or titanium oxide particles, or polymeric crosslinked particles such as polystyrene particles or polymethylmethacrylate particles added to polyolefine, to prevent the films from blocking.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 57-64522 (JP-A-57-64522) discloses an oriented polypropylene film obtained in the following manner.
      <br/>
      That is, polymeric fine particles having a particle size of 3 to 40  MU m with a crosslinked structure and having no melting point are mixed with a polypropylene resin in a specific amount, the mixture is molten and extruded, followed by cooling, and then the resulting resin is stretched uniaxially or biaxially to obtain the oriented polypropylene film.
      <br/>
      The application also discloses that when the difference in solubility coefficient between the non-melting crosslinked polymer particles and the polypropylene resin is small, the affinity between the crosslinked polymer particles and the polypropylene resin is good, resulting in higher transparency of the oriented film.
      <br/>
      The fine particles of crosslinked polymers which are mainly made from polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylate, polycarbonate, polyethylene terephthalate or the like, are exemplified.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 6-107868 (JP-A-6-107868) discloses a polyolefine film made of a composition obtained by mixing polyolefine with crosslinked particles which are made from a copolymer mainly composed of a (meth)acrylic monomer and a styrene monomer, and has an average particle size of 0.4 to 7  MU m.</p>
    <p num="5">In addition, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 7-228729 (JP-A-7-228729) discloses a polyolefine film obtained by dispersing crosslinked particles having a core-shell form into a polyolefin polymer, wherein the crosslinked particles (core-shell particles) are prepared by polymerizing polymerizable monomers containing a crosslinkable monomer in an amount of 10% by weight or more to give crosslinked polymer particles (A), followed by coating the surface of the crosslinked particles (A) with a thermoplastic resin (B), and are composite crosslinked polymer particles having an average particle size of 0.01 to 10  MU m.</p>
    <p num="6">
      As described above, many kinds of fine particles such as the inorganic particles or the crosslinked particles have been known and used for modifying polyolefine.
      <br/>
      However, these conventional fine particles can not keep the high transparency of polyolefine or can not show the high affinity with polyolefine, when the particles are mixed with polyolefine.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      For example, fine particles such as silica particles or crosslinked polymethylmethacrylate particles have a refractive index close to that of polyolefine, and hence the transparency of polyolefine containing the particles is high.
      <br/>
      However, the affinity between polyolefine and the particles is insufficient and, therefore, the particles tend to separate from polyolefine when a polyolefine film containing the particles is process (ex. stretched or bent), causing problems such that voids are produced and the particles fall out of the polyolefine film.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The crosslinked polystyrene fine particles have high affinity with polyolefine, and hence the problems, such that voids are produced and the particles fall out of the polyolefine film, do not tend to occur.
      <br/>
      However, the refractive index of the crosslinked polystyrene fine particles does not be close to that of polyolefine and, therefore, the transparency of polyolefine containing the particles deteriorates.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      When the copolymer fine particles mainly composed of a (meth)acrylic monomer and a styrene monomer are used for modifying polyolefine, both properties of the affinity and of the transparency are somewhat high.
      <br/>
      However, the transparency is not as high as that achieved by the crosslinked polymethylmethacrylate fine particles, and the affinity is not as high as that between the crosslinked polystyrene fine particles and polyolefine and, therefore, the generation of voids and the separation of particles and polyolefine are not restrained so much compared with the crosslinked polystyrene fine particles, either.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      As described above, the composite crosslinked polymer particles having a core-shell form composed of core layer with a high crosslinking density and a shell layer with a low crosslinking density are used in the JP-A-7-22879, and in the examples thereof, the composite crosslinked polymer particles of which shell layer is mainly made from acrylic monomers are used.
      <br/>
      However, the affinity of these exemplified particles with polyolefine is insufficient and, therefore, the problems such as the generation of voids and the separation of particles and polyolefine have not been solved completely when the polyolefine to which these fine particles have been added is subjected to a stretching process.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">The present invention provides a fine particle for modifying polyolefine which is excellent in affinity with polyolefine, and can modify polyolefine without accompanying damage on the transparency of the polyolefine.</p>
    <p num="12">That is, the present invention provides a fine particle for modifying polyolefine which comprises (i) a core layer having a refractive index which differs from that of the polyolefine by 0.05 or less and (ii) a shell layer having a solubility parameter which differs from that of the polyolefine by 3 MPa1/2 or less, wherein the core layer is coated with the shell layer.</p>
    <p num="13">The present invention also provides a polyolefine film comprising a fine particles.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="14">A fine particle of the present invention can be used for modifying polyolefine, a comprises a core layer and a shell layer existing on the surface on the core layer.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The core layer of the fine particle of the present invention has a refractive index which differs from that of polyolefine by 0.05 or less, preferably by 0.03 or less.
      <br/>
      The refractive index of the core layer may be substantially the same as that of polyolefine.
    </p>
    <p num="16">If the refractive index of the core layer differs from that of polyolefine by more than 0.05, the transparency of the polyolefine deteriorates undesirably when the fine particles composed of the core layer are mixed with polyolefine for modifying polyolefine.</p>
    <p num="17">Examples of materials for the core layer include inorganic materials such as silica and titanium oxide, and organic polymers such as acrylic resin, polystyrene, polyester, polyolefine and silicone resin.</p>
    <p num="18">The shell layer of the fine particle of the present invention, which exists on the surface of the above-described core layer, has a solubility parameter which differs from that of the polyolefine by 3 MPa1/2 or less.</p>
    <p num="19">
      If the solubility parameter of the shell layer differs from that of polyolefine by more than 3 MPa1/2, the affinity between polyolefine and the fine particles composed of the shell layer is low and, therefore, problems arise such that the voids are generated and the particles separate from polyolefine when a polyolefine film containing the particles is formed.
      <br/>
      In addition, the particles do not show a sufficient modifying effect such as anti-blocking effect when used for modifying polyolefine.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      For forming an article of a polyolefine resin, for example, and uniaxially or biaxially film, a stretching roll is usually used.
      <br/>
      When the affinity between polyolefine and the particles mixed with polyolefine is low, the particles separate from the polyolefine and cause a contamination on the roll.
      <br/>
      The contamination itself on the roll is allowable if it is in small amounts.
      <br/>
      However, it results in contamination on the formed article and, therefore, it is preferable that there is not contamination on the roll.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the void is a flaw of the formed article itself and it is desirable that the voids are reduced even in small quantities.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The solubility parameter of the present invention is defined by the three-dimensional parameter of ( DELTA  d,  DELTA  p,  DELTA  h) proposed by Hansen, C. M., and the difference ( DELTA  DELTA ) in solubility parameter between two substances is defined by the distance between two points in the three-dimensional coordinates as in the following Expression 1.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Expression 1
      <br/>
      DELTA  DELTA 2 =( DELTA  d1 - DELTA  d2)2 +( DELTA  p1 - DELTA  p2)2 +( DELTA  h1 - DELTA  h2)2
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The value of the solubility parameter is peculiar to each substance, and is shown in, for example, "Handbook of Solubility Parameters and Other Cohesion parameters (2nd Ed.)" (CRC Press) and the like.
      <br/>
      There is also a method of calculating the value of the solubility parameter based on a group mole attraction constant.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      For materials of the shell layer, inorganic materials and organic polymers can be used, but, organic polymers are preferably used.
      <br/>
      It is more preferable to use organic polymers mainly composed of styrene monomeric units or olefin monomeric units.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      When organic polymers are used as the shell layer, it is preferred that the shell layer is crosslinked, or grafted onto the core layer.
      <br/>
      When the shell layer is crosslinked or grafted, the preferable fine particles can be obtained, since the shell layer of the fine particles hardly peels off from the core layer and hardly disperses into the polyolefine and, therefore, the affinity between the fine particles and polyolefine can be improved efficiently, when the fine particles are added to polyolefine, followed by melting and kneading.
    </p>
    <p num="26">When the thickness of the shell layer is "d" nm and the difference in refractive index between the shell layer and the polyolefine is " DELTA n", the fine particles for modifying polyolefine of the present invention preferably have the product value " DELTA n * d" of 20 nm or less, and more preferably 10 nm or less.</p>
    <p num="27">When the thickness of the shell layer increases or the difference in refractive index between the shell layer and the polyolefine increases and, consequently, the value " DELTA n * d" is more than 20 nm, then, the shell layer portion tends to largely scatter light, causing a reduction in transparency of polyolefine containing the resulting fine particles.</p>
    <p num="28">
      The thickness of the shell layer in the present invention can be calculated, from the previously measured average particle size of the core layer and the average particle size of the whole particles which are composed of the core layers and the shell layers (core-shell particles), or from the volume ration of the shell layer to the core layer and the average particle size of the core-shell particles.
      <br/>
      For example, in the case that the particles of the present invention are made from the resin obtained by two-stage polymerization of the core layer and the shell layer, the volume ration of the shell layer to the core layer can be easily obtained since almost all the utilized monomers become to be the corresponding polymers to form the core layer and the shell layer and, therefore, each volume of the shell layer and the core layer can be obtained, based on the amount of the utilized monomers.
      <br/>
      From such obtained volume ration and the average particle size of the core-shell particles, the thickness of the shell layer can be easily calculated.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The method for producing the fine particles of the present invention which have a core-shell form is not restricted.
      <br/>
      Examples thereof include known methods such as a method in which fine particles corresponding to the core layer itself are blended with fine particles to be the shell layer by a dry method or by a wet method to obtain composite particles; and a method in which two-stage polymerization of the core layer and the shell layer is conducted by the emulsion polymerization method or dispersion polymerization method.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Examples of the methods conducting the blending by the dry method or by the wet method to obtain the composite particles, include a coating method using a fluid bed (ex., "Chemical Engineering" p.p., 26-30, the March 1996, issue), a mechanofusion method using a shear type mill (ex., "Chemical Engineering" p.p., 34-42, the September 1995, issue), a hybridization method utilizing impact energy in high-speed flow (ex., "Journal of the Society of Powder Technology", vol. 33, the 8th issue, p.p., 35-43 (1996)), and a hetero coagulation method in which an amphoteric latex is blended (ex., "Kagaku Kogaku Ronbunshu" vol. 18, the 5th issue, p.p., 637-642, (1992)).</p>
    <p num="31">Examples of the method conducting the two-stage polymerization by the emulsion polymerization method and the dispersion polymerization method are also widely known (ex., J. of Polym. Sci. Polym. Chem. Ed. 16, 3219 (1980), etc.).</p>
    <p num="32">The latter methods in which the two-stage polymerization is conducted are suitable for obtaining the core-shell particles of which the shell layer is crosslinked or grafted onto the core layer.</p>
    <p num="33">The fine particles of the present invention are added to polyolefine and are used for modifying the polyolefine.</p>
    <p num="34">Examples of polyolefine include homopolymers or copolymers of  ALPHA -olefins such as propylene, ehtylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene; copolymers of the  ALPHA -olefins and monomers copolymerizable with the  ALPHA -olefins (ex., vinyl acetate and maleic acid); and the polymer mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The fine particles of the present invention are used for modifying polyolefine in various amounts in accordance with their sue, and the amount is not restricted.
      <br/>
      The particles are usually used in an amount in the range of 0.01 to 50 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of polyolefine.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The method for adding the fine particles to polyolefine is not restricted as long as the fine particles are uniformly dispersed into polyolefine.
      <br/>
      Examples thereof include the methods in which the particles and polyolefine are mixed by a ribbon blender, Henschel mixer or the like, followed by melting and mixing the resulting mixture by an extruder.
    </p>
    <p num="37">When the fine particles are added to polyolefine, an agent such as antioxidant, neutralizer, lubricant, non-dropping agent or antistatic agent can also be appropriately added to polyolefine, if necessary.</p>
    <p num="38">
      The polyolefine to which the fine particles of the present invention have been added can be formed into film by known methods and is utilized for many applications.
      <br/>
      The polyolefine containing the fine particles is especially suitable for uniaxially or biaxially oriented films.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The present invention provides a fine particle for modifying polyolefine which is excellent in affinity with polyolefine, and can modify polyolefine without accompanying damage on the transparency of the polyolefine.
      <br/>
      Especially, when the polyolefine to which the fine particles have been added is subjected to a stretching process, there arise less problems such as the generation of voids and the separation of the particles and polyolefine, which enables the modifying effect to be exerted sufficiently.

    <heading>EXAMPLES</heading>
    <p num="41">The present invention is described in more detail by following Examples, which should not be construed as a limitation upon the scope of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="42">
      In the following, Examples in which polypropylene was used as polyolefine and biaxially oriented films of polypropylene was formed are described, since the effect of affinity between the polyolefine and the fine particles emerges remarkably.
      <br/>
      The results of evaluation of Examples and Comparative Examples are shown in Table 2.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Forming a biaxially oriented film was carried out in the following manner.
      <br/>
      That is, a mixture of 100 parts by weight of polypropylene and 0.4 parts by weight of fine particles was subjected to melting and extrusion at a resin temperature of 260 (degree)  C., which was then quenched by a 60 (degree)  C. chill roll to be solidified by cooling in a film form having a thickness of 0.8 mm. Subsequently, after preheating, the film was subjected to five-fold stretching at a stretching temperature of 145 (degree)  C. in the machine direction (MD) by a difference in peripheral speed between rolls of a stretching machine.
      <br/>
      Then, the film was subjected to eight-fold stretching at a stretching temperature of 157 (degree)  C. in the transverse direction by means of a tenter, followed by a heat treatment at 165 (degree)  C. to obtain an oriented film having a thickness of 20  MU m. The one side of oriented film was then subjected to a corona treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      This film forming was continued for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      Then, the degree of contamination with the fine particles on the above MD stretching roll was measured with the eye.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      An total haze value of each film and an internal haze value of each film were measured in accordance with ASTM D-103.
      <br/>
      The higher the transparency of the film, the smaller the haze value.

    <p num="46">
      The solubility parameters of polypropylene and various kinds of polymers utilized in Examples and Comparative Examples for obtaining the fine particles were determined by using the Hansen parameters based on the mole traction constants thereof, and then a difference in solubility parameters between polypropylene and each polymer was calculated.

      To calculate a thickness of fine particles, firstly, the average particle size of the fine particles was measured and the volume ration of "core layer/shell layer" was calculated, which was based on the amounts of monomers used for forming the core layer and the shell layer.
      <br/>
      Then, the thickness of the shell layer of the fine particles was obtained by the average particle size and the volume ratio.
      <br/>

      After dissolution, the first-stage polymerization was effected at 90 (degree)  C. for 10 hours to obtain fine particles having a refractive index of 1.51 and an average particle size of 1.3  MU m. The fine particles were used as particles composing core layers in this example.
