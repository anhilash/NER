    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to the molecular biology of cellular growth factors and recombinant DNA technology.
      <br/>
      More specifically, this invention relates to epidermal growth factor (EGF) modified to increase its binding activity at low pH, and the therapeutic uses of modified EGF of the invention.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a 53-amino acid protein synthesized in the duodenum and salivary glands of normal humans, and normally excreted in the urine.
      <br/>
      For its effect in reducing gastric acid secretion, and its first isolation source, it was formerly termed urogastrone.
      <br/>
      After it was sequenced, it was recognized that urogastrone was homologous to murine EGF, and that urogastrone additionally stimulated the proliferation of certain cell types, prompting a change in nomenclature to EGF.
      <br/>
      The biological and chemical properties of hEGF and mEGF are reviewed in G. Carpenter et al, Ann Rev Biochem (1979) 48:193-216.
    </p>
    <p num="4">The amino acid sequence of human EGF is:</p>
    <p num="5">Asn Ser Asp Ser Glu Cys Pro Leu Ser His Asp Gly Tyr Cys Leu His Asp Gly Val Cys Met Tyr Ile Glu Ala Leu Asp Lys Tyr Ala Cys Asn Cys Val Val Gly Tyr Ile Gly Glu Arg Cys Gln Tyr Arg Asp Leu Lys Trp Trp Glu Leu Arg (SEQ ID NO:1)</p>
    <p num="6">
      This sequence was published by H. Gregory et al, Int J Peptide Protein Res (1977) 9:107-18, who isolated the protein as urogastrone from human urine (1 mg/ 1000 L), and disclosed its sequence homology with mEGF.
      <br/>
      Murine EGF has the sequence (differences from hEGF underlined):
    </p>
    <p num="7">Asn Ser Tyr Pro Gly Cys Pro Ser Ser Tyr Asp Gly Tyr Cys Leu Asn Gly Gly Val Cys Met His Ile Glu Ser Leu Asp Ser Tyr Thr Cys Asn Cys Val Ile Gly Tyr Ser Gly Asp Arg Cys Gln Thr Arg Asp Leu Arg Trp Trp Glu Leu Arg, (SEQ ID NO:2)</p>
    <p num="8">
      which conserves the disulfide bonds.
      <br/>
      Gregory also discloses that urogastrone may be maintained in aqueous solution at pHs of 1-11 for at least 20 hours without loss of activity, and that the six C-terminal amino acids may be removed without loss of biological activity.
    </p>

      C. George-Nascimento et al, Biochem (1988) 27:797-802 reported the isolation from recombinant yeast culture of four distinct forms of EGF, termed A, B, C, and D, each of which exhibit full EGF activity.
      <br/>
      EGF-D represents the 52-amino acid sequence obtained by removing the C-terminal arg, while EGF-B corresponds to EGF-D wherein the C-terminal arg-leu has been removed.
      <br/>
      EGF-C appears to be EGF-D in which Met21 has been oxidized, while EGF-A appears to be EGF-B with Met21 oxidized.

      EGF-D is reported to be stable when stored as a lyophilized powder.

      George-Nascimento et al, U.S. Ser. No. 07/351,773, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,158,935, disclosed EGF muteins in which the Asp11 residue is replaced, preferably with Glu, in order to prevent degradation by isomerization of the Asp residue.
      <br/>
      Asp11 may isomerize to iso-Asp, which disturbs the peptide backbone and impairs the peptide's activity.

      The physical structure of a recombinantly-produced hEGF has been partially elucidated using COSY and NOESY by K. Makino et al, Proc Nat Acad Sci USA (1987) 84:7841-45.
      <br/>
      Makino disclosed that amino acids 19-32 form an antiparallel beta-pleated sheet, placing His10 in close proximity to Tyr22 and Tyr29.
      <br/>
      Makino also suggested that amino acids 45-53 may form an alpha helix which crosses the surface of the beta-pleated sheet, creating a hydrophobic pocket comprising His10, Tyr22, Tyr29, Trp49, and Trp50.
      <br/>
      Removal of amino acids 49-53 altered the NMR chemical shift and pKa of the ring protons on His10, His19, Tyr22, and Tyr29, and drastically reduced the activity, suggesting that these amino acids may participate in the EGF binding site.

    <p num="13">Nestor et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,686,283 disclosed the preparation of polypeptides and polypeptide analogs homologous to amino acids 34-43 of EGF and TGF- ALPHA , which are useful as EGF antagonists and for preparing anti-EGF antibodies.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      Contrary to the teachings in the art, we have found that His16 is not a residue essential for receptor binding activity.
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, we discovered that EGF muteins in which His16 is replaced with a neutral or acidic amino acid exhibit activity equal or superior to wild-type EGF at neutral and basic pH, and which retain their activity at pHs as low as 4.0, whereas wtEGF exhibits substantially reduced binding activity below pH 6.5.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      We have now invented EGF muteins having neutral or acidic residues at position 16, which exhibit activity at low pH which is enhanced with respect to wild-type EGF.
      <br/>
      We have also invented therapeutic methods of treatment comprising administering the EGF muteins of the invention to a subject in need thereof.

    <p num="16">FIG. 1 graphically depicts the binding of labeled wtEGF and EGF-A16 to fixed A431 cells as a function of pH.</p>
    <heading>MODES OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      A.
      <br/>
      Definitions The term "EGF" as used herein refers to a polypeptide having substantially the same sequence and activity as purified native epidermal growth factor.
      <br/>
      The term "hEGF" denotes the EGF protein having the substantially the same sequence and characteristics as epidermal growth factor obtained from humans, while "rhEGF" specifies that the hEGF is produced by recombinant methods.
      <br/>
      Similarly, "mEGF" denotes EGF of murine origin, and "rmEGF" denotes EGF having the murine sequence prepared by recombinant means. "wtEGF" specifies EGF having the wild-type (naturally occurring) sequence. "EGF mutein" specifies an EGF peptide having a sequence different from wild type.
      <br/>
      EGF muteins will have from 1 to 20 differences from the wild type amino acid sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      "EGF" includes proteins varying from the native sequence, e.g., by substitution of one or more amino acids with other amino acids, so long as the EGF biological activity is substantially preserved.
      <br/>
      EGF biological activity is preferably measured by a receptor binding assay. "Substantially similar" sequences are those which preferably have at least 65 number % homology with the native sequence, more preferably about 85 number %, still more preferably about 90 number %, and most preferred about 95 number %. Thus, for example, a human EGF protein in which the methionine (Met) at position 21 is replaced with isoleucine (Ile) falls within the scope of "EGF." Such a protein is denoted hEGF-I21 generally, and is denoted rhEGF-I21 if prepared recombinantly (chemically synthesized hEGF is included in the term "hEGF").
      <br/>
      Similarly, hEGF having the Asp at position 11 replaced with Glu is denoted hEGF-E11.
      <br/>
      Some EGF proteins truncated near the carboxy terminal retain their biological activity, and are denoted with a subscript indicating the last peptide residue retained.
      <br/>
      Thus, EGF lacking the last 2 of its normal 53 peptides is indicated EGF51.
      <br/>
      Proteins having an amino acid deletion, for example wherein Trp49 is absent, are denoted with the term "del" (or  DELTA ) and a subscript indicating the position, without altering the numbering of the remaining amino acids.
      <br/>
      Thus, if Trp49 were deleted, the resulting protein would be indicated EGF- DELTA 49.
      <br/>
      Insertions, increasing the chain length, are indicated as substitutions substituting 2 or more amino acids for one, e.g., rhEGF-L/G15 indicates insertion of Gly after the natural Leu15.
      <br/>
      Finally, an EGF of the invention where His16 has been replaced by another amino acid, with or without other modifications, is denoted generically by EGF-X16.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The term "amino acid" as used herein refers generally to a molecule of the formula NH2 --CHR--COOH, wherein R is a side chain or residue which may or may not occur naturally.
      <br/>
      The terms "natural amino acid" and "naturally-occurring amino acid" refer to those 20 amino acids which are the normal constituents of proteins, e.g., Ala, Asp, Cys, Glu, Phe, Gly, His, Ile, Lys, Leu, Met, Asn, Pro, Gln, Arg, Ser, Thr, Val, Trp, Tyr.
      <br/>
      Other (non-natural) amino acids which may be used include homoserine, phenylglycine, taurine, iodotyrosine, and the like.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the side chain (R) of an amino acid will contain 1-12 carbon atoms, 0-4 nitrogen atoms, 0-2 sulfurs, 0-4 oxygens, and 0-4 halogen atoms.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      A "condition treatable with EGF" is any disorder or wound having symptoms which may be ameliorated using EGF.
      <br/>
      For example, EGF is known to reduce secretion and oversecretion of gastric acid.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, EGF-X16 may be used to treat gastric and duodenal ulcers, as well as gastric hyperacidity.
      <br/>
      EGF is also known to improve healing of epithelial wounds, including wounds to the eye, e,g., caused by trauma (including surgery), infection, and the like.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, EGF-X16 may be administered to epithelial wounds to improve wound healing.
      <br/>
      EGF-X16 is particularly useful in corneal storage media, for preserving the epithelial and endothelial cell layers on corneal explants stored for subsequent transplantation.
      <br/>
      As corneal explants may be stored for period of up to about three months, it is extremely useful to use a form of EGF which is not chemically degraded over that time period.
    </p>
    <p num="21">B. General Method</p>
    <p num="22">
      The proteins of the present invention are muteins of EGF, preferably human EGF, in which the His residue at position 16 is replaced with a neutral or acidic amino acid.
      <br/>
      Neutral amino acids include, without limitation, Ala, Gly, Val, Leu, Ile, Met, Ser, Thr, Phe, Tyr, Trp, homo-alanine, benzylglycine, and the like.
      <br/>
      Presently preferred neutral amino acids are Ala, Gly, Val, Ser, and Thr.
      <br/>
      Acidic amino acids include, without limitation, Asp, Glu, homoglutamic acid, and the like.
      <br/>
      The presently preferred acidic amino acids are Asp and Glu.
      <br/>
      It is believed that His16 does not participate in receptor binding, but does interfere with receptor binding when protonated at low pH.
      <br/>
      This is likely due to the positive charge acquired with protonation.
      <br/>
      Thus, peptides in accordance with the present invention lack a basic residue at position 15.
      <br/>
      Any amino acid which is not easily protonated at low pH, and which does not stearically interfere with binding, may be substituted for His16 with a reasonable expectation of success.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      As disclosed by C. George-Nascimento et al. in copending application U.S. Ser. No. 004,212, the Asp11 residue of hEGF is prone to isomerization in solution, resulting in the loss of EGF biological activity.
      <br/>
      George-Nascimento demonstrated that other amino acids (such as Glu) may be substituted for Asp11, significantly increasing the shelf life of the peptide without loss of biological activity.
      <br/>
      Such modifications are also useful to the peptides of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, derivatives such as rhEGF-E11 A16 are within the scope of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      We have also found that substitutions at positions 12 and 13 result in EGF muteins exhibiting increased receptor affinity and/or mitogenicity.
      <br/>
      Presently preferred substitutions are Trp for Tyr13 and Glu for Gly12.
      <br/>
      Thus, preferred peptides of the invention include EGF-E12 A16, EGF-W13 A16, EGF-E12 W13 A16, EGF-E11 E12 A16, EGF-E11 W13 A16, EGF-E11 E12 W13 A16, and the like.
      <br/>
      Peptides substituted at positions 12 and/or 13 but lacking substitutions of the invention at position 16 may be used where activity at low pH is not critical, and still exhibit the enhanced levels of activity at neutral pH.
      <br/>
      Thus, peptides such as EGF-E12, EGF-W13, and EGF-E12 W13 are also useful.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Peptides of the invention are EGF muteins having a neutral or acidic substitution at position 16, and which preferably are additionally substituted at positions 11, 12, and/or 13.
      <br/>
      Other positions, such as Glu43, may also be substituted without detrimental effect on EGF activity.
      <br/>
      In general, critical residues are typically conserved across species lines, whereas non-critical residues are more likely to vary from one species to the next.
      <br/>
      Thus, one may compare EGF sequences obtained from differing species for guidance as to which residues may be varied without loss of activity.
      <br/>
      Both human and murine EGF exhibit activity with human cells.
      <br/>
      Thus, non-conserved positions indicate residues which are not essential for binding to human EGF receptors.
      <br/>
      These residues are 3-5, 8, 10, 16-17, 22, 25, 28, 30, 35, 38, 40, 44 and 48.
      <br/>
      Some or all of these positions may be altered, within reason, without loss of biological activity.
      <br/>
      Such alteration is preferably a conservative amino acid substitution, such as Gly for Ala, Val or Leu for Ile, Asp for Glu, Gln for Asn, and so forth, in which basic residues are replaced with other basic residues, acidic residues are replaced with other acidic residues, etc.
      <br/>
      It is preferred not to change Pro residues due to the effect on the polypeptide backbone.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      EGF may also be altered by adding an N-terminal extension.
      <br/>
      EGF-flag ( PHI EGF) derivatives have the additional sequence DWKDDDDK (SEQ ID NO:3), which permits rapid purification of peptides by affinity chromatography on anti-flag MAb columns (International Biotechnology Inc.).
      <br/>

      The proteins of the invention may be expressed in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems, or in in vitro expression systems.

      Prokaryotes are most frequently represented by various strains of E. coli.

      However, other microbial strains may also be used, such as bacilli (for example Bacillus subtilis), various species of Pseudomonas, and other bacterial strains.
      <br/>
      In such prokaryotic systems, plasmid vectors which contain replication sites and control sequences derived from a species compatible with the host are use.
      <br/>
      For example, E. coli is typically transformed using derivatives of pBR322, a plasmid derived from an E. coli species by Bolivar et al, Gene (1977) 2:95. Commonly used prokaryotic control sequences, which are defined herein to include promoters for transcription initiation, optionally with an operator, along with ribosome binding site sequences, include such commonly used promoters as the  BETA -lactamase (penicillinase) and lactose (lac) promoter systems (Chang et al, Nature (1977) 198:1056) and the tryptophan (trp) promoter system (Goeddel et al, Nuc Acids Res (1980) 8:4057) and the lambda-derived PL promoter and N-gene ribosome binding site (Shimatake et al, Nature (1981) 292:128).

S. Urdea et al, Proc Nat Acad Sci USA (1983) 80:7461-65).
      <br/>

      Briefly, an in vitro expression vector is prepared (e.g., an sp6 plasmid), and the codon position corresponding to the non-natural amino acid site is altered to a nonsense codon (particularly TAG), e.g., using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis.

    <p num="39">Vector Construction</p>
    <p num="40">
      Construction of suitable vectors containing the desired coding and control sequences employs standard ligation and restriction techniques which are well understood in the art.
      <br/>
      Isolated plasmids, DNA sequences, or synthesized oligonucleotides are cleaved, tailored and religated in the form desired.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Site specific DNA cleavage is performed by treatment with a suitable restriction enzyme (or enzymes) under conditions which are generally understood in the art, generally following the manufacturer's directions.
      <br/>
      See, e.g., New England Biolabs, Product Catalog.
      <br/>
      In general, about 1  MU g of plasmid or DNA sequence is cleaved by one unit of enzyme in about 20  MU L of buffer solution; in the examples herein, typically, an excess of restriction enzyme is used to insure complete digestion of the DNA substrate.
      <br/>
      Incubation times of about 1 hr to 2 hr at about 37 (degree)  C. are workable, although variations can be tolerated.
      <br/>
      After each incubation, protein is removed by extraction with phenol/chloroform, and may be followed by diethyl ether extraction, and the nucleic acid recovered from aqueous fractions by ethanol precipitation followed by separation over a Sephadex.RTM. G-50 spin column.
      <br/>
      If desired, size separation of the cleaved fragments may be performed by polyacrylamide gel or agarose gel electrophoresis using standard techniques.
      <br/>
      A general description of size separations is found in Meth Enzymol (1980) 65:499-560.

      Restriction cleaved fragments may be blunt ended by treating with the large fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow) in the presence of the four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) using incubation times of about 15 to 25 min at 20 to 25 (degree)  C. in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 6 mM DTT and 5-10  MU M dNTPs.
      <br/>
      The Klenow fragment fills in at 5' sticky ends but chews back protruding 3' single strands, even though the four dNTPs are present.
      <br/>
      If desired, selective repair can be performed by supplying only 1-3 of the dNTPs, within the limitations dictated by the nature of the sticky ends.
      <br/>
      After treatment with Klenow fragment, the mixture is extracted with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitated followed by running over a Sephadex.RTM. G-50 spin column.

      In vector construction employing "vector fragments", the vector fragment is commonly treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP) in order to remove the 5' phosphate and prevent religation of the vector.

      <br/>
      Briefly, the synthetic oligonucleotide is used as a primer to direct synthesis of a strand complementary to the phage, and the resulting double-stranded DNA is transformed into a phage-supporting host bacterium.

      Conductivity readings were taken at each pH to ensure that conductivity was in a range not affecting the receptor assay. 200  MU L of 125 I-EGF (1 nM) or 125 I-EGF-A16 (1 nM) in assay buffer (pH 2.7-9.0) was added to each well in triplicate, and incubated for 2 hr at 37 (degree)  C. The wells were then washed 3 *  with 200  MU L of PBS/0.1% BSA, detached, and counted in a gamma counter.
      <br/>
      The results (shown in FIG. 1) demonstrate that EGF-A16 retains its receptor binding activity at a pH approximately 1.2 pH units lower than wild type EGF.

      Thawed cells are trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in a medium containing DMEM, 5% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 300  MU g/mL L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100  MU g/mL streptomycin.
      <br/>
      The cells are counted using a hemocytometer and 0.4% trypan blue.
      <br/>
      The cell concentration is adjusted to 1 * 105 cells/mL using the same medium, and dispensed onto microtiter plates (100  MU L/well).

      EGF muteins prepared in Example 1 and native sequence EGF are dissolved to make 100  MU g/mL solutions.
      <br/>
      These solutions are used to make serial dilutions of 20, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.3125, 0.15625, 0.078125, 0.0390625, 0.0195, and 0.00975 ng/mL.
      <br/>
      Ten  MU L of each dilution is added to a microtiter plate well, and the plates returned to the incubator and incubated at 37 (degree)  C. for 18 hours.
      <br/>
      The cells are then pulsed with 3 H-thymidine (3 H-T), by adding 10  MU L of 3 H-T (100  MU Ci/mL) to each well, and incubating for 24 hours.
      <br/>
      The 3 H-T is then expelled, and the plates rinsed twice with PBS.
      <br/>
      To fix the cells, the plates are then incubated twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for 15 minutes at room temperature, followed by incubation twice with 100% MeOH.
      <br/>
      The plates are then air-dried.

      The well contents are then solubilized using 0.3 N NaOH (50  MU L/well) for 30 minutes, and transferred to scintillation vials.
      <br/>
      Scintillation fluid Ready-Solv EP, 4 mL) is then added to each vial, and the vials counted for 1 min with a 0-1,000 (3 H) window in a Beckman LS3801 counter.
