      A composition comprising a lower aqueous phase having from at least about 1 wt % of the composition of a polymer or copolymer selected from the group consisting of polyacrylate, polystyrene sulfonate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, or maleic anhydride and mixtures thereof and an upper aqueous phase having a cleansing effective amount of a surfactant or mixture thereof.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      Cleansing compositions are generally a single phase or an oily phase dispersed in a watery cleansing phase.
      <br/>
      When significant quantities of an oily phase are present, particularly to apply skin conditioning via emolliency with lipophilic type components, substantial efforts are usually made to provide a stable emulsion, which does not come apart.
      <br/>
      However, there can be significant advantages to having two or more phases present in a single container during non-use.
      <br/>
      These phases can be appealing to the eye depending upon various agents; particularly coloring agents dispersed therein or particles present at the interface of the phases.
      <br/>
      A small amount of shaking by the user prior to end use can create mixing of the phases and at times a bubbly-type appearance.
      <br/>
      Emulsion(s) can be formed during the mixing and can be present during the actual cleansing.
      <br/>
      Upon nonagitation, the phases once more readily separate into two or more phases and are ready for the next cleansing, for example, twenty-four hours later when using a shower gel.
      <br/>
      Though, lower viscosities are acceptable for products such as bath foam, higher viscosities are preferred for certain products such as shower gels, cream-like compositions, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      However, making two aqueous phases is not readily achievable.
      <br/>
      Secondly, the selective thickening of one aqueous phase, as opposed to the second, is also not readily achievable.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">In accordance with the invention, there is a composition comprising a lower aqueous phase having therein from at least about 1% desirably at least about 2 wt. % of the composition of a hydrophilic polymer or copolymer selected from the group consisting of polyacrylate, polystyrene sulfonate, polyvinylpryrrolidone, or maleic anhydride and mixtures thereof and an upper aqueous phase having therein a cleansing effective amount of a surfactant or mixture thereof.</p>
    <p num="4">When the lower polymer phase is formed, it is desirable that at least about 10% of the volume of the composition be in the lower phase.</p>
    <p num="5">It is preferred that the viscosity of the composition when mixed should be at least 200 centipoise and no more than about 15,000 centipoise.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Though selective choice of polymers a third phase can be formed.
      <br/>
      This phase is a second aqueous polymer phase below the first aqueous polymer phase.
      <br/>
      This results in a three phase composition having a surfactant phase which lies above a first polymer place and the first polymer phase lies above a second polymer phase.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The two aqueous phases form distinct separate layers when in contact without agitation.
      <br/>
      Normally when a water-soluble polymer is present with a water soluble or dispersible surfactant (such as a nonionic ethoxylated surfactant) a single aqueous layer is formed.
      <br/>
      It has now been found that certain skin compatible polymers will not normally coexist in a single aqueous layer with a surfactant but will form a second layer, usually below that of the surfactant containing aqueous layer.
      <br/>
      It is believed that the property which separates this grouping of polymers from the ones that are compatible in one phase, is the hydrophilicity of the polymer.
      <br/>
      Those polymers which are highly hydrophilic will form a second aqueous phase.
      <br/>
      These polymers typically have no or very little cross-linking and no significant hydrophobic bonding.
      <br/>
      Examples of polymers, which form such a second aqueous phase are polyacrylate polymers (including copolymers) polystyrene sulfonate(s), polyvinylpyrrolidones and the like.
      <br/>
      Examples of polymers, which do not form a second phase but maintain a single phase with the aqueous surfactant-containing phase, are polyethylene glycols, Pluronics (ethylene oxide polymers and copolymers with propylene oxide, cellulosic polymers, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The greater the quantity of hydrophilic polymer employed in the composition, the larger the volume of the polymer containing phase.
      <br/>
      Generally the higher the molecular weight the greater the propensity for the polymer to be present in the phase separate from the surfactant phase.
      <br/>
      The lower the molecular weight the more the polymer partitions with the surfactant phase until there may be only one phase at relatively low polymer molecular weights.
      <br/>
      When using polyvinylpyrrolidone polymer greater than about 60,000 molecular weight and with other polymers present, a second polymer phase can be formed which is below the first polymer phase.
      <br/>
      This results in a three phase system with surfactant layer on top, a first polymer phase having the high molecular weight polyvinylpyrrolidone and the second polymer phase below the first polymer phase having the other polymers mentioned before such as the polyacrylate maleic anhydride.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that there is always some partitioning of the surfactant and polymer(s) in all the phases.
      <br/>
      However, when referring to a "surfactant phase", the phase is rich in surfactant compared to the other phase(s).
      <br/>
      The same applies to "first polymer phase" and "second polymer phase".

    <p num="9">
      In the same manner as various polymers having a tendency to associate with the surfactant in a single aqueous phase, so do the usual thickening components.
      <br/>
      This phenomenon therefore provides a reasonably viscous surfactant phase and a very thin polymer-containing phase prior to thickening.
      <br/>
      Examples of thickening agents which preferentially enter the aqueous surfactant phase as opposed to the polymer phase are common salt such as sodium chloride, associated thickeners such as polyacrylate methacrylates with cross linking such as Aculyn 22 and 33, see CTFA vol. 4, 1991 for further definition, and hydrophobically modified polymers.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      With respect to the two phase system, this preferential solubility leaves a two aqueous phase composition which is heavily imbalanced with respect to viscosity, the upper surfactant phase being substantially more viscous than the lower polymer phase.
      <br/>
      It is difficult to achieve proper mixing when the two-phase composition is agitated.
      <br/>
      However, some thickeners are preferentially soluble in the polymer phase.
      <br/>
      These materials include the non-hydrophobically modified water-soluble polymers, which may or may not be crosslinked.
      <br/>
      Examples of such polymers include polyacrylic acids and polyacrylic acids crosslinked with an allyl ether of pentaerythritol and the like, of sucrose or of propylene, for example, the Carbomer 900 series available from Goodrich as "Carbopol(s)". Such polyacrylic acids are 70 to 100% neutralized with a base.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Additionally, it has been observed that certain metallic salts also bring about preferential thickening of the polymer phase as opposed to the surfactant phase.
      <br/>
      These salts are the water soluble metallic salts having a cation with an oxidation number of at least plus two.
      <br/>
      Examples of such salts include magnesium, calcium, barium, manganese, iron, aluminum and the like.
      <br/>
      Various anions include chloride, nitrate, sulfates and the like of these metallic salts.
      <br/>
