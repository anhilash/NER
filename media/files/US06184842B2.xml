    <heading>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This application claims the priority of German patent document 198 19 709.8, filed May 2, 1998, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.</p>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to a range warning radar dome made of a radar transparent material which has a metallically glossy layer, and to a method of manufacturing such a radar dome.</p>

    <p num="4">A design which includes a maker's emblem in a raised form within a visually partially transparent radome structure in a Range Warning Radar (RWR) system, has not been known so far.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Also new is the provision of a scratch-resistant surface made of SiO2 on or in combination with a radome.
      <br/>
      Such a scratch-resistant SiO2 -layer can be applied by a sol-gel technique or by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD=depositing layers of material on a substrate from the gaseous phase).

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The general idea of the invention to integrate a manufacturer's symbol, emblem or characteristic structures of motor vehicle parts into the radar dome itself, and to provide the represented symbols with a for example, metallic, chrome-glossy appearance, while maintaining full radar transparency, and without influencing the propagation of radar waves due to diffraction, refraction, dispersion and reflection.
      <br/>
      In this manner the imaging characteristics of the radome are fully maintained.
      <br/>
      In addition, the radome may also have the form and function of a lens.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The firm emblem 10 illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 can be contructed as a radome as follows: In a known manner, it is composed of a star 11 and of a ring 12 enclosing it.
      <br/>
      The three pointed star 11 has a chrome-colored coating, is radar-transparent and embedded in a transparent cover layer.
      <br/>
      The ring 12 is a transparent thermoplastic material which has a dark-colored, opaque or corresponding coating, and preferably scratch-resistant coating, as well.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      As shown in FIG. 2, the above-mentioned radome therefore consists of a radar-transparent and visually transparent cover plate a1 made of a material which exhibits low dielectric losses --for example, polycarbonate.
      <br/>
      In this cover plate, the structure or the maker's emblem is now integrated in negative relief a2; that is, viewed from the backside it is formed as a recess.
      <br/>
      The backside of the cover plate a1 is preferably provided with a mask of a black paint coat so that the residual surfaces (those surfaces which do not belong to the negative relief) are covered during the working operation which follows for the metallic coating of the emblem 10 or of the structure.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The formed maker's emblem 10 is provided with a metallic or a metallically glossy layer a3.
      <br/>
      This layer has a thickness such that, within the visible wavelength range, electromagnetic radiation (light) is completely reflected, but the longer-wave radar waves penetrate almost without attenuation.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the metallic coating can be determined experimentally for various metallic coating materials; a respective diagram is indicated in FIG. 5.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In order to prevent distortions of the penetrating electromagnetic field because of the geometry of the backside surface, another polycarbonate layer, which is dyed in a dark color, is sprayed onto the backside of the transparent partially coated cover plate, or a plate of polycarbonate a4 is glued on in a form-locking manner.
      <br/>
      It is understood that in this case no inhomogeneities as the result of air bubbles, etc. must occur in the boundary layers.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      To protect the radome surface from mechanical or chemical influences, a radar-transparent ceramic cover layer made of SiO2 of a thickness of only a few  MU m is applied by means of chemical vapor deposition.
      <br/>
      Scratch-resistant radar-transparent coatings can be applied in a known manner also by means of the paint-coating or the sol-gel technique.
      <br/>
      For the cover plate a1 of the radome and the backside spraying, only materials are used which do not differ (or differ only slightly) in their dielectricity constant; and, as customary in radome construction, its thickness is coordinated with the wavelength of the corresponding radar frequency and to the angle of incidence in order to ensure constructive inference in the radome material.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      As a result of the above-suggested measures, the metallically glossy object a3 which is embedded in the clear polycarbonate a1 will now appear for the viewer in a top view before a dark background.
      <br/>
      Because of the homogeneity of the body in the resolution range of the wavelength, the material of the radome appears homogeneous for the radar wave.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      After the above explanation of the radome construction for the range warning radar, the radome construction using a deep-drawing technique is now described, and is illustrated in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The starting material to be used for the radome consists of a radar-transparent, stiff but thin foil material b1.
      <br/>
      As common in the deep-drawing and blister technique, the foil material, while being simultaneously heated, is pulled by means of a vacuum over a shape which corresponds to the desired geometry to be represented.
      <br/>
      In the illustrated embodiment, the forming tool has the geometry of a radiator grille b1. (The shape is selected such that only a few partial rays of the penetrating radar waves impinge diagonally or in a grazing manner on the surfaces of the dielectric or of the foil.)
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      For representing metallic parts, the foil is vapor-deposited or sputtered before or after the shaping by means of a metallic layer b2.
      <br/>
      Coating with special metallically glossy, non-metallic paints is also possible.
      <br/>
      It is important that the shape is designed such that it has no recesses or indentations in which water or snow can accumulate because of the air stream, but this can automatically be deflected by the wind pressure from the radome, as illustrated in FIG. 3 at 3b, where the illustrated radiator grille structure is open on the side in order to be able to deflect rain water and snow.
      <br/>
      Reference number b2 indicates the chrome-colored vapor-deposition or sputtering of the radome structure and b4 indicates a transparent protective layer.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As mentioned above, the metallically glossy areas are printed on, sputtered on or vapor-deposited on.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the metallic layer is selected, for example, as a function of the sputtering duration such that, for radar frequencies, a full transparency is still ensured.
      <br/>
      This takes place by means of the control of the ohmic resistance of the metal layer or by means of transmission measurements at microwave frequencies or by means of the duration of the coating process.
      <br/>
      Information in this respect is indicated in the diagrams in FIGS. 4 and 5 of the drawing.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Finally, to protect the metallic coating from corrosive and mechanical influences, it is recommended to apply a scratch-resistant paint coat to the metal layer or to use an SiO2 -layer b4 by means of chemical vapor deposition for this purpose.</p>
    <p num="21">
      The above-described radar-transparent processes are distinguished in that metallic structures can be represented by the coating of contours with metallic materials or with non-metallic paint coats which are metallically glossy because of interference effects without significantly influencing the imaging characteristics.
      <br/>
      This permits the integration of a trademark or characteristic structural shapes and, for example, to in the case of range warning systems, ensures their proper functioning.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The foregoing disclosure has been set forth merely to illustrate the invention and is not intended to be limiting.
      <br/>
      Since modifications of the disclosed embodiments incorporating the spirit and substance of the invention may occur to persons skilled in the art, the invention should be construed to include everything within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
