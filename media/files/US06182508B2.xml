      The oscillator 4 is, as clearly shown in FIG. 1, a typical tuning fork oscillator and includes the base 10 (i.e., a node) and a pair of arms 12 and 14.

      The base 10 is attached at the bottom 4a to the fixture 6.

      The fixture 6 is of substantially H-shape and includes the mount portion 32, the connecting portion 34, and the base portion 36.

      The connecting portion 34 is smaller in width than the mount portion 32 and connects between the centers of the mount portion 32 and the base portion 36.

      The base portion 36 is attached at the attachment surface 6b to the base 10.

      The attachment surfaces 6a and 6b are, as will be apparent from the discussion below, machined to be oriented at right angles to each other in order to install the oscillator 4 to the base 3 so that the longitudinal center line of the oscillator 4 extends parallel to the upper surface (i.e., the reference surface) of the base 3.
      <br/>
      This allows the angular rate sensor 2 to be mounted on a moving object so that an axis of rotation (i.e., the z axis in FIG. 1) of a moving object, whose angular rate is to be measured by the angular rate sensor 2, may lie in coincidence with the longitudinal center line of the oscillator 4 passing between opposed side surfaces of the arms 12 and 14.

      The base 3 has formed in the upper surface the rectangular recess 3a and disposed on the sides of the recess 3a terminals T1 to T8 connecting with the pad electrodes 27, the GND electrodes 22, the monitor electrodes 20, and the input electrodes 16 and 18 through wires W1 to W8.
      <br/>
      The glass material 79 is loaded into a clearance between the periphery of each of the terminals T1 to T8 and a mount hole formed in the base 3 for electrical isolation and hermetic sealing.
      <br/>
      The recess 3a is, as clearly shown in FIG. 1, slightly greater in an area than the oscillator 4 and the mount portion 36 of the fixture 6 and has the width and depth, as will be described later in detail, enough to prevent the oscillator 4 from touching or colliding with the base 3 due to excitation of the oscillator 4 and movement of the angular rate sensor 2 at the angular rate  OMEGA .
      <br/>
      The recess 3a is, as will be apparent from the following discussion, used to orient the oscillator 4 relative to the base 3, that is, to bring the length of the oscillator 4 into coincidence with the axis of rotation (i.e., the z axis) of the moving object.

      The fixture 6 is connected at the attachment surface 6b directly to the upper surface of the base 3 by bonding edges of both side surfaces of the base portion 36 at two points, as indicated at numeral 200, on each side surface using laser welding.

      In operation, 180 (degree)  out-of-phase ac excitation signals having a given frequency are applied to the input electrodes 16 and 18.

      This will cause the oscillator 4 to be excited to oscillate the arms 12 and 14 in the y-axis direction so that they are moved in a cycle close to and away from each other.
      <br/>
      During this oscillation, the monitor electrodes 20 output monitor signals indicative of oscillation of the oscillator 4 which are, in turn, fedback to, for example, an excitation signal generator and used for establishing the stability of excitation of the oscillator 4.

      When the angular rate sensor 2 is moved at the angular rate  OMEGA  around the z axis (i.e., the longitudinal center line of the oscillator 4 extending between the arms 12 and 14) during the oscillation of the oscillator 4, it will cause the Coriolis force to be produced which deflects the arms 12 and 14 in opposite directions along the z axis extending perpendicular both to the x and y axes.
      <br/>
      This deflection results in compression and tension stresses in the arms 12 and 14, thereby developing the voltage across the signal output electrodes 26 proportional to the angular rate  OMEGA  which is, in turn, extracted as an angular rate signal.

      The angular rate sensor 2 of this embodiment features the structure wherein the fixture 6 is bonded directly to the base 3 and supports the oscillator 4 parallel to the upper surface (i.e., the reference surface) of the base 3 with a given gap.

      This minimizes undesired oscillations of the oscillator 4, thereby resulting in high-accuracy angular rate detection.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The fixture 6 is, as described above, bonded to the base 3 using laser welding which produces less heat, thus avoiding the deterioration of polarization of the piezoelectric element of the oscillator 4.

    <p num="61">
      Usually, the undesired oscillations produced at the oscillator 4 depend not only upon the attachment of the fixture 6 to the base 3, but also upon a bond between the oscillator 4 and the fixture 6.

      <br/>
      Note that the width of a temperature drift means the width of a variation in output of the angular rate sensor 2 when the ambient temperature is changed from -30 to 85 (degree)  C. and is expressed in FIG. 3 as being divided by an output produced per unit angular rate; namely, an angle per unit time ( (degree) /s).

The oscillator 4 has a height (i.e., length) of 20.0 mm, a width of 4.4 mm, and a thickness of 2.1 mm.

      The line (d) indicates the width of a temperature drift when the adhesive is applied to a central portion of the attachment surface 6a (or the bottom 4b).
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The graph of FIG. 3 shows that the bonding of the oscillator 4 and the fixture 6 with the adhesive applied to the central portion of the attachment surface 6a (or the bottom 4b) minimizes, as indicated by the line (d), the temperature drift regardless of an adhesive-applied area and that the temperature drift is greatly decreased as long as the adhesive-applied portion of the attachment surface 6a (or the bottom 4b) occupies an area more than or equal to 80% thereof even when the adhesive-applied portion of the attachment surface 6a (or the bottom 4b) is biased from a vertical center line (extending perpendicular the longitudinal center line of the oscillator 4) in any direction.
      <br/>
      Specifically, it is advisable that the adhesive be applied to an overall surface of the attachment surface 6a or the bottom 4b, but the above described adhesive applications can also decrease the undesired oscillations of the oscillator 4.

    <p num="111">
      The angular rate sensor 300 includes the base 103, the oscillator 4, and the shell or cover 307.
      <br/>
      The cover 307 is made, for example, by pressing a metallic plate and hermetically installed on an upper surface of the base 103 to protect the oscillator 4 from the ingress of dirt, dust, and moisture.
      <br/>
      The structure of the base 103 and attachment of the oscillator 4 to the base 103 may utilize those disclosed in any one of the above embodiments, and explanation thereof in detail will be omitted here.
      <br/>
      Specifically, this embodiment features the installation of the angular rate sensor 300 in the housing 340, as shown in FIGS. 22(a) and 22(b).
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      The angular rate sensor 300 is supported by the housing 340 using two vibration isolators 330.
      <br/>
      Each of the vibration isolators 330 is made of a single silicone rubber member and includes mount bases 334, cylindrical damper shafts 333, and holder 332.
      <br/>
      The holder 332 has formed therein the slit 331 for insertion of the flange 230 of the base 103 of the sensor 300 and the threaded hole 331a for installation of the base 103 to the vibration isolator 330.
      <br/>
      The damper shaft 333 connects the holder 332 and the mount base 334 and works as a damper to absorb the vibration transmitted from the mount base 334 (i.e., the housing 340) to the angular rate sensor 300.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      The housing 340 is, as shown in FIGS. 22(a) and 22(b), made of a box-like member whose one surface is opened and has mounting portions (not shown) for attachment to a spinning object.
      <br/>
      Four bearing bases 341 are secured on inner side walls of the housing 340.
      <br/>
      Each of the bearing bases 341 has formed therein the circular opening 341a for bearing or holding one of the damper shafts 333 tightly.
    </p>
    <p num="114">The installation of the angular rate sensor 300 on the vibration insulators 330 is achieved by inserting the flanges 230 of the base 103 into the slits 331 of the holders 332, interposing the rubber spacers 350, as shown in FIGS. 21(a) and 21(b), between the slits 331 and the flanges 230, passing screws 360 through the threaded holes 220 of the base 103 and the threaded holes 331a of the holders 332, and tightening the screws 360.</p>
    <p num="115">
      The angular rate sensor 300 is, as clearly shown in FIGS. 22(a) and 22(b), held by the vibration isolators 330 so that the longitudinal center line of the base 103 may lie parallel to those of the vibration isolators 330.
      <br/>
      The vibration isolators 330 are supported by the bearing bases 341 within the housing 340 so that the longitudinal center line of the base 103 or the length of the oscillator 4 may be oriented to the z axis when the housing 340 is mounted on a given place of the moving object.
    </p>
    <p num="116">The four damper shafts 333 are arranged on a plane including the center of gravity of the angular rate sensor 300 diametrically across the center of gravity of the angular rate sensor 300.</p>
    <p num="117">
      Specifically, the damper shafts 333 lie flush with the base 103 since the angular rate sensor 300 is thin as a whole and the center of gravity thereof lies near the surface of the base 103.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the elastic force of each of the damper shafts 333 acts on the plane flush with the base 103.
      <br/>
      The resultant elastic center of the elastic centers of all the damper shafts 333, as will be described later in detail, agrees with the center of gravity of the angular rate sensor 300.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      The installation of the angular rate sensor 300 in the housing 340 after mounted on the vibration isolators 330 is accomplished by fitting the damper shafts 333 into the openings 341a of the bearing bases 341 in contact of the mount bases 334 with the bearing bases 341.
      <br/>
      The vibration isolators 330 are disposed within the housing 340 so that they are slightly compressed in the lengthwise direction thereof, thereby causing the elastic force of the damper shafts 333 to act outward to urge the mount base 334 into constant engagement with the inner wall of the housing 340.
      <br/>
      This holds the vibration isolators 330 tightly within the housing 340.
      <br/>
      The angular rate sensor 300 is, as described above, installed on, for example, an automotive vehicle.
      <br/>
      In this case, the housing 340 is secured within a console box so that the length of the oscillator 4 (i.e., the z axis) is oriented vertically.

    <p num="119">FIGS. 23(a) and 23(b) show a conventional vibration proofing structure made by the inventors for comparison with this invention.</p>
    <p num="120">
      The angular rate sensor 300 is the same as that shown in the above embodiment except for the shape of the base 103.
      <br/>
      The four vibration isolators 370 made from rubber are arranged perpendicular to the base 340.
      <br/>
      The base 340 lies parallel to the z-axis.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the longitudinal center line of each of the vibration isolators 370 extends in the direction of the x-axis.
    </p>
    <p num="121">The vibration isolators 370 are secured at ends thereof on the base 103 through the rubber spacers 380 using the screws 385 and at other ends on an inner wall of the housing 340 through rubber sheets 380 using screws (not shown).</p>
    <p num="122">FIGS. 24(a) to 24(c) show a physical model of the conventional vibration proofing structure in FIGS. 23(a) and 23(b).</p>
    <p num="123">
      Usually, when the pressure is applied to a rubber cushion, it will cause the rubber cushion to be deformed in the same direction as the pressure and three axes to arise which do not undergo any angular displacement.
      <br/>
      Such axes are called principal elastic axes.
      <br/>
      When a line of action of pressure applied to the rubber cushion passes through the elastic center (i.e., an intersection of the three principal elastic axes), the rubber cushion is deformed in a direction parallel to the applied pressure without experiencing any angular deformation.
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      In FIGS. 24(a) to 24(c), the resultant principal elastic axes of the principal elastic axes of all the vibration isolators 370 are expressed by arrows Dx, Dy, and Dz in a rectangular coordinate system defined by x, y, and z axes oriented in the same directions as those shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Each black point D1 indicates the resultant elastic center.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      In the conventional vibration proofing structure shown in FIGS. 24(a) to 24(c), the four vibration isolators 370, as illustrated as springs, are arranged perpendicular to the angular rate sensor 300.
      <br/>
      The resultant elastic center D1 of the vibration isolators 370, thus, lies between the angular rate sensor 300 and the housing 340 away from the center of gravity M of the angular rate sensor 300.
      <br/>
      In this case, when vibrations are, as shown in FIG. 35, generated in the y- and z- axis directions, it will cause the angular moment to be produced between the resultant elastic center D1 and the center of gravity M, resulting in angular displacement or rotational motion of the vibration proofing structure.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      Particularly, when vibrations are generated in the y-axis direction, it will cause the vibration proofing structure to experience a rotation around the z axis.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the angular rate arises around an axis extending parallel to the length of the oscillator 4 at equal intervals away from the arms 12 and 14, so that the angular rate sensor 300 detects that angular rate in error as an angular rate arising from actual rotational motion of the angular rate sensor 300.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      The vibration proofing structure of the invention, as shown in FIGS. 20 to 22(b), is designed for avoiding the above problem.
      <br/>
      The operation thereof will be described below using a physical model shown in FIGS. 26(a) to 27.
    </p>
    <p num="128">In FIGS. 26(a) to 27, the resultant elastic center that is an intersection of the resultant principal elastic axes of the vibration isolators 330 or the damper shafts 333 is expressed by D2.</p>
    <p num="129">
      The vibration proofing structure of this invention is different from the above described conventional vibration proofing structure in that the resultant elastic center D2 of the damper shafts 333 coincides with the center of gravity M of the angular rate sensor 300.
      <br/>
      Thus, even if vibrations act on the angular rate sensor 300 from any directions, the rotational moment is not produced.
      <br/>
      For example, when a vibration is, as shown in FIG. 27, produced in the y-axis direction, the angular rate sensor 300 undergoes only a displacement parallel to the direction of the vibration and does not detect the vibration as the angular rate in error.
    </p>
    <p num="130">The oscillator 4 used in this embodiment is made from PZT ceramic and has, as shown in FIG. 28, a thickness of 2.17 mm. The arms 12 and 14 have a width of 2 mm and a length of 17 mm and are spaced 0.6 mm. The length of the connection 306 is 3 mm.</p>
    <p num="131">The total length of the oscillator 4 in the z-axis direction is thus 20 mm.</p>
    <p num="132">
      The frequency of vibration of the oscillator 4 is set to 3.2 kHz. The vibration damping characteristics or size and hardness of the vibration isolators 330 are so determined that the damper shafts 333 dampen a vibration of 3.2 kHz by -40 dB.
      <br/>
      The vibration isolators 330 are made from silicone rubber whose hardness Hs (JIS-C-2323) is 60.

      FIGS. 29(a) to 29(c) show vibration sensitivities to vibrations acting from x-, y-, and z-axis directions on the angular rate sensors 300 in the conventional vibration proofing structure, as shown in FIGS. 23(a) and 23(b), and the vibration proofing structure of this invention, as shown in FIGS. 20 to 22(b).
      <br/>
      The vibration sensitivity is a sensor output (i.e., an offset voltage) when the angular rate sensor 300 is shaken by an exciter and expressed in the graphs as a value ( (degree) /S) derived by dividing a sensor output (voltage: V) when the angular rate sensor 300 is excited at 3.2 kHz and 0.1 G by a sensor output (sensitivity: V/ (degree) /S) when a unit angular rate is applied to the angular rate sensor 300.
      <br/>
      In the following discussion, the conventional vibration proofing structure will be referred to as a structure A, and the vibration proofing structure of this invention will be referred to as a structure B.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      As apparent from the graphs, the structure B is smaller in the vibration sensitivities to vibrations in all the directions or sensor output errors.
      <br/>
      Particularly, the vibration sensitivities to the vibrations in the x- and y-axis directions are much smaller.
      <br/>
      This is due to the fact that the resultant elastic center D2 of the damper shafts 33 coincides with the center of gravity M of the angular rate sensor 300 and particularly based on the fact that the structure B orients the length of each of the damper shafts 333 in the z-axis direction, that is, that the direction in which each of the damper shafts 333 is compressed is neither of the x- and y-axis directions and a shearing direction in which the resonance frequency is small.
    </p>
    <p num="135">FIG. 30 shows temperature drifts in output of the angular rate sensors 300 in the structures A and B.</p>
    <p num="136">The temperature drift and a variation thereof in the structure B is, as apparent from the graph, smaller than those in the structure A. This is because a rotational vibration of the oscillator 4 around the z axis induced by an excited oscillation of the oscillator 4 is damped by the above described vibration proofing characteristics of the structure B.</p>
    <p num="137">
      In the above embodiment, each of the vibration isolators 330 is so arranged that the length of the damper shaft 333 is oriented in the z-axis direction, but the length of the damper shaft 333 may alternatively be oriented in the y-axis direction.

      The excitation signal generator outputs excitation signals to the oscillator 4 of the angular rate sensor 300.

      The angular rate detector receives an output of the angular rate sensor 300 to determine the angular rate of the moving object.

      The vibration isolators 330 are identical in operation with those of the thirteenth embodiment, but different therefrom slightly in structure as discussed later.

    <p num="145">
      The casing 410 is formed with an aluminum box made by die casting and has formed at four corners of the inner wall 411 the seats 410a (only two are shown in FIG. 32 for brevity of illustration) which have U-shaped grooves for holding the vibration insulators 330 within the casing 410.
      <br/>
      The casing 410 has also formed on an outer wall thereof the flange 410b for attachment to the moving object.
      <br/>
      When the moving object is an automotive vehicle, the casing 410 is mounted so as to orient the angular rate sensor 300 (i.e., the oscillator 4) vertically.

    <p num="146">
      Each of the vibration isolators 330 is made of a one-piece rubber cushion and includes mount bases 334, damper shafts 333, and holder 332.

      <br/>
      The damper shaft 333 connects the holder 332 and the mount base 334 and works as a damper to absorb the vibration transmitted from the mount base 334 (i.e., the casing 410) to the angular rate sensor 300.

      The mount base 334 is fitted into one of the seats 410a of the casing 410 to secure the angular rate sensor 300 within the casing 410 elastically.

      Each of the holders 332 includes, as clearly shown in FIGS. 34(a) and 34(b), the side wall 451c and a pair of legs 451d.

      The side wall 451c has a thickness L1 between an outer surface thereof and an end of the flange 230 in the y-axis direction (the thickness L1 will be referred to as a y-axis protrusion, hereinafter).

      The y-axis protrusion and the x-axis protrusion work as dampers.

      Each of the vibration isolators 330 are disposed within the casing 410 so that the y-axis protrusion and the x-axis protrusion of each of the holder 332 may be arranged at intervals L3 and L4 away from the inner wall 411.
      <br/>
      The intervals L3 and L4 are so determined as to avoid collision of the holders 332 with the inner wall 411 of the casing 410 even when the holders 332 undergo a maximum deformation caused by the movement of the angular rate sensor 300 during normal usage in which the angular rate sensor 300 is free from accidental impact.
      <br/>
      For example, the intervals L3 and L4 are approximately 2 mm.

      Specifically, the x-axis and y-axis protrusions of the holders 333 and the damper shafts 332 work as dampers independently to absorb vibrations acting on the angular rate sensor 300 in x-, y-, and z-axis directions.

      The damper shafts 333 are designed taking into account the vibration power spectrum in the normal environmental condition.
      <br/>
      For example, the primary natural frequency of a spring/mass system defined by the damper shafts 333 and the angular rate sensor 300 is set to 100 to 300 Hz so that a vibration of 3.2 kHz that is a frequency of excitation signals input to the oscillator 4 is attenuated by -40 dB or more.
      <br/>
      It is also advisable that the damping factor of the damper shafts 333 be less than or equal to 0.5 in terms of the vibration-attenuating ability.
      <br/>
      This allows vibrations within a frequency band near 3.2 kHz or an odd multiple of 3.2 kHz transmitted from the casing 410 to be absorbed by the damper shafts 333 of the vibration isolators 330.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      It is advisable that the material of the damper shafts 333 be selected taking into account a change in spring coefficient due to a change in ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      Usually, silicone rubber exhibits a smaller temperature-caused change in spring coefficient and is suitable for the material of the damper shafts 333.
    </p>
    <p num="153">FIGS. 35(a) to 35(c) show a physical model of the vibration proofing structure of this embodiment.</p>
    <p num="154">
      In FIGS. 35(a) to 35(c), the resultant principal elastic axes of the principal elastic axes of all the damper shafts 333 are, similar to FIGS. 24(a) 26(c), expressed by arrows Dx, Dy, and Dz in a rectangular coordinate system defined by x, y, and z axes oriented in the same directions as those shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Each black point D1 indicates the resultant elastic center.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      The vibration proofing structure of this embodiment is so designed that the resultant elastic center D2 of the damper shafts 333 coincides with the center of gravity M of the angular rate sensor 300.
      <br/>
      Thus, even if vibrations act on the angular rate sensor 300 from any directions, the rotational moment is not produced.
      <br/>
      For example, when a vibration is, as shown in FIG. 36, produced in the y-axis direction, the angular rate sensor 300 undergoes only a displacement parallel to the direction of the vibration and does not detect the vibration as the angular rate in error.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      The excited oscillation and angular rate-caused movement of the oscillator 4 are, as described above, oriented in x- and y-axis directions perpendicular to the z axis.
      <br/>
      The shearing direction of each of the damper shafts 333 in which the resonance frequency is small is oriented to a direction perpendicular to the z axis.
      <br/>
      This minimizes unwanted vibrations impinging upon the excited oscillation and the angular rate-caused movement of the oscillator 4.
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      The lengthwise direction of compression and tension of each of the damper shafts 333 is, as described above, oriented in the z-axis direction.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the shearing stress acting on each of the damper shafts 333 is oriented to a direction parallel to a plane including the x and y axes.
      <br/>
      This causes the vibrational movement of the damper shafts 333 in the x- or y-axis direction during normal usage to be greater than that in the z-axis.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the size of the casing 410 and the location of the vibration isolators 330 within the casing 410 are so determined that the intervals L3 and L4, as shown in FIGS. 34(a) and 34(b), are great enough to avoid collision of the x- and y-axis protrusions of each of the holders 332 with the inner wall 411 of the casing 410 even when the holders 332 undergo a maximum deformation caused by the movement of the angular rate sensor 300 during normal usage in which the angular rate sensor 300 is free from accidental impact.
    </p>
    <p num="158">If the accidental impact acts on the angular rate sensor 300 through the casing 410 in the shearing direction of the damper shafts 333 of the vibration isolators 330, resulting in displacement of the angular rate sensor 300 over the interval L3 or L4, then the x- or y-axis protrusion of the holders 332 of the vibration isolators 330 collides with the inner wall 411 of the casing 410 to absorb the impact.</p>
    <p num="159">
      The size of each of the x- and y-axis protrusions of the holders 332 is so determined that an area facing the inner wall 411 of the casing 410 is greater than a cross sectional area of the damper shafts 333.
      <br/>
      This is because it is difficult to allow great vibration-damping strokes of the holders 332 in the x- and y-axis directions for the limitation of overall size of the sensor unit.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      FIG. 37 shows the results of drop and impact tests.

      The ordinate axis indicates the shock elimination ratio of the holder 333, and the abscissa axis the thickness L1 of the side wall 451c of the holder 333 (i.e., the y-axis protrusion).
      <br/>
      The shock elimination ratio is a ratio of the amount of impact absorption when the y-axis protrusion has the thickness L1, as expressed by 20 log(impact acceleration acting on the oscillator 4/impact acceleration acting on the casing 410)dB to that when the y-axis protrusion has a thickness of zero, as defined as 0 db.
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      The graph shows that the impact absorption of the y-axis protrusion of the holder 333 is enhanced according to an increase in thickness L1.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the thickness L1 is 3.2 mm in view of the size of the angular rate sensor 300, an allowable drop height of the vibration-proofing structure, and a maximum deformation of the vibration-proofing structure.
