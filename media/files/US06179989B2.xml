    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Exhaust sensors are conventionally used in vehicles to sense the level of oxygen in the exhaust gases.
      <br/>
      These sensors detect changes in the exhaust gas content, i.e., when the content changes from rich to lean or lean to rich in relation to the air/fuel ratio.
      <br/>
      One known type of oxygen sensor is a flat plate oxygen sensor formed of various layers of ceramic and electrolyte materials laminated and sintered together with electrical circuit and sensor traces placed between the layers in a conventional manner.
      <br/>
      A typical co-sintered flat plate sensor element is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,433,830 to Kawai et al; and commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,395,506 to Duce et al.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Numerous attempts have been made to produce improved exhaust sensors.
      <br/>
      One such sensor is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,030 to Duce et al.
      <br/>
      This patent discloses an exhaust sensor having a substrate with a dielectric material, an electrolyte material, and a transition zone disposed therebetween.
      <br/>
      Another improved sensor is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,504 to Paulus et al.
      <br/>
      This patent addresses lean switch point by teaching the use of a pre-equilibration zone on an exhaust gas sensor to provide a catalytic site to catalyze less reactive components of the exhaust gas prior to the gas sample reaching the sensor's exhaust side electrode.

    <p num="5">What is needed in the art is an improved exhaust sensor having improved performance, reduced sensitivity to processing, reproducibility and potentially higher manufacturing tolerances.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">The present invention is an improved exhaust sensor and method for making the same comprising electrically treating and chemically etching the sensor in order to improve sensor performance characteristics, catalytic activity on the surface of the sensor, and reproducibility of the signal, to reduce sensitivity to process variation, and to allow for higher manufacturing tolerances.</p>
    <p num="13">
      The exhaust sensor of the present invention can be any conventional sensor such as those disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,467,636, 5,602,325, 5,616,825, 5,384,030, and 5,733,504. (The relevant portions of which are hereby incorporated by reference).
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 1, one possible, planar exhaust sensor 100 comprises an electrode assembly 101 disposed within a metal tube utilizing a metal to glass seal 103 to isolate the sensing electrode 3 (see FIG. 2)(cathode electrode), from the exhaust electrode 5 (anode electrode).
      <br/>
      Exhaust gas gains access to the sensing electrode by means of a louvered shield 102 in the sensor.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Referring to FIG. 2, the electrode assembly 1 comprises a layered, sintered structure of electrodes 3, 5 and electrode leads 7, disposed on each side of a solid electrolyte 15, typically zirconia, with a protective layer 9, typically alumina, having a porous end disposed adjacent to the electrode 3.
      <br/>
      The other side of the electrolyte 15 has an insulating layer 17, typically alumina, containing an air channel 11 disposed therethrough, adjacent to the electrolyte 15 such that reference air contacts electrode 5.
      <br/>
      Disposed between this insulating layer 17 and heater 19 with heater leads 21, is one or multiple protector plates 13, also typically alumina.
      <br/>
      On the opposite side of the heater 9 is an end protector plate 13.
      <br/>
      Finally, disposed on both sides 23, 25 of the exterior of this layered structure, on an end opposite the electrode end, are contact pads 27.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Once the electrode assembly has been assembled, laminated and sintered, it is both chemically etched and electrically treated.
      <br/>
      The electrical treatment essentially eliminates sensor-caused negative voltage readings, i.e., it shifts the sensor output voltage upwards (to positive).
      <br/>
      In contrast, the chemical treatment, etching, increases the amplitude of the signal.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      As shown in FIG. 3, the combination of these preparation processes produces an improved exhaust sensor having faster response times versus untreated exhaust sensors, with false leakage readings virtually eliminated.
      <br/>
      Line 306 represents an exhaust sensor in which the electrode assembly has been electrically treated, line 305 represents an exhaust sensor in which the exhaust sensor has been electrically treated, line 304 represents a hydrofluoric acid etched electrode, line 303 represents a hydrofluoric acid etched exhaust sensor which was subsequently electrically treated, while line 302 represents an electrode sensor which was hydrofluoric acid etched followed by electrical treatment of the electrode assembly, and line 301 represents an exhaust sensor in which the electrode assembly was electrically treated and then hydrofluoric acid etched.
      <br/>
      As is clear from the graph, the exhaust sensors of the present invention, represented by lines 301, 302 and 303 had useful response times and lower operating temperatures than other sensors: 301 and 302 were switching at 9.5 volts (an operating temperature of approximately 350 to 400 (degree)  C.), with response times of about 35 milliseconds and 55 milliseconds without degrading other sensor performance characteristics, respectively, versus the other sensors which did not switch at all.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Although the electrode assembly can be first chemically treated and then electrically treated, a process of electrically treating followed by chemical etching is preferred since it produces somewhat superior results as is evident from FIGS. 3, 5 and 6 (described below).</p>
    <p num="18">
      Chemical treatment is believed to remove contaminants from the surface of the etched electrode(s), particularly silicon compounds, such as silica, and/or aluminum compounds, such as alumina.
      <br/>
      Chemically etching comprises exposing the electrode to an etchant for a sufficient period of time to increase the amplitude of the output signal produced by the exhaust sensor when in use, by about 50 millivolts, without degrading the sensor.
    </p>
    <p num="19">The exhaust side electrode, i.e., electrode 3 in FIG. 2, is exposed to an etchant by dipping a sufficient portion of the tip of the electrode assembly 1 in an etchant to expose at least electrode 3 to the etchant for a period of typically less than 60 seconds, with a period of about 10 seconds to about 30 seconds preferred, and a period of about 15 to about 25 seconds, especially preferred, for dipping the electrode assembly in a 1% hydrofluoric acid solution.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Possible etchants include silica etchants, such as hydrofluoric acid, bromic acid, potassium hydroxide/ethanol, and others capable of removing the contaminants from the electrode surface without degrading the structural integrity of the sensor, with hydrofluoric acid and a potassium hydroxide/ethanol mixture preferred due to the improved results obtained therewith.
      <br/>
      The potassium hydroxide/ethanol mixture can have up to about 10% volume percent (vol. %) potassium, with about 1 vol. % to about 5 vol. % potassium especially preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In addition to chemical etching, it is also preferred to electrically treat the sensor, or electrode assembly.
      <br/>
      Electrically treating comprises exposing the sensor or electrolyte assembly to electricity for a sufficient period of time to lower the interface impedance, obtain a higher rich voltage, and/or decrease the lean-rich response time, without degrading other performance characteristics.
      <br/>
      The sensor, which is typically heated prior to electrical treatment to a typical operating temperature, can be exposed to an alternating voltage of up to about 2 volts, with about 1.2 volts to about 1.5 volts preferred, for a period of up to about 15 seconds per exposure, with about 5 seconds to about 10 seconds per exposure preferred, for a total period of up to about 60 minutes, with about 5 to about 30 minutes preferred.
      <br/>
      The temperature for the electrical treatment is preferably about 600 (degree)  C. to about 800 (degree)  C., with about 700 (degree)  C. especially preferred.
      <br/>
      For example, after the electrode assembly of FIG. 2 was connected to an electrical source and heated to about 700 (degree)  C., a typical operating environment within an automobile, a voltage of 1.5 volts was applied to the sensor for about 5 seconds.
      <br/>
      The polarity was then reversed and a voltage of -1.5 volts was applied for about 5 seconds.
      <br/>
      This process continued for about 5 minutes.
      <br/>
      The interface impedance of the resulting sensor was then tested and compared to an untreated, conventional sensor.
      <br/>
      The electrically treated sensor revealed an order of magnitude improvement.
      <br/>
      The conventional sensor produced an impedance of about 2,000 ohms. at 700 (degree)  C., while the treated sensor had an interface impedance of below 300 ohms at 700 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Referring to FIG. 4, the sensor output of a conventional, untreated exhaust sensor (line 401) is compared to a sensor having a hydrofluoric acid etched electrode (line 405), a sensor having a hydrofluoric acid etched electrode and electrically treated electrode assembly (line 410), and a sensor having a potassium hydroxide/ethanol etched electrode (line 415), over time.
      <br/>
      As can be seen from this illustration, the hydrofluoric acid etched and potassium hydroxide/ethanol etched sensors had a significantly higher amplitude (both over 600 millivolts) versus the conventional sensor (less than 300 millivolts).
      <br/>
      The hydrofluoric acid etched sensor (line 405), however, produced a negative signal of about -200 millivolts, which can cause a false leakage reading during operation.
      <br/>
      The sensor having a hydrofluoric acid etched electrode and electrically treated electrode assembly (line 410), however, had significantly improved amplitude while only producing positive readings.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      FIGS. 5 and 6 graphically represent the comparison of a sensor having an electrically treated electrode assembly and a hydrofluoric acid etched electrode (lines 501, 601), a sensor having a hydrofluoric acid etched electrode and electrically treated electrode assembly (lines 503, 603), an electrically treated sensor having a hydrofluoric acid etched electrode (lines 505, 605), a sensor having a hydrofluoric acid etched electrode (lines 507, 607), and a sensor having an electrically treated electrode assembly (lines 509, 609) versus an electrically treated electrode sensor (lines 511, 611) for lean voltage and rich voltage, respectively.
      <br/>
      Under both conditions, the sensor having an electrically treated electrode assembly and a hydrofluoric acid etched electrode (lines 501, 601) and the sensor having a hydrofluoric acid etched electrode and electrically treated electrode assembly (lines 503, 603) produced superior results, low reading at lean voltage and high readings at rich voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="24">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="25">The following example has been used to produce a sensor having an electrically treated electrode assembly and a hydrofluoric acid etched electrode.</p>
    <p num="26">
      The heater of a laminated, sintered electrode assembly, as shown in FIG. 2, was attached to a power supply, while the electrodes were attached to a second power supply.
      <br/>
      A voltage of 13.5 volts was applied to the heater to raise the temperature of the electrode assembly to about 750 (degree)  C. After about 1 minute a square wave was applied to the electrodes; 1.5 volts for 5 seconds, followed by -1.5 volts for 5 seconds, for a total of 5 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The anode electrode of the electrically treated electrode assembly was then dipped in a 1% hydrofluoric acid solution for 15 seconds.
      <br/>
      The electrode assembly was then rinsed three times with deionized water to remove the hydrofluoric acid.
      <br/>
      The resulting sensor is illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6, lines 501, 601, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="28">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="29">The following example has been used to produce a sensor having a potassium hydroxide/ethanol mixture etched electrode.</p>
    <p num="30">
      The exhaust electrode of a laminated, sintered electrode assembly, as shown in FIG. 2, was dipped in a potassium hydroxide solution diluted with 50 volume percent (vol. %) ethanol for a period of 12 hours.
      <br/>
      The electrode assembly was then rinsed three times with deionized water to remove the potassium hydroxide/ethanol mixture.
      <br/>
      The resulting sensor is illustrated in FIG. 4, line 415.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      As is well known in the art, exhaust sensors provide important feed back regarding the engine efficiency.
      <br/>
      Prompt, accurate information is very useful in improving the efficiency and performance of a vehicle.
      <br/>
      The exhaust sensor of the present invention has improved accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility, possibly higher manufacturing tolerances, eliminates the "green effect", enables lower operating temperatures, and substantially reduced response delay, i.e., a reduction from about 80 milliseconds of the prior art to about 20 milliseconds of the present invention (at the conventional operating temperature of about 750 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      Note the green effect is the effect of the sensor characteristics improving after a period of use.
      <br/>
      For example, a sensor used in an automobile operates more efficiently after about 50 hours of use than when it is new.
      <br/>
      The sensors of the present invention do not experience this "green effect".
      <br/>
      They operate essentially the same, efficiently, at installation and 50 hours thereafter.

      While preferred embodiments have been shown and described, various modifications and substitutions may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is to be understood that the present invention has been described by way of illustrations and not limitation.
