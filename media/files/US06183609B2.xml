    <p num="3">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="4">
      A first aspect of the present invention relates to a sintered laminated structure including a plurality of ceramic layers made of different materials, which sintered laminated structure is useful as a filter as well as a laminated structure for electrochemical cells such as solid oxide fuel cells, steam electrolysis cells, oxygen pumps, and NOx decomposition cells.
      <br/>
      The invention also relates to a process for producing such a sintered laminated structure, and to an electrochemical cell using such a sintered laminated structure.
    </p>
    <p num="5">(2-0001)</p>
    <p num="6">A second aspect of the present invention relates to a self-supporting type substrate for an electrochemical cell, a process for producing the substrate for the electrochemical cell, and such an electrochemical cell, said electrochemical cell including the self-supporting type electrode substrate and adapted to be used as a solid oxide fuel cell, a steam electrolysis cell, an oxygen pump, or a NOx decomposing cell or the like.</p>

    <p num="9">
      Heretofore, ceramic filters have been used in various technical fields including treatment of water.
      <br/>
      Among such filters, for example, a filter in which a ceramic layer having fine pores is formed on the surface of a cylindrical porous ceramic main body is known.
    </p>
    <p num="10">(1-0003)</p>
    <p num="11">
      The solid oxide fuel cells are broadly classified into a planar type and a tubular type.
      <br/>
      In the solid oxide fuel cell of the planar type, a power generating stack is formed by alternatively laminating so-called separators and power-generating layers.
      <br/>
      In JP-A 5-54897, a fuel electrode and an air electrode are separately formed, a power-generating layer is produced by using these fuel electrode and air electrode, an interconnector is formed, and a laminated body is produced by interposing a thin film containing ceramic powder and an organic binder between the power-generating layer and the interconnector.
    </p>
    <p num="12">(1-0004)</p>
    <p num="13">
      In JP-A 6-68885, a green molded body of an interconnector and that of a distributor on a side of an air electrode are laminated together, and the interconnector and the distributor are joined together by integrally firing the resulting laminate.
      <br/>
      According to this process, a stress-relaxation layer is formed between the green molded bodies by applying such a material between them as extremely differs from the green bodies in terms of the thermal shrinkage behavior so that stress between the green molded bodies may be relaxed by the stress-relaxation layer.
      <br/>
      The above stress-relaxation layer is finely broken during firing shrinkage, which relaxes the stress.
    </p>
    <p num="14">(1-0005)</p>
    <p num="15">
      Both of a principal portion of the solid oxide fuel cell and the ceramic filter is a member obtained by laminating ceramic layers and integrally the laminate.
      <br/>
      However, they have the following common problems.
      <br/>
      That is, as to the ceramic filter, the entire dimension of the filter needs to be made greater to enhance the filtration efficiency.
      <br/>
      This causes a cost-up and increase in the installation space.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, since the filter is made of bulky ceramics, the filter has a large weight.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, in order to decrease the filtration resistance of the filter, the thickness of the filter needs to be thin.
      <br/>
      In order to decrease the filtering resistance of the filter, the thickness of the filter needs to be decreased.
      <br/>
      This unfavorably largely deteriorates the strength of the structural body of the filter.

      On the other hand, according to the solid oxide fuel cell, a gas cannot be fed to the electrode at good efficiency, that is, resistance against diffusion of the gas inside the electrode is large, so that there is a certain limit upon the power-generating performance of the cell.
      <br/>
      Further, there are problems that a unit cell is heavy and a material cost is high because a rare earth element is used.

    <p num="19">
      In the solid oxide fuel cell, it is a common technique that an electrode or an interconnector is designed in the form of a substrate to give strength, and that constituting elements (a solid electrolyte and the other electrode) other than the substrate are formed on the substrate in a filmy fashion to reduce resistance of the cell.
      <br/>
      For example, according to a solid oxide fuel cell of a so-called Westinghouse type, a tubular air electrode is used as a substrate, and a film of a solid electrolyte and a film of a fuel electrode are formed on this substrate.
      <br/>
      NGK Insulators, Ltd. also disclosed a unit cell having a structure in which a sintered laminated structure composed of an air electrode and an interconnector is used as an air electrode/interconnector substrate, and a film of a solid electrolyte and a film of a fuel electrode are formed on the substrate (JP-A-5-66518).

    <p num="20">(2-0003)</p>
    <p num="21">
      However, since a collective cell is formed by laminating a number of planar or tubular unit cells, given mechanical strength is required for such unit cells.
      <br/>
      In the conventional unit cells, since the electrode is used as a substrate, it is indispensable that the substrate has a large thickness of around 3 mm to around 10 mm to afford given mechanical strength upon the substrate.
      <br/>
      For this reason, there exist problems in that the substrate is heavy and the cost for materials to constitute the substrate is high.
      <br/>
      Further, since the substrate is thick, an internal resistance of the substrate is large.
      <br/>
      Electric power is generated at a three-phase interfaces at which electrodes, pores and a solid electrolyte contact together.
      <br/>
      Since the substrate is thick, diffusing resistance at which a gas diffuses in the substrate is large, and polarization is great.
      <br/>
      Consequently, this leads to reduction in the electric power-generating performance.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it has been clarified that similar problems exist in the case of an electrochemical cell other than the solid oxide fuel cell, for example, a high temperature steam electrolysis cell.

    <p num="23">
      It is therefore an object of the first aspect of the present invention to provide a sintered laminated functional ceramic structure for use as a ceramic filter or for a solid oxide fuel cell, in which functions possessed by ceramics can be enhanced, the weight of the sintered laminated structure is reduced and the structural strength of the sintered laminated structure is increased.
      <br/>
      The present invention also relates to a process for producing such a sintered laminated structure as well as to an electrochemical cell using such a sintered laminated structure.
    </p>
    <p num="24">(1-0008)</p>
    <p num="25">The first aspect of the present invention relates to the sintered laminated structure comprising a plurality of ceramic layers being made of ceramic materials different from one another, wherein each of the ceramic layers is provided with through-holes passing said each of the ceramic layers.</p>
    <p num="26">(1-0009)</p>
    <p num="27">
      The present inventors reached a new structure that the independent through-holes are formed in each of the ceramic layers constituting the sintered laminated structure.
      <br/>
      As a result, the functions possessed by the ceramic materials can be enhanced, the weight of the sintered laminated structure can be reduced, and the structural strength of the sintered laminated structure can be improved.
    </p>
    <p num="28">(1-0010)</p>
    <p num="29">
      More specifically, when the sintered laminated structure is used as a ceramic filter for a filtering device, filtering resistance is small, filtering efficiency is improved, and a large amount of liquid can be treated in a short time.
      <br/>
      Further, the weight of the filter can be reduced by the provision of the through-holes.
      <br/>
      Since the independent or closed through-holes are formed in each of the ceramic layers, the structural strength can be kept high.
    </p>
    <p num="30">(1-0011)</p>
    <p num="31">
      On the other hand, when the sintered laminated structure is a sintered laminated structure having a planar shape for an electrochemical cell and is provided with an electrode layer and a separator layer, the gas-diffusing efficiency inside the electrode can be enhanced and the electrode reaction can be activated by the provision of the through-holes in the electrode layer.
      <br/>
      As a result, in the case of the solid oxide fuel cell, the power-generating density is enhanced.
      <br/>
      In the case of the steam electrolysis cell, electrolysis efficiency is improved.
      <br/>
      In addition, the cooling effect of the cell can be improved and the temperature of the cell can be made uniform by the provision of the through-holes in the separator.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the cell can be made lighter by the through-holes without deteriorating the strength of the structure.

    <p num="41">
      The present inventors reached a technical idea that the electrode substrate was formed by a honeycomb ceramic structure, actually produced unit cells and conducted electric power-generating tests for them.
      <br/>
      As a result, even if the thickness of the walls of the honeycomb ceramic structure is made smaller, given mechanical strength of the honeycomb structure can be maintained, and the weight of the unit cell can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Further, the internal resistance in the electrodes can be reduced, gases can be fed to a reaction site at higher efficiency, and polarization can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Thereby, electric power-generating performance per unit cell can be further improved.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="49">(1-0012)</p>
    <p num="50">In the following, more specific embodiments of the first aspect of the present invention will be explained.</p>
    <p num="51">
      The sintered laminated structure is preferably in an elongate shape.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the longitudinal length of the through-hole is set at preferably not less than 2 times, more preferably not less than 5 times as large as that of the through-hole in a direction vertical to the through-hole.
    </p>
    <p num="52">(1-0013)</p>
    <p num="53">
      A process for producing the sintered laminated structure according to the present invention is not limited to any specific one.
      <br/>
      However, a molded body for the above sintered laminated structure can be produced by obtaining a molded body through simultaneously feeding bodies for respective ceramic layers to a die and integrally firing the molded body.
    </p>
    <p num="54">(1-0014)</p>
    <p num="55">
      According to the above producing process, laminated structures having various sectional shapes can be produced by changing the configuration of the die.
      <br/>
      Further, an elongate product (for example, 1000 mm in length) can be produced.
      <br/>
      In this process, the number of the producing steps can be largely reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="56">(1-0015)</p>
    <p num="57">
      If the shape of an inlet is designed to be circular, the die can be easily worked.
      <br/>
      The shape of the inlet of the die is appropriately designed so that the bodies may easily proceed in the die.
      <br/>
      As an extruding mechanism for extruding each of the die in the die, a plunger or a vacuum pug mill may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="58">(1-0016)</p>
    <p num="59">
      If an aqueous binder is used in the body, it needs not be deaerated unlike in the use of an organic solvent.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the producing equipment may be simplified, and the molded body extruded from the die is unlikely to be bent.
      <br/>
      In this case, the content of water in the body is preferably in a range of 10 to 20 wt %. Further, as the aqueous binder, polyvinyl alcohol, methyl cellulose and ethyl cellulose may be recited.
    </p>
    <p num="60">(1-0017)</p>
    <p num="61">
      Further, it turned out that the molded body is likely to be bent in extruding the molded body.
      <br/>
      That is, the flowing speed of the harder body tends to be smaller on extruding, whereas that of the softer body tends to be larger.
      <br/>
      Due to this difference in the flowing speed, the molded body was bent or warped as the molded body goes away from the tip of the molded body.
      <br/>
      Further, due to the above difference in the flowing speed between the bodies, the interface between them was positionally deviated.
    </p>
    <p num="62">(1-0018)</p>
    <p num="63">
      On the other hand, it turned out that hardness of a body preferably differs from that of an adjacent one by not more than 2 so that the molded body may not be bent, the molded body may be straightly extruded, and the interface of the adjacent green molded bodies may not positionally deviated.
      <br/>
      Hardness referred to here is hardness measured by a standard set for a NGK clay hardness meter.
    </p>
    <p num="64">(1-0019)</p>
    <p num="65">
      It is often difficult to finely adjust the hardness of actual bodies in an actual producing process.
      <br/>
      In order to continuously feed each body into a single die, it is possible that a body to constitute a first green molded body is pushed to the die from a first extruding mechanism, and another body to constitute an adjacent green molding body is pushed to the die from a second extruding mechanism.
      <br/>
      Thereby, it is possible that the extruding speed and the extruding pressure of each of the bodies through the first and second extruding mechanisms are mechanically appropriately adjusted so that the laminated body may be prevented from being bent.
    </p>
    <p num="66">(1-0020)</p>
    <p num="67">
      In the present invention, in case of a filter where a liquid is fed to an inner layer and a filtered liquid is discharged from an outer layer, silica, alumina, mullite, zirconia, spinel, silicon carbide, and cordierite may be recited as a material for constituting the outer layer of the filter.
      <br/>
      The average pore diameter is preferably 1 to 10  MU m, and the porosity is preferably 10 to 70%.
      <br/>
      As a material for constituting the inner layer of the filter, silica, alumina, mullite, zirconia, spinel, silicon carbide, and cordierite may be recited.
      <br/>
      The material of the inner layer may be identical with or different from that of the outer layer.
      <br/>
      The average pore diameter of the inner layer is preferably 5 to 200  MU m. In this case, the average pore diameter of the inner layer is greater than that of the outer layer.
      <br/>
      The porosity of the inner layer is preferably 20 to 80%.
      <br/>
      In the above, if the construction is reversed between the inner layer and the outer layer, the liquid can be fed to the outer layer side, whereas the filtered liquid can be discharged from the inner layer side.
    </p>
    <p num="68">(1-0021)</p>
    <p num="69">As the electrochemical cell to which the present invention may be applied, an oxygen pump may be recited.</p>
    <p num="70">(1-0022)</p>
    <p num="71">
      This cell may be used for a hydrogen-producing apparatus or a steam-removing apparatus.
      <br/>
      In that case, the following reactions occur in each electrode.

    </p>
    <p num="74">(1-0024)</p>
    <p num="75">
      Further, the present invention may be applied to the NOx decomposing cell.
      <br/>
      This decomposing cell may be used as a purifier for exhaust gases from automobiles and power generating apparatuses.
      <br/>
      At present, NOx generated from gasoline engines is now being coped with by means of ternary functional catalysts.
      <br/>
      However, with respect to low fuel consumption type engines such as lean burning engines or diesel engines, the ternary function catalyst will not work well because the content of oxygen in the exhaust gases from these engines is large.
    </p>
    <p num="76">(1-0025)</p>
    <p num="77">
      If the electrochemical cell according to the present invention is used as an NOx decomposing cell, oxygen in the exhaust gas is removed through a solid oxide electrolyte film, NOx is decomposed into N2 and O2- through electrolysis, and oxygen thus produced by the decomposition can be also removed.
      <br/>
      Further, concurrently with the above process, steam in the exhaust gases is electrolyzed into hydrogen and oxygen, and NOx is reduced into N2 with this hydrogen.

      In the electrochemical cell according to the present invention, both an anode such as an air electrode and a cathode such as a fuel electrode may be included in an electrode to be integrated with a separator, but the anode is preferred.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is particularly favorable to join a self-supporting type anode to the separator.
      <br/>
      For, when a laminate composed of green molded bodies of the anode and the separator is to be formed, the laminate of the self-supporting anode and the separator is thicker and stronger, which makes handling easier.

      FIG. 2 is a partial sectional view for outlining the state in which the filter in FIG. 1 is placed in a filtering device.
      <br/>
      The filter shown in FIG. 1 was produced according to the following steps, and its performance was evaluated.
    </p>
    <p num="97">(1-0035)</p>
    <p num="98">Preparation of a Starting Material</p>
    <p num="99">
      First, a body was prepared by using alumina powder, cellulose and methyl cellulose.
      <br/>
      More specifically, 5 parts by weight of cellulose, 3 parts by weight of ethyl cellulose and 20 parts by weight of water were mixed into 100 parts by weight of alumina starting material powder, and a kneaded product was formulated by placing the resulting mixture into a kneader and kneading it.
      <br/>
      The kneaded produce was placed in a vacuum pug mill where a cylindrial body A having a diameter of 50 mm and a length of 300 mm was produced.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, 3 parts by weight of methyl cellulose and 23 parts by weight of water were mixed into 100 parts by weight of alumina raw material powder having the average particle diameter of 100 parts by weight, and a kneaded product was formulated by placing it in a kneader and kneading it.
      <br/>
      A tubular body B having the diameter of 50 mm and a length of 300 mm was produced through placing the kneaded product in the vacuum pug mill.

    <p num="101">(Molding Step)</p>
    <p num="102">
      Next, using the bodies A and B, a molded body of a filter was produced by simultaneously extruding them.
      <br/>
      At that time, an extruding machine having a configuration shown in FIG. 3 was used.
      <br/>
      That is, the bodies A and B (15A and 15B) were fed into passages 14A and 14B of molding barrels 13A and 13B, respectively.
      <br/>
