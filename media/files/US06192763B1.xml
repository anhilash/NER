      A method of determining the compressive strength path of a mortar or concrete mix is presented.
      <br/>
      The method includes: (a) conducting a series of tests by directing a jet of gas at gradually increasing pressure onto a surface of a freshly mixed test batch of mortar or concrete mix, monitoring the surface of the test sample and recording the pressure of the gas jet at which erosion resistance of the sample surface breaks down; (b) averaging the recorded gas pressure of the tests to obtain a strength index for the sample, and; (C) relating the strength index to predetermined set index of mortar or concrete compression strength.

    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to a method and apparatus for determining the compressive strength pathe of a mortar or concrete mix using the gas jet erosion resistance breakdown of freshly mixed mortar.
      <br/>
      Strength may be measured in various ways such as compression tensile or shear, compression being the most often specified.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Basically concrete is a crute material used in volume.
      <br/>
      Being crude a design strength is set for each type of concrete.
      <br/>
      Presently however control within this design strength is difficult and this difficulty is covered by an overdesign strength to the lowest reasonable level and in doing so to increase the workability which is of the utmost importance in itself.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Each batch of concrete, made up of its peculiar aggregate, fine aggregate, cement, water and additives assumes its peculiar strength increse path.
      <br/>
      These peculiar strength paths intertwine as they proceed.
      <br/>
      It is the control of these peculiar strength paths from variations from their peculiar strength paths thast allows the reduction in over design strength.
    </p>
    <p num="4">The use of this invention would appeal to:</p>
    <p num="5">
      Architects and Engineers who are charged with safety and costs of construction,
      <br/>
      Concrete suppliers who would have their production costs reduced and gain business resulting from lower prices and improved quality reliability, and
      <br/>
      Structure owners who would gain from improved quality and reduced costs of their structures.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">Accordingly this invention discloses an apparatus for determining the compressive strength path of a concete mix using the gas jet erosion resistance breakdown of freshly mixed mortar, said apparatus comprising a gas nozzle, a frame on which said nozzle is mounted and directed towards the surface of a test batch of said freshly mixed concrete, means on said frame for varying the distance of the nozzle from said surface, means for supplying gas to said nozzle through a range of pressures up to that necessary to effect erosion resistance breakdown of said surfacw and means for indicating the gas pressure supplied to said nozzle.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In another aspect this invention also discloses a method for determining the compressive strength path of a concrete mix, said method including:
      <br/>
      A.
      <br/>
      Conducting a series of tests which comprise
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      - directing a jet of gas at gradually increasing pressure onto the surface of a freshly mixed batch of said concrete.
      <br/>
      - Monitoring the surface of said concrete and recording the pressure of said gas jet at which erosion resistance of said concrete breaks down.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      B. Averaging the recorded gas pressure of said tests to obtain a strength index for said concrete mix, and
      <br/>
      C.
      <br/>
      Comparing said strength index to a predetermined set index of 3, 7, and 28 days compressive concete strength.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="10">
      Currently preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the attached drawings in which:
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of the aforementioned apparatus,
      <br/>
      FIGS. 2, 3 and 4 show schematic views of test samples before during and after the erosion breakdown process using the apparatus of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 5 and 6 show graphical respresentations of the test sample results.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="11">
      Referring first to FIG. 1 there is a compressior 1, comprssed air receiver 2, control valve 3, water extractor 4, pressure regulating valve 5, preesure guage 6, jet holder 7, test sample container 8 and test sample 9.
      <br/>
      The jet holder rides on the rim of the test sample container 8 which is parallel to its base which in turn is parallel to the surface 8A of the test sample 9.
      <br/>
      In this way the jet is directed normally to the test sample surface 8A.
      <br/>
      The jet is made to slide in the jet holder 7 to enable the jet to be set using a movable spacer to impinge on the surface.
      <br/>
      Unless stated to the contrary a 12 mm spacer is used.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Test sample container 8 is preferably made of plastic, though any material would be acceptable provided it is not prone to warping nor affecting the Test Sample 9.</p>
    <p num="13">Test Sample 9 height in the case of mortar may be say 12 mm and in the case of concretes say 3 *  the maximum size of the coarse aggregate.</p>
    <p num="14">Test Sample Container 8 must have sufficient depth to protect the air jet against surrounding air movement which might affect it.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Basiclly the procedure comprises directing a jet of gas onto the mortar surface of freshly mixed concrete, the jet being set at a fixed distance from and preferably normally to the surface after it has been freed from the effects of bleed water.
      <br/>
      The pressure is gradually increased until the erosion extends over a 15 mm diameter roughly circular area at which point air control valve is closed off and the reading on the pressure gage is recorded.
      <br/>
      The attached FIG. 2 shows the broken outline of a 15 mm diameter circle 10 encompassing an area free from surface defects and thus suitable for an erosion test, FIG. 3 shows the start of the erosion from the point of impingment 11 of the jet of air and FIG. 4 shows the full outline of the 15 mm diameter circle to which the erosion 12 has reached on closing off of the gas control valve.
      <br/>
      As will be seen from the adjoined test results produced in accordance with this invention the precision is unequalled by far when compared with any other tests in the mortar and concrete fields.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Experimentation has shown that for a single strength test of freshily mixed correctly apportioned concrete mortar it is necessary to produce an average of ten erosion tests.</p>
    <p num="17">Examples of these rare:</p>
    <p num="18">
      a. 55, 35, 40, 45, 42, 55, 40, 35, 50, 45=44.2 kPa average
      <br/>
      b. 165, 85, 280, 60, 115, 175, 160, 175, 120, 120=145.5 KPa average
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      This results from the crude nature of concrete and is covered by the design strength.
      <br/>
      The overall strength results from the inexact operation and is thus additional.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Each average is an index applicable to the concrete strength of its particular mix.
      <br/>
      If it is for example 10% above the set index the 3, 7 and 28 day strengths will each be 10% above.
      <br/>
      On the other hand if it is say 10% below the set index then the 3, 7, and 28 days strength will each be 10% lower.

    <p num="36">2.0 Having established the relation between the erosion resistance break down of the mortar of a concrete mixture on completion of mixing and the compressive strength of the same concrete at a later time, usually 28 days, the erosion resistance break down of the mortar of a succeeding concrete mixture made from similar materials can be used as a rapid means of determining whether or not the compressive strengths at the later time will be as required.</p>
    <p num="37">
      2.1 For example in FIG. 5 the dotted line to the right of the Mixture 1 solid line indicates a 10% increase in compressive strength each time--pressure being increased by 10%.

      3.0 For each peculiar mix and thus for its peculiar strength path to pass through the desired compressive strengths, a graph must be produced under laboratory conditions starting from the freshly mixed strength and based on the water/cement value.
      <br/>
      For this dry aggregate must be used.
      <br/>
      As indicated in Item 1 for each similar peculiar mix, depending on whether the freshly mixed strength is higher or lower the water/cement ratio may be raised or lowered to keep the production in reasonable compressive strength balance.

    <p num="40">
      3.1 Laboratory tests are usually performed at 22C whereas field tests take place over a wider temperature range.
      <br/>
      Thus for each peculiar mix its freshly mixed strength must be determined by the laboratory at say 32C, 27C, 17C and 12C and a graph provided.
      <br/>
      Lower temperature strengths will be lower than high temperature strengths and the graph will allow field operators to make the necessary temperature strength adjustments.

    <p num="41">4.0 FIELD MIXING AND DESPATCH FACILITY</p>
    <p num="42">
      Coarse and fine aggregates are stored in the open according to size, type and source, and may thus contain moisture.
      <br/>
      Cement and additives are stored under dry conditions according to the type and source.
      <br/>
      Water is sourced from the local potable supplies.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      5.0 Laboratory tests must be made from seperate samples sent from the field mixing and despatch facility prior to initial start-up of the facility production and as often thereafter as considered necessary.
      <br/>
      Materials must continue to be obtained from those sources to which laboratory test information refers.
      <br/>
      In the event of its being necessary to make a material change new laboratory test information must first be obtained and all relevant compartments cleaned out before introducing the new material.
      <br/>
      A freshly mixed strength must be determined by the facility on initial start-up for each mix to take into account moisture conditions in the materials stored in the open, and as often thereafter as found necessary.
      <br/>
      Continuously sourced materials may change as time goes on and this makes it necessary for the facility, if its tests appear to show that this may be happening to have the relevant laboratory tests repeated.
    </p>
    <p num="44">6.0 POSITIONS OF DISCHARGE</p>
    <p num="45">Freshly mixed strengths my be retaken at points of discharge from the information available and should there be anything untoward appropriate action can be taken.</p>
    <p num="46">
      7.0 From the forgoing it has been shown that each specific (peculiar) mix can have its own strength pedigree starting from the as mixed strengths at say 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes and 120 minutes after mixing and proceeding upwards through say 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days and onwards.
      <br/>
      Thus the ability to determine as mixed strengths in accordance with this invention is the key to the strength control of concrete structures.
      <br/>
      If the strength index of a mix is taken at say 30 minutes after mixing the workability limit might be set at say 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 120 minutes or 150 minutes after mixing.

    <p num="47">8.0 A PROCEDURE TO PREPARE A CONCRETE TEST SAMPLE FOR TESTING</p>
    <p num="48">
      a.
      <br/>
      Use a plastic container prefrerably circular with a turned over rim.
      <br/>
      In the making of the moulds in which there are made the base and the rim are parallel.
      <br/>
      b. Use a flat level surface onto which to drop the container when loaded with test material.
      <br/>
      The height of drop say 2 centimeters and the number of drop times may be varied to suit the material to be tested.
      <br/>
      This will bring sufficient mortar above the coarse aggregate to allow testing without unduly striking the coarse aggregate and will produce a certain amount of compaction.
      <br/>
      Before commencing the dropping action and at suitable times during the dropping action while the container is on the flat surface jerk the container to left and to right to assist in the action.
      <br/>
      c. After obtaining a suitable surface of mortar for testing allow the container to rest on the flat level surface until it's time for testing when it is placed in its position at the test instrument, which position is slightly canted towards the operator to allow the bleed water to remain in the lower part of the test area and thus permit testing in the upper part.
      <br/>
      In the event of striking an occasional piece of coarse aggregate discard the reading and make a replacement test for that reading.

      During this period the mortar is gradually gaining strength.

      When rain falls on the aggregates stored in the open it drains downwards fairly evenly in the case of coarse aggregate.
      <br/>
      This is not so in the case of fine aggregate and water retention builds up on its way to the bottom of the pile.
      <br/>
      For this reason it is necessary to determine the water contents at appropriate intervals.
      <br/>
      An easy way of doing this would be the use of a standard cement mixed with appropriate quantities of the dry aggregates and water for which a strength index is determined.

      Material--`Concrete Mix` (2.93 kg--6.47 lbs--Water addition--330 mls)
      <br/>
      MPa--25 at 28 days
      <br/>
      Temperature=21 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      Spacing--24 mm between jet and test material, i.e. 2 * previous spacing
      <br/>
      Time--30 minutes after mixing (water addition)
      <br/>
      - 140, 100, 80, 83, 97, 140, 92, 130, 142, 150, average=115.4
    </p>
    <p num="64">-  60 minutes after mixing (water addition) 180, 140, 138, 130, 124, 225, 160, 150, 160, 110, average 151.7</p>

      It will thus be appreciated that this invention at least in the form of the embodiment disclosed provides a novel and useful procedure for determining the strength path of a mortar or concrete mix using the gas jet erosion resistance breakdown of freshly mixed mortar.
      <br/>
      Clearly however the examples described are only the currently preferred forms of this invention and a wide variety of modifications may be made which would be apparent to a person skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For example the design of the various components shown in FIGS. 1 to 3 may be changed according to application.
      <br/>
      The invention is also not limited to any particular sensing device for detecting and amplifying the gas jet rupture noise of the mortar surface,
