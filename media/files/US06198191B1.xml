      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="4">The present invention relates generally to alternators and methods for producing alternators, and more particularly, but not by way of limitation, to an improved alternator having a higher electrical current output at low speeds of revolutions and having an improved battery terminal assembly and to methods of producing such an improved alternator.</p>
    <p num="5">2. Brief Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="6">
      Alternators for vehicles are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      The prior art alternators, such as the CS-130 alternator manufactured by General Motors, are presently provided with a housing defining an alternator interior space adapted to receive a rotor having a rotor coil.
      <br/>
      The rotor coil is rotated by the vehicle's engine and generates a moving magnetic field which induces an alternating current in three-phase stator windings disposed near the rotor coil.
      <br/>
      The speed at which the rotor coil rotates and the intensity of the rotor coil's magnetic field determine the voltage and current characteristics of the electricity generated by the prior art alternator.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Because the vehicle's engine speed varies considerably under normal driving conditions, the prior art alternators are provided with a voltage regulator which controls the intensity of the magnetic field generated by the rotor coil so that the alternator's output voltage remains within predefined limits.
      <br/>
      However, as the engine speed varies, the current of the electricity produced by the alternator also varies.
      <br/>
      That is, as the engine speed is reduced the electrical current produced by the prior art alternators is also reduced, and as the engine speed is increased the electrical current produced by the prior art alternators is also increased.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The output of the prior art alternators is electrically connected to the battery and electrical system of the vehicle to recharge the battery and to meet the current demands of the electrical system.
      <br/>
      However, if the prior art alternators are not generating a sufficient amount of electrical current to meet the demands of the electrical system then such electrical system draws electrical current from the battery to meet this deficiency.
      <br/>
      Because excess use of the battery shortens the useful life of same, it is undesirable for the battery to supply electrical current to the electrical system except during starting.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The prior art alternators typically produce a sufficient amount of electrical current to effectively charge the battery and to meet the demands of the electrical system when the prior art alternators are operating at high speeds.
      <br/>
      However, when the prior art alternators are operating at idle or low speeds, the prior art alternators produce an insufficient amount of electrical current to meet the demands of the electrical system.
      <br/>
      Thus, the battery supplies electrical current to the electrical system when the engine is operating at low speeds which shortens the useful life of the battery.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The voltage regulators of the prior art alternators are typically disposed in the alternator interior space of the housing where they are subjected to both external and internal heat.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the number one cause of alternator failure is an overheated voltage regulator.
      <br/>
      The external heat described above is supplied to the voltage regulator by the engine and the internal heat described above is supplied to the voltage regulator by the electric current flowing through the voltage regulator.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      While these prior art voltage regulators maintain the alternator's output within predefined limits, heat sinks provided on the back plate of the regulator do not effectively transfer the external and internal heat away from the voltage regulator.
      <br/>
      Thus, the voltage regulator overheats and is either destroyed or caused to malfunction.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      To supply electricity to the rotor coil of the prior art alternators so that the rotor coil can generate the moving magnetic field, the rotor is provided with a pair of slip rings which are adapted to mate against a pair of corresponding brushes.
      <br/>
      The prior art alternators are provided with a brush assembly which includes a brush housing having a pair of brush chambers formed therein.
      <br/>
      A cylindrically shaped brush spring and one of the brushes is disposed in each of the brush chambers such that the spring force of each brush spring forces one of the brushes against the corresponding slip ring of the rotor.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Upon assembly of the prior art alternators, a portion of the brush may be inadvertently locked between one of the loops of the brush spring and the brush housing thereby preventing the brush spring from forcing the brush against the slip ring of the rotor coil.
      <br/>
      Thus, electricity is not supplied to the rotor coil and the alternator malfunctions.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The brushes in the prior art alternator are electrically connected to their respective electrical field circuits provided externally of the brush housing by flexible braided wires extending from the respective brushes to the field circuit connections.
      <br/>
      Because the brush housings of the prior art alternators provide no guarding or channeling mechanisms for the braided wires, these wires can be pinched, trapped, severed or otherwise damaged.
      <br/>
      If any of these conditions occur, the electrical connection to the field circuit can be lost and the prior art alternator will fail.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In addition, the prior art alternators are provided with a rectifier which rectifies the output of the alternator.
      <br/>
      The rectifier has a conductive surface with an opening formed therethrough.
      <br/>
      The voltage regulator of the prior art alternators is provided with a conductive surface which has an opening formed therethrough.
      <br/>
      The conductive surface of the voltage regulator is adapted to mate against the conductive surface of the rectifier such that the opening in the voltage regulator is aligned with the opening in the rectifier and such that electrical current flows between the conductive surfaces.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The voltage regulator and the rectifier are disposed in the alternator interior space of the housing of the alternator and a bolt is inserted through a plastic insulator, an opening formed in the housing of the alternator and the aligned openings in the voltage regulator and the rectifier such that a threaded end of the bolt extends from the voltage regulator into the alternator interior space.
      <br/>
      A nut is disposed on the threaded end of the bolt and is tightened to clamp the voltage regulator and the rectifier to the housing and to simultaneously clamp the mating conductive surfaces of the voltage regulator and the rectifier together.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      However, the clamp formed from the nut and the bolt must be maintained at a precise predetermined tension.
      <br/>
      When the clamp is too loose, a gap forms between the mating conducting surfaces of the voltage regulator and the rectifier.
      <br/>
      Electricity arcs across the gap and generates heat which can overheat the voltage regulator, the rectifier and/or the battery.
      <br/>
      When the clamp is too tight, the plastic insulator can break or crack and then the clamp becomes too loose and excess heat is generated as previously discussed.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The voltage regulator of the prior art alternator is provided with an electronic switch for controlling the field current in the rotor of the alternator.
      <br/>
      If a fault such as a short circuit occurs in the rotor, the current through the electronic switch increases significantly.
      <br/>
      This increased current can destroy the electronic switch and generate excess heat.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Finally, the prior art voltage regulators control a lamp in the automobile's dash for communicating an alternator failure to a driver.
      <br/>
      Conventionally, the means for controlling the lamp was disposed internally in the logic control unit.
      <br/>
      The logic control unit was destroyed in the event of a lamp short caused by the insulation being rubbed off a wire, or the incorrect wiring of the automobile or in the event that the ignition key was left in the lamp on-engine off position for an extended period of time, for example.
      <br/>
      This was costly in terms of dollars and inconvenience to the user.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      To this end, a need has long existed for an improved alternator with a higher electrical current output at low speeds of revolutions and with increased heat dissipation qualities and decreased heat generation qualities.
      <br/>
      It is to such an improved alternator that the present invention is directed.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="23">
      Referring now to the drawings and in particular to FIG. 1, a typical prior art or existing CS-130 alternator for use in a vehicle (not shown) is depicted.
      <br/>
      The prior art alternator 10 is provided with a housing 12 (FIG. 1) defining an alternator interior space 14.
      <br/>
      The housing 12 is provided with a drive end housing 16 and a slip ring end housing 18.
      <br/>
      The drive end housing 16 is provided with a plurality of air vents 20 formed therethrough and the slip ring end housing 18 is provided with a plurality of air vents 22 formed therethrough so that air can flow into the alternator interior space 14 through the air vents 22 in the slip ring end housing 18 and out of the alternator interior space 14 through the air vents 20 in the drive end housing 16.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The alternator interior space 14 of the housing 12 is adapted to receive a rotor 24 having a drive shaft 26.
      <br/>
      The drive end housing 16 is provided with a bearing well 28 adapted to receive a drive end bearing 30 for rotatably supporting one end of the drive shaft 26 of the rotor 24.
      <br/>
      The slip ring end housing 18 is provided with a bearing well 32 adapted to receive a slip ring end bearing 34 for rotatably supporting the other end of the drive shaft 26 of the rotor 24.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The housing of the prior art alternator has a first side 36, a second side 38, a top end 40, a bottom end 42, a predetermined length 44, a predetermined width 46, and a predetermined height 48.
      <br/>
      The predetermined length 44 of the housing 12 extends generally between an outermost portion of the bearing well 28 of the drive end housing 16 and an outermost portion of the bearing well 32 of the slip ring end housing 18.
      <br/>
      The predetermined width 46 of the housing 12 extends generally between the first side 36 and the second side 38 thereof.
      <br/>
      The predetermined height 48 of the housing 12 extends generally between the top end 40 and the bottom end 42 thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In an installed position, the prior art alternator 10 is disposed in a predetermined alternator space (not shown) within the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The alternator space has a predetermined length, a predetermined width and a predetermined height which correspond to the length 44, width 46, and height 48, respectively, of the prior art alternator 10.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The rotor 24 (FIG. 1) of the prior art alternator 10 is provided with a rotor coil 50 in which a magnetic field is generated.
      <br/>
      The prior art alternator 10 is provided with a stator assembly 52 (FIG. 1) which surrounds the rotor coil 50 and is positioned in the magnetic field generated by the rotor coil 50.
      <br/>
      The stator assembly 52 has a plurality of stator windings 54 wound about a stator lamination 56, typically in a three-phase configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The rotor coil 50 is rotated by the automobile's engine via the drive shaft 26 of the rotor 24 so that a current is induced in the stator windings 54 such that the prior art alternator 10 generates electricity.
      <br/>
      A voltage regulator 58 (FIG. 1) is provided in the alternator interior space 14 of the housing 12 and is electrically connected to the rotor coil 50 via slip rings 60 provided on the drive shaft 26 of the rotor 24 for controlling the intensity of the magnetic field generated by the rotor coil 50 such that the voltage output of the alternator 10 is maintained within predefined limits.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B is an exploded view of a replacement alternator 70 which is constructed to replace the prior art CS-130 alternator 10 in the vehicle (not shown) where the existing CS-130 alternator 10 was disposed in the predetermined alternator space within the vehicle as discussed previously.
      <br/>
      In other words, the replacement alternator 70 has a predetermined length (not shown), a predetermined width (not shown) and a predetermined height (not shown) which are substantially identical in magnitude as the length 44, width 46, and height 48 of the prior art alternator 10.
      <br/>
      The replacement alternator 70 of the present invention provides a stabilized current output of at least about 43 amperes at about 1600 RPMs and typically outputs about 26 percent more electrical current at about 1600 RPMs than the prior art alternator 10 discussed above which permits the replacement alternator 70 of the present invention to meet or exceed the demands of the electrical system of the vehicle at low or idle speeds of the replacement alternator 70.
      <br/>
      Thus, the replacement alternator 70 of the present invention extends the useful life of the battery of the vehicle and thereby represents an advance in the state of the art relating to alternators for use in vehicles.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the phrase "about 43 amperes" as used herein means an electrical current reading from about 41 amperes to about 45 amperes depending on the particular test stand which is being used to test the alternator 70.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The alternator 70 includes a drive end housing 72 (FIG. 2A) and a slip ring end housing 74 (FIG. 2B) which cooperate to form a housing.
      <br/>
      The drive end housing 72 and the slip ring end housing 74 define an alternator interior space 76 adapted to receive a rotor assembly 78 (FIGS. 2A and 3) which is constructed in accordance with the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The rotor assembly 78 is shown in more detail in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Referring now to FIG. 2A in combination with FIG. 3, the rotor assembly is provided with a drive shaft 80 having a drive end 82 and a slip ring end 84.
      <br/>
      A first hub 86 and a second hub 88 are fixedly secured to the drive shaft 80 in a spaced-apart relation.
      <br/>
      The first and second hubs 86 and 88 have a substantially similar diameter 90 which is typically about 95.91 millimeters to about 96.07 millimeters.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The rotor assembly 78 is provided with a plurality of circumferentially spaced first claw-pole fingers 92 which are supported by the first hub 86 and which extend from the first hub 86 towards the second hub 88.
      <br/>
      Only two of the first claw-pole fingers are labeled in FIG. 3 as 92a and 92b for purposes of clarity.
      <br/>
      The first claw-pole fingers 92 are constructed of a magnetically permeable material.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The rotor assembly 78 is further provided with a plurality of circumferentially spaced second claw-pole fingers 94 which are supported by the second hub 88 and which extend from the second hub 88 towards the first hub 86 such that the second claw-pole fingers 94 are interleaved with the first claw-pole fingers 92.
      <br/>
      Only two of the second claw pole fingers are labeled in FIG. 3 as 94a and 94b for purposes of clarity.
      <br/>
      The second claw-pole fingers 94 are constructed of a magnetically permeable material.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      A rotor coil form 96 is fixedly supported by the drive shaft 80 of the rotor assembly 78 and is disposed generally between the first hub 86 and the second hub 88.
      <br/>
      The rotor coil form 96 is disposed radially intermediate or below the first and second claw-pole fingers 92 and 94.
      <br/>
      A rotor fan 98 is disposed on the drive shaft 80 and is connected to the second hub 88 of the rotor assembly 78.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The rotor coil form 96 is wound with a suitable length of wire 100 thereby forming a rotor coil.
      <br/>
      The rotor coil form 96 can be wound with between about 320 to about 340 turns of about 18 to about 20 gauge wire, and is desirably wound with between about 325 to about 338 turns of about 19 gauge wire and is more desirably wound with about 335 turns of about 19 gauge wire.
      <br/>
      The rotor coil form 96 can be wound with a GP-200 insulated copper magnet wire obtainable from Essex Group, Inc., of Fort Wayne, Ind.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      It should be noted that the rotor coil form 96 of the present invention is wound with about 17 additional turns or windings of wire of a slightly larger gauge as the wire wound on the rotor coil form of the prior art alternator 10.
      <br/>
      These additional turns or windings of wire have contributed to the increased electrical output of the alternator 70 of the present invention and lower field current.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Winding systems and services for winding the wire 100 about the rotor coil form 96 are available from BACHI, L. P., Itasca, Ill.</p>
    <p num="38">To supply electricity to the wire 100 which is wound about the rotor coil form 96 so that the wire 100 generates a rotating magnetic field as the rotor assembly 78 rotates, the rotor assembly 78 is provided with a pair of slip rings 102 and 104 which are electrically connected to the wire 100 and which are disposed on the drive shaft 80, near the slip ring end 84 thereof.</p>
    <p num="39">
      To supply electricity to the slip rings 102 and 104 of the rotor assembly 78, the alternator 70 is provided with a brush assembly 106 (FIGS. 2B and 4) which is disposed in the alternator interior space 76 formed by the drive end housing 72 and the slip ring end housing 74.
      <br/>
      The brush assembly 106 includes a first brush 108 and a second brush 110.
      <br/>
      In an assembled condition of the alternator 70, the first brush 108 slidingly engages the slip ring 102 and the second brush 110 slidingly engages the slip ring 104 so as to provide electricity to the wire 100 which is wound about the rotor coil form 96.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The brush assembly 106 is shown in more detail in FIGS. 4A and 4B. Referring now to FIG. 2B in combination with FIGS. 4A and 4B, the brush assembly 106 is provided with a brush housing 111 having a first end 112, a second end 113, and a pair of brush chambers 114a and 114b.
      <br/>
      The brush chambers 114a and 114b openly communicate with the first end 112 of the brush housing 111 and extend into the brush housing 111 from the first end 112 thereof generally toward the second end 113 thereof.
      <br/>
      The brush assembly 106 is provided with two rigid conductors 115a and 115b matingly disposed on at least a portion of the exterior of the brush housing 111.
      <br/>
      Each of the rigid conductors 115a and 115b is provided with a first terminal end 116a and 116b, respectively, and a second terminal end 117a and 117b, respectively.
      <br/>
      The first terminal ends 116a and 116b of the rigid conductors 115a and 115b are each electrically connected to respective brushes 108 and 110 via flexible conductors 118a (not shown) and 118b.
      <br/>
      The first terminal ends 116a and 116b are identical in construction.
      <br/>
      The second terminal ends 117a and 117b are electrically connected to terminals (not shown) provided on the replacement alternator 70 in a similar manner as terminals (not shown) are provided on the prior art alternator 10 for supplying electrical power to the brushes 108 and 110 of the brush assembly 106.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The brush housing 111 is further provided with a backplate 121 disposed through a backplate opening 119 located near the second end 113 of the brush housing 111.
      <br/>
      The backplate 121 serves to substantially cover the brush chambers 114a and 114b near the second end 113 of the brush housing 111 and to maintain the rigid conductors 115a and 115b on the brush housing 111.
      <br/>
      The backplate 121 can be secured to the brush housing 111 via snaps (not shown) or any other means capable of maintaining the backplate 121 on the brush housing 111.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The brush assembly 106 is further provided with a pair of brush springs 120.
      <br/>
      Only one of the brush springs 120 is depicted in FIG. 4A for purposes of clarity.
      <br/>
      The brush spring 120 is shown in more detail in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The brush spring 120 has an intrinsic spring force, a first end 122, a second end 124 and an opening 125 extending therebetween.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Referring to FIGS. 4A and 4C in combination with FIG. 5, one of the brush springs 120 is disposed between the first terminal end 116b and the brush 110, and another one of the brush springs 120 is disposed between the first terminal end 116a and the brush 108.
      <br/>
      The flexible conductors 118a and 118b connecting the first terminal ends 116a and 116b to the brushes 108 and 110, respectively, extend through the openings 125 formed through the brush springs 120.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      As shown in FIG. 5, the brush spring 120 can be characterized as having a first end portion 126, a second end portion 128, and a medial portion 130.
      <br/>
      The first end portion 126 extends a predetermined distance from the first end 122 towards the second end 124.
      <br/>
      The medial portion 130 extends a predetermined distance from the first end portion 126 towards the second end 124.
      <br/>
      The second end portion 128 extends a predetermined distance from the medial portion 130 to the second end 124.
      <br/>
      The medial portion 130 of the brush spring 120 has a substantially uniform diameter 132.
      <br/>
      The first end portion 126 of the brush spring 120 tapers radially inwardly towards the first end 122 of the brush spring 120, and the second end portion 128 of the brush spring 120 tapers radially inwardly towards the second end 124 thereof such that the first end 122 and the second end 124 have a diameter 134 which is less than the diameter 132 of the medial portion 130.
      <br/>
      Each of the brush springs 120 is disposed in one of the brush chambers 114a and 114b (FIG. 4A) of the brush housing ill such that the first end 122 of the brush spring 120 is disposed in close proximity to the first end 112 of the brush housing 111.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      To assemble the brush assembly 106, one end of the flexible conductor 118b is connected to the brush 110 (FIG. 4C).
      <br/>
      The other end of the flexible conductor 118b is then disposed through the opening 125 in the brush spring 120 such that at least a portion of the flexible conductor 118b protrudes from the end of the brush spring 120 opposite the brush 110.
      <br/>
      The protruding end of the flexible conductor 118b is then connected to the first terminal end 116b of the rigid conductor 115b via soldering or welding, for example.
      <br/>
      The brush 110 and the brush spring 120 are then inserted into the brush chamber 114b through the second end 113 of the brush housing 111 until an upper end 136b of the first terminal end 116b is disposed in a recess 138b provided in the brush housing 111.
      <br/>
      The above described procedure is then repeated to connect the brush 108 to the first terminal end 116a of the rigid conductor 115a to permit electrical communication therebetween.
      <br/>
      Once the brushes 108 and 110 and brush springs 120 are assembled and disposed in respective brush chambers 114a and 114b, the backplate 121 is slid through the backplate opening 119 provided near the second end 113 of the brush housing 111 to maintain the rigid conductors 115a and 115b in place.
    </p>
    <p num="46">Once each of the brush springs 120 is disposed in one of the brush chambers 114a and 114b, each of the first and second brushes 108, 110 can reciprocate in respective brush chambers 114a and 114b of the brush housing 111 against the spring force of the brush spring 120 such that the first end 122 of one of the brush springs 120 engages the first brush 108, for example, and urges at least a portion of the first brush 108 beyond the first end 112 of the brush housing 111, as depicted in FIG. 4A.</p>
    <p num="47">
      It should be noted that the tapering of the brush spring 120 throughout the first end portion 126 thereof prevents the first and second brushes 108 and 110 from being inadvertently locked between one of the loops of the brush spring 120 and the brush housing 111.
      <br/>
      The first and second brushes 108 and 110 can be the brushes which are utilized in an existing CS-130 alternator, such as the alternator 10.
      <br/>
      In addition, the rigid conductors 115a and 115b extending exteriorly of the brush housing 111 are an improvement over the prior art brush housings (not shown) having the exteriorly extending flexible conductors in that the rigid conductors 115a and 115b are much more resistant to the problems of pinching and cutting of the flexible conductors, as hereinbefore described.
      <br/>
      Thus, the replacement alternator 70 having the brush housing 111 and the brush spring 120 is more reliable than the prior art alternator 10.

      The slip ring end housing 74 is connected to the drive end housing 72 so as to sandwich the stator assembly 170 therebetween via a plurality of mounting bolts 358.

    <p num="93">The power output of the replacement alternator 70 of the present invention and the prior art alternator 10 were tested and the results of such tests are depicted in the graph set forth as FIG. 17. The test data obtained on the prior art alternator 10 are represented in FIG. 17 by the dashed lines and the test data obtained on the replacement alternator 70 are represented in FIG. 17 by the solid lines.</p>
    <p num="94">
      Initially, the replacement alternator 70 and the prior art alternator 10 were operated at a speed of about 5000 RPMs at a substantially uniform output voltage of about 13 volts for a period of time sufficient to stabilize the output current of such alternators (about 10 minutes).
      <br/>
      The replacement alternator 70 and the prior art alternator 10 were then selectively operated at speeds of: 1600 RPMs; 1800 RPMs; 2000 RPMs; 2500 RPMs; 4000 RPMs; and 6500 RPMs.
      <br/>
      The output currents of the alternators 10 and 70 were obtained at each of the speeds while the output voltages of such alternators were maintained at 13 volts.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      As depicted in FIG. 17, at a speed of about 1600 RPMs the output current of the replacement alternator 70 was 49 amperes whereas the output current of the prior art alternator 10 was 39 amperes.
      <br/>
      Thus, the current output of the replacement alternator 70 is about 26% greater than the current output of the prior art alternator 10 when such alternators are operated at a speed of about 1600 RPMs, which shows a substantial unexpected improvement over the prior art alternator 10.
      <br/>
      The replacement alternator 70 provides a stabilized current output of at least about 43 amperes in the stator windings 174 at about 1600 revolutions per minute of the rotor coil form 96.
      <br/>
      The determination of the current induced in the stator windings 174 can vary depending on the particular test stand utilized.
      <br/>
      Thus, it should be understood that the term "about 43 amperes" refers to a current output range varying between about 41 amperes to about 45 amperes.

      Shown in FIG. 18 is the circuitry for one embodiment of the voltage regulator 260 utilized by the replacement alternator 70 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The voltage regulator 260 of the replacement alternator 70 is provided with a logic control unit 380 and an electronic switch 382.
      <br/>
      The logic control unit 380 has a local sense input 384 and an output 386.
      <br/>
      The electronic switch 382 has an input 388 and an output 390.
      <br/>
      The output 386 of the logic control unit 380 is electrically connected to the input 388 of the electronic switch 382 via a resistor 392.
      <br/>
      The voltage regulator 260 which receives signals indicative of the alternator output voltage via the local sense input 384.
      <br/>
      In response thereto, the output 386 of the logic control unit 380 outputs signals indicative of predefined voltage regulation requirements to be received by the electronic switch 382.
      <br/>
      The output 390 of the electronic switch 382 is electrically connected to the wire 100 wound on the rotor coil form 96 via the field terminal 394.
      <br/>
      When the logic control unit 380 outputs signals to the electronic switch 382 indicative that the automobile requires more power, the electronic switch 382 increases the flow of current to the wire 100 wound on the rotor coil form 96 via field terminal 394 thereby increasing the intensity of the magnetic field and increasing the voltage which the replacement alternator 70 outputs.
      <br/>
      When the logic control unit 380 outputs signals to the electronic switch 382 indicative that the automobile requires less power, the electronic switch 382 decreases the flow of current to the wire 100 wound on the rotor coil form 96, thereby decreasing the intensity of the magnetic field and decreasing the voltage which the replacement alternator 70 outputs.
      <br/>
      The logic control unit 380 is typically an integrated circuit, such as an MC33092DW, obtainable from Motorola, Inc.
      <br/>
      However, it should be understood that the logic control unit 380 can be any circuit capable of functioning as a logic control unit, such as a suitably programmed microprocessor.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      The electronic switch 382 of the voltage regulator 260 can be any electronic switch capable of controlling the current supplied to the wire 100 wound on the rotor coil form 96 such as a transistor, a JFET, a MOSFET, a relay or the like.
      <br/>
      However, the electronic switch 382 is typically a MOSFET having a low saturation voltage and a low on resistance so that the internal heat created by the electronic switch 382 is minimized.
      <br/>
      The saturation voltage of the electronic switch 382 is less than about 0.7 volts at 5 amperes and is desirably less than about 0.3 volts at 5 amperes.
      <br/>
      The on resistance of the electronic switch 382 is typically 0.045 ohms.
      <br/>
      The electronic switch 382 can be an MTD20N06HD, obtainable from Motorola, Inc.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      The voltage regulator 260 is further provided with a shorted field protection circuit 396 connected in parallel with the electronic switch 382.
      <br/>
      The shorted field protection circuit 396 functions to turn off the electronic switch 382 in the event of a fault in the wire 100 wound on the rotor coil form 96 to prevent the electronic switch 382 from being damaged thereby.
      <br/>
      The shorted field protection circuit 396 is connected to the positive power terminal 262 and is provided with a resistor 398, a resistor 400, a resistor 402, a resistor 404, a resistor 406, a resistor 408, an electronic switch 410, an electronic switch 412, and an electronic switch 414 connected substantially as shown in the drawings.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the shorted field protection circuit 396 is connected between the positive power terminal 262 and the ground terminal 264 substantially as shown in FIG. 18.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      When the wire 100 wound on the rotor coil form 96 is in a non-shorted condition such that the replacement alternator 70 is operating normally, the electronic switch 382 is in an on condition, the electronic switch 410 is in an on condition, the electronic switch 412 is in an off condition, and the electronic switch 414 is in an off condition.
      <br/>
      However, if a fault such as a short circuit occurs in the wire 100 wound on the rotor coil form 96, the current in the wire 100 increases.
      <br/>
      As the current in the wire 100 increases, the current passing through the electronic switch 382 increases causing the voltage across the electronic switch 410 to increase correspondingly.
      <br/>
      As the voltage across the electronic switch 410 increases, the voltage across the resistor 402 also increases.
      <br/>
      When the voltage across the resistor 402 exceeds a predetermined threshold, the increased voltage causes the electronic switch 412 to be switched to an on condition whereby current flows through the electronic switch 412.
      <br/>
      The current flowing through the electronic switch 412 causes the voltage to increase above a predetermined threshold on the base of the electronic switch 414 to switch the electronic switch 414 to an on condition.
      <br/>
      When the electronic switch 414 is switched to the on condition, the voltage on the output 386 of the logic control unit 380 is almost grounded.
      <br/>
      In the meantime, the voltage on the input 388 of the electronic switch 382 is decreased below a predetermined threshold so as to switch the electronic switch 382 off.
      <br/>
      Thus, the shorted field protection circuit 396 functions to sense the increase in current passing through the wire 100 and when the current passing through the wire 100 exceeds a predetermined threshold of typically about 14 amperes, the shorted field protection circuit 396 switches the electronic switch 382 to an off or non-conducting condition so that the electronic switch 382 is not damaged by the occurrence of the fault in the wire 100.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      Once the fault or shorted condition is removed in the wire 100, the voltage across the resistor 402 is decreased.
      <br/>
      This decreased voltage causes the electronic switch 412 to be switched to an off condition whereby current does not flow therethrough.
      <br/>
      This causes the voltage on the base of the electronic switch 414 to be decreased below a predetermined threshold so as to switch the electronic switch 414 to an off or non-conducting condition.
      <br/>
      When the electronic switch 414 is switched to the off or non-conducting condition, this causes the voltage on the output 386 of the logic control unit 380 to return to a normal condition, and the voltage on the input 388 of the electronic switch 382 to increase above a predetermined threshold to switch the electronic switch 382 to the on or conducting condition.
      <br/>
      Thus, the shorted field protection circuit 396 senses when the fault or short circuit is removed in the wire 100 and switches the electronic switch 382 back to the on or conducting condition to re-establish current in the wire 100.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      It should be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the electronic switch 382 and the shorted field protection circuit 396 are disposed exteriorly of the logic control unit 380 between the positive power terminal 262 (the positive power terminal 262 is commonly referred to in the art as "B+") and the ground terminal 264.
      <br/>
      The electronic switch 382 being disposed between the positive power terminal 262 and the wire 100 being connected to the ground terminal 264 (as shown in FIG. 18) is commonly referred to in the art as a "high side drive".
      <br/>
      The shorted field protection circuit 396 is adapted to work with alternators having a "high side drive".

    <p num="102">
      The voltage regulator 260 is further provided with a shorted lamp protection circuit 418 disposed externally of the logic control unit 380, substantially as shown in FIG. 18 for protecting the voltage regulator 260 so that the voltage regulator 260 can operate continuously under a shorted lamp condition.
      <br/>
      The shorted lamp protection circuit 418 is connected to an ignition terminal 419 (provided as a plug connection on the voltage regulator 260 in a manner well known in the art) via a current limiting means such as a resistor 420.
      <br/>
      The ignition terminal 419 is connected to an ignition switch (not shown) provided in the dash of the automobile via a signal path (not shown).
      <br/>
      The shorted lamp protection circuit 418 is also connected to a lamp terminal 421 which is connected to an indicator lamp 422 provided in the dash of the automobile via the signal path 422a.
      <br/>
      The shorted lamp protection circuit 418 is provided with a resistor 423, a resistor 424, a resistor 426, an electronic switch 428, and an electronic switch 430.
      <br/>
      The lamp terminal 421 inputs a substantially continuous signal of about 14v to the electronic switch 428 via the resistor 424 when the ignition switch 431 is in a closed condition.
      <br/>
      To turn the lamp 422 on to indicate a fault in the charging system of the automobile, such as when the alternator 70 has failed, or when the ignition switch 431 on the automobile is in a "key on-engine off" position, the logic control unit 380 outputs signals over the signal path 432 so as to turn the electronic switch 428 to an on or conducting condition to permit current to flow between the resistor 424 and the electronic switch 430 to bias the base of the electronic switch 430 above a predetermined threshold to switch the electronic switch 430 to an on or conducting condition.
      <br/>
      When the electronic switch 430 is switched to the on or conducting condition, current flows through the lamp 422, the resistor 426, and the electronic switch 430.
    </p>
    <p num="103">It should be noted that the resistor 426 functions as a current limiting means so that the electronic switch 430 is not destroyed by over current in the event that the lamp 422 is in an on condition and the lamp 422 is shorted to the positive power terminal 262 ("B+") or the signal paths 419a and 422a are shorted such as when the insulation on the signals paths 419a and/or 422a is rubbed through to expose a bare conductor or the lamp 422, or the signal paths 419a and 422a were incorrectly switched or exchanged when the automobile was manufactured.</p>
