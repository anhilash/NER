      A catalyst for the polymerization of vinylaromatic monomers, and particularly styrene, with a high yield and a high syndiotacticity index, comprises the product consisting of the following two components in contact with each other:A) an eta5-cyclopentadienyl complex of titanium;B) an organo-oxygenated compound of aluminum;and contains a sufficient amount of at least one carboxylated product having the following general formula:wherein R-COO is a carboxylic group comprising the organic radical R having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, and G represents a hydrogen atom, an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms or a metal atom, possibly substituted, linked to said carboxylic group.
    </p>
  </abstract>
  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a catalyst and a process for the syndiotactic polymerization of vinylaromatic compounds.</p>
    <p num="2">More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of highly syndiotactic polymers of compounds having a primary vinyl group bound to an aromatic ring, especially styrene monomers, by polymerizing these latter in the presence of a metallocene catalyst.</p>
    <p num="3">
      As is known, polymers of styrene, and particularly polystyrene, are thermoplastic materials which can be obtained with high molecular weights.
      <br/>
      Their thermal resistance, adaptability to various hot moulding techniques and excellent insulating properties, make them particularly suitable for the production of extruded, moulded or expanded articles which can be used mainly in the fields of sound and thermal insulation and as dielectric materials.
      <br/>
      Polystyrene can be obtained by the radicalic, cationic or anionic polymerization of styrene.
      <br/>
      The polymer which can be obtained radicalically, which is the one prevalently used, is an amorphous material which shows an 1 H-NMR spectrum with wide and poorly defined bands in the chemical shift zone relating to protons of aliphatic --CH&lt; and --CH2 -- groups, coherent with a statistic distribution in the polymeric chain of monomeric units having a different steric configuration (atactic structure).
      <br/>
      These amorphous styrene polymers, which are transparent and relatively inexpensive, have various applications but are limited to use within a relatively limited temperature range owing to the low glass transition temperature (Tg) which is slightly less than 100 (degree)  C. for the polystyrene homopolymer.
      <br/>
      As is known, in fact, around and above this temperature there is a softening of the polymer with a drastic deterioration in all the mechanical properties.
    </p>
    <p num="4">The normal techniques of anionic and cationic polymerization also lead to the production of a substantially amorphous polymer although, in some cases, the presence of short syndiotactic sequences of the monomeric units have been observed.</p>
    <p num="5">It is also known that crystalline polystyrene, prevalently isotactic, can be obtained by the stereospecific polymerization of styrene in the presence of Ziegler-Natta type catalysts, which are normally based on the combination of a halogenated compound of a transition metal with an alkyl derivative of aluminum, possibly with the addition of an electron-donor compound (Lewis base) to favour steric control.</p>
    <p num="6">
      A detailed description of the methods for obtaining isotactic polystyrene can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,161,624 and 2,882,263.
      <br/>
      This material, although potentially of great industrial interest, has never been widely distributed owing to its extremely slow and difficult crystallization, which is unacceptable in normal moulding and forming technologies.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      European patent application publication number 210,615 describes a polystyrene having a structure characterized by a high degree of stereoregularity, in which the monomeric units have a regularly alternating configuration, thus producing a polymer with a syndiotactic structure.
      <br/>
      This material does not have the above disadvantages of atactic or isotactic polystyrene; it is a material which crystallizes rapidly, having a high melting point generally between 250 and 275 (degree)  C., and can be oriented during transformation processes, producing end-products with excellent thermal resistance and resistance to organic solvents.
      <br/>
      These properties produce a material of great technological interest, comparable to thermoplastic technopolymers such as polyesters, polyamides, polyimides, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Syndiotactic polystyrene can be prepared according to what is prepared in literature, for example, in accordance with what is described in the above European patent application, as well as in European patent application EP 272,584 and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,978,730. These preparation methods comprise the polymerization of styrene (or other styrene monomers) in bulk or in solution of an inert solvent such as toluene, at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 150 (degree)  C., in the presence of a catalytic system obtained from the combination of a compound of a transition metal, normally selected from Ti, Zr, Hf, V or Ni, and an organo-oxygenated compound of aluminum, normally consisting of aluminoxane.
      <br/>
      Among the compounds of transition metals described in the art, halides, alcoholates, acetylacetonates and complexes containing at least one  ETA 5 -cyclopentadienyl ring coordinated to the metal (metallocenes), are preferably used.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Other catalytic systems suitable for the purpose are those described in published European application 421,659, consisting of compounds of boron containing fluorinated groups.</p>
    <p num="10">The tacticity index (syndio) specified in literature in the specific case of polystyrene, expressed as a weight percentage of polymer insoluble in methylethylketone at boiling point, is between 92 and 97% at best.</p>
    <p num="11">
      Another measure commonly used for expressing the (syndio) tacticity index is the percentage of syndiotactic dyads which can be revealed by 13 C-NMR spectroscopy.
      <br/>
      The latter index may be different from the former, for instance in case of stereoblock polymers.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The mechanical, chemical and thermal properties of syndiotactic polystyrene largely depend on the percentage of stereoregularity of the polymer (syndiotacticity index).
      <br/>
      Percentages of soluble polymer of more than 2% by weight are generally sufficient to give it unsatisfactory characteristics especially in relation to resistance to organic solvents (mineral oils, oxygenated solvents) and thermal resistance.
      <br/>
      Syndiotactic polystyrenes with syndiotacticity indexes of more than 99% can normally be obtained only after extraction of the soluble part, this is an onerous process in terms of time and costs, which can preclude the use of this material for applications of high technological value.
    </p>
    <p num="13">The necessity has therefore been felt for further improvements in the field of the syndiotactic polymerization of styrene with traditional processes, aimed at increasing the stereochemical purity of the product as obtained by the polymerization process, but at the same time maintaining satisfactory yields and high molecular weights.</p>
    <p num="14">It is also important for the catalysts used for the preparation of syndiotactic polystyrene to be obtained with simple and rapid processes, starting from reagents which are easily available on the market.</p>
    <p num="15">On the other hand, it is also desirable to have production processes of syndiotactic polystyrene which enable the polymerization reaction to be carried out in relatively reduced volumes, without the necessity of using large quantities of inert liquids necessary in the traditional solution/suspension processes.</p>
    <p num="16">
      Polymerization in bulk, or with reduced quantities of diluents, could advantageously overcome this problem and it has been experimented, for example, in accordance with European patent application EP-A 584,646.
      <br/>
      It has the disadvantage however of a very slow reaction kinetics, with unsatisfactory hourly productivities and low conversions of the monomer which make it necessary to separate and recycle the non-reacted part.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a relevant amount of atactic polymer is formed during the process, partially due to the parallel radical polymerization, especially at elevated temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="17">It would be then desirable to have catalytic systems capable of effecting bulk polymerization of styrene with a higher productivity and conversion, but at the same time maintaining a satisfactory control of the stereoregularity of the polymer obtained.</p>
    <p num="18">It has now been surprisingly found that using a particular catalytic system based on metallocene compounds of titanium, it is possible to polymerize styrene or other vinylaromatic compounds, either in the presence or in the absence of a liquid diluent, with high conversions of the monomer, to obtain stereoregular polymers with a high average molecular weight.</p>
    <p num="19">A first object of the present invention therefore relates to a catalyst for the polymerization of vinylaromatic monomers, comprising the product consisting of the following two components in contact with each other:</p>
    <p num="20">
      A) an  ETA 5 -cyclopentadienyl complex of titanium;
      <br/>
      B) an organo-oxygenated compound of aluminum;
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      characterized in that it contains a sufficient quantity of at least one carboxylate having the following general formula:
      <br/>
      R--COO--G  (I)
    </p>
    <p num="22">wherein R--COO is a carboxylic group comprising the organic radical R having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, and G represents a hydrogen atom, an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms or a metal atom, possibly substituted, bound to said carboxylic group.</p>
    <p num="23">Another object of the present invention relates to a process for the prevalente syndiotactic polymerization of at least one vinylaromatic monomer, comprising polymerizing said at least one monomer in the presence of the above catalyst.</p>
    <p num="24">Other objects of the present invention will be specified hereafter.</p>
    <p num="25">
      The carboxylic group R--COO in the above carboxylate having formula (I) is of an anionic nature and can be, for example, in the form of an R--COO- anionic group, wherein G is a metal cation different from Al or Ti, or in the form of an R--COO--H acid, maintaining however its anionic nature with respect to the hydrogen atom, or it can be in the form of an ester of a G hydrocarbon group, or it can be included as a ligand of an anionic nature in one or both components (A) and (B) of the catalyst, in which case G is a group containing, titanium or aluminum, respectively, bound to the carboxylic group.
      <br/>
      Particularly satisfactory results, in accordance with the present invention, have been obtained when the R--COO--G carboxylate is a compound of Al or Ti, as specified hereunder.
    </p>
    <p num="26">The organic radical R in the group R--COO, comprises from 1 to 30, preferably from 1 to 20, carbon atoms, and may additionally also contain heteroatoms such as, for example, N, O, S, X=halogen, P, Si, preferably having a very weak co-ordinating capacity, such as, for example, if the RCOO group is a carbamate group (RH donicity less than 10 Kcal/mole).</p>
    <p num="27">
      According to the above definition, preferred R radicals for the purposes of the present invention are aromatic or aliphatic, linear, cyclic or branched hydrocarbon groups, having from 1 to 17 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred among these are aliphatic, linear or branched groups, non-substituted or substituted with at least one fluorine or chlorine atom, preferably fluorine.
      <br/>
      Non-limiting examples of the above R groups are: methyl, trifluoromethyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, 4-methylpentyl, neopentyl, octyl, decyl, pentadecyl, heptadecyl, 1,3,5-trimethylhexyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl, naphthyl, benzyl, 4-methylbenzyl, 4-hexylbenzyl.
      <br/>
      Other examples of R groups suitable for the purpose, in which heteroatoms are comprised, are the groups 2-furanyl, trimethylsilyl, trimethylsilylmethyl, 2-chloroethyl.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Also comprised in the present invention are catalysts containing two or more carboxylates having formula (I) mixed with each other.</p>
    <p num="29">The metallocene complexes which constitute component (A) in the catalyst suitable for the present invention, are preferably comprised in the following formula (II):  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="30">
      wherein:
      <br/>
      Ti is a titanium atom in oxidation state +3 or, preferably, +4;
      <br/>
      A is an anion containing an  ETA 5 -cyclopentadienyl ring co-ordinated to the titanium atom;
      <br/>
      each of the R' substituents independently represents a substituent group selected from hydride, halide, a C1 -C8 alkyl group, a C3 -C12 alkylsilyl group, a C5 -C8 cycloalkyl group, a C6 -C10 aryl group, a C1 -C8 alkoxyl group, a C1 -C30 carboxylic group, a C2 -C10 dialkylamide group,

      According to the present invention, the group A in formula (II) is an anion containing an  ETA 5 -cyclopentadienyl ring which preferably derives (formally by extraction of a H+ ion) from a cyclopentadiene, indene or fluorene molecule, or a derivative of one of the above compounds, in which one or more carbon atoms of the molecular skeleton (comprised or not comprised in the cyclopentadienyl ring), are substituted with C1 -C8 alkyl or silylalkyl groups, or C6 -C10 aryl or aryloxy groups or C1 -C8 alkoxyl groups.
      <br/>
      This A group may also be condensed with one or more other aromatic rings as in the case, for example, of 4,5-benzoindenyl.

      <br/>
      According to the present invention, this organo-oxygenated compound of aluminum is preferably an aluminoxane.
      <br/>
      As is known, aluminoxanes are compounds containing Al--O--Al bonds, with a varying O/Al ratio, which can be obtained, according to the known technique, by the reaction, under controlled conditions, of an aluminum alkyl, or aluminum alkyl halide, with water or other compounds containing controlled quantities of water available, as, for example, in the case of the reaction of aluminum trimethyl with a salt hydrate, such as aluminum sulfate hexahydrate, copper sulfate pentahydrate and iron sulfate pentahydrate.
      <br/>
      Alurninoxanes preferably used for the formation of the polymerization catalyst of the present invention are oligo- or polymeric compounds, cyclic and/or linear, characterized by the presence of repetitive units having formula (III):  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)

    <p num="48">
      The carboxylate is conveniently present in the catalyst in a molar quantity which is at least equal to and preferably higher than the moles of metal in the metallocene.

      In the preferred case of metallocene-carboxylates, the ratio between carboxylic groups and metal M is equal to 3, but results in line with the high stereospecificity and activity of the catalysts of the present invention are still obtained in the case of a sufficient quantity of carboxylate either freely mixed with components (A) and (B) in the formation process of the catalyst, or contained in component (B) rather than in component (A).
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      According to a preferred aspect of the present invention, a catalyst for the highly syndiospecific polymerization of vinylaromatic monomers is that obtained by contact and reaction of: (A) a metallocene complex having the previous formula (II) wherein each (R')n and R" is a carboxylic group R--COO bound to Ti, wherein R is an aliphatic fluorinated or non-fluorinated group, having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, or an aromatic group having from 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and

      (B) a methylaluminoxane as previously defined;

    <p num="50">in which the ratio between Al and Ti is between 50 and 2000, preferably between 100 and 1000.</p>
    <p num="51">
      Another preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises the catalyst consisting of a metallocene complex (A) of Ti not containing carboxylic groups, combined with an aluminoxane and a sufficient quantity of carboxylic groups, preferably such that the ratio RCOO/Ti is between 2 and 20.
      <br/>
      In this case the carboxylic groups can be preliminarily included in the aluminoxane, for example by adding the desired quantity of carboxylic acid to the aluminoxane, or they can be added directly to the system as third component, either in the form of carboxylic acid, or in the form of carboxylate salt of a metal preferably selected from the metals of groups 1, 2 or 13 of the periodic table of elements.
    </p>
    <p num="52">Intermediate methods and situations between those previously described are however included in the scope of the present invention (for example in the case of carboxylate partly included in the metallocene and partly included in the aluminoxane, before contact between the two components to form the catalyst).</p>
    <p num="53">
      According to the present invention, the procedure with which components (A) and (B), and the possible carboxylate, if added separately, are put in contact with each other is not critical.

      In particular, the preparation of the polymerization catalyst of the present invention can be carried out by addition of the components in any order.
      <br/>
      It is preferable however, when component (A) does not comprise carboxylate, for the latter to be premixed with component (B).
    </p>
    <p num="54">The above components form the catalyst of the present invention by contact and reaction with each other, preferably at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 120 (degree)  C. and for times varying from 1 minute to 1 hour, more preferably from 1 to 5 minutes.</p>

      In addition, the catalyst of the present invention may also contain additives or other components normally included according to the known art, for modification or improvement, in catalysts for the stereospecific polymerization of styrene and other vinylaromatic compounds.

      These additives or components are, for example, inert solvents, such as aliphatic and/or aromatic hydrocarbons, weakly co-ordinating additives such as, for example, additives having a donicity DN &lt;= 10 described in Italian patent application MI95A02214, in particular pentafluoroanisole, halogenated hydrocarbons, preferably chlorinated, etc.

    <p num="56">
      According to a particular aspect of the present invention, the catalyst for the syndiotactic polymerization of vinylaromatic compounds consists, in addition to components (A), (B) and the possible free carboxylate, of a further component (C) combined with the above, consisting of a compound of tin, having the following general formula (IV):
      <br/>
      SnR3 R4 R5 R6  (IV)
    </p>
    <p num="57">wherein the groups R3, R4, R5 and R6, the same or different, represent a linear or branched, alkyl radical preferably having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or an aryl orarylalkyl radical having from 6 to 14 carbon atoms.</p>

    <p num="59">
      Component (C), when comprised in the catalyst of the present invention, advantageously produces an increase in the polymerization activity, without causing any undesired effect, particularly on the stereoselectivity.
      <br/>
      It is preferably used in such a quantity that the atomic ratio Sn/Ti is between 0.001 and 100, more preferably between 1 and 50.
      <br/>
      Sn/Ti ratios lower than 0.001 do not cause any determinable variation in the properties of the catalyst with respect to this without tin; ratios higher than 100 do not provide any further advantage, but produce an undesired accumulation of tin in the polystyrene obtained at the end of the catalytic process.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The optional component (C) can be combined with the other essential components as held most suitable by the average expert.
      <br/>
      It is therefore possible, for example, to add component (C) to component (B) before adding component (A), or it is possible to add component (C) to the product formed by (A) and (B).

      The catalysts of the present invention can be used with excellent results in stereospecific polymerization processes of vinylaromatic compounds to obtain syndiotactic polymers.

      <br/>
      On the other hand, if used in bulk polymerization processes, in the absence of a diluent, or in the presence of a diluent in a weight ratio not higher than 1/1 with regard to the weight of the monomer, the catalyst of the present invention allows a prevalently syndiotactic polymer to be obtained, with a high molecular weight and not more than 20% by weight of the polymer being atactic.

    <p num="67">The above process can be carried out under the conditions normally adopted and known in the art for syndiotactic polymerization processes of styrene and other vinylaromatic monomers.</p>

      The following components are charged, in order, into a 50 ml glass tailed test-tube, at room temperature and in a stream of nitrogen:
      <br/>
      20 ml (equal to 0.175 moles) of anhydrous styrene purified by passage on a basic alumina column;
      <br/>
      0.66 ml of a solution of MAO 1.57 M in toluene (1.05 mmoles Al; molar ratio Al/Ti=1238);
      <br/>
      0.44 ml of a solution of tin tetraphenyl 0.001 M in toluene (4.4 * 10-6 moles of Sn, ratio Sn/Ti=5.2);
      <br/>
      0.27 ml of a solution 3.14 * 10-3 M in toluene of (pentamethyl- ETA 5 -cyclopentadienyl)titanium tris(trifluoroacetate) (8.48 * 10-7 moles) prepared as in example 2 (molar ratio Sty/Ti=206,000).
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      The mixture is briefly stirred and the temperature is then brought to 90 (degree)  C. The polymerization of the styrene is activated and is prolonged for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      At the end the mixture is suspended in 200 ml of methanol acidified with 0.5 mnl of concentrated HCL.
      <br/>
      After filtration, washing with methanol and drying, 8.26 g of polymer are recovered which, after extraction according to what is specified above in example 16, gave 7.46 g of substantially syndiotactic polystyrene (insoluble fraction 90.4% by weight, syndio stereoregularity &gt;99.9%).
      <br/>
      The conversion to syndiotactic PS was 41% with respect to the initial styrene, with a productivity equal to 184 KgsPS /gTi.
