    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
    <p num="1">This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. Pat. No. 6,830,942 which patent is specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates generally to phase change inks.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to a phase change carrier composition containing the combination of at least one urethane resin, at least one mixed urethane/urea resin, at least one mono-amide, and at least one organoleptic maskant or fragrant additive.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the present invention relates to inks useful for printing applications formed by adding colorant materials to such carrier compositions.
      <br/>
      Still further, the present invention relates to processes of using these phase change ink compositions in a printing device.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE RELEVANT ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      In general, phase change inks (sometimes referred to as "hot melt inks") are in the solid phase at ambient temperature, but exist in the liquid phase at the elevated operating temperature of an ink jet printing device.
      <br/>
      At the jet operating temperature, droplets of liquid ink are ejected from the printing device and, when the ink droplets contact the surface of the printing media, they quickly solidify to form a predetermined pattern of solidified ink drops.
      <br/>
      Phase change inks have also been investigated for use in other printing technologies such as gravure printing as referenced in U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,879 and German patent publications DE 4205636AL and DE 4205713AL assigned to Siegwerk Farbenfabrik Keller, Dr.
      <br/>
      Rung and Co.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Phase change inks for color printing generally comprise a phase change ink carrier composition, which is combined with a phase change ink compatible colorant.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a colored phase change ink will be formed by combining the above-described ink carrier composition with compatible subtractive primary colorants.
      <br/>
      The subtractive primary colored phase change inks of this invention can comprise four component dyes, namely, cyan, magenta, yellow and black. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,889,506; 4,889,761; and 5,372,852 teach that the subtractive primary colorants employed typically may comprise dyes from the classes of Color Index (C.I.) Solvent Dyes, Disperse Dyes, modified Acid and Direct Dyes, and a limited number of Basic Dyes.
      <br/>
      The colorants can also include pigments as exemplified in U.S. Pat. No. 5,221,335, assigned to Coates Electrographics LTD. U.S. Pat. No. 5,621,022 issued Apr. 15, 1997, and assigned to Tektronix, Inc., is directed to the use of a specific class of polymeric dyes in phase change ink compositions.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Phase change inks are desirable for ink jet printers since they remain in a solid phase at room temperature during shipping, long-term storage, and the like.
      <br/>
      Also, the problems associated with nozzle clogging due to ink evaporation are largely eliminated, thereby improving the reliability of ink jet printing.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, in the above-noted prior art phase change ink jet printers where the ink droplets are applied directly onto the printing medium the droplets solidify immediately upon contact with the substrate, migration of ink along the printing medium is prevented and dot quality is improved.
      <br/>
      This is also true of the processes and ink compositions described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In addition to the above-referenced U.S. patents, many other patents describe materials for use in phase change ink jet inks.
      <br/>
      Some representative examples include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,653,932; 4,390,369; 4,484,948; 4,684,956; 4,851,045; 4,889,560; 5,006,170; and 5,151,120; as well as EP Application Nos. 0187352 and 0206286.
      <br/>
      These materials can include paraffins, microcrystalline waxes, polyethylene waxes, ester waxes, fatty acids and other waxy materials, fatty amide-containing materials, sulfonamide materials, resinous materials made from different natural sources (tall oil rosins and rosin esters are an example) and many synthetic resins, oligomers, polymers and co-polymers.

      <br/>
      Application WO 94/14902, which was published on Jul. 7, 1994 and is assigned to Coates Brothers PLC, teaches a hot melt ink containing a colorant and, as a vehicle for the hot melt ink, an oligourethane having a melting point of at least 65 (degree)  C. and obtained by reacting an aliphatic or aromatic diisocyanate with at least a stoichiometric amount of either: (i) a monohydric alcohol component; or (ii) a monohydric alcohol component followed by another different monohydric alcohol component; or (iii) a monohydric alcohol component, followed by a dihydric alcohol component, followed by a monohydric alcohol component.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      This PCT patent application defines the monohydric alcohol component as either a monohydric aliphatic alcohol (e.g. C1 to C22 alcohols), an etherified dihydric aliphatic alcohol (e.g. propylene glycol methyl ether (PGME), dipropylene glycol methyl ether (DPGME), ethylene glycol butyl ether (EGBE), diethylene glycol butyl ether (DPGBE), tripropylene glycol butyl ether (TPGBE) and propylene glycol phenyl ether (PPL)); esterified dihydric aliphatic alcohol (e.g. the esterifying acid may be an ethylenically unsaturated acid (such as acrylic acid or methacrylic acid), thereby introducing ethylenic unsaturation into the oligourethane and rendering it suitable for eventual further additional polymerization (curing) after having been applied to a substrate by hot melt printing), or dihydric polyalkylene glycol.
      <br/>
      This PCT application further defined the dihydric alcohol component as a dihydric aliphatic alcohol or a dihydric polyalkylene glycol (e.g. ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol (PEG 1500), polypropylene glycol (PPG 750, 1000 and 1500), trimethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, methylpropanediol and 1,6-hexanediol).
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Also, PCT Pat.
      <br/>
      Application WO 94/04619, assigned to the General Electric Company, teaches the use of ionomeric materials in combination with image forming agents to form a hot melt ink jet ink.
      <br/>
      The ionomeric materials can include many different types of copolymeric or polymeric ionomers, including carboxyl-functional polyurethanes prepared from a diol or polyol and a hydroxyl acid.
      <br/>
      Many other carrier materials and colorants for the image forming agent of the invention are included in this PCT application.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Furthermore, U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,942, assigned to the Assignee of the present invention, teaches phase change carrier compositions that comprise the combination of a urethane resin with a urethane/urea resin that may optionally contain other ingredients such as mono-amides and polyethylene waxes.
      <br/>
      However, that U.S. Patent application does not teach or explicitly suggest a phase change carrier composition that contains the combination of critical ingredients of the carrier compositions with an organoleptic maskant constituent of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      There is still a need for new materials for novel and different applications of phase change carrier compositions and inks containing such carrier compositions that do not generate offensive odors in inks when the inks are melted for use in phase change ink printers, especially in carrier composition and inks employing low viscosity resins and waxes.
      <br/>
      Additionally, needs continue to exist for phase change inks utilizing carrier compositions that produce fragrantly pleasing ink sticks and inks upon melting.
      <br/>
      These needs are solved by the present invention by providing an organoleptic maskant or fragrance that is added directly to these resin materials for specific applications.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">It is an aspect of the present invention that phase change carrier compositions comprise an admixture of (1) at least one urethane resin; and/or (2) at least one mixed urethane/urea resin; and (3) at least one mono-amide; and (4) at least one odor maskant or organoleptic maskant constituent that adds a pleasing fragrance to the melted composition to avoid offensive aromas in use or to achieve a desired aroma.</p>
    <p num="13">It is another aspect of the present invention that phase change ink compositions comprise the admixture of (a) the above-noted phase change carrier composition with (b) a phase change ink compatible colorant.</p>
    <p num="14">It is yet another aspect of the present invention that a method for producing a layer of a phase change colored ink on the surface of a substrate by either direct or indirect printing is obtained wherein the phase change ink composition in the solid phase comprises an admixture of (a) the above-noted phase change carrier composition and (b) a phase change ink compatible colorant.</p>
    <p num="15">It is a feature of the present invention that the phase change carrier composition and the colored inks have no odor or possess a pleasant odor upon melting.</p>
    <p num="16">It is an advantage of the present invention that phase change carrier compositions and inks of the present invention that the fragrance is released upon melting and remains if left in a printer for an extended period of time.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="17">
      The term "nucleophile" in the present specification and claims is used as defined on page 179 of "Advanced Organic Chemistry", 3rd Edition by Jerry March, .COPYRGT.1985 by John Wiley and Sons, to describe a reagent that brings an electron pair to a reaction to form a new bond.
      <br/>
      The preferred nucleophiles of this invention are alcohols or amines, but it is understood that other nucleophilic functional groups that are capable of reacting with the isocyanate moiety could also be used in the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The term "oligomer" in the current specification and claims is used as defined on page 7 of "Polymer Chemistry--The Basic Concepts" by Paul Hiemenz, 81984 by Marcel Dekker, Inc., to describe a term coined to designate molecules for which n (representing the number of repeating monomer units) is less than 10.</p>
    <p num="19">The term "isocyanate-derived resin" as used in the present specification and claims is defined as any monomeric, oligomeric or non-polymeric resinous material derived from the reaction of mono-, di-, or poly-isocyanates with suitable nucleophilic molecules.</p>
    <p num="20">The terms "isocyanate-derived wax" as used in the present specification and claims is defined as any crystalline or semicrystalline waxy material derived from the reaction of a fatty isocyanate with a suitable nucleophile, or the reaction of a fatty nucleophile with a suitable isocyanate, or the reaction of a fatty nucleophile with a fatty isocyanate.</p>
    <p num="21">The term "urethane resin" or "urethane isocyanate-derived resin" as used in the present specification and claims is defined as any resin that is a urethane that is the product of the reaction of an isocyanate and an alcohol.</p>
    <p num="22">The term "mixed urethane/urea resin" or "urethane/urea isocyanate-derived resin" as used in the present specification and claims is defined as any resin that is a mixed urethane/urea that is the product of the reaction of an isocyanate, an alcohol and an amine.</p>
    <p num="23">
      Any suitable reaction condition for making urethane resins or mixed urethane/urea resins by condensing alcohols and/or amines with isocyanates may be employed in the practice of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the reaction is carried out at elevated temperatures (e.g. about 60 (degree)  C. to about 160 (degree)  C.) in the presence of a urethane reaction catalyst such as dibutyltindilaurate, bismuth tris-neodecanoate, cobalt benzoate, lithium acetate, stannous octoate or triethyla rine.
      <br/>
      The reaction conditions preferably are conducted in an inert atmosphere, such as argon or nitrogen gas or other suitable atmosphere, to prevent oxidizing or yellowing the reaction products and to prevent undesirable side reactions.
      <br/>
      The mole ratio of reactants is adjusted so that the isocyanate functionalities are completely consumed in the reaction with a slight molar excess of alcohol or amine typically remaining.
      <br/>
      Conceptually the reactants can be added together in any order and/or added to the reaction as physical mixtures.
      <br/>
      However, in the preferred embodiments of the invention, reaction conditions and the order of the addition of reactants are carefully controlled for several reasons.
      <br/>
      First, reaction conditions and reactant additions are chosen to provide a controlled exothermic reaction.
      <br/>
      Secondly, when reacting mixtures of alcohols and/or amines with diisocyanates such as isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), the order of addition of the isocyanate and the different nucleophiles to the reaction is chosen to tailor the distribution of diurethane molecules, and/or mixed urethane/urea molecules, and/or diurea molecules in the final resin.
      <br/>
      When doing this, the different reactivities to isocyanates of alcohols versus amines are employed, as are the different reactivities of the two separate isocyanate groups on IPDI.
      <br/>
      See J. H. Saunders and K. C. Frisch's "Polyurethanes Part I, Chemistry" published by Interscience of New York, N.Y. in 1962 and Olin Chemicals' Luxate (tm)  IM isophorone diisocyanate technical product information sheet which provide further explanation of this chemistry.
      <br/>
      This control of the reaction conditions and order of addition of the reactants is done to specifically tailor or customize the different types of molecular species in the finished resin so that the resin will:
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      (1) have a controlled viscosity that is designed for a specific application,
      <br/>
      (2) have a controlled glass transition temperature and/or melting point, and
      <br/>
      (3) have consistent properties from batch to batch.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The isocyanate-derived resins from these reactions are generally transparent solids having melting points in the range of about 20 (degree)  C. to about 150 (degree)  C., viscosities in the range of about 10 cPs to about 5000 cPs at 150 (degree)  C. and Tg 's of about -30 (degree)  C. to about 100 (degree)  C. The isocyanate-derived waxes from these reactions are generally opaque waxy solids having sharp melting points from about 50 (degree)  C. to about 130 (degree)  C., and viscosities of about 1 cPs to about 25 cPs at 140 (degree)  C. The isocyanate-derived resins and waxes display properties such that the higher the Tg and the melting point, the higher is the viscosity.
      <br/>
      While the structural activity relationships are not fully understood, it is known that the Tg of the isocyanate-derived resins is controlled by the proper choice of the mixture of nucleophiles in the reaction as illustrated in Table 3 in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,942. Varying one or more of the readily available commodity chemicals used as chemical precursors will permit custom-tailoring of the properties of the isocyanate-derived resin and wax materials.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Preferred alcohols to react with difunctional and higher isocyanates to make either the urethane resins or the urethane/urea resins of this invention include any monohydric alcohol.
      <br/>
      For instance, the monohydric alcohol could be any aliphatic alcohol �e.g., a C1 -C22 or higher linear alcohol, any branched alcohol or any cyclic aliphatic alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, (n- and iso)-propanol, (n-, iso-, t-) butanol, (n-, iso-, t-, and the like) pentanol, (n-, iso-, t-, and the like) hexanol, (n-, iso-, t-, and the like) octanol, (n-, iso-, t-, and the like) nonanol, (n- and branched) decanols, (n- and branched) undecanols, (n- and branched) dodecanols, (n- and branched) hexadecanols, (n- and branched) octadecanols, 3-cyclohexyl-1-propanol, 2-cyclohexyl-1-ethanol, cyclohexylmethanol, cyclohexanol, 4-methyl cyclohexanol, 4-ethylcyclohexanol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, and the like�; an aliphatic/aromatic alcohol �e.g., benzyl alcohol, octyl, nonyl, and dodecylphenol alkoxylates of octyl, nonyl, and dodecylphenol, and alkoxyphenol�; aromatic alcohols such as phenol, naphthol, and the like, and their derivatives; fused ring alcohols (e.g., rosin alcohols, hydroabietyl alcohol, cholesterol, vitamin E, and the like) and other suitable alcohols (e.g., N,N-dimethyl-N-ethanolamine, stearamide-monoethanolamine, tripropyleneglycol monomethylether, hydroxybutanone, menthol, isoborneol, terpineol, 12-hydroxy stearyl stearamide, and the like).
      <br/>
      It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that small amounts (on a molar basis) of polyols could also be incorporated into the reaction mixture to produce oligomeric species in the resins if so desired.
      <br/>
      The preferred alcohols are hydroabietyl alcohol, octylphenol ethoxylate and octadecyl alcohol.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Preferred amines to react with difunctional and higher isocyanates to make the mixed urethane/urea resins of this invention include any monofunctional amine, with the exception of tertiary amines void of other nucleophilic functional groups (e.g., triethylamine).
      <br/>
      For instance, the mono-amine could be any aliphatic primary or secondary amine (e.g., a C1 -C22 or higher linear amine, any branched amine or any cyclic aliphatic amine) such as methyl amine, ethyl amine, (n- and iso-)propyl amine, (n-, iso-, and t-) butyl amine, (n-, iso-, t-, and the like) pentyl amine, (n-, iso-, t-, and the like) hexyl amine, (n-, iso-,t-, and the like) octyl amine, (n-, iso-, t-, and the like) nonyl amine, (n- and branched) decyl amine, (n- and branched) undecyl amines, (n- and branched) dodecyl amines, (n- and branched) hexadecyl amines, (n- and branched) dodecyl amines, dimethyl amine, diethyl amine, di(n- and iso-)propyl amines, di(n-, iso-, t-)butyl amine, di(n-, iso-, t-, and the like)pentyl amine, di(n-, iso-, t-, and the like)hexyl amine, di(n-, iso-, t-, and the like)cyclohexyl amine, di(n-, iso-, t-, and the like)heptyl amine, di(n-, iso-, t-, and the like)octyl amine, di(n-, iso-, t-, and the like)decyl amine, di(n-, iso-, t-, and the like)dodecyl amine, di(n-, iso-, t-, and the like)octadecyl amine, cyclohexyl amine, 2,3-dimethyl-1-cyclohexylamine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, and the like; an aliphatic/aromatic amine (e.g., benzyl amine or analogues with longer or additional alkyl chains); aromatic amines such as aniline, anisidine, and the like; fused ring amines such as rosin amine, dehydroabietyl amine, dihydroabietyl amine, hydroabietyl amine, and the like; and miscellaneous amines (e.g., adamantyl amine, isonipecotamide, polyoxyalkylenemonoamines, such as M-series Jeffamines available commercially from Huntsman Chemical Company of Austin, Tex.; 3,3'-diamino-N-methyl-dipropylamine, and the like.
      <br/>
      It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that small amounts (on a molar basis) of polyamines could also be incorporated into the reaction mixture to produce oligomeric species in the resins if so desired.
      <br/>
      The preferred amine is octadecyl amine.

      Phase change inks of this invention contain a phase change carrier system or composition.
      <br/>
      The phase change carrier composition is generally designed for use in either a direct printing mode or use in an indirect or offset printing transfer system.
      <br/>
      In the direct printing mode, the phase change carrier composition is generally made up of one or more chemicals that provide the necessary properties to allow the phase change ink (1) to be applied in a thin film of uniform thickness on the final receiving substrate when cooled to the ambient temperature after printing directly to the substrate; (2) to be ductile while retaining sufficient flexibility so that the applied image on the substrate will not fracture upon bending; and (3) to possess a high degree of lightness, chroma, transparency and thermal stability.
      <br/>
      In an offset printing transfer or indirect printing mode, the phase change carrier composition is designed to possess not only the above mentioned properties, but certain fluidic and mechanical properties necessary for use in such a system, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,389,958 which is hereby incorporated by reference in pertinent part.
      <br/>
      The phase change carrier composition and the inks made therefrom which collectively comprise the current invention contain a combination of urethane resins and/or urethane/urea resins, along with another critical ingredient.
      <br/>
      These critical ingredients can be supplemented with (one or more) optional ingredients to prepare commercial phase change carrier compositions.
      <br/>
      The urethane resins and mixed urethane/urea resin materials of the current invention are tailored to have the desirable properties mentioned above when used in the carrier composition of the inks of the present invention by varying one or more of the readily available commodity chemical precursors.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The phase change carrier compositions of the current invention may be used in combination with conventional phase change ink colorant materials such as Color Index (C.I.) Solvent Dyes, Disperse Dyes, modified Acid and Direct Dyes, Basic Dyes, Sulphur Dyes, Vat Dyes, and/or polymeric dyes such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,621,022, and/or pigments to produce a phase change ink.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the phase change carrier compositions of the current invention may employ colored urethane resins or urethane/urea resins or other isocyanate-derived colored resins as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,528 and assigned to the assignee of the present invention, to produce a phase change ink.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The third critical ingredient of the phase change carrier compositions and the inks made therefrom of the present invention is a mono-amide.
      <br/>
      A mono-amide compound typically comprises either a primary or secondary mono-amide, but is preferably a secondary mono-amide.
      <br/>
      Of the primary mono-amides, stearamide, such as KEMAMMIDE S, manufactured by Witco Chemical Company, can be employed herein.
      <br/>
      As for the secondary mono-amides, behenyl benenamide (KEMAMIDE EX-666), and stearyl stearamide (KEMAMIDE S-180), both manufactured by Witco Chemical Company, are extremely useful mono-amides.
      <br/>
      However, stearyl stearamide (KEMAMIDE S-180) is the mono-amide of choice in producing the phase change ink compositions of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The phase change carrier compositions and the inks made therefrom of the present invention may contain at least one polyethylene wax.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the polyethylene wax has a molecular weight of about 500 to about 5,000; more preferably, of about 700 to about 2,000; and, most preferably, of about 800 to 1,200.
      <br/>
      Preferred polyethylene waxes are Polywax 850, Polywax 1000 or Polywax 2000, all available from Petrolite.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Preferably, the total amount of urethane resin or resins in the phase change carrier composition and the inks made therefrom will comprise about 10% to about 40%, more preferably, about 15-35% and most preferably, about 20-30%, by weight of the carrier composition.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the total amount of mixed urethane/urea resin or resins in the phase change carrier composition will likewise comprise about 10% to about 40%, more preferably about 15-35% and most preferably, about 20-30%, by weight of the carrier composition.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the total amount of mono-amide wax and polyethylene wax, if used, combined will comprise about 40% to about 70%, more preferably, about 45-60% and most preferably about 48-57% by weight of the carrier composition.

    <p num="38">
      Prior art phase change inks for use in direct and indirect transfer printing systems are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,889,560 and 5,372,852.
      <br/>
      These inks consist of a phase change ink carrier composition comprising one or more fatty amide-containing materials, usually consisting of a mono-amide wax and a tetra-amide resin, one or more tackifiers, one or more plasticizers and one or more antioxidants, in combination with compatible colorants.
      <br/>
      A preferred tetra-amide resin is a dimer acid based tetra-amide that is the reaction product of dimer acid, ethylene diamine, and stearic acid.
      <br/>
      The typical mono-amide is stearyl stearamide.
      <br/>
      A preferred tackifier resin is a glycerol ester of hydrogenated abietic (rosin) acid and a preferred antioxidant is that provided by Uniroyal Chemical Company under the tradename Naugard 524.
      <br/>
      The urethane and urethane/urea resins employed in this invention can replace one or more of the ingredients in this prior art carrier composition or inks employing the resin components of the present invention can have all of these prior art ingredients replaced by the urethane and/or urethane/urea resins disclosed herein and/or by isocyanate derived waxes.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Upon melting inks employing the present urethane and/or mixed urethane/urea resins and mono-amide admixture can release potentially offensive aromas, such as sharp pungent or mildewy odors.
      <br/>
      The use of selected organoleptic maskant contituents or fragrances from about 0.0005% to about 0.25% by weight, and more preferably from about 0.001% to about 0.01% by weight, is effective to either eliminate completely or change the odor of the ink to a more pleasant and identifiable fragrance.
      <br/>
      Effective organoleptic maskant constituents have been obtained from International Flavors and Fragrances of Union Beach, N.J. identified as 8125-HAZ Golden Forest and 8126 and 8127 HAZ Maskants.
      <br/>
      All are liquids and possess thermal stability at about 140 (degree)  C. in the carrier composition, are not extremely volatile, are oil soluble and are chemically inert.
      <br/>
      Flashpoints ranged from 196 (degree)  F. to 182 (degree)  F. to 142 (degree)  F., respectively.
      <br/>
      All contain active ingredients selected from the group consisting of esters, lactones, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, ethers, acetals, ketals, heterocycles, compositions having cumulated double bonds including pheromones, acetylenes, amines and mixtures thereof These functional groups are represented in natural product fragrance extracts, such as Brazilian peppermint.

    <p num="40">
      The advantages of inks formulated with the combination of the aforementioned critical ingredients (urethane resin, mixed urethane/urea resin, mono-amide) and the organoleptic maskant constituent or fragrance over the prior art phase change inks are:
      <br/>
      (1) The urethane resins and mixed urethane/urea resins of this invention are very pure, being free of salts and other insoluble contaminants.
      <br/>
      This makes the inks made from these materials easy to filter and provides for high reliability in ink jet printing devices.
      <br/>
      This is a major advantage.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      (2) The urethane resins and mixed urethane/urea resins of this invention may be specifically tailored to give certain physical properties that optimize the performance of the inks of this invention in ink jet printing devices and on the output substrate.
      <br/>
      These desirable ink properties include melting point, viscosity, transparency and the dynamic mechanical properties referenced in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,389,958.
      <br/>
      (3) The urethane resins and mixed urethane/urea resins of this invention are used in combination with the mono-amide wax and polyethylene wax to give ink compositions that display an improved yield stress versus temperature curve over prior art ink compositions.
      <br/>
      This enables ink droplets to be spread and fused at elevated temperatures during the fusing and transfer steps in an indirect printing process, but at a lower pressure than was possible with prior art inks.
      <br/>
      (4) The ink formulations with the added odor maskant or fragrance disclosed herein exhibit no offensive odors, such as sharp, pungent or mildewy odors upon melting and/or provide a pleasing aroma.
