      In a control unit of an automotive vehicle, it is possible to securely prevent a tie-up due to a miss-recognition of a disengage timing of a disengage side friction device, securely prevent an early disengage due to an erroneous recognition of the disengage timing and realize a control of accurately and reliably shifting the clutch.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a control unit of an automatic transmission having pressure adjusting command generating means which executes a shift by engaging and disengaging a predetermined friction device in an automatic transmission connected to an engine and adjusts a hydraulic pressure acting on the friction device at a time of the shift is structured such as to have disengage timing recognizing means which recognizes a disengage timing of a disengage side friction device at a time of shifting the automatic transmission, first disengage determining means which determines a disengage operation of the disengage side friction device on the basis of a result of recognition by the disengage timing recognizing means and second disengage determining means which forcibly determines a disengage operation of the disengage side friction device in the case that it is impossible to recognize the disengage timing in the disengage timing recognizing means.
      <br/>
      In this control unit, the pressure adjusting command generating means operates so as to disengage the disengage side friction device on the basis of determination of the first and second disengage determining means.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a control unit and a control method of an automatic transmission for controlling a hydraulic pressure used for a shift in the automatic transmission of an automotive vehicle, and an automotive vehicle having the control unit mounted thereon.</p>
    <p num="3">
      As this kind of control method in accordance with the prior art, for example, there is a structure described in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 9-280362. This conventional control method is structured such as to at first start an engagement of a fixed side friction device when a shift command signal is generated and next start a disengage of a disengage side friction device when recognizing a disengage timing of the disengage side friction device.
      <br/>
      Further, the disengage timing of the disengage side friction device is recognized by detecting a torque phase on the basis of a longitudinal acceleration signal of a vehicle.
      <br/>
      Here, the torque phase means a period at which a number of rotation of a turbine is not reduced and only a torque of an output shaft in the transmission is changed in the case of paying attention to a time change of the torque of the output shaft in the transmission.
      <br/>
      Further, when recognizing a disengage timing (a torque phase) of the disengage side friction device on the basis of the longitudinal acceleration signal of the vehicle, an elapsed time after the shift command signal is generated is measured, the elapsed time when the disengage timing is recognized is compared with a predetermined elapsed time and a disengage of the disengage side friction device is started for the first time when the former elapsed time is greater than the latter elapsed time, whereby an early disengage due to an erroneous recognition of the disengage timing during a rough road travelling or the like is prevented and a blowing-up of a number of rotation of the turbine is prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In accordance with the control method described in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 9-280362, as mentioned above, since the disengage side friction device is disengaged for the first time when the elapsed time at which the disengage time is recognized becomes greater than the predetermined elapsed time, it is possible to prevent an early disengage due to an erroneous recognition of the disengage timing during the rough road travelling.
      <br/>
      However, in accordance with the control method described in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 9-280362, in the case that the disengage timing can not be recognized due to the rough road travelling, both of the fixed side friction device and the disengage side friction device are fixed (tied up), so that there is generated a problem that not only the shift characteristic is deteriorated but also the friction device (a clutch) is promoted to be broken.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">A first object of the present invention is to provide a control unit and a control method of an automotive vehicle which securely prevent a tie-up due to a miss-recognition of the disengage timing of the disengage side friction device and realize a control of accurately and reliably shifting the clutch, and an automotive vehicle having the control unit mounted thereon.</p>
    <p num="6">A second object of the present invention is to provide a control unit and a control method of an automotive vehicle which securely prevent an early disengage and a tie-up due to an erroneous recognition and a miss-recognition of the disengage timing of the disengage side friction device and realize a control of accurately and reliably shifting the clutch.</p>
    <p num="7">(1) In order to achieve the first object mentioned above, in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a control unit of an automatic transmission having pressure adjusting command generating means which executes a shift by engaging and disengaging a predetermined friction device in an automatic transmission connected to an engine and adjusts a hydraulic pressure acting on the friction device at a time of the shift, comprising:</p>
    <p num="8">
      disengage timing recognizing means which recognizes a disengage timing of a disengage side friction device at a time of shifting the automatic transmission;
      <br/>
      first disengage determining means which determines a disengage operation of the disengage side friction device on the basis of a result of recognition by the disengage timing recognizing means; and
      <br/>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="19">Embodiments in accordance with the present invention will be in detail described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 1 is an idiomatic view of a structure of an automatic transmission provided with a control unit in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, reference numeral 101 denotes an engine, and the engine 101 is a four cylinder engine in the present embodiment.
      <br/>
      An ignition device 102 is provided in the engine 101.
      <br/>
      The ignition device 102 has four ignition plugs 103 corresponding to a number of the cylinders in the engine 101.
      <br/>
      An electronically controlled throttle 105 for adjusting a flow amount of an air passing through a suction pipe 104, a fuel injection device 106 for injecting a fuel and an air flow meter 107 are provided in the suction pipe 104 which is used for sucking the air to the engine 101.
      <br/>
      The fuel injection device 106 has four fuel injection valves 108 in correspondence to the number of the cylinders in the engine 101.
      <br/>
      The electronically controlled throttle 105 is structured such that an actuator 109 drives a throttle valve 110 so as to control an air flow amount.
      <br/>
      Further, in a normal automotive vehicle, the throttle valve 110 and an acceleration pedal (not shown) are connected to each other by a mechanical wire (not shown) and are operated one to one.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      A fly wheel 112 is mounted to a crank shaft 111 of the engine 101.
      <br/>
      An engine rotational number sensor 113 for detecting a number of rotation of the crank shaft 111, that is, a number Ne of rotation of an engine is mounted to the fly wheel 112.
      <br/>
      A torque converter 114 is directly connected to the fly wheel 112, a stepped variable speed gear mechanism 119 is directly connected to a torque converter output shaft 118, and an automatic transmission 130 is constituted by the torque converter output shaft 118 and the stepped variable speed gear mechanism 119.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The torque converter 114 is constituted by a pump 115, a turbine 116 and a stator 117.
      <br/>
      An output shaft of the turbine 116, that is, the torque converter output shaft 118 is directly connected to the stepped variable speed gear mechanism 119.
      <br/>
      Further, a turbine rotation sensor 120 for measuring a number Nt of rotation of the turbine is mounted to the torque converter output shaft 118.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A structure of the variable speed gear mechanism 119 is known, includes two planetary gears and five frictional engaging apparatuses and is structured such that a gear ratio or a direction of rotation of the planetary gears is changed by selectively connecting or disengaging five frictional engaging apparatuses so as to shift or switch between a forward movement and a backward movement.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, for reasons of convenience for explanation, these elements are represented by a planetary gear 121 and friction devices 122 and 123.
      <br/>
      The friction devices 122 and 123 are respectively controlled by spools 126 and 127 and linear solenoids 128 and 129 (a pressure adjusting apparatus).
      <br/>
      Further, the variable speed gear mechanism 119 is connected to an output shaft 124 and the output shaft 124 is connected to a propeller shaft (not shown) of an automotive vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Various kinds of actuators for driving the engine 101 and an automatic transmission 130 mentioned above are controlled by a controller 131.
      <br/>
      A throttle valve opening  THETA , a number No of rotation (vehicle speed) of the output shaft of the transmission, a number Nt of rotation of the turbine, a number Ne of rotation of the engine, a temperature Toil of an oil in the transmission, a pedaling amount  ALPHA  of the accelerator pedal and the like are input to the controller 131 and used for a control.
      <br/>
      Further, in a special system, a torque To of the output shaft of the transmission detected by using a torque sensor (not shown) mounted to the output shaft 124 of the automatic transmission 130 is taken into the controller 131.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 2 is a shift diagram at a shift-up time in the case that the automatic transmission 130 is a four speed automatic transmission.
      <br/>
      The controller 131 judges a shift on the basis of an amount indicating a load of the engine, for example, the throttle valve opening  THETA  and an actual vehicle speed V, as shown in FIG. 2, and determines a shifting stage of the automatic transmission 130.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      FIG. 3 is a table which shows a relation between engagement and disengaging operations and shift gears in five friction devices of the variable speed gear mechanism 119.
      <br/>
      The automatic transmission 130 is provided with a low clutch (L/C), a 24 brake (2&amp;4/B), a high clutch (H/C), a low reverse brake (L&amp;R/B) and a low one-way clutch (L/OWC) as five friction device, and selectively fix (symbol  (small circle)  in the drawing) or disengage (symbol  *  in the drawing) them as shown in FIG. 3, whereby forward movement 1 to 4 stages and a backward movement stage can be selected.
      <br/>
      For example, in a 2-3 shift, a shift is established by fixing the high clutch (H/C) and disengaging the 24 brake (2&amp;4/B).
      <br/>
      In the following description, a fixed side friction device (a friction device which is currently under a disengaged condition and will be fixed for shifting) is represented by the friction device 123 in FIG. 1, and a disengaged side friction device (a friction device which is currently under a fixed condition and will be disengaged for shifting) is represented by the friction device 122 in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      A control unit in accordance with the present embodiment is provided in the automatic transmission mentioned above.
      <br/>
      The control unit is constituted by the controller 131 shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      That is, the controller 131 has processing functions of a shift command generating portion 132, a disengaging time recognizing portion 133, a disengaging operation determining portion 134, a pressure adjusting command generating portion 135 and a forcibly disengaging operation determining portion 136 as the control unit in accordance with the present embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="28">In the shift command generating portion 132 judges on the basis of the throttle valve opening  THETA  and the number No of rotation of the output shaft in the transmission (vehicle speed), as shown in FIG. 2, whether or not a state to be shifted is established, and when the state to be shifted is established, it generates the shift command signal.</p>
    <p num="29">
      The disengaging time recognizing portion 133 recognizes a disengaging time of the disengaged side friction device (the friction device currently under the fixed state) among the friction devices 122 and 123.
      <br/>
      As an example, it recognizes a torque phase at a time of shifting.
      <br/>
      As a method of recognizing the torque phase, there can be considered a method of using signals of a torque sensor (not shown) and an acceleration sensor (not shown) or a time change rate of the number No of rotation of the output shaft in the transmission.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Then, in the case of recognizing an optimum disengaging time in accordance with the method mentioned above, the disengaging operation determining portion 134 outputs a minimum value of a hydraulic pressure command value to the pressure adjusting command generating portion 135 so as to disengage the disengaged side friction device 122.
      <br/>
      Further, in the case that the disengaging time can not be recognized by the disengaging time recognizing portion 133, the forcibly disengaging operation determining portion 136 outputs a minimum value of the hydraulic pressure command value to the pressure adjusting command generating portion 135 so as to forcibly execute a clutch disengaging operation.
      <br/>
      When the minimum value of the hydraulic pressure command value is output, the pressure adjusting command generating portion 135 drives the linear solenoid 129 in connection to the disengaged side friction device 122 so as to generate the hydraulic pressure for disengaging the clutch.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In accordance with the structure mentioned above, it is possible to securely disengage the friction device even when the optimum disengaging time can not be recognized, for example, due to the rough road travelling or the like, whereby it is possible to prevent a shift characteristic from deteriorating.
      <br/>
      Here, in the following description, the "friction device" will be properly called as a "clutch".
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 4 is a schematic view of a shift characteristic at a shift up time in accordance with a conventional general control method.
      <br/>
      The shift command signal is generated and the hydraulic pressure control at a shifting time is started.
      <br/>
      The hydraulic pressure in the fixed side clutch is increased, and the output shaft torque is reduced while the number of rotation of the turbine is not reduced when a transmission of the torque is started.
      <br/>
      This is because the torque acts on both of the disengaged side clutch and the fixed side clutch under the fixed state due to beginning of the fixation of the fixed side clutch and a part of the torque is not transmitted to the output shaft 124.
      <br/>
      This area corresponds to the torque phase.
      <br/>
      At this period, when the hydraulic pressure in the disengaged side clutch is lowered at a stroke, the number of rotation of the turbine is lowered and the shift is actually started.
      <br/>
      That is, a good clutch shifting control is realized by recognizing the beginning of the torque phase so as to disengage the disengaged side clutch at a stroke.
      <br/>
      Further, the hydraulic pressure of the fixed side clutch during the shift and the hydraulic pressure of the disengaged side clutch before the torque phase is started are set to a level at which a good shift characteristic can be realized at each of operating conditions of the automatic transmission.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 5 is a schematic view which shows an influence in the case that the clutch disengage timing is slipped in the shift characteristic at a shift up time in accordance with a conventional general control method.
      <br/>
      As shown by a single-dot chain line in FIG. 5, when executing a clutch disengaging operation at a period prior to a time at which a torque phase is actually started, for example, due to an erroneous recognition of the torque phase, a blowing up of the number or rotation of the turbine is generated, thereby applying a feeling of physical disorder to a driver.
      <br/>
      Further, as shown by a broken line in FIG. 5, when executing a clutch disengaging operation at a widely delayed timing after the torque phase is started, for example, due to a miss-recognition of the torque phase, there is generated a state (a tie-up state) that the torque is applied to both of the fixed and disengaged clutches, so that not only a drag of the output shaft torque and a torque change are generated but also a deterioration of the clutch is promoted.
      <br/>
      That is, it is necessary to establish a method of accurately recognizing the torque phase start timing as the disengaging timing and preventing an erroneous recognition and a miss-recognition of the recognizing method so as to obtain a high reliability.
    </p>
    <p num="34">FIG. 6 is a flow chart which shows processing functions of the disengaging time recognizing portion 133, the disengaging operation determining portion 134, the pressure adjusting command generating portion 135 and the forcibly disengaging operation determining portion 136 in the control unit of the automatic transmission 130 in accordance with the present embodiment.</p>
    <p num="35">
      At first, in a step 401, it is judged whether or not the shift command signal is generated.
      <br/>
      When the shift command signal is generated, the step goes to a step 402, and when it is not generated, the step 401 is again executed.
      <br/>
      Next, in the step 402, it is judged by using a time change rate of the number of rotation of the transmission output shaft 124 whether or not the disengaging time is established (the disengage time recognizing portion 134 and the disengaging operation determining portion 134).
      <br/>
      In the case of recognizing as the disengaging time, the step goes to a step 404.
      <br/>
      In the case of not recognizing as the disengaging time, the step goes to a step 403.
      <br/>
      In the step 403, it is judged whether or not the value TmSft mentioned above is greater than a disengaging time recognition finishing time tTmTq-e (the forcibly disengaging operation determining portion 136).
      <br/>
      In the case that it is greater, the step goes to a step 404 for preventing the tie-up.
      <br/>
      In the case that it is smaller, the step returns to the step 402.
      <br/>
      Finally, in the step 404, the hydraulic pressure command value f the disengaged side clutch is set to a minimum value and a clutch disengaging operation is executed (the pressure adjusting command generating portion 135).
      <br/>
      By setting these processing flow, it is possible to securely prevent the miss-recognition of the disengaging time of the disengaged side friction device 122, thereby avoiding a deterioration of the shift characteristic.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      FIG. 7 is a flow chart which shows details of the process for recognizing the disengaging time in the step 402 shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      In a step 501, the shift command signal is taken in and in a step 502, it is judged whether or not the taken shift command signal changes in comparison with the preceding value.
      <br/>
      In the case that the shift command signal changes from the preceding value, a shift control start flag is set in a step 503, a value of a current number dN of rotation of the output shaft in the transmission is substituted for a reference value dNo-s in a step 504, and the step goes to a step 505.
      <br/>
      In the case that the shift command signal does not change, the step goes to the step 505 without executing the steps 503 and 504.
      <br/>
      In the step 505, it is judged whether or not the shift control start flag is set.
      <br/>
      In the case that the flag is set, the step goes to a step 506, and in the case that it is not set, the step returns to the step 501.
      <br/>
      In the step 506, the current number dNo of rotation of the output shaft in the automatic transmission is taken in.
      <br/>
      Next, in a step 507, a difference between the value dNo-s (the value dNo when the shift command is generated) and the value dNo is obtained and it is judged whether or not this value of difference is greater than a disengaging time recognizing level cTqLv1.
      <br/>
      In the case that it is greater, the step goes to a step 508 and in the case that it is smaller, the step returns to the step 506.
      <br/>
      Finally, in the step 508, the disengaging time recognizing flag is set and the process is finished.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      FIG. 8 is a time chart which explains an operation of the present embodiment.
      <br/>
      When the shift command signal is generated, the time TmSft starts counting up.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, the number dNo of rotation of the output shaft stores a value when the shift command is generated in a memory as dNo-s.
      <br/>
      Here, an accuracy of detecting a noise and a number of rotation during the rough road travelling is bad when storing the value dNo-s, it is possible to set an average value within a fixed time after the shift command signal s generated.
      <br/>
      When the difference between the values dN0s and dNo becomes greater than the disengage time recognizing level cTqLv1, the disengage time recognizing flag is set.
      <br/>
      When the disengage time recognizing flag is set, the hydraulic pressure command value of the disengaged side clutch becomes the minimum value, whereby the hydraulic pressure of the disengaged side clutch is reduced.
      <br/>
      Further, when the value TmSft reaches a disengage time finishing time tTmTq-e, the forcibly disengaging flag is set.
      <br/>
      At this time, in the case that the disengage timing can not recognized by the changing rate of the number of rotation of the output shaft, when the forcibly disengaging flag is set as shown by a single-dot chain line in FIG. 8, the disengaging time recognizing flag is simultaneously set and the operation is performed so that the hydraulic pressure command value of the disengage side clutch becomes the minimum value.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the operation mentioned above, it is possible to securely prevent the miss-recognition of the torque phase starting time during the rough road travelling.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      FIG. 9 is an example of a map of the forcibly disengaging operation determining portion 136 shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      A throttle valve opening is set to a horizontal axis and the forcibly disengaging time tTmTq-e is stored at each of the throttle valve openings.
      <br/>
      Here, an optimum disengaging time (the torque phase starting time) is dependent upon the hydraulic pressure of the clutch to be fixed.
      <br/>
      When disengaging the clutch after exceeding the disengaging time, a torque change (a longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle) shown by a broken line in FIG. 5 is generated.
      <br/>
      This torque change becomes greater as the exceeding time is longer, and apply a feeling of physical disorder to the driver as a shift shock.
      <br/>
      Then, the shift is executed at each of the throttle valve openings so as to previously determine a limit time so that the torque change is 0.2 G or less in accordance with a tuning and store it as the map data.

    <p num="40">In FIG. 10, the controller 131A has processing functions of the shift command generating portion 132, the disengaging time recognizing portion 133, the disengaging operation determining portion 134, a disengaging time recognition inhibiting portion 201, the pressure adjusting command generating portion 135 and the forcibly disengaging operation determining portion 136 as the control unit of the automatic transmission in accordance with the present embodiment.</p>
    <p num="41">
      In the shift command generating portion 132 generates the shift command signal on the basis of the throttle valve opening  THETA  and the number of rotation of the output shaft of the transmission (the vehicle speed).
      <br/>
      The disengaging time recognizing portion 133 recognizes a disengaging time of the disengaged side friction device.
      <br/>
      In the case of recognizing the disengage time, the disengaging operation determining portion 134 outputs the minimum value of the hydraulic pressure command value to the pressure adjusting command generating portion 135 so as to disengage the disengaged side friction device.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Here, in the case that the recognition is inhibited by the disengaging time recognition inhibiting portion 201, the disengaging operation command signal of the disengaging operation determining portion 134 is ignored.
      <br/>
      Then, in the case that the disengaging time can not be recognized by the disengaging time recognizing portion 133, the minimum value of the hydraulic pressure command value is output to the pressure adjusting command generating portion 135 so that the clutch disengaging operation is forcibly executed by the forcibly disengaging operation determining portion 136.
    </p>
    <p num="43">In accordance with the structure mentioned above, in the same manner as that of the first embodiment, it is possible to securely disengage the friction device even in the case that the optimum disengaging time can not be recognized, for example, due to the rough road travelling so as to prevent the shift characteristic from deteriorating, and further, it is possible to solve the problem that the optimum disengaging time is erroneously recognized, for example, due to the rough road travelling or the like and the early disengaging operation is executed.</p>
    <p num="44">
      FIG. 11 is a time chart which explains an operation of the second embodiment.
      <br/>
      When the shift command signal is generated, the time TmSft starts counting up and a recognition inhibiting flag is set.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, the number dNo of rotation of the output shaft stores a value when the shift command is generated in a memory as dNo-s.
      <br/>
      Here, an accuracy of detecting a noise and a number of rotation during the rough road travelling is bad when storing the value dNo-s, it is possible to set an average value within a fixed time after the shift command signal s generated.
      <br/>
      When the difference between the values dN0-s and dNo becomes greater than the disengage time recognizing level cTqLv1, the disengage time recognizing flag is set.
      <br/>
      Here, as shown in FIG. 11, even when the difference mentioned above becomes greater than the level mentioned above while the recognition inhibiting flag is set, the disengage time recognizing flag is not set as an erroneous recognition of the disengaging time.
      <br/>
      When the value TmSft becomes more than a disengaging time recognition inhibiting time tTmTq-s, the forcible flag mentioned above is reset and the disengaging time recognition becomes effective at the dNo signal mentioned above.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the operation mentioned above, it is possible to securely prevent the erroneous recognition of the torque phase starting time during the rough road travelling and prevent the number of rotation from blowing up due to the early disengaging operation.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      FIG. 12 is an example of a map of the disengaging time recognition inhibiting portion 201 shown in FIG. 10. A throttle valve opening is set to a horizontal axis and the disengaging time recognition inhibiting time tTmTq-s is stored at each of the throttle valve openings.
      <br/>
      Here, as mentioned above, an optimum disengaging time (the torque phase starting time) is dependent upon the hydraulic pressure of the clutch to be fixed.
      <br/>
      When disengaging the clutch before the disengaging time, a blowing-up of the number of rotation shown by a single-dot chain line in FIG. 5 is generated and applies a feeling of physical disorder to the driver.
      <br/>
      Then, the shift is executed at each of the throttle valve openings so as to previously determine a time so that the blowing-up of the number of rotation is not generated in accordance with a tuning and store it as the map data.
    </p>
    <p num="46">As mentioned above, in accordance with a combination of the method of recognizing the disengaging time and the method of preventing the erroneous recognition or the miss-recognition due to the former method, a reliable clutch shifting control can be realized, so that it is possible to prevent the shift characteristic from deteriorating and the clutch from deteriorating.</p>
    <p num="47">
      FIG. 13 shows a third embodiment in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 13 is an idiomatic view of a structure of an automotive vehicle in accordance with the present invention, however, the contents of the controller 131 (or 131A) in FIG. 13 are the same as those shown in FIG. 1 or 10, and are omitted.
      <br/>
      The engine 101, the automatic transmission 130 and the controller 131 (or 131A) mentioned above are mounted to an automotive vehicle 301 in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The automotive vehicle 301 is structured such that the shift characteristic is not deteriorated and a comfortable shift feeling can be always obtained because the disengaging time of the disengaged side friction device is optimally controlled by the controller 131 (or 131A) mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p num="48">In accordance with the present invention, in the automatic transmission which executes the shift by engaging or disengaging a predetermined friction device, it is possible to securely prevent a tie-up due to a miss-recognition of the disengage timing of the disengage side friction device and always realize a control of accurately and reliably shifting the clutch at an optimum timing.</p>
    <p num="49">Further, in accordance with the present invention, in the automatic transmission which executes the shift by engaging or disengaging a predetermined friction device, it is possible to securely prevent the early disengage due to the erroneous recognition of the disengage timing of the disengaged side friction device or the tie-up due to the miss-recognition thereof and always realize a control of accurately and reliably shifting the clutch.</p>
