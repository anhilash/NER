    <p num="1">The present invention relates generally to LCD semiconductor devices, and more specifically to reflective type LCD-on-silicon semiconductor devices.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      LCD-on-silicon devices, or reflective type display LCD devices, need to be illuminated with high intensity light.
      <br/>
      Stray light leaking through the gaps between metal lines/pixels may cause the bottom, or control, transistors to malfunction by the photoelectric effect.
      <br/>
      This phenomenon limits the brightness of the projected image to lessen the risk/effects of the photoelectric effect on the bottom transistors.
    </p>
    <p num="3">U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,827 to Kobayashi et al. describes a passivation film CMP polishing method used in the fabrication of reflective type active matrix LCD display panels.</p>
    <p num="4">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,203,792 to Thompson describes a method of fabricating a dome shaped transparent polymer material within which is an opto-isolator, or optically coupled isolator.
      <br/>
      The method provides for an initial gelling of the multicomponent polymer material so that the desired dome shape may be retained while a heat cure is performed.
      <br/>
      An opaque body of polymer, adapted for diffusely reflecting light, can be used to enclose the dome shaped transparent polymer material.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,926,702 to Kwon et al. describes a method of fabricating a TFT (thin film transistor) array substrate having a black matrix (light shielding layer) to generally shield the TFT, data bus line and gate bus line of the lower substrate of an LCD (liquid crystal display) to prevent light leakage.
      <br/>
      A transparent planarization layer is used to reduce the step height near the boundaries of the black matrix resin and the pixel electrode (overlying the transparent planarization layer).
      <br/>
      This reduces the poor rubbing problem otherwise present near the boundaries between the black matrix and the pixel electrode.

    <p num="6">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,663 to Oh et al. describes a liquid crystal display (LCD) and a method of making same where a black matrix region is formed over a orientation layer that is evenly formed on the surface of the TFT panel.
      <br/>
      The orientation layer is formed and rubbed to form regular microgrooves on its surface which serve to align liquid crystal molecules for selectively transmitting light.
      <br/>
      The black matrix is then formed over the rubbed orientation layer so that the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules within 1 to 2  MU m around the black matrix region is substantially carried out thus increasing the contrast ratio and enhancing picture quality.

      U.S. Pat. No. 5,851,411 to An et al. describes a method of manufacturing an LCD display that includes first and second substrates each having an inner light shielding region and an edge light shielding region.

      U.S. Pat. No. 5,850,271 to Kim et al. describes a color filter substrate for an LCD device that is obtained by patterning color filters on a transparent substrate, selective-coating an overcoat layer on the substrate, and forming a common electrode and a black matrix to be connected to each other without any further steps.
      <br/>
      The black matrix is comprised of an opaque metal such as aluminum (Al) or chromium (Cr).

    <p num="9">
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,781,254 and 5,784,133, both to Kim et al., describe an LCD, and a method of making same, respectively, having a top plate and a bottom plate.
      <br/>
      The bottom plate includes a plurality of gate bus lines and drain bus lines arranged in a matrix on a substrate surface with a plurality of TFTs formed at the intersections of the gate and drain bus lines.
      <br/>
      A black matrix pattern, including a non-conductive black resin, is provided on the gate and drain bus lines and the TFTs for shielding them from light generated by back lighting the display.
      <br/>
      A protective layer is formed on the black matrix pattern having contact holes for coupling the pixel electrodes to corresponding drain electrodes of the TFTs.

    <p num="17">Problem solved by the invention</p>
    <p num="18">
      An original configuration LCD-on-silicon device 110 known by the inventors (not to be considered as prior art and not the invention) is shown in FIG. 1.

    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Tungsten (W) S/D plugs 124A, 124B are formed within S/D contact openings 128A, 124B, respectively, within interlevel dielectric (ILD) layer 126 and connect to source 118 and drain 120, respectively, of control transistor 114.

      Stray light 156 then passes through IMD layer 132 and through the gap between M1 metal lines 130B, 130C, reflecting off the side of M1 metal line 130B.
      <br/>
      Stray light 156 then passes through ILD layer 126 and impinges upon the control transistor 114 causing it to malfunction due to the photoelectric effect.

      The metal layer is chemical-mechanical polished to form additional M2 portion 38A abutting black dielectric sidewall spacers 70A, 70B between upper M2 metal lines 37A, 37B of dual damascene structures 36A, 36B, respectively; and additional M2 metal portion 38B abutting the other black dielectric spacer 70B on upper M2 metal line 37B.
      <br/>
      This forms light and signal shielding layer 80 that prevents any stray light from impinging upon gate electrode 16 as will be discussed below.
    </p>
    <p num="46">Upper M2 metal islands 37A, 37B are separated from adjacent additional M2 metal lines 38A, 38B by only about from 0.05 to 0.2  MU m, and more preferably about 0.1  MU m--the width of black dielectric sidewall spacers 70A, 70B.</p>
    <p num="47">As shown in FIG. 6, M2 intermetal dielectric (IMD) layer 40 is formed and patterned over W M2 metal structures 37A, 38A, 37B, 38B to form M2 contact openings 42A, 42B exposing M2 metal islands 37A, 37B.</p>
    <p num="48">M2 IMD layer 40 is preferably comprised of black dielectric.</p>
    <p num="49">
      A metal layer, such as Al, aluminum silicon alloys (AlSi) or Ti, and most preferably W, is deposited and planarized over M2 IMD layer 40, filling M2 contact openings 42A, 42B and forming M2 W plugs 44A, 44B, respectively.
      <br/>
      M2 W plugs 44A, 44B are about 0.5  MU m high as at 45 for example.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Another metal layer, such as Al or AlCuSi, and most preferably an aluminum copper alloy (AlCu), is deposited and patterned over M2 IMD layer 40 to form M3 metal pixels 46A, 46B, 46C.

      M3 metal pixels 46A, 46B, 46C are spaced apart by from about 0.5 to 0.7  MU m and more preferably by 0.6  MU m as at 50, for example.
      <br/>
      M3 metal pixel 46A, for example, connects to M2 W plug 44A.
      <br/>
      M3 metal pixel 46B, for example, connects to M2 W plug 44B.
      <br/>
      Pixels 46A, 46B, 46C serve as LCD electrodes as well as mirrors.
    </p>
    <p num="51">If not comprised of black dielectric, IMD layers 32, 40 may be comprised of silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, or polyimide.</p>
    <p num="52">The total thickness, as at 52, of the original configuration LCD-on-silicon device is from about 1 to 5  MU m, and more preferably from about 2 to 3  MU m, from semiconductor structure 12 to the top of M3 metal pixels 46A, 46B, 46C.</p>
    <p num="53">
      Optical interface layer 54 is then formed over M3 metal pixels 46A, 46B, 46C to complete the reflective type LCD-on-silicon device 10.
      <br/>
      Optical interface layer 54 may include (not shown) single or multiple transparent passivation layers of SiO2, Si3 N4, etc., over M3 pixels 46A, 46B, 146 and aids in reflection enhancement of M3 pixels 46A, 46B, 46C.

      A polyimide orientation layer (not shown) is formed over optical interface layer 54.

      A transparent electrode (not shown) is formed over, and spaced apart from, the polyimide orientation layer.
      <br/>
      A layer of liquid crystal (not shown) is placed between the transparent electrode and the polyimide orientation layer.

      The interconnect, metal lines and plugs described in this patent can be formed by any means and is not limited as described above.
      <br/>
      For example, the lines/plugs can also be formed using a dual damascene technique (and using an etchback of the dielectric layer to expose the sidewalls of the line) or a borderless contact process.
      <br/>
      Other methods may be used as technology advances.
      <br/>
      Also, the sidewall spacers (e.g., 70A) and the light blocking layer (e.g., 38A) can be formed on any line level and is not limited to the 2nd metal line level.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      One or more light shielding layers (line, spacer and shield layer) can be formed.

      Also, the invention is not limited to 3 conductive (e.g., metal) layers.

    <p num="57">
      The reflective type LCD-on-silicon device 10 of the present invention does not permits stray light to leak from optical interface layer 54 as shown at 56, for example, to control transistor 14.
      <br/>
      If IMD layers 32, 40 are formed of black dielectric, most of the stray light 56 is absorbed by the black dielectric of IMD layer 40.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      If IMD layers 32, 40 are not formed of black dielectric, any stray light 56, for example, passes between M3 metal lines 46A, 46B, through IMD layer 40, reflects off the top of M2 metal line 38A, then the bottom of M3 metal lines 46B.
      <br/>
      However, most of the stay light 56 may not pass through the gap between M2 metal lines 38A, 37B not only because of the narrow gap (about 0.1  MU m) between those M2 metal lines, but also due to black dielectric sidewall spacer 70B between those M2 metal lines.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Control transistor 14 is protected from the photoelectric effect even if sidewall spacers 70A, 70B are formed of a transparent material, such as SiO2, for example, because: black dielectric layer 40 greatly reduces the intensity of any stray light 56; and the gaps between M2 structures 36A, 38A; 38A, 37B; and 37B, 38B, respectively, are much narrower than in the conventional structures/methods without using advanced photolithography techniques, which further reduces any stray light 56 from penetrating to control transistor 14.
      <br/>
      The smaller gap formation are due to the double deposition of the W films to form islands 37A, 37B and metal portions 38A, 38B of the single sheet W layer.
    </p>
    <p num="60">Since stray light impingement upon control transistor 14 is minimized or eliminated with the novel design of the present invention, control transistor 14 will not malfunction due to the photoelectric effect, and the light intensity falling on LCD-on-silicon device 10 may be increased therefore allowing for increased brightness of the projected image or increased maximum size of the projected image.</p>
