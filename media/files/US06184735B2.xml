      A variable delay circuit comprises: a variable delay part having n (&gt;=2) cascade-connected delay parts, each of which has a delay element, a selecting circuit for selecting whether an input signal is allowed to pass through the delay element, and an OR gate for outputting an output of the selected delay element or the input signal; and a control part for selecting at least one of the plurality of delay parts on the basis of desired delay time information to transmit a control signal for operating so that the selecting circuit in the selected delay part selects a corresponding one of the delay elements, wherein a designed delay time value Dk of the delay element of a number k (1&lt;=k&lt;=n) delay part meets the following conditions.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to provide a smaller circuit scale of a variable delay circuit.

      <br/>
      Field of The Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to a variable delay circuit.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of The Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">Referring to FIGS. 3 through 8, some examples of conventional variable delay circuits will be described below.</p>
    <p num="5">
      The construction of a first conventional variable delay circuit 20 is shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      This variable delay circuit is called a current stubbed inverter comprising P-channel MOS transistors 22, 23 and N-channel MOS transistors 24, 25, and widely used for PLL circuits, DLL circuits and so forth.
      <br/>
      The variable delay circuit 20 is designed so that a charging current of a load capacity supplied from a power supply 28 by controlling voltages Vcp, Vcn, which are applied to the gates of the transistors 22, 25 when a trailing edge signal is inputted to an input terminal 21, is changed by ON resisters R of the transistors 22, 25 and a parasitic capacity C to optionally set a delay time of a leading edge signal appearing at an output terminal 27.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the voltage Vcn is an inverted signal of the voltage Vcp.

      The construction of a fifth conventional variable delay circuit is shown in FIG. 7.

      This delay circuit has a plurality of delay parts 51, . . . , 5n which are cascade-connected.
      <br/>
      Each of the delay parts 5i (i=1, . . . , n) comprises a delay element 3i, a multiplexer 2i for selecting whether an input signal is allowed to pass through the delay element 3i and an OR gate 4i for transmitting an output of the selected delay element or the input signal to the subsequent stage of delay part.

    <p num="13">
      Even if the fifth conventional variable delay circuit is used, it is not ensured to obtain a desired delay time.
      <br/>
      The delay time of the variable delay circuit is determined by the set value Span of the maximum delay time and a resolution (the minimum delay time) Res.
      <br/>
      An optional delay time thus obtained is about integer times as large as the resolution Res.
    </p>
    <p num="14">A conventional example of a variable delay circuit capable of solving the problem of the fifth conventional variable delay circuit will be described as a sixth conventional variable delay circuit.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The construction of the sixth conventional variable delay circuit will be described in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      This delay circuit is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2582250. This delay circuit is formed by providing the variable delay circuit of FIG. 7 with a control circuit 6 for controlling each stage of multiplexer.
      <br/>
      In order to obtain a desired delay time, the set delay time value Dk of each delay element 3k (k=1, . . . , n) is defined so as to satisfy the following formulae.  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      wherein when
      <br/>
      k=1, D1 =+Res/(1+da)}/(1+dr)  (1b)
    </p>
    <p num="17">wherein Res is a resolution of a variable delay circuit, da being an absolute value of an absolute error at a designed delay time Dk, and dr being an absolute value of a relative error.</p>
    <p num="18">
      The actual delay time value of each delay element 3k is equal to the designed value if there is no error, and the characteristic thereof is shown by line g0 in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      However, this characteristic varies due to the variation in producing process, the fluctuation of working environment (temperature and power supply voltage) and so forth, so that the characteristic is included in a region between lines g1 and g2 in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      This region of the variation in characteristic corresponds to the absolute error da (see FIG. 9).
      <br/>
      Even in the case of substantially the same characteristic, there is a variation of the characteristic as shown by points P1, P2 in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      This variation corresponds to the relative error dr.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In the sixth conventional variable delay circuit, as can be seen from formulae (1a) and (1b), the set delay time value Dk of each delay elements 3k (k=1, . . , n) is derived on the basis of the preset resolution Res, the absolute error da and the relative error dr.
      <br/>
      In this case, the designed delay time values are sequentially derived in order of smaller value.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Thus, each delay element 3k (k=1, . . . , n) is derived.
      <br/>
      When the maximum delay time derived from the delay times D1, . . . , Dn of the delay elements 31, . . . , 3n is smaller than the predetermined value Span previously given, a delay element 3n+1 is newly added so that the resulting maximum delay time is greater than the predetermined value Span.
      <br/>
      At this time, the delay time of the added delay element 3n+1 is set so as to satisfy formula (1a).
      <br/>
      Therefore, the delay time Dn+1 of the added delay element has a greater value than any delay time values Di (i=1, . . . , n) of other delay elements 31, . . . , 3n. For that reason, there is a problem in that the circuit scale of a variable delay circuit increases.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="34">Referring now to the accompanying drawings, particularly to FIG. 1, the first preferred embodiment of a variable delay circuit according to the present invention will be described below.</p>
    <p num="35">
      In this preferred embodiment, a variable delay circuit comprises a variable delay part including a plurality of delay parts 51, . . . , 5n which are cascade-connected, and a control circuit 6.
      <br/>
      In this preferred embodiment, the delay parts 51, . . . , 5n are numbered so that the subscript of the reference number of a certain stage is smaller than that of the subsequent stage unlike the conventional case shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      Similar to the conventional case, each of the delay parts 5i (i=1, . . . , n) comprises a delay element 3i, a multiplexer 2i for selecting whether an input signal is allowed to the delay element 3i, and an OR gate 4i for transmitting an output of the selected delay element or the input signal to the subsequent stage of delay part.
    </p>
    <p num="36">Then, a set delay time value Dk of each of the delay parts 5k (k=1, . . . , n) is derived by the following formulae (2a) and (2b).  (Equation image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="37">
      wherein when
      <br/>
      k=1, D1 =Span/(1-da)/2
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      when
      <br/>
      k=2,D2 =(Span/(1-da)/2) * (1+dr)/2  (2b)
    </p>
    <p num="39">wherein Span is the set value of the maximum delay time, Res being a resolution, da being an absolute error, and dr being a relative error.</p>
    <p num="40">In this case, the following convergence determining conditions must be met.</p>
    <p num="41">Dn * (1+da) * (1+dr)&lt;Res  (3a)  (Equation image '6' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="42">
      If the above described convergence determining conditions are not met, a delay part 5n+1 is newly provided.
      <br/>
      Then, if the delay time Dn+1 of the delay element 3n+1 of the delay part 5n+1 meets the above described convergence determining conditions, it is completed to provide any additional delay parts, and if the delay time Dn+1 does not meet the conditions, it is continued to provide additional delay parts until the delay time Dn+1 meets the conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      From the delay parts 51 through 5n thus constructed, the control circuit 6 selects one delay part on the basis of desired delay time information.
      <br/>
      Then, in the selected delay part 5j (1 &lt;= j &lt;= n), the multiplexer 2j operates so that the received input signal passes through the delay element 3j.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the above described desired delay time information is coded.
      <br/>
      When the number of stages of delay parts of the variable delay circuit is n, the above described delay information is an n-bit signal.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In the variation delay circuit according to this preferred embodiment, the set delay time value Dk of the delay element 3k of each of the delay parts 5k (k=1, . . . , n) meets the formulae (2a) and (2b).
      <br/>
      That is, the set delay time values of delay elements are sequentially determined in order of greater set value on the basis of the set value Span of the maximum delay time value and the resolution Res.
      <br/>
      Thus, in this preferred embodiment, even if it is required to add a delay part, it is enough to add a delay part having a small set delay time value.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the whole circuit scale can be smaller than that of the conventional variable circuit of FIG. 8 wherein the set delay time values of variable elements are sequentially determined in order of smaller set value.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      This will be described using examples of calculation in this preferred embodiment and conventional case.
      <br/>
      Now, variable delay circuits of a specification having an absolute error da of 0.5, a relative error dr of 0.1, a variable width set value Span of 3875 ps and a resolution Res of 125 ps are designed in this preferred embodiment using the formulae (2a), (2b), (3a) and (3b) and in the conventional example using the formulae (1a) and (1b).
      <br/>
      Then, the number of stages of delay parts is eight, and the set delay time values T1 through T8 of the respective delay parts are shown in the following table.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, Ti =D9-i (i=1, . . . , 8) in this preferred embodiment, and Ti =Di (i=1, . . . , 8) in the conventional example.

    </p>
    <p num="47">
      It can be seen from the above table that the total delay time realized by the whole variable delay circuit is 8536 ps in this preferred embodiment, and 10965 ps in the conventional example.
      <br/>
      Thus, the circuit scale in this preferred embodiment can be smaller than that in the conventional example.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Then, a first modified example of the above described preferred embodiment will be described.
      <br/>
      The formulae (2a), (2b), (3a) and (3b) for use in the above described preferred embodiment do not include every phenomena which may occur in an actual semiconductor integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      That is, the relative error dr varies every delay element.
      <br/>
      In addition, the relative error when the delay time increases is different from the relative error when the delay time decreases.
      <br/>
      Specifically, it is assumed that the first stage of delay element has a delay time of 1 ns in an ideal state, and the second stage of delay element has a delay time of 2 ns in an ideal state.
      <br/>
      It is also assumed that, on the worst condition wherein the delay time increases, the first stage of delay element has a delay time of 1.5 ns whereas the second stage of delay element has a delay time of 2.8 ns, and on the best condition wherein the delay time decreases, the first stage of delay element has a delay time of 0.6 ns whereas the second stage of delay element has a delay time of 1.4 ns. In this case, the relative errors will be as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="49">Relative element on the best side of the first stage of delay element body: drb1=0.4</p>
    <p num="50">Relative element on the worst side of the first stage of delay element body: drw1=0.5</p>

    <p num="52">Relative element on the worst side of the second stage of delay element body: drw2=0.4</p>
    <p num="53">
      Thus, each of the delay elements has different values on the best and worst sides.
      <br/>
      This can not be considered in the above described preferred embodiment.

    <p num="54">Therefore, in the first modified example, the set delay time value Dk of each delay element 3k (k=1, . . . , n) is derived using the following formulas (4a) and (4b) in place of the formulae (2a) and (2b).  (Equation image '7' not included in text)</p>

      In the first preferred embodiment and the first and second modified examples, the desired delay time information to be inputted to the control circuit 8 has been coded.
      <br/>
      When the variable delay circuit comprises n stages of delay parts, the above described delay information is an n-bit signal.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the control circuit 6 has a data table for decoding the n-bit signal.
      <br/>
      Since the number of the delay time information is 2n, there is a problem in that the size of the data table in the control circuit 6 increases to increase the circuit scale as the number of stages of delay parts of the variable delay circuit increases.
      <br/>
      A variable delay circuit for solving this problem will be described as the second preferred embodiment of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      The construction of the second preferred embodiment of a variable delay circuit according to the present invention is shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In the second preferred embodiment, a variable delay circuit comprises variable delay parts 1A, 1B and control circuits 7, 9.
      <br/>
      Each of the variable delay parts 1A, 1B comprises a plurality of delay parts which are cascade-connected as described in the first preferred embodiment.
      <br/>
      The variable delay part 1A is connected to the variable delay 1B in series.
      <br/>
      The sets of the plurality of delay parts constituting the variable delay parts 1A, 1B are the same as those in any one of the first preferred embodiment and the first and second modified examples.
      <br/>
      That is, the plurality of stages of delay parts in any one of the first preferred embodiment and the first and second modified examples are put in the proper order, and a circuit thus formed is divided into the two variable delay parts 1A and 1B.
    </p>
    <p num="74">Now, it is assumed that the number of stages of delay parts of the variable delay part 1A is m (2 &lt;= m &lt;= n-2), and the number of stages of delay parts of the variable delay 1B is n-m.</p>
    <p num="75">
      The control circuit 7 selects a suitable one from the delay parts constituting the variable delay part 1A on the basis of the upper m bits of corded n-bit desired delay time information.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the control circuit 7 also has a table including information (which will be hereinafter referred to as "error information") on the difference between the designed delay time value obtained from the selected delay part and an actual delay time, and outputs the error information on the basis of the upper m bits of the coded n-bit delay time information.
    </p>
    <p num="76">The control circuit 9 selects a suitable on from the delay parts constituting the variable delay part 1B on the basis of the lower n-m bits of the n-bit delay time information and the error information.</p>
    <p num="77">
      Furthermore, in the second preferred embodiment, assuming that the variable width and resolution of the variable delay part 1A are span 1 and res1, respectively, and the variable width and resolution of the variable delay part 1B are span2 and res2, respectively, the variable width and resolution of the variable delay circuit being SPAN and RES, respectively, and the error information being ERR, then, it is required to meet the following conditions.
      <br/>
      res2&lt;res1&lt;span2
      <br/>
      ERR+res2&lt;RES
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      In the second preferred embodiment, the control circuit 7 has a data table for decoding m-bit signals, and the control circuit 9 has a data table for decoding n-m bit signals.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the second preferred embodiment, the size of the data table is 2m +2n-m.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in the first preferred embodiment, the size of the data table of the control circuit 6 is 2n, and 2n &gt;2m +2n-m.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the size of the data table in the second preferred embodiment can be smaller than that in the first preferred embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="79">Also in the second preferred embodiment similar to the first preferred embodiment, the circuit scale can be smaller than the conventional case.</p>
    <p num="80">As described above, according to the present invention, it is possible to reduce the circuit scale size.</p>
    <p num="81">
      While the present invention has been disclosed in terms of the preferred embodiment in order to facilitate better understanding thereof, it should be appreciated that the invention can be embodied in various ways without departing from the principle of the invention.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the invention should be understood to include all possible embodiments and modification to the shown embodiments which can be embodied without departing from the principle of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.
