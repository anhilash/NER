    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">

      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a multi-laser scanning unit (LSU) capable of diffracting and scanning light incident from a plurality of light sources, and more particularly, to a multi-LSU in which a plurality of scanning lines (rays) are directionally the same and incident onto an image of a photoreceptor.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In general, a multi-LSU is adopted in a color printer and is used to form a plurality of latent electrostatic images required to develop a color image in combination with a plurality of colors including yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), black (K), and the like.
      <br/>
      In this case, a plurality of scanning lines scanned by the multi-LSU and incident onto a photoreceptor such as a photosensitive belt or photosensitive drum, must be parallel at predetermined intervals, such that scanning directions of the plurality of scanning lines are parallel each other.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Referring to FIGS. 1 through 3, a conventional multi-LSU capable of generating four scanning lines corresponding to the colors Y, M, C and K, includes a driving source 11 for providing a rotatory force, a deflection disk 15 having a plurality of sectors each with a hologram pattern 15a, and a light source unit 20 which is arranged facing one surface of the deflection disk 15 and which radiates light onto the deflection disk 15.
      <br/>
      The light source unit 20 includes four light sources 21, 23, 25 and 27, which irradiate light onto four incident points S1, S2, S3 and S4, respectively, wherein each pair of points adjacent to each other form a right angle at the rotary center of the deflection disk 15.
      <br/>
      Also, the four incident points S1, S2, S3 and S4, are placed with equal radii from the rotary center of the deflection disk 15.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The incident light lines are diffracted by the hologram patterns 15a by rotation of the deflection disk 15 and form scanning lines L11, L21, L31 and L41 in the directions indicated by the arrow ( --&gt; ).
      <br/>
      Here, the scanning lines L11 and L31 are parallel (to the Y-axis) and are opposite in direction.
      <br/>
      Also, the scanning lines L21 and L41, perpendicular to the scanning lines L11 and L31, are parallel (to the X-axis) and are opposite in direction.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Traveling paths of the scanning lines L11, L21, L31 and L41 are changed by a plurality of mirrors such that the centers of the scanning lines travel along the X-axis.
      <br/>
      That is, the scanning line L11 is reflected by a mirror M1 to travel in the X-axis direction, and the scanning line L21 is reflected by a mirror M21 toward the rotary center of the deflection disk 15 and then reflected again by a mirror M22 positioned on the rotary center of the deflection disk 15 to travel in the X-axis direction.
      <br/>
      Also, the scanning line L31 is reflected by a mirror M3 to travel in the X-axis direction, and the scanning line L41 is reflected by a mirror M41 toward the rotary center of the deflection disk 15 and reflected again by a mirror M42 positioned on the rotary center of the deflection disk 15 to travel in the X-axis direction.

    <p num="8">
      Scanning directions of scanning lines L12, L22, L32 and L42, scanning in the X-axis direction after being reflected by the mirrors M1, M21, M22, M3, M41 and M42, are indicated by the arrow ( --&gt; ) in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the scanning lines L12, L22 and L42, have the same scanning directions, but the direction of the scanning line L32 is opposite to that of the scanning lines L12, L22 and L42.
    </p>
    <p num="9">That is, in the case of using a plurality of mirrors and post-holographic optical elements to change the traveling path of the light, after being reflected by the mirrors M1, M22, M3 and M42, the plurality of scanning lines are parallel in scanning directions for a photoreceptor, but the direction of the scanning line L32 is still opposite to that of the others.</p>
    <p num="10">
      Thus, when forming an image on the photoreceptor, image information must be compensated for in the circuitry due to the different scanning directions.
      <br/>
      That is, the light source 25 providing the scanning line L32 must transfer the image data in the opposite direction to match the image provided by the remaining light sources 21, 23 and 27.
      <br/>
      That is, there is a disadvantage in that the light sources 21, 23 and 27 provide image information in the direction indicated by X while the light source 25 provides image information in the direction indicated by .circle-w/dot. as shown in FIG. 3, so that image data processing is complicated.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="14">Referring to FIGS. 4 through 7, a multi-laser scanning unit (LSU) according to the present invention includes a driving source 31 for providing a rotatory force, a deflection disk 35 having a plurality of sectors 35a each with a hologram pattern, a light source unit 40 which is arranged facing the bottom of the deflection disk 35 and irradiates beams onto the deflection disk 35, and a light path changing means for changing a traveling direction of the light diffracted and scanned by the deflection disk 35.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The light source unit 40 includes a plurality of light sources corresponding to each color, and preferably the light lines (rays) irradiated by the light sources are incident onto the deflection disk 35 such that two incident points which are the farthest from each other are located at an angle of 180 (degree)  at the rotary center of the deflection disk 35.
      <br/>
      Also, the light lines emitted by the plurality of light sources are incident onto incident points of the deflection disk which are arranged at the same intervals and form circles of equal radii and have the same center points which are the rotary center of the deflection disk 35.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The light source unit 40 may include first through fourth light sources 41, 43, 45 and 47 corresponding to the colors of yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C) and black (K).
      <br/>
      In this case, the light lines irradiated by the first through fourth light sources 41, 43, 45 and 47, are incident onto predetermined points S1 ', S2 ', S3 ' and S4 ' of the deflection disk 35.
      <br/>
      Here, the incident points S1 ', S2 ', S3 ' and S4 ', form circles of the same radii R centered around the rotary center of the deflection disk 35, and two incident points which are the farthest from each other, i.e., irradiated by the first and fourth light sources 41 and 47, form an angle of 180 (degree)  or less at the center point C of the deflection disk 35.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the incident points S1 ', S2 ', S3 ' and S4 ' are located at the same intervals along the circles with the same radii R.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Here, the incident points S1 ', S2 ', S3 ' and S4 ' on the deflection disk 35, irradiated by the first through fourth light sources 41, 43, 45 and 47, pass the center point of the deflection disk 35 and the incident points S1 ' and S4 ', and S2 ' and S3 ' are symmetrical with respect to the X-axis (the light traveling direction).
      <br/>
      Also, the incident points S1 ', S2 ', S3 ' and S4 ' are located at the same intervals with the same angles at the center point C between adjacent incident points with, i.e.,  THETA 12 = THETA 23 = THETA 34 =60 (degree) , and the angle between the incident points S1 ' and S4 ' which are the farthest from each other, i.e.,  THETA 12 + THETA 23 + THETA 34, is equal to 180 (degree) .
    </p>
    <p num="18">As described above, by defining the location of the light incident points onto the deflection disk 35, the centers of the scanning lines are in the same scanning direction along the X-axis after being reflected by a plurality of mirrors comprising the light path changing means, which will be described later.</p>
    <p num="19">That is, the scanning lines L1, L2, L3 and L4, are diffracted and scanned by the deflection disk 35 in the direction indicated by the arrow ( --&gt; ) and then the light traveling path is changed by the light path changing means such that the centers of the scanning lines L1, L2, L3 and L4, travel along the X-axis.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Here, the light path change means includes a plurality of planar mirrors M12', M21 ', M22 ', M31 ', M32 ', M41 ', and M42 '. The scanning line L1 is reflected by the planar mirrors M11 ' and M12 ' in sequence such that the center of the scanning line travels in the X-axis direction and the scanning direction thereof is in the -Y-axis direction (the direction indicated by the arrow .arrow-down dbl. of FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      Also, the scanning lines L2 and L4 are reflected by the planar mirrors M21 ' and M22 ', and M41 ' and M42 ', respectively, in sequence such that the center of the scanning line travels in the X-axis and the scanning direction thereof is in the -Y-axis direction (the direction indicated by the arrow .arrow-down dbl. of FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      The scanning line L3 is reflected by the planar mirrors M31 ' and M32 ' in sequence such that the center of the scanning line travels in the X-axis and the scanning direction thereof is in the -Y-axis direction (the direction indicated by the arrow .arrow-down dbl. of FIG. 5).
    </p>
    <p num="21">Preferably, as shown in FIG. 7, the light path changing means further comprises a plurality of planar mirrors M other than the above-mentioned mirrors, curved mirrors CM1, CM2, CM3 and CM4, and holographic optical elements HOE1, HOE2, HOE3 and HOE4.</p>
    <p num="22">The planar mirrors M reflect four scanning lines L1, L2, L3 and L4 with the scanning direction of -Y-axis and serves light traveling paths corresponding to each scan region on a photoreceptor 60.</p>
    <p num="23">The curved mirrors CM1, CM2, CM3 and CM4 converge and reflect the scanning lines incident via the plurality of the planar mirrors M such that the scanning lines become parallel, and correct bowing of the scanning lines which is due to diffraction of the incident light by the hologram pattern and rotation of the deflection disk 35.</p>
    <p num="24">The holographic optical elements HOE1, HOE2, HOE3 and HOE4 diffract and transmit the incident scanning lines at a predetermined angle such that the scanning lines head toward the photoreceptor 60 to be incident at a nearly right angle onto the photoreceptor 60.</p>
    <p num="25">
      In the multi-LSU according to the present invention, the incident points of the light lines onto the deflection disk are controlled in 180 (degree)  or less with the rotary center of the deflection disk.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is not necessary to correct the scanning directions of the plurality of scanning lines formed by the deflection disk to the same direction and it is not necessary to invert the image signal in circuitry.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Also, by defining the location of the incident points of the light lines onto the deflection disk in 180 (degree)  or less, the size of the plurality of planar mirrors M11 ', M12 ', M21 ', M22 ', M31 ', M32 ', M41 ', and M42 ', can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Also, by arranging the planar mirrors as shown in FIG. 7, the centers of the four scanning lines reflected by the planar mirrors M12 ', M22 ', M32 ' and M42 ', can be matched with the rotary center of the deflection disk.
    </p>
    <p num="27">It is contemplated that numerous modifications may be made to the apparatus and procedure of the invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.</p>
