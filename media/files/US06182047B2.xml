      A computer system (100) for providing a medical information log system (202).
      <br/>
      A mouse (107) and/or a keyboard (106) is used to input data (400) for various medical log entries.
      <br/>
      These log entries are associated with a medical visit, and they contain information related to the doctor (1020) and the type of said medical visit (1040).
      <br/>
      Each medical visit has only one log entry associated with it.
      <br/>
      The inputted data is stored within an organized database located in the computer's memory (103, 108).
      <br/>
      The computer's controller (101) is used to track the inputted data for various desired information.
      <br/>
      This information can be used for record keeping, outcome analysis, research, teaching, quality assurance, and/or billing.
      <br/>
      The inputted data is displayed on display (105) when desired.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">The present invention is directed to a medical information log system, and more particularly to advanced features in a surgical operative log system.</p>
    <p num="4">
      The ReSOLution package from Information Science Associates (ISA) is a DOS based program created specifically for the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and Residency Review Committee (RRC) for surgery.
      <br/>
      The program is not network compatible, is not cross-platform capable, and does not incorporate Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) menus or coding for forms for the American College of Surgeons (ACS).
      <br/>
      CPT is a standard numerical coding scheme.
      <br/>
      Its specific advantage is that it can download information directly to ACGME/RRC reporting diskettes which are the required method of reporting operative data by surgical residents and surgical training programs to the ACGME and RCC.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Summit from Summit Medical is a specific package for tracking pre, peri, and post operative variables, as well as outcomes for cardiothoracic surgery.
      <br/>
      While fairly comprehensive, its specific disadvantages are that it is expensive, not cross-platform capable, and does not address the specific needs of cardiothoracic residents.
      <br/>
      Specifically, it does not attempt to assist cardiothoracic surgery residents with completing required forms for the American Board of Thoracic Surgery certification (ABTS--the RCC equivalent for cardiothoracic surgery).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The TRACS package was designed specifically to track trauma and, to a less extent, critical care patients on surgical services.
      <br/>
      This package does not do coding for the RRC or the ACS, and does not cover any areas of General Surgery other than trauma, let alone other surgical specialties.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Surgical Procedure Log (tm)  (SPL) from Medical Software Solutions, Inc. is a member of the FileMaker Database market.
      <br/>
      Databases were created in FileMaker Pro, and these databases were applied to multiple specialties.
      <br/>
      FileMaker has major problems when dealing with large databases.
      <br/>
      For example, the current FileMaker version does not support files larger than 32 MByte (about 32K operations).
      <br/>
      In addition, SPL does not incorporate ACS coding forms.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The package from the American College of Surgeons (ACS) includes a program written in FoxPro (Windows version only) limited to general cancer database (outcomes package).
      <br/>
      This is not an operative log, and it does not generate RRC, ACS, or similar reports.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      VascuBase for Vascular Surgeons from Consensus Medical Systems, Inc. is a surgical log and outcomes package for vascular surgeons only.
      <br/>
      This package includes statistics and some graphics, but it does not generate report forms for residents for the RRC.
      <br/>
      Thus, this package is limited by specialty and directed at practicing surgeons, but not surgeons in training (residents).
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Most surgical log systems are for full departments only.
      <br/>
      Thus, a system for either a full department or individual use is needed.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a system which functions across multiple specialties is desirable.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      In the preferred embodiment, the present invention utilizes a computer system to provide a medical information log system.
      <br/>
      A mouse and/or a keyboard is used to input data for various medical log entries.
      <br/>
      These log entries are associated with a medical visit, and they contain information related to the doctor and the type of said medical visit.
      <br/>
      Each medical visit has only one log entry associated with it.
      <br/>
      The inputted data is stored within an organized database located in the computer's memory.
      <br/>
      The computer's controller is used to track the inputted data for various information.
      <br/>
      This information includes record keeping, outcome analysis, research, teaching, quality assurance, and/or billing.
      <br/>
      The inputted data is displayed when desired.
    </p>

      <br/>
      Software system 200 is stored in system memory 103 and on disk memory 108.
      <br/>
      Software system 200 programs the central processor 102 to display a graphic user interface (GUI) on display monitor 105.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, software interface 203 provides an interface between a user 206, an operating system 201, and a computer application 202.
      <br/>
      It will be apparent that one of ordinary skill in the art, informed by this application, could implement the invention in other operating environments.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In the preferred embodiment, computer application 202 is a surgical operative log system written to use the FoxPro database engine.
      <br/>
      This operative log system can also be written to use the Filemaker database engine, and the like.
      <br/>
      Computer application 202 is compatible with DOS, UNIX, Mac and Windows systems.
      <br/>
      While a surgical operative log system is provided in the preferred embodiment, the present invention also provides a log system for any type of medical information including medical visits, minor medical procedures, and medical operations.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      FIG. 3 is a process flowchart for the various functions provided by the computer application.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, there is a correspondence between functions and screens displayed on display device 105, but it is understood that the functions may be organized and implemented in other ways, even without the use of screens.
      <br/>
      For example, information requesting prompts could be provided to the user on a printer.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      When a user begins operative log computer application 202, the first screen displayed on display device 105 is Case Counter Opening Screen 310.
      <br/>
      From Case Counter Opening Screen 310, The user can choose to proceed to Password Screen 313.
      <br/>
      At Password Screen 313, if the user types the correct password in response to a prompt, he can proceed to Main Menu 316.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      From Main Menu 316, the user can choose to proceed to Main Data Entry Screen 319.
      <br/>
      At Main Data Entry Screen 319, the user can enter data for operation(s).
      <br/>
      This data can include, for each operation, the following: Patient First Name, Patient Middle Name, Patient Last Name, Patient Initials, Patient Date of Birth, Patient Age, Patient Medical Record Number, Patient Sex, Date of operation, Outpatient Arrival Indicator, Operative Note Dictated Indicator, Inpatient Indicator, Brief Operative Description, CPT Code, CPT Text Description, RRC Category, RRC CPT Code, RRC Procedure Description, RRC Pediatric/Trauma Indicator, Surgical Program Name, surgeon Name, Surgeon Post Graduate Year, Surgeon Status, Hospital, Surgical Service, Attending Surgeon First Name, Attending Surgeon Last Name, Patient History, Patient Pre operative Diagnosis, Patient Post Operative Diagnosis, Operative Findings, Pathology, Complication Indicator, Patient Outcome, and Patient Followup.
      <br/>
      A CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) Code, from this paragraph above, is one procedure from a detailed standard list of procedures.
      <br/>
      An RRC (Residency Review Committee) Procedure Description, from this paragraph above, is one procedure from the RRC's less-detailed, standard list of procedures.
      <br/>
      Because the RRC's list of procedures is shorter than the CPT list, certain procedures which would be classified differently in the CPT scheme would be classified as the same under the RRC scheme.
      <br/>
      The RRC has provided a default one-to-one mapping from each of its procedures into a "corresponding" CPT procedure.
      <br/>
      This mapping is adequate for many purposes, but for a particular procedure which has been classified into an RRC procedure, the default mapping may not supply the best CPT Code for that procedure.
      <br/>
      The RRC CPT Code, from this paragraph above, is a datum kept by the computer application to remedy the deficiencies of the RRC mapping.
      <br/>
      The RRC CPT Code is a CPT Code which the user may enter for an actual procedure, which will override the RRC's default mapping in those places where the RRC's default mapping would otherwise be used, for example, in generating certain reports.
      <br/>
      An RRC Category is a broad characterization of procedures according to a list of categories chosen by the RRC.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the present invention is used for operations performed by surgeons.
      <br/>
