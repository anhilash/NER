      <br/>
      A static resistant reticle for use in photolithography having optimal transmission and reduced electrostatic discharge.
      <br/>
      The reticle comprises a substrate, a patterning layer, and two layers of material having a first refractive index and a second refractive index wherein the first refractive index is greater than the second refractive index and at least one of the layers is conductive.
      <br/>
      The refractive indices and thickness of the layers are matched to create an anti-reflective coating.
      <br/>
      The anti-reflective coating optimizes transmission of light through the reticle substrate to about 98.0% to about 99.5% at a wavelength of about 360 nm to about 370 nm.
      <br/>
      The conductivity of at least one of the layers reduces electrostatic discharge further improving delineation of the pattern projected onto a silicon wafer of a semiconductor device.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the anti-reflective coating comprises two or more layers of cermet material.
      <br/>
      The layer of material having a first refractive index is most preferably ruthenium oxide or ruthenium oxide with alumina.
      <br/>
      The second layer of material having a second refractive index is most preferably silica.
      <br/>
      A method of fabricating a static resistant reticle, and a method of patterning a silicon wafer using the reticle of the present invention is also described.

      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates in general to an apparatus used in the fabrication of semiconductor devices, and more specifically, to a reticle used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices employing photolithography.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The use of lithographic technology in transferring patterns from photomasks to semiconductor substrates in the fabrication of semiconductor devices, such as integrated circuits, has been highly developed and widely used.
      <br/>
      Reticles, or photomasks, are used with a variety of radiation sources, both visible and ultraviolet, as well as x-rays and electron beams.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A typical reticle comprises a transparent substrate, such as glass, quartz and the like, which is coated with a masking layer patterned to be complementary to the pattern desired to be transferred to a silicon wafer.
      <br/>
      Such masking layers are generally materials such as chromium, chrome oxide, iron oxide, nickel and the like.
      <br/>
      These materials are deposited on the substrate by conventional techniques known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In photolithography, transmission of light through the substrate of the reticle is about 96.0%. Thus, about 4% of the light is reflected at the interface of the substrate facing the silicon wafer and the air.
      <br/>
      Light passing through the substrate and hitting the masking layer is completely reflected at the substrate/mask interface.
      <br/>
      The 4% inherent reflectance of the reticle at the substrate/air interface increases the exposure time to pattern the silicon wafer leading to slower production and increased cost per wafer.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The glass substrate will typically become statically charged during handling.
      <br/>
      Even the smallest amount of static charge will attract dust and particles to the glass surface further degrading the circuit pattern projected on to the semiconductor substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Static electricity due to the motion of objects or air around the reticles builds up on the reticles.
      <br/>
      Electrostatic discharge (ESD) results when the opposite charge between objects reaches a threshold, and the charge is passed between the objects.
      <br/>
      Depending on the degree of charge and an object's material sensitivity, the exchange of charge can cause damage to the object.
      <br/>
      In the case of very small mask photolithographic design structures, such as reticles, this damage can be severe enough to melt and/or blast the chrome structure.
      <br/>
      This causes mask damage including opens, re-deposited chrome, and severed geometries.
      <br/>
      The damage results in wafer scrap, rework, mask repair and rebuild, and considerable engineering and manufacturing time spent on in-line inspections and defect analysis.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Bearing in mind the problems and deficiencies of the prior art, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a reticle having reduced inherent reflectance improving the transmission of light when transferring the pattern onto a semiconductor substrate.</p>
    <p num="10">It is another object of the present invention to provide a reticle having optimal transmission and reduced ESD.</p>
    <p num="11">A further object of the invention is to provide a method of fabricating a static resistant reticle having optimal transmission and reduced ESD.</p>
    <p num="12">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method of patterning a silicon wafer in a semiconductor device with enhanced transmission of light and reduced ESD providing enhanced clarity of the reticle pattern.</p>
    <p num="13">Still other objects and advantages of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part be apparent from the specification.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <p num="30">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS(S)</p>
    <p num="31">
      In describing the preferred embodiment of the present invention, reference will be made herein to FIGS. 1-10 of the drawings in which like numerals refer to like features of the invention.
      <br/>
      Features of the invention are not necessarily shown to scale in the drawings.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Generally, the present invention provides an anti-reflective coating (ARC) which enhances transmission of light and reduces ESD during photolithography.
      <br/>
      The ARC may comprise of at least two dielectric layers, each layer having different refractive indices selected to optimize transmission of light, disposed on an optically transparent substrate comprising glass, soda lime glass, quartz or sapphire.
      <br/>
      The layers comprising the ARC may comprise cermet material, a semi-synthetic material consisting of a mixture of ceramic and metallic components, e.g., metal carbides, borides, oxides and silicides.
      <br/>
      For example, a cermet such as alumina (Al2 O3) has small inclusions comprising grains of aluminum which further reduce ESD due to its conductivity through the inclusions to bleed charge off the particular layer.
      <br/>
      Other cermets comprising dielectric materials may have inclusions formed therein by conventional implantation or techniques such as plasma immersion implantation.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      As the electrostatic charge builds up on isolated regions of the reticle, the electric field increases.
      <br/>
      The ARC layers which may be initially non-conducting become conducting due to the increased electric field.
      <br/>
      The conductivity of the ARC layers bleeds the charge off the isolated reticle region.
      <br/>
      In cases where a cermet comprises one or more of the layers of the ARC, the conduction mechanism can be thought of as a combination metallic transport through the inclusions and electron hopping between inclusions, particularly where the inclusions are metal grains.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      FIG. 1 shows a cross sectional view of a portion of a reticle 1 of the present invention according to the top coat method of making the reticle.

      The reticle as shown is prior to patterning of the masking layer.

      Substrate 10 is made of an optically transparent material such as soda lime glass, quartz, glass, or sapphire.
      <br/>
      The refractive index of the substrate is irrelevant to the present invention so long as it is optically transparent.

      A masking layer 15 is deposited over substrate 10.
      <br/>
      The masking layer 15 can be any material capable of blocking light such as chromium, chrome oxide, copper, steel, or epoxy.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the masking layer is chrome deposited onto substrate 10 by any conventional means known in the art.

      The layer of material having a first refractive index can be deposited onto the substrate by any conventional means known in the art.

      FIG. 4 shows continued processing of the reticle where a layer of material having a second refractive index 25 is then deposited over the layer of material having a first refractive index 20.
      <br/>
      The edge of reticle 1 has a small region 30 where the layer of material having a first refractive index 20 is not covered by the layer of material having a second refractive index 25.
      <br/>
      The second refractive index must be lower than the first refractive index and that layer can also be conductive.
      <br/>
      The refractive index of the layer of material having a second refractive index is preferably in the range of about 1.0 to about 1.2. Preferably, the layer of material having a second refractive index comprises cermet material, most preferably, silica having a thickness of about 100  Angstrom  to about 1000  Angstrom .

      <br/>
      The grounding strap is, preferably, a copper aluminum alloy attached by conventional methods known in the art.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 5, grounding strap 5 is attached at region 30 to the conductive layer of material having a first refractive index 20 which is not covered by the layer of material having a second refractive index 25.
      <br/>

      The resist layer of the silicon wafer is patterned with the reticle pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The transmission of light through the reticle is a function of five variables: the wavelength of light, the refractive index and thickness of the layer of material having a first refractive index, and the refractive index and thickness of the layer of material having a second refractive index.
      <br/>
      The above variables are optimized in the preferred embodiments of the present invention to enhance transmission of light through the reticle to the range of about 98.0% to about 99.5%. However, the reticle thickness, the refractive index of the materials, and the materials themselves, can be varied to give optimal transmission at any wavelength.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The above invention achieves the objects recited above.
      <br/>
      The layer of material having a first refractive index and the layer of material having a second refractive index, wherein the first refractive index is greater than the second refractive index, are matched with regard to their indices of refraction and thicknesses at the exposure wavelength, to optimize transmission and minimize reflectance.
      <br/>
      The two layers comprise an anti-reflective coating on the reticle improving transmission when projecting the image of the pattern onto a silicon wafer of a semiconductor device.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The conductivity of at least one of the layers serves to reduce ESD minimizing damage to the reticle.
      <br/>
      Delineation of the pattern when projecting the image is also improved since static charge is reduced and fewer particles are attracted to the reticle.
      <br/>
      A grounding strap extending from the conductive layer also aids in decreasing static charge.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      While the present invention has been particularly described, in conjunction with a specific preferred embodiment, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description.
      <br/>
      It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will embrace any such alternatives, modifications and variations as falling within the true scope and spirit of the present invention.
