    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to filters, and more particularly, to continuous differential filters that use gyrators or the like to simulate one or more inductance values.
      <br/>
      Most electrical systems include at least some form of an electrical filter such as a low pass, a high pass, or a bandpass filter.
      <br/>
      These filters are typically implemented using a combination of discrete components such as resistors, inductors and/or capacitors.
      <br/>
      In some technologies, such as integrated circuit and some printed circuit board technologies, inductors cannot readily be produced.
      <br/>
      To overcome this limitation, gyrators have been developed.
      <br/>
      Gyrators simulate an inductance using, for example, only active elements such as transistors and a capacitance load.
      <br/>
      Gyrators thus help eliminate the need for conventional physical inductors (e.g., coils).
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Gyrators often have an input impedance that is proportional to the load admittance.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when a gyrator is loaded with a capacitance, the input impedance behaves like an inductance.
      <br/>
      Some prior art gyrator circuits are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,643,183 to Geffe, U.S. Pat. No. 3,715,693 to Fletcher et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,758,885 to Voorman et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 4,812,785 to Pauker.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In integrated circuit technologies, the load capacitance used by the gyrator is typically formed using a gate oxide type capacitor.
      <br/>
      Gate oxide capacitors include a gate oxide layer cladded by the substrate layer and the polysilicon gate layer.
      <br/>
      The capacitance value of a gate oxide capacitor is primarily dictated by the area of the polysilicon gate region.
      <br/>
      Even though the gate oxide layer is relatively thin, the amount of capacitance that can be generated per unit area is relatively small.
      <br/>
      Therefore, to generate an adequate capacitance value for many filter applications, the area of the gate oxide capacitor must be relatively large, which can significantly reduce the overall density, reliability and yield of the integrated circuit (IC).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In many integrated circuit processes, the gate oxide layer may be susceptible to pin holing, wherein one or more pinhole defects in the gate oxide effectively short the substrate to the polysilicon gate layer.
      <br/>
      The probability of having a pin hole in any given circuit is typically dependent on the total gate oxide area in the circuit.
      <br/>
      Thus, when large gate oxide capacitors are used, the chance of having one or more pin holes in the circuit increases, and the overall yield of the circuit decreases.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it would be desirable to produce a gyrator based filter circuit that minimizes the total area of the gate oxide capacitors.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Gyrator filters are also often only adapted to accept and filter single ended input signals.
      <br/>
      For some applications, it would be desirable to provide a gyrator based filter that is adapted to accept and filter differential input signals.
      <br/>
      Differential input signals typically provide an improved signal-to-noise ratio relative to a single ended input signal, and can increase the dynamic range of the circuit.
      <br/>
      This is particularly important for low power applications where the peak-to-peak signal level is relatively small, and when the gyrator circuit is integrated on a single IC along with other circuits that generate substantial substrate and power supply noise.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it would also be desirable to provide a gyrator based filter that is adapted for receiving and filtering a differential input signal.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention overcomes many of the disadvantages of the prior art by providing a gyrator based filter that is adapted to receive and filter a differential input signal.
      <br/>
      The differential gyrator filter preferably includes a first gyrator connected to the positive input signal of the differential input signal and a second gyrator connected to the negative input signal of the differential input signal.
      <br/>
      A load capacitor is connected between the load terminals of the first gyrator and second gyrator, which minimizes the total load capacitance required for the gyrator based filter.
      <br/>
      This implementation is believed to increase the overall density, reliability, yield, signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range of the gyrator based filter and related circuitry.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In one illustrative embodiment, the differential gyrator based filter includes a positive filter input terminal and a negative filter input terminal for receiving the positive input signal and the negative input signal, respectively, of the differential input signal.
      <br/>
      The positive filter input terminal is coupled to a first gyrator and the negative filter input terminal is coupled to a second gyrator.
      <br/>
      A load capacitor is then connected between the load terminal of the first gyrator and the load terminal of the second gyrator.
      <br/>
      By connecting the load capacitor between gyrators, rather than providing a separate capacitor from each gyrator to ground, the overall capacitor area is reduced.
      <br/>
      This may reduce the overall die area, increase the overall yield, reduce the manufacturing and test costs associated with each device, and provide a number of other advantages.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The first gyrator may include a first differential amplifier and a second differential amplifier.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the second gyrator may include a first differential amplifier and a second differential amplifier.
      <br/>
      The first differential amplifier and the second differential amplifier of each gyrator preferably has a positive input terminal, a negative input terminal, a positive output terminal and a negative output terminal.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The positive input terminal of the first differential amplifier of the first gyrator and the negative output terminal of the second differential amplifier of the first gyrator are preferably coupled to the input terminal of the first gyrator.
      <br/>
      The negative input terminal of the first differential amplifier of the first gyrator is preferably coupled to the positive output terminal of the second differential amplifier of the first gyrator.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the positive output terminal of the first differential amplifier of the first gyrator is preferably coupled to the positive input terminal of the second differential amplifier of the first gyrator.
      <br/>
      Finally, the negative output terminal of the first differential amplifier of the first gyrator is preferably coupled to the negative input terminal of the second differential amplifier of the first gyrator.
      <br/>
      The second gyrator is preferably similarly constructed.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Because the first and second gyrators are formed using two fully differential amplifiers, each gyrator may have two separate load terminals.
      <br/>
      To balance the load on each of the load terminals, the load capacitance preferably includes matched first and second capacitor loads, each having a first terminal and a second terminal.
      <br/>
      The positive output terminal of the first differential amplifier of the first gyrator and the positive input terminal of the second differential amplifier of the first gyrator are preferably coupled to the first terminal of the first capacitor.
      <br/>
      The negative output terminal of the first differential amplifier of the first gyrator and the negative input terminal of the second differential amplifier of the first gyrator are preferably coupled to the first terminal of the second capacitor.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the positive output terminal of the first differential amplifier of the second gyrator and the positive input terminal of the second differential amplifier of the second gyrator are preferably coupled to the second terminal of the first capacitor.
      <br/>
      Finally, the negative output terminal of the first differential amplifier of the second gyrator and the negative input terminal of the second differential amplifier of the second gyrator are preferably coupled to the second terminal of the second capacitor.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      It is contemplated that the above differential gyrator circuit may be used in conjunction with other impedance elements such as capacitors and resistors to form a desired filter.
      <br/>
      In one illustrative embodiment, a first filter capacitor may be connected in parallel with the first gyrator to form a parallel LC network.
      <br/>
      Likewise, a second filter capacitor may be connected in parallel with the second gyrator to form another parallel LC network.
      <br/>
      A third filter capacitor may be connected between the input or output terminals of the first gyrator and the second gyrator.
      <br/>
      This configuration provides a low pass filter.
      <br/>
      To improve the quality of the filter, it is contemplated that a number of the above gyrator based filter stages may be cascaded together, with each filter stage providing one or more filter poles.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the overall gyrator filter may have sufficient filter stages to provide a 7-pole elliptic low-pass filter.

      <br/>
      This is preferably accomplished by providing a first gyrator connected to the positive input signal of the differential input signal and a second gyrator connected to the negative input signal of the differential input signal.
      <br/>
      A load capacitor is connected between the load terminals of the first gyrator and second gyrator, which minimizes the total load capacitance required for the gyrator based filter.

      FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an integrated direct down conversion Narrowband FSK Transceiver 210 that incorporates the present invention.
      <br/>
      The Narrow Band FSK Transceiver 210 includes both transmit and receive functions, preferably on a single substrate with minimal use of external components.
      <br/>
      In use, the Narrow Band FSK Transceiver 210 provides a half-duplex transceiver radio data link capable of statistical frequency-spread transmissions.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Two or more Narrow Band Transceivers 210 can be used to form a wireless data communication network.
      <br/>
      Because each Narrowband FSK Transceiver 210 includes both transmit and receive functions, bi-directional transmission is possible.
      <br/>
      Bi-directional transmission allows data transfers to be confirmed, thereby increasing the reliability of the link to near 100 percent, depending on the access control algorithm implemented by the user.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The basic architecture of the Narrowband FSK Transceiver 210 is shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Off-chip components may include a crystal (which can be shared with an applications microprocessor), front end LC matching and filtering components, LC circuits for tuning the Phase Lock Loop (PLL)/Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) 212, some external capacitors for filtering supply noise, a printed circuit board (PCB), an antenna 214 and a power source.
      <br/>
      The single chip Narrowband FSK Transceiver 210 is intended for the 418 MHz, 434.92 MHz, 868-870 MHz, and 902-928 MHz frequency bands.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The receiver design is based on the direct down conversion principle which mixes the input signal directly down to the baseband using a local oscillator at the carrier frequency.
      <br/>
      The direct down conversion principle is discussed in "Design Considerations for Direct-Conversion Receivers", by Behzad Rasavi, IEEE Transactions On Circuits and Systems--II; Analog and Digital Signal Processing, Vol. 44, No. 6, June 1997.
      <br/>
      In a direct down conversion alogrithm, two complete signal paths are provided including an I-channel 240 and a Q-channel 242, where the Q-channel 242 has a 90 degree phase shift relative to the I-channel 240.
      <br/>
      The I-channel 240 and the Q-channel 242 are used to demodulate the received signal.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Accordingly, the received signal is first provided to a low noise amplifier (LNA) 220. The LNA 220 preferably includes a compensation circuit that actively compensates selected bias levels within the LNA 220 in response to variations in the supply voltage, as more fully described in U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/311,234 filed May 13, 1999 entitled "Compensation Mechanism For Compensating Bias Levels Of An Operation Circuit In Response To Supply Voltage Changes", which has been incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      LNA 220 differentially drives a quadrature mixer pair 222 and 224.
      <br/>
      As indicated above, the input signal provided to mixer 224 is phase shifted 90 degrees relative to the input signal provided to mixer 222.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The PLL synthesizer/(VCO) 212 provides local oscillator (LO) signals in phase quadrature to mixers 222 and 224 via interfaces 216 and 218, respectively.
      <br/>
      Mixer 222 mixes the non-phase shifted the LO signal with the input signal, while Mixer 224 mixes the 90 degree phase shifted LO signal with the same input signal.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the present invention, mixers 222 and 224 also preferably include a compensation circuit that actively compensates selected bias levels in response to variations in supply voltage, as more fully described in U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/311,234 filed May 13, 1999 entitled "Compensation Mechanism For Compensating Bias Levels Of An Operation Circuit In Response To Supply Voltage Changes", which has been incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The differential outputs of mixer 222 and mixer 224 are provided down two identical signal channels in quadrature phase: the I-channel 240 and the Q-channel 242. I-channel 240 includes baseband filter block 226, and Q-channel 242 includes baseband filter block 228.
      <br/>
      Each baseband filter block may include a single pole low pass filter, followed by a second order filter (with two near-DC high-pass poles and two wideband low-pass poles), and a gyrator filter.
      <br/>
      The main channel filter of each baseband filter block is the gyrator filter, which preferably includes a gyrator-capacitor implementation of a 7-pole elliptic low-pass filter. I-channel 240 may also include limiter block 230, and Q-channel 42 may include limiter block 232.
      <br/>
      Limiter blocks 230 and 232 preferably limit the amplitudes of the corresponding signals to remove the amplitude information before the signals are provided to the demodulator 250.
      <br/>
      At least one of the limiter blocks 230 and 232 may contain an RSSI (Receive Signal Strength Indicator) output that can be used for Forward-and-Reverse link power management for DSSS applications or for demodulating FSK (Frequency Shift Key), ASK (Amplitude Shift Key), OOK (On Off Key), or any other modulation technique.
      <br/>
      One such power management approach is described in U.S. patent application Ser.

      A loop filter may also be provided external to the chip for flexibility, which may be a simple passive circuit.
      <br/>
      The VCO 212 preferably provides one or more on-chip varactors.

      In one embodiment, the VCO 212 includes a high tune sensitivity varactor for wideband modulation and a low tune sensitivity varactor for narrowband modulation.

      The modulation varactors are used to modulate a serial data stream onto a selected carrier frequency.

      The DC offset cancellation circuit both actively provides a near-DC high-pass pole, and actively cancels out the DC offset before sending the signal to the next succeeding stage.

      The folded cascode input stage converts the differential input voltage on input terminals 332 and 334 into a differential current through load resistors 336 and 338.

      The gain of the input stage is determined by the value of the load resistors 336 and 338.

      The differential amplifier 350 samples the output of the folded cascode input stage 330, and provides differential control signals 354 and 356 to the offset circuit 352 as shown.
      <br/>
      The offset circuit 352 accepts the differential control signals 354 and 356, and provides enough current to the load resistors 336 and 338 to compensate for (i.e., zero out) the DC offset voltage at the input of the differential amplifier 350.

      At low frequencies, the load capacitors 360 and 362 appear as opens, and the feedback path from the differential amplifier 350 to the offset circuit 352 remains relatively unencumbered.
      <br/>
      Thus, control signals 354 and 356 cause offset circuit 352 to provide offset currents that force the positive input port 370 and the negative input port 372 of the differential amplifier 350 to be substantially equal.
      <br/>
      As indicated above, this not only actively controls (e.g., eliminates) the DC offset between the positive and negative input ports 370 and 372, but also provides a high-pass pole.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      As the frequency increases beyond the high-pass pole, the load capacitors 360 and 362 begin to appear as AC shorts to ground.

      This effectively prevents the AC control signals from reaching the offset circuit 352, and the offset circuit 352 provides the same offset current to the positive input port 370 and the negative input port 372.
      <br/>
      When this occurs, the differential amplifier 350 may provide a sufficient DC voltage to the offset circuit 352 so that the positive input port 370 and the negative input port 372 are centered about a reference voltage, such as reference voltage 376.

      The LPG blocks 302I and 302Q are placed after the PREDCC blocks 300I and 300Q to maximize the dynamic range of the channel since the out-of-band signals will already have been rejected by the low and high-pass poles of the PREDCC blocks 3001 and 300Q.

      The linear transconductor loads 406 and 408 can produce larger impedance levels in a smaller area than polysilicon resistors.
