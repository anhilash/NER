  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a private parts cleaning system and more particularly pertains to allowing handicapped people and the elderly to clean hard to reach areas.</p>
    <p num="2">
      The use of sanitary cleaning devices is known in the prior art.
      <br/>
      More specifically, sanitary cleaning devices heretofore devised and utilized for the purpose of cleaning objects are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="3">By way of example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,019,447 to Sluz discloses a device capable of cleaning one's anus with a spray of water. U.S. Pat. No. 4,092,744 to Butoi discloses a washing device comprised of a water jet and brush capable of cleaning an individual's private parts.</p>
    <p num="4">While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objective and requirements, the aforementioned patents do not describe a private parts cleaning system for allowing handicapped people and the elderly to clean hard to reach areas.</p>
    <p num="5">In this respect, the private parts cleaning system according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in doing so provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of allowing handicapped people and the elderly to clean hard to reach areas.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Therefore, it can be appreciated that there exists a continuing need for a new and improved private parts cleaning system which can be used for allowing handicapped people and the elderly to clean hard to reach areas.
      <br/>
      In this regard, the present invention substantially fulfills this need.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      In the view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of sanitary cleaning devices now present in the prior art, the present invention provides an improved private parts cleaning system.
      <br/>
      As such, the general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new and improved private parts cleaning system which has all the advantages of the prior art and none of the disadvantages.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      To attain this, the present invention essentially comprises a plurality of cleaning attachments adapted for cleaning hard to reach areas of a user.
      <br/>
      The cleaning attachments each are defined by a rigid plate.
      <br/>
      The rigid plate has an upper end and a lower end.
      <br/>
      The upper end has a cleaning head secured thereto.
      <br/>
      The lower end has an inverted Y-shaped protrusion secured thereto and extending downwardly therefrom.
      <br/>
      An attachment clip is provided that is adapted for coupling with the plurality of cleaning attachments.
      <br/>
      The attachment clip includes an inverted Y-shaped channel dimensioned for slidably receiving the inverted Y-shaped protrusion of one of the cleaning attachments therein.
      <br/>
      The attachment clip includes a cylindrical collar extending downwardly therefrom.
      <br/>
      The cylindrical collar has an open lower end.
      <br/>
      A handle portion is provided that is adapted for removably coupling with the attachment clip.
      <br/>
      The handle portion has a tapered upper end dimensioned for being received within the open lower end of the cylindrical collar of the attachment clip.
      <br/>
      The handle portion has a lower end formed with hand gripping indentations.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.
      <br/>
      There are, of course, additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.
      <br/>
      The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways.
      <br/>
      Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention.
      <br/>
      It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="12">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved private parts cleaning system which has all the advantages of the prior art sanitary cleaning devices and none of the disadvantages.</p>
    <p num="13">It is another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved private parts cleaning system which may be easily and efficiently manufactured and marketed.</p>
    <p num="14">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a new and improved private parts cleaning system which is of durable and reliable construction.</p>
    <p num="15">An even further object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved private parts cleaning system which is susceptible of a low cost of manufacture with regard to both materials and labor, and which accordingly is then susceptible of low prices of sale to the consuming public, thereby making such a private parts cleaning system economically available to the buying public.</p>
    <p num="16">Even still another object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved private parts cleaning system for allowing handicapped people and the elderly to clean hard to reach areas.</p>
    <p num="17">
      Lastly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved private parts cleaning system including a plurality of cleaning attachments adapted for cleaning hard to reach areas of a user.
      <br/>
      The cleaning attachments each are defined by a rigid plate.
      <br/>
      The rigid plate has an upper end and a lower end.
      <br/>
      The upper end has a cleaning head secured thereto.
      <br/>
      The lower end has an inverted Y-shaped protrusion secured thereto and extending downwardly therefrom.
      <br/>
      An attachment clip is provided that is adapted for coupling with the plurality of cleaning attachments.
      <br/>
