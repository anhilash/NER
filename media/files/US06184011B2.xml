      <br/>
      The method is effected adding to the solid matrix a degrading enzyme capable of degrading the solid matrix, to thereby release the particulates from the solid matrix.

    <heading>FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a method of releasing solid matrix affinity adsorbed particulates by enzymatically degrading the solid matrix to which the particulates are adsorbed.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of releasing particulates, such as viruses, cells or fragments thereof, which are affinity adsorbed on a polysaccharide solid matrix, by enzymatically degrading the polysaccharide solid matrix to which the particulates are adsorbed with a polysaccharidase.
    </p>
    <p num="2">The need for efficient affinity adsorption and release methods:</p>
    <p num="3">There is a tremendous effort being made to develop rapid cell testing and separation methods to meet the needs of the food, medical, environmental and veterinary industries.</p>
    <p num="4">
      The food industry, for example, needs rapid microbial testing to approve or reject raw materials and determine whether or not to release a held batch of product.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, with the increasing implementation of hazard analysis and critical control point programs by the food industry, the demand for rapid microbial testing has been steadily on the rise (Rules and Regulations, Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service, "Pathogen Reduction; Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems" (1996) 61 Federal Register 38806).
    </p>
    <p num="5">Rapid microbiological methods such as nucleic acid probe hybridization and immunological assays have advanced dramatically, shortening the time required for the detection of pathogens in meats and other foods.</p>
    <p num="6">
      However, these methods require concentrations of target microorganism of 104 to 106 cells per ml or more (Blackburn et al., 1994, Lett.
      <br/>
      Appl. Microbiol. 19:32-36; Swaminathan et al., 1994, Ann.
      <br/>
      Rev. Microbiol. 48:401-426; and Tian et al., 1996, J. Food Prot. 59:1158-1163).
      <br/>
      Foods which are contaminated by bacterial pathogens usually have low numbers of bacteria so that an enrichment step is required prior to the application of a rapid detection assay or even a selective culture method.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      PCR-based assays have the potential to overcome the need for long selective enrichment steps due to their ability to detect and identify pathogens in the presence of large numbers of background flora (K.
      <br/>
      Venkateswaran et al., 1997, Appl.
      <br/>
      Environ. Microbiol. 63:4127-4131).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Nevertheless, when target pathogen concentrations are low, i.e., less than 103 CFU/g, current PCR procedures require 6 to 18 hours of enrichment prior to PCR amplification in order to detect such target pathogens.
      <br/>
      This enrichment step not only brings the target pathogen, which may be present at levels of less than 1 cell per ml or gram of food (Swaminathan et al., 1994, Ann.
      <br/>
      Rev. Microbiol. 48:401426), to PCR detectable levels but also allows for samples to be diluted or filtered to reduce or partially remove PCR inhibitory food components while bringing the target pathogen to a concentration which is detectable (K.
      <br/>
      Venkateswaran et al., 1997, Appl.
      <br/>
      Environ. Microbiol. 63:4127-31).
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In culture methods, selective reagents are necessary in order to inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms but they also inhibit target bacteria ultimately increasing the time it requires to achieve detectable levels of the target pathogen.
      <br/>
      Similarly, many foods contain compounds which are inhibitory to the target bacteria and in many cases the target bacterial cells do not revive or revive very slowly.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, selection media inhibit the "resuscitation" (reviving the viability) of damaged bacteria present, e.g., in meat samples due to freeze thaw cycles, inhibitory food components, or desiccation during processing.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The possibility of selectively concentrating and thereafter recovering and counting or analyzing target bacteria from a food sample, other than by culture methods, while removing background flora and inhibitory compounds would have a tremendous impact on rapid food testing saving time and increasing sensitivities of existing detection techniques.</p>
    <p num="11">
      Zero tolerance standards require the detection of these damaged pathogens even when they are present at minute levels.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, selective concentration of target bacteria would enable rapid enrichment to be carried out without the addition of selective reagents which are necessary in order to inhibit the growth of background flora but which also inhibit target bacteria and ultimately increase the time it takes to achieve detectable levels of target pathogen.
      <br/>
      Removal of competing microorganisms and inhibitory compounds found in food samples to affect resuscitation of target pathogens is best accomplished by selective concentration and subsequent wash steps.
    </p>
    <p num="12">In summary, efficient methods for selective affinity concentration and release of a particular pathogen(s) from foods would not only shorten the overall time required for detection of these pathogens, but would allow for more sensitive detection due to more efficient resuscitation of damaged bacteria.</p>
    <p num="13">Furthermore, the ability to collect larger more representative samples while selectively concentrating and recovering a specific pathogen from these samples would greatly increase the probability of detecting a pathogen in foods when they are present at extremely low concentrations.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Methods of efficient affinity adsorption and concentration of a microorganism or microorganisms are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/175,040, filed Oct. 19, 1998, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      This application teaches methods for concentrating a particular microorganism or microorganisms of interest in a sample.
      <br/>
      The disclosed methods are generally effected by contacting a sample with a cellulosic or chitin matrix to which is bound a cellulose binding protein ("CBP")-receptor (i.e., a first member of a binding pair) or cellulose binding domain ("CBD")-receptor conjugate specific for said microorganism(s).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The methods also include a washing step to remove unbound material of the sample from the matrix.
      <br/>
      The methods also include an optional step for enriching the concentrated microorganism(s) in situ by addition of a culture medium to the matrix or by enriching the concentrated microorganism(s) in vitro by transferring the microorganism(s) from the matrix to a culture medium.
      <br/>
      The method also includes an optional step of performing an assay to detect any microorganisms that bind to the CBP- or CBD-receptor conjugate bound to the matrix.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The disclosed methods have utility in concentrating microorganisms in samples, particularly dilute samples, in order to detect the microorganisms by any means known in the art.
      <br/>
      Such methods of concentration provide improved means of concentrating microorganisms in food, environmental, or biological, such as medical or veterinary, samples.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The disclosed methods have a number of advantages over previously described concentration methods.
      <br/>
      For example, the use of cellulosic fabric as a matrix allows for larger volumes of liquids (up to 10 liters) to be passed with relatively high flow rates as compared to, for example, the DYNAL.RTM. DYNALBEADSO.RTM. procedure �Dynal-product Cat.
      <br/>
      No. 710-03�. The low non-specific binding of the cellulose achieves very low background levels.
      <br/>
      In certain preferred embodiments, the disclosed methods are able to capture microorganisms present at very low concentrations by use of high surface area cellulosic or chitin matrix, such as, but not limited to gauze.
      <br/>
      The physical properties of the cellulosic or chitin matrix enable its performance under conditions that Immuno Magnetic Separation (IMS) do not perform effectively, i.e., in the presence of food samples containing milk and food samples containing bacteria at concentrations lower than 103 CFU/ml.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      However, no efficient method of releasing the captured microorganism is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/175,040.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      There is also a need for efficient adsorption and release of eukaryotic cells.
      <br/>
      Of particular interest are bone marrow and hematopoietic derived cells.
      <br/>
      Particular cell types derived from these sources, such as, but not limited to, hematopoietic stem cells, stromal stem cells, lymphocytes, etc., are used in a variety of therapeutic allogenic and autologous procedures as well as diagnostic procedures.
      <br/>
      Examples include, but are not limited to, adoptive immunotherapy for treatment of cancers, cartilage damage repair for treatment of damaged joints, gene therapy for treatment of genetic disorders and cancer, analysis of maternal blood derived fetal cells for detection of genetic diseases, removal of cells causing graft vs. host disease in cases of bone marrow transplantation.
      <br/>
      In most cases, however, the cell types required for such procedures are scarce and need to be separated from a mixed cell population.
      <br/>
      Affinity adsorption is in many cases employed to separate the required cells from the mixed cell population.

      This application teaches methods and compositions for isolating growth-factor dependent cells through the use of immobilized growth factors.

      The compositions include a matrix binding polypeptide and a growth factor conjugate which is used as an affinity complex to adsorb the growth factor dependent cells to the matrix.

      Various methods have been proposed to effect the release of cells or other target substances from a solid matrix once they have been exclusively adsorbed thereto. U.S. Pat. No. 3,970,518 to Giaever discloses the use of antibody-coated magnetic microspheres to separate cells, and uses a chemical cleaving agent such as formic or sulfuric acids to release the separated cells. U.S. Pat. No. 4,988,621 to Hayman, et al. discloses the use of a short peptide which interferes with the binding of cells to fibronectin, allowing the detachment of cells from a solid matrix.

      EP 463508 A to Mori discloses the use of a temperature-responsive adhesive to immobilize a cell for microinjection, lowering the temperature to release the immobilized cell.
      <br/>
      WO 91/16452 to Berenson describes a technique involving agitation of an avidin column to remove cells captured thereon.
      <br/>
      The use of ionic strength manipulation to reversibly immobilize antibodies bound to magnetic beads has also been reported.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Scouten, Anal.
      <br/>
      Biochem. 205:313-18 (1992). U.S. Pat. No. 5,081,030 to Civin discloses the use of chymopapain to digest the cell surface antigen My10, releasing stem cells from magnetic particles used to isolate the stem cells from a cell suspension.
      <br/>
      WO 94/20858 to Berge et al. describes the separation of target substances by means of a relatively large magnetic particle linked via a hydroxyboryl/cis-diol bond to an antibody, which bond is cleaved after separation of the target substance.
      <br/>
      The commercially available DETACHaBEAD from Dynal (Oslo, Norway) comprises an anti-mouse FAb with higher affinity for the binding site of a monoclonal antibody than the monoclonal has for its corresponding antigen.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the anti-FAb antibody can displace the original MAb from a target cell.

      Competitive affinity elution is disclosed by Grandics, et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,224).
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Some other proposed methods include reduction of disulfides or cleavage of specific linkages by enzymatic or chemical agents inserted somewhere between the capture solid surface and the target cells.
      <br/>
      Such techniques may include protease digestion of marker antibodies or coupling peptides, cellular oligosaccharides cleavable with glycolytic enzymes, or chemical bonds broken under mild conditions that will preserve biological activity, such as oxidizing, reducing, basic, or acidic conditions.
      <br/>
      Because of the extreme complexity of cell surfaces and the desire to maintain high cell viability and functional integrity during selection, it is very difficult to find an enzymatic or chemical release method which has no effect on the cell structure and/or function.
      <br/>
      Mechanical agitation/elution can be damaging to the cell membrane and reduce cell viability.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      All of the above methods suffer one or more disadvantages, which may include, low release/elution yields, non-stoichiometric release/elution, low recovery following elution and cell damage.
      <br/>
      However, all of the above methods share a common limitation--they lack universality.
    </p>
    <p num="27">The following paragraphs provide some more insight into the limitations associated with various prior art approaches of releasing particulates adsorbed to solid matrices.</p>
    <p num="28">
      Thus, a variety of matrices have been employed for capturing specific cells for the isolation thereof from mixed cell populations.
      <br/>
      In all of these cases the release of the cells involve perturbation of the cell surface or destruction of the immobilizing linker.
      <br/>
      Each of these treatments can be detrimental to the viability of the recovered cells.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Current methods for releasing cells from surfaces to which they are adsorbed include, for example, chemical treatment, heat treatment, enzymatic treatment, competitive release and release via receptor internalization.
      <br/>
      Each of these methods suffer limitations as further detailed hereinunder.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Chemical and heat treatments:</p>
    <p num="31">
      Examples for methods which are used to release cells from antibodies bound to a solid matrix include treatment with chaotropic agents, such as, but not limited to, 4.5 M MgCl2 pH 7.5, or 2.5 M NaI pH 7.5 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,415,997), polarity reducing agents, such as ethylene glycol in solutions of up to 50% (U.S. Pat. No. 5,415,997), and agents that lead to changes in pH, such as glycine/HCl pH 2.5, aqueous NH3 pH 11, and 0.5% KOH pH 12.5 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,415,997), or in ionic strength, such as in the case of oligo dA tagged antibodies which are bound to Dynabeads Oligo-dT.
      <br/>
      In all of the above cases the viability of the target cells is compromised.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Other methods exist which can be used to release cells which have been captured by different means on a wide variety of solid matrices.
      <br/>
      High temperatures and other harsh treatments such as lytic reagents (NaOH) and denaturing reagents (5 M urea, 6 M guanidine HCl) can also lead to the release of cells from the matrices to which they are bound, however these cells are not viable.
      <br/>
      These approaches are suitable if the goal is to perform tests such as DNA analysis or immunoassays for specific antigen of the organisms which are released from the matrix, which can be performed using a non-viable cellular material.
      <br/>
      However these methods are not suitable for the recovery of viable cells and in some cases the antigen which is the target of an immunoassay may be destroyed by the releasing agent.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      It should be noted that even in cases where viable cells are not directly required to perform a test, it may still be desirable to amplify the recovered cells before running the test.
      <br/>
      This is especially true when the number of cells captured on the matrix is less than the amount required to generate a sufficient signal to give a statistically significant positive result in the test selected.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Elution methods which have a lethal effect on the viability of the targeted cells generates a need for capturing extremely high numbers of target cells in order to recover just a few after elution.
      <br/>
      Often this demand is answered by prolonged enrichment steps prior to the capture of the target cells.
      <br/>
      However, these enrichment steps often cause exponential growth of unwanted microorganisms as well, which form a burden to the capture system and its ability to produce isolated target cells following the elution step.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Enzymatic treatment:</p>
    <p num="36">
      In the case of linker-based immobilization through a cell specific antibody or ligand, it is often possible to digest the linker molecule itself.
      <br/>
      This can be done with general proteases such as proteinase K or pronase, however these enzymes tend to digest proteins nonspecifically, and typically damage cell surface proteins which leads to loss of viability and/or functional activity of the cell surface protein.
      <br/>
      Even more specific proteases targeted at specific portions of an antibody or ligand often have detrimental affect on cell viability.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, these specific enzymes are not necessarily very efficient at mediating the quantitative release of cells from the matrix.
      <br/>
      In general, the efficiency of a particular protease for the release of a cell which has been captured by an antibody or other ligand must be determined empirically.
      <br/>
      Not every protease performs with every antibody, ligand and/or coupling method.
      <br/>
      In some cases, the protease concentration required to effect cell release is so high that cell is viability is compromised.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Competitive release:</p>
    <p num="38">
      In some cases, reagents are available which can compete off the bound cells.
      <br/>
      These may be high concentrations and/or slightly altered soluble forms of the immobilized antibody or ligand.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, this approach is often unsuccessful in practice.
      <br/>
      This may be due, in part, to the fact that the density of the cell surface molecules leads to very high avidity multivalent interactions with the immobilized antibodies or ligands which often require drastic elution conditions which prevent viable cell recovery (Bonnafous J C, et al., J Immunol Methods, 1983 58 (1-2):93-107).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it may be necessary in some cases to produce a competitive reagent specifically for each ligand-target cell pair, rendering this option cost-ineffective and/or impractical.
      <br/>
      An example of competitive release is shown with the use of methoxyethoxymethyl (MEM) bonded-phase Cellulofine columns to selectively separate human peripheral platelets, granulocytes and lymphocytes.
      <br/>
      Selective elution was achieved by using different mobile phases containing various saccharides (Shibusawa et al., J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Appl. 1995, 666(2):233-239).

      Receptor internalization: Release, can in some rare cases, be obtained by simply incubating cells which have been captured over night in cell culture.
      <br/>
      B cells can be released from Dynabeads after capture by overnight incubation in cell culture which causes transient down regulation of the target surface antigen by the target cell.
      <br/>
      Again, this method is limited to specific cell types which can and are induced to perform internalization under capture conditions.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="73">
      The present invention is of a method which can be used for releasing solid matrix affinity adsorbed particulates.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the present invention can be used to release solid matrix affinity adsorbed particulates such as viruses, cells or portions thereof by enzymatically degrading the solid matrix to which the particulates are adsorbed, thereby providing a universal method of releasing particulates from a solid matrix, which method inflicts substantially no damage upon the released particulates and can be used to release close to 100% of the adsorbed particulates in a viable form even when present at ultra low titers.
    </p>
    <p num="74">The principles and operation of a method according to the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and accompanying descriptions.</p>
    <p num="75">
      Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.
      <br/>
      The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways.
      <br/>
      Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Thus, the present invention provides a method of releasing particulates, such as cells or portions thereof, from a solid matrix.
      <br/>
      The method according to the present invention is effected by adding to the solid matrix a degrading enzyme capable of degrading the solid matrix, to thereby release the particulates from the solid matrix.
    </p>
    <p num="77">As used herein in the specification and in the claims section below, the verb "to release" includes to free, to dissociate and/or to detach.</p>
    <p num="78">
      The particulates according to the present invention can be adsorbed to the solid matrix.
      <br/>
      They can be either affinity adsorbed or non-specifically adsorbed to the solid matrix.
      <br/>
      By "affinity adsorbed" it is meant that the particulates are directly or indirectly bound to the solid matrix via an affinity complex at affinity sites.
      <br/>
      By "non-specifically adsorbed" it is meant that the particulates are bound to the solid matrix via non-specific interactions which are known to be weaker.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      In both cases, the interactions between an endogenous determinant (which forms a first member of a binding pair) present on the surface of the particulate as further detailed below, and the affinity complex (which forms a second member of the binding pair)--for affinity adsorption; or between various (non-specific) determinants of the particulate and the solid matrix--for non-specific adsorption, are typically effected through non-covalent interactions, such as, for example, electrostatic, polar, hydrophobic and/or Van der Waals interactions.
      <br/>
      The interactions between the affinity complex and the solid matrix can be either affinity non-covalent interactions as described above, or alternatively, covalent interactions.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      The particulates can be affinity adsorbed to the solid matrix via an endogenous determinant of the particulates.
      <br/>
      Such a determinant can be, for example, a determinant that resides on a surface of the particulate.
      <br/>
      Such a determinant can include, for example, a complex carbohydrate, a lipopolysaccharide, a protein and/or a glycoprotein.
    </p>
    <p num="81">Some complex carbohydrates (e.g., sialyl-Lewisx (SLex) and other carbohydrate moieties involved in cell adhesion and signaling), proteins, glycoproteins and lipopolysaccharides form endogenous surface determinants which are well known to be specific to different types of cells.</p>
    <p num="82">
      For example, different cells of the hematopoietic lineage include unique determinants which are frequently used to identify and isolate such cells from a mixed cell population.
      <br/>
      These include, for example, the CD4 and CD8 antigen determinants of hematopoietic cells.
      <br/>
      Additional examples include MHC antigens and receptors.
      <br/>
      Other examples include growth factor receptors, e.g., steel factor receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, nerve growth factor receptor, brain derived neurotrophic factor receptor, erythropoietin receptor, GM-CSF receptor; interleukin (including IL-2 and IL-3 and others) receptor, platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and the like.
      <br/>
      Still additional examples include hormone receptors, e.g., insulin receptor, glucagon receptor and the like.
      <br/>
      Other examples include receptors for neurotransmitters.
      <br/>
      Yet other examples include cell adhesion receptors/cell scaffold determinants, such as, but not limited to, integrins, LAM-1, ICAM-1, LFA-3, H-CAM, ELAM-1.
      <br/>
      Still additional examples include cell transporters, such as antiporters, coporters and ATP dependent transporters.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Also bacterial species and strains differ from one another by endogenous determinants thereof, e.g., in their lipopolysaccharides and/or flagellar proteins.
      <br/>
      This is specifically characteristic of pathogenic versus non-pathogenic strains of a single bacterial species, wherein determinants which are unique to the pathogenic strain are related to the pathogeneity thereof and are absent in the non-pathogenic strain.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      Indeed, through the years of biological and medical research a variety of cell specific determinants have been characterized for a variety of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.
      <br/>
      These determinants, such as receptors, selecting, cell scaffolds proteins, and the like surface determinants, which serve any one of a plurality of biological functions, can be used for affinity adsorption of specific cell types as further detailed hereinunder.
    </p>
    <p num="85">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the particulates are affinity adsorbed to the solid matrix via an affinity complex which is bound to the endogenous surface determinant of the particulates on one hand, and to the solid matrix on the other hand.</p>
    <p num="86">The affinity complex which is used according to the present invention to affinity adsorb the particulates to the solid matrix can include one or more affinity moieties (which, for example, form the second member of the binding pair), such as, but not limited to, an antibody, an antigen, a hapten, a ligand, a soluble receptor, a matrix binding peptide, avidin, streptavidin and biotin.</p>
    <p num="87">
      As used herein in the specification and in the claims section below, the term "antibody" include serum immunoglobulins, polyclonal antibodies or fragments thereof or monoclonal antibodies or fragments thereof.
      <br/>
      The antibodies are preferably elicited against a surface determinant of the particulate.
      <br/>
      Monoclonal antibodies or purified fragments of the monoclonal antibodies having at least a portion of an antigen binding region, including such as Fv, F(abl)2, Fab fragments (Harlow and Lane, 1988 Antibody, Cold Spring Harbor), single chain antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778), chimeric or humanized antibodies (Morrison et al., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851; Neuberger et al., 1984, Nature 312:604-8) and complementarily determining regions (CDR) may be prepared by conventional procedure.
      <br/>
      Purification of the serum immunoglobulins antibodies or fragments can be accomplished by a variety of methods known to those of skill including, but not limited to, precipitation by ammonium sulfate or sodium sulfate followed by dialysis against saline, ion exchange chromatography, affinity or immunoaffinity chromatography as well as gel filtration, zone electrophoresis, etc. (see Goding in, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, 2nd ed., pp. 104-126, 1986, Orlando, Fla., Academic Press).
    </p>
    <p num="88">As used herein in the specification and in the claims section below, the terms "antigen" and "thaptent" include moieties which are specifically recognized by either antibodies as defined above and/or receptors of immune system cells.</p>
    <p num="89">
      As used herein in the specification and in the claims section below, the term "aligand" includes moieties capable of specifically binding to a receptor.
      <br/>
      Examples of ligands which can be used in an affinity complex according to the present invention include, but are not limited to, growth factors, hormones and neurotransmitters.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      As used herein in the specification and in the claims section below, the term "1 a soluble receptor" includes soluble extracellular portions of cellular receptors which retain their ligand binding activity.
      <br/>
      These may include soluble portions of growth factor, hormone and neurotransmitter receptor s.
    </p>
    <p num="91">As used herein in the specification and in the claims section below, the term "a matrix binding peptide" include peptides e.g., proteins and domains thereof, which are capable of binding to the solid matrix.</p>
    <p num="92">
      Such peptides include amino acid sequences that are derived from a matrix binding region, of e.g., a polysaccharide binding protein or a polysaccharide binding domain of a polysaccharidase.
      <br/>
      The polysaccharide binding peptide can include any amino acid sequence or a glycoprotein derivative thereof which binds to an oligosaccharide polymer, for example, the polysaccharide binding domain or protein can be derived from a polysaccharidase, a binding domain of a polysaccharide binding protein or a protein designed and engineered to be capable of binding to a polysaccharide.
      <br/>
      The polysaccharide binding domain or protein can be naturally occurring or synthetic.
      <br/>
      Suitable polysaccharidases from which a polysaccharide binding domain or protein may be obtained include  BETA -14-glucanases.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, a polysaccharide binding domain or protein from a cellulase is used.
      <br/>
      Typically, the amino acid sequence is essentially lacking in the hydrolytic activity of the polysaccharidase, but retains the substrate binding activity.
      <br/>
      The amino acid sequence preferably has less than about 10% of the hydrolytic activity of the native polysaccharidase; more preferably less than about 5%, and most preferably less than about 1% of the hydrolytic activity of the native polysaccharidase, ideally no activity altogether.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      The polysaccharide binding domain or protein can be obtained from a variety of sources, including enzymes and other proteins which bind to polysaccharides which find use in the subject invention.
      <br/>
      In Table 5 below are listed those binding domains which bind to one or more soluble/insoluble polysaccharides including all binding domains with affinity for soluble glucans ( ALPHA ,  BETA , and/or mixed linkages).
      <br/>
      The N1 cellulose-binding domain from endoglucanase CenC of C. fimi is the only protein known to bind soluble cellosaccharides and one of a small set of proteins which are known to bind any soluble polysaccharides.
      <br/>
      Also, listed in Tables 1 to 4 are examples of proteins containing putative  BETA -1,3-glucan-binding domains (Table 1); proteins containing Streptococcal glucan-binding repeats (Cpl superfamily) (Table 2); enzymes with chitin-binding domains (Table 3), and starch-binding domains (Table 4).
      <br/>
      Scaffoldin proteins which include a cellulose binding domain protein such as that produced by Clostridium cellulovorans (Shoseyov et al., PCT/US94/04132) can also be used for preparing a polysaccharide binding domain or protein.
      <br/>
      Several fungi, including Trichoderma species and others, also produce polysaccharidases from which polysaccharide binding domains or proteins can be isolated.
      <br/>
      Additional examples can be found in, for example, Microbial Hydrolysis of Polysaccharides, R. A. J. Warren, Annu.
      <br/>
      Rev. Microbiol. 1996, 50:183-212; and "Advances in Microbial Physiology" R. K. Poole, Ed., 1995, Academic Press Limited, both are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.
      <br/>
      In addition, U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,758 teaches a maltose binding protein capable of binding to the polysaccharide  ALPHA -amylose.

      The Ka for binding of the polysaccharide binding domains or proteins to oligosaccharide is at least in the range of weak antibody-antigen extractions, i.e.,  &gt;= 103, preferably 104, most preferably 106 M-1.
      <br/>
      If the binding of the polysaccharide binding domain or protein to the oligosaccharide is exothermic or endothermic, then binding will increase or decrease, respectively, at lower temperatures, providing a means for temperature modulation of the immobilization step.

      Once the most appropriate polysaccharide binding peptide for a particular application has been identified, the polysaccharide binding protein or domain can be prepared by transforming into a host cell a DNA construct comprising DNA encoding the appropriate polysaccharide binding moiety.
      <br/>
      The phrase "polysaccharide binding peptide" intends an amino acid sequence which comprises at least a functional portion of the polysaccharide binding region of a polysaccharidase or a polysaccharide binding protein.
      <br/>
      The phrase further relates to glycoprotein derivatives of such amino acid sequences.
      <br/>
      By "functional portion" is intended an amino acid sequence which binds to an oligosaccharide polymer of interest.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      The techniques used in isolating polysaccharidase genes, such as a cellulase gene, and genes for polysaccharide binding proteins are known in the art, including synthesis, isolation from genomic DNA, preparation from cDNA, or combinations thereof. (See, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,137,819; 5,202,247; and 5,340,731) The sequences for several polypeptide binding domains, which bind to soluble oligosaccharides are known (See, FIG. 1 of PCT/CA97/00033, WO 97/26358).
      <br/>
      The DNAs coding for a variety of polysaccharidases and polysaccharide binding proteins are also known.
      <br/>
      Various techniques for manipulation of genes are well known, and include restriction, digestion, resection, ligation, in vitro mutagenesis, primer repair, employing linkers and adapters, and the like (see Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989).
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      The amino acid sequence of a polysaccharidase also can be used to design a probe to screen a cDNA or a genomic library prepared from mRNA or DNA from cells of interest as donor cells for a polysaccharidase gene or a polysaccharide binding protein gene.
      <br/>
      By using the polysaccharidase cDNA or binding protein cDNA or a fragment thereof as a hybridization probe, structurally related genes found in other microorganisms can be easily cloned.
      <br/>
      Particularly contemplated is the isolation of genes from organisms that express polysaccharidase activity using oligonucleotide probes based on the nucleotide sequences of genes obtainable from an organism wherein the catalytic and binding domains of the polysaccharidase are discrete, although other polysaccharide binding proteins also can be used (see, for example, Shoseyov, et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. (USA) (1992) 89:3483-3487).
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      Probes developed using consensus sequences for the binding domain of a polysaccharidase or polysaccharide-binding protein are of particular interest.
      <br/>
      The  BETA -1,4-glycanases from C. fimi characterized to date are endoglucanases A, B, C and D (CenA, CenB, CenC and CenD, respectively), exocehobiohydrolases A and B (CbhA and CbhB, respectively), and xylanases A and D (Cex and XylD, respectively) (see Wong et al. (1986) Gene, 44:315; Meinke et al. (1991) J. Bacteriol., 173:308; Coutinho et al., (1991) Mol. Microbiol. 5:1221; Meinke et al., (1993) Bacteriol., 175:1910; Meinke et al., (1994) Mol. Microbiol., 12:413; Shen et al., Biochem. J., in press; O'Neill et al., (1986) Gene, 44:325; and Millward-Sadler et al., (1994) Mol. Microbiol., 11:375).
      <br/>
      All are modular proteins of varying degrees of complexity (FIG. 1), but with two features in common: a catalytic domain (CD) and a cellulose-binding domain (CBD) which can function independently (see Millward-Sadler et al., (1994) Mol. Microbiol., 11:375; Gilkes et al., (1988) J. Biol. Chem., 263:10401; Meinke et al., (1991) J. Bacteriol., 173:7126; and Coutinho et al., (1992) Mol. Microbiol., 6:1242).
      <br/>
      In four of the enzymes, CenB, CenD, CbhA and CbhB, fibronectin type III (Fn3) repeats separate the N-terminal CD from the C-terminal CBD.
      <br/>
      The CDs of the enzymes come from six of the families of glycoside hydrolases (see Henrissat (1991) Biochem. J., 280:309; and Henrissat et al., (1993) Biochem. J., 293:781); all of the enzymes have an N- or C-terminal CBD or CBDs (see Tomme et al., Adv. Microb. Physiol., in press); CenC has tandem CBDs from family IV at its N-terminus; CenB and XylD each have a second, internal CBD from families III and II, respectively.
      <br/>
      Cex and XylD are clearly xylanases; however, Cex, but not XylD, has low activity on cellulose.
      <br/>
      Nonetheless, like several other bacterial xylanases (see Gilbert et al., (1993) J. Gen. Microbiol., 139:187), they have CBDs. C. fimi probably produces other  BETA -1,4-glycanases.
      <br/>
      Similar systems are produced by related bacteria (see Wilson (1992) Crit. Rev. Biotechnol., 12:45; and Hazlewood et al., (1992) J. Appl. Bacteriol., 72:244).
      <br/>
      Unrelated bacteria also produce glycanases; Clostridium thermocellum, for example, produces twenty or more  BETA -1,4-glycanases (see Beguin et al., (1992) FEMS Microbiol.
      <br/>
      Lett., 100:523).
      <br/>
      For solid phase recovery systems, CBDs that bind insoluble polysaccharides are of particular use.
      <br/>
      For use in phase separation purification of growth factor conjugates, a particularly useful CBD is the binding domain of C. fimi endoglucanase C N1, which is the only protein known to bind soluble cellosaccharides and one of a small set of proteins that are known to bind any soluble polysaccharides.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      Examples of suitable binding domains are shown in FIG. 1 of PCT/CA97/00033 (WO 97/26358), which presents an alignment of binding domains from various enzymes that bind to polysaccharides and identifies amino acid residues that are conserved among most or all of the enzymes.
      <br/>
      This information can be used to derive a suitable oligonucleotide probe using methods known to those of skill in the art.
      <br/>
      The probes can be considerably shorter than the entire sequence but should at least be 10, preferably at least 14, nucleotides in length.
      <br/>
      Longer oligonucleotides are useful, up to the fall legnth of the gene, preferably no more than 500, more preferably no more than 250, nucleotides in length.
      <br/>
      RNA or DNA probes can be used.
      <br/>
      In use, the probes are typically labeled in a detectable manner, for example, with 32 p, 3 H, biotin, avidin or other detectable reagents, and are incubated with single-stranded DNA or RNA from the organism in which a gene is being sought.
      <br/>
      Hybridization is detected by means of the label after the unhybridized probe has been separated from the hybridized probe.
      <br/>
      The hybridized probe is typically immobilized on a solid matrix such as nitrocellulose paper.
      <br/>
      Hybridization techniques suitable for use with oligonucleotides are well known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Although probes are normally used with a detectable label that allows easy identification, unlabeled oligonucleotides are also useful, both as precursors of labeled probes and for use in methods that provide for direct detection of double-stranded DNA (or DNA/RNA).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the term "oligonucleotide probe" refers to both labeled and unlabeled forms.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      Generally, the binding domains identified by probing nucleic acids from an organism of interest will show at least about 40% identity (including as appropriate allowances for conservative substitutions, gaps for better alignment and the like) to the binding region or regions from which the probe was derived and will bind to a soluble  BETA -1,4 glucan with a Ka of  &gt;= 103 M-1.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the binding domains will be at least about 60% identical, and most preferably at least about 70% identical to the binding region used to derive the probe.
      <br/>
      The percentage of identity will be greater among those amino acids that are conserved among polysaccharidase binding domains.
      <br/>
      Analyses of amino acid sequence comparisons can be performed using programs in PC/Gene (IntelliGenetics, Inc.).
      <br/>
      PCLUSTAL can be used for multiple sequence alignment and generation of phylogenetic trees.

    <p num="108">
      In order to isolate the polysaccharide binding protein or a polysaccharide binding domain from an enzyme or a cluster enzymes that binds to a polysaccharide, several genetic approaches can be used.
      <br/>
      One method uses restriction enzymes to remove a portion of the gene that codes for portions of the protein other than the binding portion thereof.
      <br/>
      The remaining gene fragments are fused with expression control sequences to obtain a mutated gene that encodes a truncated protein.
      <br/>
      Another method involves the use of exonucleases such as Bal31 to systematically delete nucleotides either externally from the 5' and the 3' ends of the DNA or internally from a restricted gap within the gene.
      <br/>
      These gene deletion methods result in a mutated gene encoding a shortened protein molecule which can then be evaluated for substrate or polysaccharide binding ability.
      <br/>
      Appropriate substrates for evaluating binding activity include those for the enzymes are listed in Tables 1-5 above, as well as the carbohydrates listed in Table 6 below.

      Once the particulates have been released from the solid matrix to which they were adsorbed by the action of the degrading enzyme which degrades the solid matrix, the particulates can be physically removed (eluted or separated) from the solid matrix.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the solid matrix is arranged in a column, the particulates are eluted therefrom via the addition of an appropriate liquid at the top of the column.
      <br/>
      Such a liquid can include a buffer, e.g., an isotonic buffer such as buffered saline, or a growth medium.
      <br/>
      If, on the other hand, the solid matrix is in dispersion, a simple step of, for example, centrifugation or filtration can be used to separate the matrix and the particulates that have been released therefrom.
      <br/>
      The removed particulates can thereafter be recovered by plating into or on a suitable growth medium.
      <br/>
      The type of growth medium required to recover and sustain specific particulates depend to a great extent on the particulates of choice.
      <br/>
      One ordinarily skilled in the art would know how to select an appropriate growth medium to recover specific particulates.

    <p num="116">
      The use of a matrix degrading enzyme to release solid support adsorbed particulates therefrom is introduced herein for the first time and renders the method according to the present invention highly universal.
      <br/>
      Thus, regardless of the method employed to capture or adsorb the particulates, the matrix degrading enzyme ensures the release of the particulates therefrom.
      <br/>
      In addition, it will be appreciated that the method according to the present invention dissociated the particulates from the matrix at a location which is as far as possible from the particulates, using highly specific degrading enzymes which do not affect the particulates themselves.
      <br/>
      As such, the method according to the present invention ensures that a minimal damage, if any, is inflicted upon the particulates when released.
      <br/>
      While reducing the present invention to practice an unexpected phenomenon has been observed, i.e., non-stoichiometric amounts of the degrading enzyme were sufficient to release a high fraction of the adsorbed particulates, close to 100% thereof in some cases.
      <br/>
      This phenomenon is explained, in a non-limiting fashion, by that the degrading enzymes degrade the surface of the solid matrix which is sufficient to release the particulates therefrom.
      <br/>
      By "non-stoichiometric amounts" is meant amounts which are insufficient to degrade the entire solid matrix.
      <br/>
      In fact, close to 100% release was experienced while macroscopically the matrix itself appeared unchanged.

      Finally, certain cartridges which were treated with 100 mg/ml cellulase were eluted with an additional 10 ml PBS-Tween and 10 ml PBS to determine if any additional microorganisms had been released but not removed from the cartridge by previous eluants.

      Due to the high specificity of the cellulose matrix and the effective wash step prior to elution, the elution step results in high target to background ratio as can be seen on CT-SMAC agar plates in which most colonies are Sorbitol negative and E. coli O157 positive.

      Method: In two separate reactions, 1.8 mg MBP (6.0 mg/ml) was mixed with 20-fold molar excess of SPDP (68 mM solution dissolved in ethanol) and 2.2 mg IgG (1.5 mg/ml) was mixed with 25-fold molar excess of SPDP (68 mM solution dissolved in ethanol).
      <br/>
      Both of these reactions were allowed to continue for two hours at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The reactions were then dialyzed against PBS overnight at 4 (degree)  C. and the precipitates were collected by centrifugation.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      IgG was reduced by addition of 1 M DTT to a final concentration of 50 mM and incubation for 1 hour at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The reduced IgG was desalted on a G-25 column (up to 5% sample/column volume ratio) by equilibration with 50 mM KH2 PO4 pH 6.5. The reduced SPDP-IgG was then mixed with the SPDP-MBP in a molar ratio of 1:2.9, respectively, at 4 (degree)  C. over night.
      <br/>
      The precipitates were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was stored at 4 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="169">Preparation of amylose coated gauze matrix:</p>
    <p num="170">
      1.3 grams amylose were mixed with 100 ml distilled water and the mixture was brought to boil. 50 mg pre-cut gauze quadrants were added to the boiling amylose solution and the amylose coated gauze was removed after 1-2 minutes from the boiling solution and was air dried at room temperature.
      <br/>
      Excess amylose was washed from the gauze quadrants by stirring the coated gauze in 1 liter Tris buffer, pH 7.4, at 60 (degree)  C. for 5 minutes.
      <br/>
      The wash step was repeated two more times using fresh Tris buffer.
      <br/>
      Finally, each individual quadrant of coated gauze was washed with 1 ml Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and air dried at room temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="171">Preparation of an MBP-IC capture cartridge:</p>
    <p num="172">
      The dried gauze was then pack into a cartridge.
      <br/>
      NaCl was added to the conjugate at a final concentration of 0.2 M. 150  MU l of conjugate (final concentration of 0.1 mg protein/ml as determined by the Bradford method) was added onto the packed gauze, incubated for 15 minutes at 37 (degree)  C., cooled to room temperature and washed twice with 5 ml of PBS.
      <br/>
      The MBP-Ab-IC cartridge was then ready for use.
    </p>
    <p num="173">Capture and wash step:</p>
    <p num="174">
      1 ml of PBS containing 250 CFU's of E. coli O157:H7 was drawn into an MBP-Ab-IC cartridge or an MBP-IC cartridge by a standard action of a lab pipettor actuated 5 times in an up and down manner.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the cartridge was washed with 10 ml of a PBS solution.
      <br/>
      The amount of captured bacteria was calculated by subtracting the amount of bacteria present in the wash solutions from original inoculum number to be approximately 46% (114 CFU's).
    </p>
    <p num="175">
      1 ml of expelled model solution was added to 10 ml wash and the bacterial concentration was determined by a filter method using the mENDO LES agar filtration technique.
      <br/>
      Thus, the eluant was filtered through a GN-6 Metricel filter and then the filter was plated on a mENDO LES agar and incubated overnight at 37 (degree)  C. for viable cell count.
    </p>
    <p num="176">Release step:</p>
    <p num="177">
      In order to release the captured bacteria from the matrix, two different types of  ALPHA -amylases were tested, Bacillus licheniformis  ALPHA -amylase and Aspergillus oryzae  ALPHA -amylase.
      <br/>
      To this end, 200  MU l of an  ALPHA -amylase solution containing 100 mg  ALPHA -amylase per ml, i.e., 79000 or 4000 units per cartridge for Bacillus licheniformis  ALPHA -amylase and Aspergillus oryzae  ALPHA -amylase, respectively, were drawn into the cartridges and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to release the affinity adsorbed bacteria from the matrix.
    </p>
    <p num="178">Eluting and plating of microorganisms:</p>
    <p num="179">
      Following the incubation with  ALPHA -amylase, the elution buffer was drawn three times in and out of the cartridge before being expelled from the cartridge and plated onto mENDO LES agar plates for quantification of bacterial CFUs.
      <br/>
      The first elution was followed by 200  MU l PBS wash which was drawn in and out of cartridge three times before being expelled and plated onto mENDO LES agar for quantification of bacterial CFU's.
      <br/>
      Elution buffer (PBS) without  ALPHA -amylase was used as a control.
    </p>
    <p num="180">Experimental Results:</p>
    <p num="181">
      Aspergillus oryzae  ALPHA -amylase (A-0273) was more suitable for the elution of MBP-Ab immunocaptured bacteria, than Bacillus licheniformis a -amylase effecting 19.2% elution as compared to 10.8%, respectively, at 100 mg  ALPHA -amylase concentrations (FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      The percentages in FIG. 3 represent the CFU's which were eluted by the 200  MU l eluant and the 200  MU l wash step combined.
    </p>
    <p num="182">
      These results show that  ALPHA -amylase can be used to elute microorganisms which have been captured to amylose matrix without any apparent detrimental effects on the viability of the microorganisms.
      <br/>
      This can be achieved using  ALPHA -amylase originating from different microorganisms, such as, but not limited to, Aspergillus oryzae and Bacillus licheniformis.
      <br/>
      Between these two  ALPHA -amylases, Aspergillus oryzae  ALPHA -amylase is presently the preferred  ALPHA -amylase, using which, 200  MU l of 100 mg/ml solution was sufficient to effect nearly 20% elution of viable captured E. coli O157:H7 from the matrix without incorporation of large volume wash step.
    </p>
    <p num="183">EXAMPLE 4</p>
    <p num="184">
      The use of a variety of reagents has been attempted to elute viable cells which have been captured on a cellulosic matrix using CBD-antibody as the affinity complex.
      <br/>
      These included the following reagents: ethylene glycol (1-50% solutions), glycerol (50% solution), DTT (20-500 mM), glycine HCl pH 2.2-3.0+ethylene glycol, pepsin, CMC, cellobiose, CBDClos (5 mg/ml), heat killed competitive antigen, KOH, and polyethylene glycol.
    </p>
    <p num="185">
      These reagents either had adverse effect on the viability of the cells or were unable to elute viable cells.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, when the number of target cells was high enough on one hand and care was taken to place eluted cells in an appropriate resuscitation media immediately after elution, then it was possible to recover a small number of viable cells (in the range of 2-5%).
