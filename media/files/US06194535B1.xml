    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to an electrophotographic photoconductor comprising an electroconductive support, and a photoconductive layer formed thereon, comprising an aromatic polycarbonate resin with charge transporting properties.
      <br/>
      In addition, the present invention also relates to the above-mentioned aromatic polycarbonate resin which is useful as the material for the electrophotographic photoconductor.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Discussion of Background</p>
    <p num="5">
      Recently organic photoconductors (OPC) are used in many copying machines and printers.
      <br/>
      The organic photoconductor has a layered structure comprising a charge generation layer (CGL) and a charge transport layer (CTL) which are successively overlaid on an electroconductive support.
      <br/>
      The charge transport layer (CTL) is a film-shaped layer comprising a binder resin and a low-molecular-weight charge transport material (CTM) dissolved therein.
      <br/>
      The addition of such a low-molecular-weight charge transport material (CTM) to the binder resin lowers the intrinsic mechanical strength of the binder resin, so that the CTL film is fragile and has a low tensile strength.
      <br/>
      Such lowering of the mechanical strength of the CTL causes the wearing of the photoconductor or forms scratches and cracks on the surface of the photoconductor.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Although some vinyl polymers such as polyvinyl anthracene, polyvinyl pyrene and poly-N-vinylcarbazole have been studied as high-molecular-weight photoconductive materials for forming a charge transporting complex for use in the conventional organic photoconductor, such polymers are not satisfactory from the viewpoint of photosensitivity.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In addition, high-molecular-weight materials having charge transporting properties have been also studied to eliminate the shortcomings of the above-mentioned layered photoconductor.
      <br/>
      For instance, there are proposed an acrylic resin having a triphenylamine structure as reported by M. Stolka et al., in "J. Polym. Sci., vol 21, 969 (1983)"; a vinyl polymer having a hydrazone structure as described in "Japan Hard Copy '89 p. 67"; an aromatic polycarbonate resin having a benzidine structure as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 64-9964; and polycarbonate resins having a triarylamine structure as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,801,517, 4,806,443, 4,806,444, 4,937,165, 4,959,288, 5,030,532, 5,034,296, and 5,080,989, and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications Nos. 64-9964, 3-221522, 2-304456, 4-11627, 4-175337, 4-18371, 4-31404, and 4-133065.
      <br/>
      However, any materials have not yet been put to practical use.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      According to the report of "Physical Review B46 6705 (1992)" by M. A. Abkowitz et al., it is confirmed that the drift mobility of a high-molecular weight charge transport material is lower than that of a low-molecular weight material by one figure.
      <br/>
      This report is based on the comparison between the photoconductor comprising a low-molecular weight tetraarylbenzidine derivative dispersed in the photoconductive layer and the one comprising a high-molecular polycarbonate having a tetraarylbenzidine structure in its molecule.
      <br/>
      The reason for this has not yet been clarified, but this report suggests that the photoconductor employing the high-molecular weight charge transport material produces poor results in terms of the photosensitivity and the residual potential although the mechanical strength of the photoconductor is improved.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Conventionally known representative aromatic polycarbonate resins are obtained by allowing 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane (hereinafter referred to as bisphenol A) to react with phosgene or diphenylcarbonate.
      <br/>
      Such polycarbonate resins made from bisphenol A are used in many fields because of their excellent characteris-tics, such as high transparency, high heat resistance, high dimensional accuracy, and high mechanical strength.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      For example, this kind of polycarbonate resin is intensively studied as a binder resin for use in the organic photoconductor in the field of electrophotography.
      <br/>
      A variety of aromatic polycarbonate resins have been proposed as the binder resins for use in the charge transport layer of the layered photoconductor.
    </p>
    <p num="11">As previously mentioned, however, the mechanical strength of the aforementioned aromatic polycarbonate resin is decreased by the addition of the low-molecular-weight charge transport material in the charge transport layer of the layered electrophotographic photoconductor.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">It is therefore a first object of the present invention to provide an electrophotographic photoconductor free from the conventional shortcomings, which can show high photosensitivity and high durability.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="29">The electrophotographic photoconductor according to the present invention comprises a photoconductive layer comprising:</p>
    <p num="30">(i) an aromatic polycarbonate resin comprising at least a structural unit with the charge transporting properties, represented by formula (I), (III) or (IV),</p>
    <p num="31">(ii) an aromatic polycarbonate resin consisting of a structural unit with the charge transporting properties, represented by formula (I), (III) or (IV), and</p>
    <p num="32">(iii) an aromatic polycarbonate copolymer resin comprising a structural unit with the charge transporting properties, represented by formula (I), (III) or (IV), and a structural unit of formula (II) for imparting other properties than the charge transporting properties to the obtained resin.</p>
    <p num="33">Those aromatic polycarbonate resins, which are novel compounds, have charge transporting properties and high mechanical strength, so that the electrical, optical and mechanical characteristics required for the charge transport layer are satisfactory when those polycarbonate resins are employed in the photoconductor of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="34">As previously mentioned, the aromatic polycarbonate resin of the present invention comprises the structural unit of formula (I):  (Chemical Structure image '9' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="35">wherein Ar1, Ar2, Ar3 and Ar4 are each an arylene group which may have a substituent; Ar5 is an aryl group which may have a substituent; and R1 is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms which may have a substituent, or an aryl group which may have a substituent.</p>
    <p num="36">It is preferable that the structural unit of formula (I) be represented by the following formula (III):  (Chemical Structure image '10' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="37">wherein Ar5 and R1 are the same as those previously defined in formula (I).</p>
    <p num="38">Further, the structural unit of formula (III) may be represented by formula (IV):  (Chemical Structure image '11' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="39">Those aromatic polycarbonate resins according to the present invention can be obtained by the conventional synthesis method for the polycarbonate resin, that is, polymerization of a bisphenol with a carbonic acid derivative.</p>
    <p num="40">To be more specific, the aromatic polycarbonate resin of the present invention can be produced by subjecting at least one diol compound with the charge transporting properties, represented by the following formula (VI), (VII) or (VIII), and a halogenated carbonyl compound such as phosgene to interfacial polymerization.  (Chemical Structure image '12' not included in text)   (Chemical Structure image '13' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="41">wherein R1 and Ar1 to Ar5 are the same as those previously defined in formula (I).</p>
    <p num="42">
      In addition to the phosgene, trichloromethyl chloroformate that is a dimer of phosgene, and bis(trichloromethyl)carbonate that is a trimer of phosgene are usable as the halogenated carbonyl compounds in the above-mentioned interfacial polymerization.
      <br/>
      Further, halogenated carbonyl compounds derived from other halogen atoms than chlorine, for example, carbonyl bromide, carbonyl iodide and carbonyl fluoride are also employed.
    </p>
    <p num="43">The above-mentioned conventional synthesis method is described in the reference, such as "Handbook of Polycarbonate Resin" (issued by The Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun Ltd.).</p>
    <p num="44">
      When a diol of the following formula (IX) is employed in combination with the diol of formula (VI), (VII) or (VIII) with the charge transporting properties in the course of the polymerization, there can be produced a copolymer polycarbonate resin with improved mechanical characteristics.
      <br/>
      In this case, a plurality of kinds of diol compounds represented by formula (IX) may be employed.
    </p>
    <p num="45">OH--X--OH  (IX)</p>
    <p num="46">wherein X is the same as that previously defined in formula (II).</p>
    <p num="47">In such a synthesis method, the amount ratio of the diol represented by formula (VI), (VII) or (VIII) which is provided with the charge transporting properties to the diol of formula (IX) can be selected within a wide range in light of the desired characteristics of the obtained aromatic polycarbonate resin.</p>
    <p num="48">
      Further, a random copolymer polycarbonate resin can be obtained according to the polymerization procedure.
      <br/>
      For instance, a random copolymer comprising the structural unit of formula (I), (III) or (IV) and the structural unit of formula (II) can be obtained when the diol of formula (VI), (VII) or (VIII) with the charge transporting properties and the diol of formula (IX) are uniformly mixed prior to the condensation reaction with the phosgene.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The interfacial polymerization is carried out at the interface between two phases of an alkaline aqueous solution of a diol and an organic solvent which is substantially incompatible with water and capable of dissolving a polycarbonate therein in the presence of the carbonic acid derivative and a catalyst.
      <br/>
      In this case, a polycarbonate resin with a narrow molecular-weight distribution can be speedily obtained by emulsifying the reactive medium through high-speed stirring operation or addition of an emulsifying material.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      As a base for preparing the alkaline aqueous solution, there can be employed an alkali metal and an alkaline earth metal.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of the base include hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; and carbonates such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate and sodium hydrogencarbonate.
      <br/>
      Those bases may be used alone or in combination.
      <br/>
      Of those bases, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are preferable.
      <br/>
      In addition, distilled water or ion exchange water are preferably employed for the preparation of the above-mentioned alkaline aqueous solution.
    </p>
    <p num="51">

    <p num="109">
      In the photoconductors according to the present invention, at least one of the previously mentioned aromatic polycarbonate resins is contained in the photoconductive layers 2, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, and 2e.
      <br/>
      The aromatic polycarbonate resin can be employed in different ways, for example, as shown in FIGS. 1 through 6.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      In the photoconductor as shown in FIG. 1, a photoconductive layer 2 is formed on an electroconductive support 1, which photoconductive layer 2 comprises an aromatic polycarbonate resin of the present invention and a sensitizing dye, with the addition thereto of a binder agent (binder resin) when necessary.
      <br/>
      In this photo-conductor, the aromatic polycarbonate resin works as a photoconductive material, through which charge carriers necessary for the light decay of the photoconductor are generated and transported.
      <br/>
      However, the aromatic polycarbonate resin itself scarcely absorbs light in the visible light range, and therefore, it is necessary to add a sensitizing dye which absorbs light in the visible light range in order to form latent electrostatic images by use of visible light.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      Referring to FIG. 2, there is shown an enlarged cross-sectional view of another embodiment of an electrophotographic photoconductor according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this photoconductor, there is formed a photoconductive layer 2a on an electroconductive support 1.
      <br/>
      The photoconductive layer 2a comprises a charge transport medium 4' comprising (i) an aromatic polycarbonate resin of the present invention, optionally in combination with a binder agent, and (ii) a charge generation material 3 dispersed in the charge transport medium 4'. In this embodiment, the aromatic poly-carbonate resin (or a mixture of the aromatic poly-carbonate resin and the binder agent) constitutes the charge transport medium 4'. The charge generation material 3, which is, for example, an inorganic material or an organic pigment, generates charge carriers.
      <br/>
      The charge transport medium 4' accepts the charge carriers generated by the charge generation material 3 and transports those charge carriers.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      In this electrophotographic photoconductor, it is basically necessary that the light-absorption wavelength regions of the charge generation material 3 and the aromatic polycarbonate resin not overlap in the visible light range.
      <br/>
      This is because, in order that the charge generation material 3 produce charge carriers efficiently, it is necessary that light pass through the charge transport medium 4' and reach the surface of the charge generation material 3.
      <br/>
      Since the aromatic polycarbonate resin comprising the structural unit of formula (I) do not substantially absorb light with a wavelength of 600 nm or more, it can work effectively as the charge transport material when used in combination with the charge generation material 3 which can absorb the light in the visible region to the near infrared region and generate charge carriers.
      <br/>
      The charge transport medium 4' may further comprise a low-molecular weight charge transport material.

      In this photoconductor, light which has passed through the charge transport layer 4 reaches the charge generation layer 5, and charge carriers are generated within the charge generation layer 5.

      <br/>
      The generation and transportation of the charge carriers are performed by the same mechanism as that in the photo-conductor shown in FIG. 2.

      The uniformly charged photoconductor is exposed to a light image so that a latent electrostatic image is formed on the surface of the photoconductor.
      <br/>
      The thus formed latent electrostatic image is developed to a visible image by a developer, and the developed image can be transferred to a sheet of paper when necessary.
