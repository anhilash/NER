      <br/>
      A device for thermal printing of a rolled paper strip has a frame of which a fixed part comprises two lateral cheeks, which are perpendicular to an axis of articulation of a cover, and each comprise on their inner side fixed articulation means.
      <br/>
      The cover comprises two discs, which are accommodated between the two fixed cheeks, and each comprise on their outer side mobile articulation means which cooperate with the fixed articulation means.
      <br/>
      A latch, which is articulated around an axis which is parallel to the axis of articulation of the cover, cooperates with the cover and the fixed part of the frame, in order to provide locking/unlocking of the paper compartment on the fixed part of the frame.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a device for thermal printing of a rolled paper strip, in particular for a plug-in or cordless portable payment terminal.</p>
    <p num="2">It applies generally to thermal printing of a rolled paper strip which is designed to be unwound in front of a thermal print head, by means of a paper drive roller, and to be cut into sections in order to form a payment authorisation or the like.</p>
    <p num="3">Many thermal printing devices are known, of the type which comprise a frame, which contains a fixed part which can support the thermal print head, and a mobile part which forms a cover for access to a paper compartment, and is articulated around an axis which is parallel to the drive axis of the paper strip.</p>
    <p num="4">When this type of printing device is that of a (plug-in or cordless) portable payment terminal, the paper compartment is often articulated in a fragile manner relative to the fixed frame, which gives rise to substantial damage, in particular when the portable payment terminal is dropped or banged.</p>
    <p num="5">The applicant has undertaken to solve the problem of eliminating this disadvantage.</p>
    <p num="6">Thus, the object of the present invention is to provide a thermal printing device, in particular for a (plug-in or cordless) portable payment terminal, in which the paper compartment is articulated integrally relative to the fixed frame.</p>
    <p num="7">The present invention relates to a thermal printing device for a rolled paper strip, in particular for a portable payment terminal, the said paper strip being designed to be unwound in front of a thermal print head, by means of a paper drive roller, and to be cut into sections in order to form a payment authorisation or the like, the printing device being of the type which comprises a frame, which contains a fixed part which can support the thermal print head, and a mobile part which forms a cover for access to a paper compartment, and is articulated around an axis which is parallel to the drive axis of the paper strip.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">According to a general definition of the invention, the fixed part of the frame comprises two lateral cheeks, which are spaced from one another, parallel to one another, perpendicular to the axis of articulation of the cover, and each comprise on their inner side fixed articulation means, the two lateral cheeks being connected partially to one another by a dished cylindrical wall;</p>
    <p num="9">
      the cover comprises two discs, which are designed to be accommodated between the two fixed cheeks, and each comprise on their outer side mobile articulation means, which cooperate with the fixed articulation means, the two discs being connected to one another by a cylindrical envelope portion, which is designed to form the paper compartment which accommodates the rolled paper strip; and
      <br/>
      the mobile and fixed articulation means are designed to make the cover pivot between a position in which access to the paper compartment is open, and a position in which access to the paper compartment is closed.
    </p>
    <p num="10">A device of this type has the advantage that it has an integral articulation between the mobile and fixed parts of the frame, which limits the damage which can be caused by the portable payment terminal being dropped or banged.</p>
    <p num="11">
      In addition, by changing the diameter of the discs of the cover, it is possible to accommodate a paper strip with a selected diameter.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is easy to use paper strips with different diameters, by changing only the diameter of the discs.
    </p>
    <p num="12">According to another important characteristic of the invention, the device additionally comprises a latch, which is articulated around an axis which is parallel to the axis of articulation of the cover, and can cooperate with the cover and the fixed part of the frame, in order to provide locking/unlocking of the paper compartment on the fixed part of the frame.</p>
    <p num="13">A latch of this type makes it possible to keep the paper compartment locked, even when the user applies considerable force to the paper strip, when the strip is cut into sections.</p>
    <p num="14">According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the latch comprises two lateral, flexible tabs, which are spaced from one another, parallel to one another, perpendicular to the axis of articulation of the latch, and are connected to one another by a bar which is parallel to the axis of articulation of the latch, the end of each tab comprising a flexible catch which can cooperate with a recess which is disposed in the fixed part of the frame, and articulation means which are mobile around the axis of articulation of the latch, and can cooperate with the two discs of the cover, in order to make the latch pivot into a position in which the tabs are spaced from the fixed frame, and a position in which the tabs are locked in the recesses of the fixed frame, in order to lock the cover positively into the fixed part of the frame.</p>
    <p num="15">In practice, each cheek of the fixed part of the frame comprises a notch which can cooperate with a tooth which is supported by the latch, in order to guide locking/unlocking of the said latch on the fixed part of the frame.</p>
    <p num="16">According to another aspect of the invention, on their outer side, the two discs each comprise an oblong indentation, which is splayed towards the periphery, and at the end of which there is disposed a pivot, and the latch additionally comprises two arms which are spaced from one another, parallel to one another, perpendicular to the axis of articulation of the latch, as well as to the plane of the tabs, and each comprise at their end an aperture which can cooperate with the pivot of the associated disc.</p>
    <p num="17">According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the latch can support the drive roller for the rolled paper strip, and, in the locked position, the print head is supported resiliently on the drive roller, whereas in the unlocked position, the print head is spaced from the drive roller for the paper strip.</p>
    <p num="18">In practice, each tab is integral with a flexible lug, which can receive a clamping force which is designed to lock/unlock the catches of the tabs in their respective recesses.</p>
    <p num="19">Preferably, the latch comprises a detector for the presence of the paper strip in front of the print head.</p>
    <p num="20">Advantageously, the two discs of the cover each comprise on their cross-section a stop which is designed to cooperate with the cylindrical wall of the fixed frame, in order to distribute the forces along the entirety of the said wall.</p>
    <p num="21">Advantageously, each indentation of the disc comprises a stop, which can cooperate with an aperture provided on each arm, in order to permit pivoting of the latch, as well as pivoting of the cover.</p>
    <p num="22">According to an application of the printing device according to the invention, to a (plug-in or cordless) portable payment terminal, the fixed part of the frame can receive and accommodate the component elements of the said payment terminal, without securing means.</p>
    <p num="23">Advantageously, in the portable payment terminal application of the type which comprises a keypad with keys, the said keypad comprises a protective casing, with dimensions which are substantially adapted to those of the keypad, which is disposed in the vicinity of the said keypad, and comprises apertures with shapes which are substantially adapted to those of the keys, the said casing being articulated according to an axis which is parallel to the plane of the keypad, between an open position, in which the casing is spaced from the keypad, in order to form a protective screen during acquisition of data via the keys, and a position in which the protective casing covers the said keypad, the keys projecting through the apertures which are provided in the said casing.</p>
    <p num="24">A protective casing of this type makes it possible to protect the terminal user against indiscreet glances, when confidential data is being acquired via the keys.</p>
    <p num="25">In addition, the casing is detachable, which allows the non-perforated part to provide a new communication or personalisation vector for the portable payment terminal.</p>
    <p num="26">
      Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description and drawings.
