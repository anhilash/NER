      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to acrylic ultraviolet light absorber and hindered amine light stabilizer compounds, method therefore and coating compositions containing the same, wherein the compounds include a carbamate functionality.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Discussion of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Curable coating compositions such as thermoset coatings are widely used in the coatings art.
      <br/>
      They are often used for topcoats in the automotive and industrial coatings industry.
      <br/>
      Color-plus-clear composite coatings are particularly useful as topcoats where exceptional gloss, depth of color, distinctness of image, or special metallic effects are desired.
      <br/>
      The automotive industry has made extensive use of these coatings for automotive body panels.
      <br/>
      Color-plus-clear composite coatings, however, require an extremely high degree of clarity in the clearcoat to achieve the desired visual effect.
      <br/>
      High-gloss coatings also require a low degree of visual aberrations at the surface of the coating in order to achieve the desired visual effect such as high distinctness of image (DOI).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the field of automotive coatings, it has become an objective to obtain a clearcoat (i.e., the outermost automotive coating) that is resistant to being etched by environmental fallout.
      <br/>
      Environmental etching is manifested by pitting, water spotting or chemical spotting of the coating or any combination of these.
      <br/>
      Environmental etch resistance is desirable because it improves the appearance and useful life of the coating.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Environmental etch resistance can be measured by visual examination of the coating, or by a profilometer or by subjecting a coating on a test panel to a saline solution in a temperature gradient oven test.
      <br/>
      Environmental etch resistance is generally measured by visual examination by individuals skilled at examining finishes for the degree of environmental etch therein.
      <br/>
      Environmental etch resistance has become more important as the amount of acid rain, and other industrial fallout has increased.
      <br/>
      Currently, environmental etching of automotive finishes is generally greatest in the areas most greatly affected by industrial fallout.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The incorporation of the HALS or UVAs as free additions or as polymer or oligomer bound UVA or HALS into a coating composition generally improves resistance of the coating composition to degradation caused by ultraviolet light exposure.
      <br/>
      Binding the HALS or UVA to an oligomer or polymer stabilizes the HALS or UVA in a coating composition, prevents migration of the UVA or HALS into other coating layers and retains the UVA or HALS in the clearcoat, where it is needed.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A coating composition containing a carbamate functional resin has shown to be effective against environmental etch even without the addition of HALS and UVAs.
      <br/>
      The addition of free HALS and UvAs, (i.e. not polymer- or oligomer-bound), has effected little or no improvement in environmental etch resistance in the coatings containing carbamate functional resins.
      <br/>
      Unexpectedly, it has been shown that addition of the polymer- or oligomer-bound HALS or UVA to a carbamate containing coating provides improved environmental etch resistance of the cured film.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      According to the present invention, durability enhancing agents comprising oligomer-bound and polymer-bound ultraviolet light absorber (UVA) or hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) compounds comprise a UVA and/or HALS bonded to an oligomeric or polymeric component, and the agents include more than one carbamate functional group, or group convertible to a carbamate functional group.
      <br/>
      The oligomer or polymer may comprise more than one UVA or HALS bound thereto, or a mixture of UVA(s) and HALS bound thereto.
      <br/>
      The oligomer-bound or polymer-bound UVA or HALS may also include additional reactive functionality that is crosslinkable into a cured coating film.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The oligomer- or polymer-bound HALS or UVA may comprise the principal resin or a separate component of the coating composition.
      <br/>
      The invention is also directed to the cured coating composition, and a method for incorporating ultraviolet light absorbing compounds and hindered amine light stabilizers into a cured coating composition comprising reacting the ultraviolet light absorbing and/or hindered amine light stabilizing compound into a crosslinked matrix which is formed upon curing the coating composition.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Generally, the incorporation of the polymer- or oligomer- bound UVA or HALS into a coating composition stabilizes the HALS or UVA in a coating composition, prevents migration of the UVA or HALS into other coating layers and retains the UVA or HALS in the where it is needed.
      <br/>
      The polymer- or oligomer-bound HALS or UVA according to the present invention, including carbamate functionality, provides the unexpected result of improved environmental etch resistance of the cured film.

      One method of preparation of oligomeric compounds having carbamate functionality is to react an alcohol (`alcohol` is defined herein as having one or more OH groups) with more than one urea to form a compound with carbamate groups.
      <br/>
      This reaction is accomplished by heating a mixture of the alcohol and ureas.
      <br/>
      This reaction is also performed under heat, preferably in the presence of a catalyst as is known in the art.
      <br/>
      Another technique is the reaction of an alcohol with cyanic acid to form a compound with primary carbamate groups (i.e., unsubstituted carbamates).
      <br/>
      Carbamates may also be prepared by reaction of an alcohol with phosgene and then ammonia to form a compound having primary carbamate groups, or by reaction of an alcohol with phosgene and then a primary amine to form a compound having secondary carbamate groups.

      Another approach is to react an isocyanate (e.g., HDI, IPDI) with a compound such as hydroxypropyl carbamate to form a carbamate-capped isocyanate derivative.
      <br/>
      Finally, carbamates can be prepared by a transcarbamylation approach where an alcohol is reacted with an alkyl carbamate (e.g., methyl carbamate, ethyl carbamate, butyl carbamate) to form a primary carbamate group-containing compound.
      <br/>
      This reaction is performed under heat, preferably in the presence of a catalyst such as an organometallic catalyst (e.g., dibutyltin dilaurate).
      <br/>
      Other techniques for preparing carbamates are also known in the art and are described, for example, in P. Adams &amp; F. Baron, "Esters of Carbamic Acid", Chemical Review, v. 65, 1965.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      Various alcohols can be used in the preparation of carbamate compounds useful in the invention.
      <br/>
      They generally have from 1 to 200 carbon atoms, preferably 1-60 carbon atoms, and may be monofunctional or polyfunctional (preferably a functionality of 2 to 3), aliphatic, aromatic, or cycloaliphatic.
      <br/>
      They may contain just OH groups, or they may contain OH groups plus heteroatoms such as O, S, Si, N, P, and other groups such as ester groups, ether groups, amino groups, or unsaturated sites.
      <br/>
      Examples of useful alcohols include 1,6-hexanediol,1,2-hexanediol, 2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol, ethyl-propyl-1,5-pentanediol, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol, 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyn-4,7-diol, 1,3-dihydroxyacetone dimer, 2-butene-1,4-diol, pantothenol, dimethyltartrate, pentaethylene glycol, dimethyl silyl dipropanol, and 2,2'-thiodiethanol.

    <p num="65">
      In the above formula, R represents H or CH3.
      <br/>
      R' represents H, alkyl, preferably of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or cycloalkyl, preferably up to 6 ring carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that the terms alkyl and cycloalkyl are to include substituted alkyl and cycloalkyl, such as halogen-substituted alkyl or cycloalkyl.
      <br/>
      Substituents that will have an adverse impact on the properties of the cured material, however, are to be avoided.
      <br/>
      For example, ether linkages are thought to be susceptible to photo-induced hydrolysis, and should be avoided in locations that would place the ether linkage in the crosslink matrix.
      <br/>
      The values x and y represent weight percentages, with x being 10 to 90% and preferably 20 to 50%, and y being 90 to 10% and preferably 80 to 50%.

      In the formula, A represents repeat units derived from one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers.

      L represents a divalent linking group, preferably an aliphatic group of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, cycloaliphatic, or aromatic linking group of 6 to 10 carbon atoms.

      In one preferred embodiment, -L- is represented by --COO-L'-- where L' is a divalent linking group.
      <br/>
      Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the polymer component (a) is represented by randomly repeating units according to the following formula:  (Chemical Structure image '16' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      In this formula, R, R', A, x, and y are as defined above.

      L' may be a divalent aliphatic linking group, preferably of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, e.g., --(CH2)--, --(CH2)2 --, --(CH2)4 --, and the like, or a divalent cycloaliphatic linking group, preferably up to 8 carbon atoms, e.g., cyclohexyl, and the like.
      <br/>
      However, other divalent linking groups can be used, depending on the technique used to prepare the polymer.
      <br/>
      For example, if a hydroxyalkyl carbamate is adducted onto an isocyanate-functional acrylic polymer, the linking group L' would include an --NHCOO-- urethane linkage as a residue of the isocyanate group.
      <br/>
      This carbamate functional acrylic polymer is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,811 which is hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      The carbamate functional polymer component used in the composition of the invention can be prepared in a variety of ways.
      <br/>
      One way to prepare such polymers is to prepare an acrylic monomer having a carbamate functionality in the ester portion of the monomer.
      <br/>
      Such monomers are well-known in the art and are described, for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,479,328, 3,674,838, 4,126,747, 4,279,833, and 4,340,497, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      One method of synthesis involves reaction of a hydroxy ester with urea to form the carbamyloxy carboxylate (i.e., carbamate-modified acrylic).
      <br/>
      Another method of synthesis reacts an  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated acid ester with a hydroxy carbamate ester to form the carbamyloxy carboxylate.
      <br/>
      Yet another technique involves formation of a hydroxyalkyl carbamate by reacting ammonia, or a primary or secondary amine or diamine with a cyclic carbonate such as ethylene carbonate.
      <br/>
      The hydroxyl group on the hydroxyalkyl carbamate is then esterified by reaction with acrylic or methacrylic acid to form the monomer.
      <br/>
      Other methods of preparing carbamate-modified acrylic monomers are described in the art, and can be utilized as well.
      <br/>
      The acrylic monomer can then be polymerized along with other ethylenically-unsaturated monomers, if desired, by techniques well-known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      An alternative route for preparing a carbamate functional acrylic polymer for use in the composition of the invention is to react an already-formed polymer such as an acrylic polymer with another component to form a carbamate-functional group appended to the polymer backbone, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,758,632, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      One technique for preparing such acrylic polymers involves thermally decomposing urea (to give off ammonia and HNCO) in the presence of a hydroxy-functional acrylic polymer or co-polymer to form a carbamate-functional acrylic polymer.
      <br/>
      Another technique involves reacting the hydroxyl group of a hydroxyalkyl carbamate with the isocyanate group of an isocyanate-functional acrylic or vinyl monomer to form the carbamate-functional acrylic.
      <br/>
      Isocyanate-functional acrylics are known in the art and are described, for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,301,257, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Isocyanate vinyl monomers are well-known in the art and include unsaturated m-tetramethyl xylene isocyanate (sold by American Cyanamid as TMI.RTM.).
      <br/>
      Yet another technique is to react the cyclic carbonate group on a cyclic carbonate-functional acrylic with ammonia in order to form the carbamate-functional acrylic.
      <br/>
      Cyclic carbonate-functional acrylic polymers are known in the art and are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 2,979,514, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      A more difficult, but feasible way of preparing the polymer would be to trans-esterify an acrylate polymer with a hydroxyalkyl carbamate.

      An example of this is reaction of 2-carbamate ethyl methacrylate with either a (Norblock) and/or TMI, followed by reaction with a hydroxyl functional UVA or HALS.
      <br/>
      Other monomers may be also included in the reaction.

      Such reactive groups include active methylol or methylalkoxy groups on aminoplast crosslinking agents or on other compounds such as phenol/formaldehyde adducts, isocyanate groups, siloxane groups, cyclic carbonate groups, and anhydride groups.
    </p>
    <p num="75">Examples of crosslinking agents include melamine formaldehyde resin (including monomeric or polymeric melamine resin and partially or fully alkylated melamine resin), blocked or unblocked polyisocyanates (e.g., TDI, MDI, isophorone diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, and isocyanurate trimers of these, which may be blocked for example with alcohols or oximes), Aminoplast resin such as melamine formaldehyde resin or urea formaldehyde resin are especially preferred.</p>
    <p num="76">
      The preferred aminoplast resins for this purpose include monomeric or polymeric melamine formaldehyde resins, alkoxylated melamine formaldehyde resins and mixtures of alkoxylated melamine formaldehyde resins.
      <br/>
      The isocyanate crosslinkers suitable for purposes of the present invention include TDI, MDI, isophorone diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, and isocyanurate trimers of these, which may be blocked for example with alcohols or oximes selected from the group consisting of triazines benzotriazoles, 2-hydroxybenzophenone compounds, oxanilides, and mixtures thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="77">Where an aminoplast crosslinking agent is used, and the aminoplast is reacted with carbamate functionality, or functionality convertible to a carbamate, excess aminoplast groups are left to crosslink with the reactive functionality on the principal resin.</p>
    <p num="78">
      While the oligomer-bound or polymer-bound HALS may be used in any layer of a multi-layer coating composition, it is preferably used in a clearcoat composition.
      <br/>
      The clearcoat may be used alone or with a pigmented basecoat composition.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The pigmented basecoat composition may any of a number of types well-known in the art, and does not require explanation in detail herein.
      <br/>
      Polymers known in the art to be useful in basecoat compositions include acrylics, vinyls, polyurethanes, polycarbonates, polyesters, alkyds, and polysiloxanes.
      <br/>
      Preferred polymers include acrylics and polyurethanes.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the basecoat composition also utilizes a carbamate-functional acrylic polymer.
      <br/>
      Basecoat polymers may be thermoplastic, but are preferably crosslinkable and comprise one or more type of cross-linkable functional groups.
      <br/>
      Such groups include, for example, hydroxy, isocyanate, amine, epoxy, acrylate, vinyl, silane, and acetoacetate groups.
      <br/>
      These groups may be masked or blocked in such a way so that they are unblocked and available for the cross-linking reaction under the desired curing conditions, generally elevated temperatures.
      <br/>
      Useful cross-linkable functional groups include hydroxy, epoxy, acid, anhydride, silane, and acetoacetate groups.
      <br/>
      Preferred cross-linkable functional groups include hydroxy functional groups and amino functional groups.
