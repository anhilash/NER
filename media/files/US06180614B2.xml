    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Viral and bacterial diseases in fin-fish, shellfish or other aquatic lifeforms pose a serious problem for the aquaculture industry.
      <br/>
      Owing to the high density of animals in the hatchery tanks or enclosed marine farming areas, infectious diseases may eradicate a large proportion of the stock in, for example, a fin-fish, shellfish, or other aquatic lifeforms facility.
      <br/>
      Prevention of disease is a more desired remedy to these threats to fish than intervention once the disease is in progress.
      <br/>
      Vaccination of fish is the only preventative method which may offer long-term protection through immunity.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The fish immune system has many features similar to the mammalian immune system, such as the presence of B cells, T cells, lymphokines, complement, and immunoglobulins.
      <br/>
      Fish have lymphocyte subclasses with roles that appear similar in many respects to those of the B and T cells of mammals.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the efficiency of the immune response of fish can be affected by outside stresses, as is true in mammals.
      <br/>
      However, fish, unlike mammals, display a temperature-dependent development of protective immunity in response to antigens.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Most vaccines for fish have been developed against bacteria while there have been very few fish vaccines made for combating viral or parasitic diseases.
      <br/>
      Fish have been immunized by antigen-based immunization methods using live attenuated pathogens, killed whole pathogens, or more recently, in laboratory settings, recombinant proteins.
      <br/>
      While live attenuated vaccines induce good humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and can be administered orally or by immersion or injection, there is the important risk of reversion to a virulent form.
      <br/>
      Whole live attenuated vaccines are not preferred in industrial farming due to the risk of contaminating other fish--a live attenuated vaccine which may be generally safe for the target species of fish may be virulent in other species of fish.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Fish vaccines using whole killed bacteria (i.e. bacterins) or recombinant proteins from pathogens expressed in cell lines (subunit vaccines) have the disadvantage of inducing short-lived immune responses.
      <br/>
      Injected antigen, including recombinant protein, is processed solely in an exogenous form usually causing induction of a humoral response (i.e., production of antibodies) but often a failure to induce cell-mediated immunity (i.e., cytotoxic T-cells).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Another disadvantage of whole killed and subunit vaccines is that they almost always must be injected and they require an adjuvant to induce an effective immune response.
      <br/>
      Intramuscular injections of these adjuvants can cause granuloma formation which scars the flesh and lowers the market value of the fish.
      <br/>
      Intraperitoneal injection of adjuvants may cause adhesions between the viscera which can affect the health of the fish and retard fish growth.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Recombinant protein vaccines are difficult and expensive to make especially if the protein must be purified.
      <br/>
      For example, bacterially-expressed recombinant proteins may form inclusion bodies from which recovery of protein in correct configuration may be low or nonexistent.
      <br/>
      Induction of an immune response may require that the antigenic protein be correctly glycosylated and folded, which may not be accomplished in a cell other than an animal cell.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Some of the current methodologies for administering vaccines are not technically or economically practical.
      <br/>
      For example, direct injection of recombinant and whole killed pathogen vaccines into the fish is labor intensive and expensive relative to the future market value of the fish.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, injection needles can cross-infect fish with contaminating pathogenic organisms, and accidental injection of humans can cause severe or fatal infections and anaphylactic reactions.
      <br/>
      Moreover, noninjurious injection of small fish is very difficult, especially in young fry, which are particularly susceptible to disease.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A less expensive and easier method which has been used to administer killed viral or bacterial vaccines is an oral method wherein the vaccine is added directly to the water or incorporated into fish food.
      <br/>
      Oral vaccines have historically shown inconsistent and relatively low levels of protection suggesting that they may be best used as a method of revaccination.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Genes have been introduced directly into animals by using live viral vectors containing particular sequences from an adenovirus, an adeno-associated virus, or a retrovirus genome.
      <br/>
      The viral sequences allow the appropriate processing and packaging of a gene into a virion, which can be introduced to animals through invasive or non-invasive infection.
      <br/>
      Viral vectors have several disadvantages.
      <br/>
      Viral vectors being live pathogens, still carry the risk of inadvertent infection.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, proteins from viral vector sequences induce undesirable inflammatory or other immune responses which may prevent the possibility of using the same vector for a subsequent vaccine or boost.
      <br/>
      Viral vectors also limit the size of the target gene that can be expressed due to viral packaging constraints.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Naked DNA transfects relatively efficiently if injected into skeletal muscle but poorly or not at all if injected into other tissues (Wolff et al., Science 247:1465-1468 (1990), incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      Plasmid DNA coated onto the surface of small gold particles and introduced into the skin by a helium-driven particle accelerator or "gene-gun" can directly transfect cells of the epidermis and dermis (Pecorino and Lo, Current Biol., 2:30-32 (1992), which is incorporated herein by reference).
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      DNA has also been introduced into animal cells by liposome-mediated gene transfer.
      <br/>
      DNA-liposome complexes, usually containing a mixture of cationic and neutral lipids, are injected into various tissues or instilled into the respiratory passages.
      <br/>
      Nabel et al., Hum. Gene Ther., 3:649-656 (1992), which is incorporated herein by reference, have shown that liposomes may be used to transfect a wide variety of cell types by intravenous injection in mammals.
      <br/>
      In addition, liposome-mediated gene transfer has been used to transfer the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance gene into the nasal epithelium of mice and humans suffering from cystic fibrosis (Yoshimura et al., Nucleic Acids Reg., 12:3233-3240 (1992) and Caplan et al., Nature Med., 1:39-46 (1995), respectively, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Substances may also be administered using biodegradable microspheres composed of polymers such as polyester poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (Marx et al., Science, 260:1323-1328 (1993), incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      It is notable that these particles can survive the upper digestive system and arrive intact in cells of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (Eldridge et al., Adv. Exp. Med. Biol., 251:191-202 (1989), incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      Biodegradable microspheres have been used to deliver recombinant antigens, toxoids or attenuated virus into mammals by systemic and oral routes (O'Hagan et al., Immunology 73:239-242 (1991); O'Hagen et al., Vaccine 11:149-154 (1993); Eldridge et al., Mol. Immunol. 228:287-293 (1991) incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      They may also be useful to deliver recombinant plasmid DNA to gut-associated lymphoid tissue for the purpose of immunization.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      While most work has been carried out on mammals, plasmid DNA encoding reporter genes have been successfully introduced into fish by intramuscular injection (Hansen et al., FEBS Lett. 290:73-76 (1991), incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      Thus, cells in fish can express proteins from a foreign gene with the same types of vector constructs (i.e., backbones, promoter and enhancer elements) that are used in mammals.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The induction of an immune response to a protein expressed from an introduced gene was first suggested by Acsadi et al., New Biologist 3:71-81 (1991), which is incorporated herein by reference, who found that after plasmid DNA transfer into rat cardiac muscle, reporter gene expression was transient but could be prolonged by treatment with an immuno-suppressant.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, it was shown that antibodies were induced in rodents against human growth hormone (Tang et al., Nature, 356:152-154 (1992); Eisenbraun et al., DNA Cell. Biol., 12:791-797 (1993), both of which are incorporated herein by reference) or human  ALPHA -antitrypsin (Tang et al., Nature, 356:152-154 (1992), also incorporated herein by reference) when these proteins were expressed from DNA coated onto gold particles and introduced into cells of the skin by bombardment.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      DNA-based immunization refers to the induction of an immune response to an antigen expressed in vivo from a gene introduced into the animal.
      <br/>
      This method offers two major advantages over classical vaccination in which some form of the antigen itself is administered.
      <br/>
      First, the synthesis of antigen in a self-cell mimics in certain respects an infection and thus induces a complete immune response but carries absolutely no risk of infection.
      <br/>
      Second, foreign gene expression may continue for a sufficient length of time to induce strong and sustained immune responses without boost.
    </p>

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">
      The present invention relates to the immunization of cultured fin-fish, shellfish, or other aquatic animals ("aquaculture species") by DNA expression systems to overcome many disadvantages associated with antigen-based vaccines.
      <br/>
      The present invention relates to introduction of DNA plasmids (alone or in a formulation) containing sequences encoding antigenic components of viral, bacterial or parasitic diseases by transfection into aquaculture species.
      <br/>
      The methods and compositions of this invention are useful for immunization (i.e., for prophylactic vaccination or therapeutic immunization) of fin-fish, shellfish or other aquatic animals against infectious diseases.
      <br/>
      The DNA sequences according to this invention are preferably present in vectors capable of inducing protein expression of these sequences (i.e. expression vectors) and may be administered alone or in combination with other DNA sequences in the same or other expression vectors or as oligonucleotides.
      <br/>
      These additional DNA sequences may encode cytokines, costimulatory molecules, or may include immunostimulatory sequences (e.g., CpG motifs).
      <br/>
      The DNA sequences may also be given with other adjuvants, such as alum.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The present invention also relates to methods of administration of DNA expression vectors to aquaculture species, which may or may not encode polypeptides from pathogens.
      <br/>
      DNA vectors of this invention may be administered to aquaculture species by oral route, injection, spray, or immersion.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the DNA expression vectors of this invention are administered by immersion techniques or automated injection devices.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="21">
      The present invention provides for methods and compositions for immunizing cultured fin-fish, shellfish, and other aquatic animals against infection by viral, bacterial or parasitic pathogens.
      <br/>
      In basic outline, DNA encoding a polypeptide component of a pathogen is introduced into an animal, and the polypeptide is expressed in cells of the animal, thus inducing an immune response that confers protection against natural infection by the pathogen or helps overcome an ongoing and possibly chronic infection.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method for immunizing cultured fin-fish, shellfish, or other aquatic animals against disease, comprising immersion of the animals in an aqueous solution containing formulated plasmid DNA encoding one or more antigenic determinants of an infectious agent (regardless of codon usage), whereby the DNA enters cells of the animal where it is expressed leading to induction of immune responses.
      <br/>
      The immunization procedure may be prophylactic to prevent infection from occurring or may be therapeutic to treat pre-existing infections.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Few anti-viral vaccines have been marketed for fish.
      <br/>
      This is largely due to the difficulty of growing virus in culture for the production of whole killed viral vaccines or safe attenuated strains of virus.
      <br/>
      Antigen-based vaccines using purified recombinant proteins are difficult and expensive to produce in large scale and may have poor immunogenicity in fish.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      DNA-based immunization has several advantages.
      <br/>
      The antigenic protein is synthesized in vivo giving rise to both humoral and cell-mediated (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) immune responses.
      <br/>
      However, unlike live attenuated pathogens, which also synthesize protein in vivo, DNA vaccines carry no risk of inadvertent infection.
      <br/>
      Unlike antigen-based immunization, DNA-based vaccination does not require the use of traditional adjuvants to generate an effective immune response.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, DNA used in the methods of this invention is inexpensive and easy to manufacture and purify.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      DNA-based immunization also allows the host animal to produce foreign antigens within its own tissue thereby resulting in several advantages.
      <br/>
      One advantage is the efficient presentation of the foreign antigen to the immune system due to the expression of a protein within a self-cell, which could be an antigen-presenting cell.
      <br/>
      Another advantage is the correct folding, protein modification, and disulfide bonding of a protein expressed in a host cell, especially for viral proteins, which are normally produced in cells of hosts.
      <br/>
      Recombinant viral proteins synthesized in bacterial or yeast cells may be incorrectly post-translationally modified and are often massed in inclusion bodies, which make the proteins difficult to purify or ineffective if administered in unpurified form.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Immune responses in fish are temperature dependent.
      <br/>
      Antigen-based vaccines may give rise to sub-optimal immune responses if such vaccines are given at the wrong temperature.
      <br/>
      DNA-based immunization is advantageous because expression of the antigenic protein could continue over a long period until such time as to stimulate an immune response when the temperature is optimal.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Another advantage of prolonged synthesis of antigen is the induction of immune responses as soon as the immune system is mature.
      <br/>
      Fish may be unable to induce sufficient immune responses at a young age.
      <br/>
      For example, trout and halibut may not produce lymphoid cells until as late as ten and thirty days after hatching, respectively, and T-dependent immune responses do not appear until months after hatching.
      <br/>
      Using the methods of this invention, expression of foreign protein in fish can continue at least four months after transfection indicating that DNA-based immunization may be preferred for vaccination of young fish.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The term "vaccine" herein refers to a material capable of producing an immune response.
      <br/>
      A vaccine according to this invention would produce immunity against disease in cultured fin-fish, shellfish and other aquatic species.
      <br/>
      One of skill in the art would readily appreciate that activation of CTL activity resulting from in vivo synthesis of antigen would produce immunity against disease not only prophylactically but also therapeutically (after development of disease in culture).
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Aquaculture species treated by methods of this invention will include a diversity of species of cultured fin-fish, shellfish, and other aquatic animals.
      <br/>
      Fin-fish include all vertebrate fish, which may be bony or cartilaginous fish.
      <br/>
      A preferred embodiment of this invention is the immunization of fin-fish.
      <br/>
      These fin-fish include but are not limited to salmonids, carp, catfish, yellowtail, seabream, and seabass.
      <br/>
      Salmonids are a family of fin-fish which include trout (including rainbow trout), salmon, and Arctic char.
      <br/>
      Examples of shellfish include, but are not limited to, clams, lobster, shrimp, crab, and oysters.
      <br/>
      Other cultured aquatic animals include, but are not limited to eels, squid, and octopi.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Purification of DNA on a large scale may be accomplished by anion exchange chromatography (for example, resins manufactured by Qiagen, U.S. FDA Drug Master File (DMF-6224)).</p>
    <p num="31">
      DNA which is introduced to aquaculture species will encode foreign polypeptides (e.g., those derived from viral, bacterial or parasitic pathogens).
      <br/>
      Polypeptides of this invention refer to complete proteins or fragments thereof, including peptides which are epitopes (e.g., a CTL epitope) associated with an infectious virus, bacterium or parasite.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      DNA sequences encoding a complete or large parts of an antigenic protein are preferred where humoral immunity is desired rather than DNA sequences encoding smaller parts, such as only CTL epitopes, as are preferred where cell-mediated immunity is desired and humoral immunity may be deleterious.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, the DNA sequences encoding polypeptides of viral pathogens may be selected from the group consisting of glycoprotein (G) or nucleoprotein (N) of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV); G or N proteins of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV); VP1, VP2, VP3 or N structural proteins of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV); G protein of spring viremia of carp (SVC); and a membrane-associated protein, tegumin or capsid protein or glycoprotein of channel catfish virus (CCV).
    </p>
    <p num="33">In other preferred embodiments, the DNA sequences encoding polypeptides of bacterial pathogens may be selected from the group consisting of an iron-regulated outer membrane protein, (IROMP), an outer membrane protein (OMP), and an A-protein of Aeromonis salmonicida which causes furunculosis, p57 protein of Renibacterium salmoninarum which causes bacterial kidney disease (BKD), major surface associated antigen (msa), a surface expressed cytotoxin (mpr), a surface expressed hemolysin (ish), and a flagellar antigen of Yersiniosis; an extracellular protein (ECP), an iron-regulated outer membrane protein (IROMP), and a structural protein of Pasteurellosis; an OMP and a flagellar protein of Vibrosis anguillarum and V. ordalli; a flagellar protein, an OMP protein, aroA, and purA of Edwardsiellosis ictaluri and E. tarda; and surface antigen of Ichthyophthirius; and a structural and regulatory protein of Cytophaga columnari; and a structural and regulatory protein of Rickettsia.</p>
    <p num="34">In yet another preferred embodiment, the DNA sequences encoding polypeptides of a parasitic pathogen may be selected from one of the surface antigens of Ichthyophthirius.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The methods of this invention could also be used to introduce plasmid vectors encoding polypeptides endogenous to the animal, but which might be normally present in low concentrations (e.g., growth hormones).
      <br/>
      In this case the expression proteins would serve a physiological role (i.e. enhanced growth) rather than induce an immune response.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Vectors useful in the making of expression plasmids include, but are not limited to, vectors containing constitutive promoters, inducible promoters, tissue-specific promoters, or promoters from the gene of the antigen being expressed.
      <br/>
      Constitutive promoters may include strong viral promoters, for example, promoter sequences from cytomegalovirus (CMV), Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), simian virus-40 (SV40), or herpes simplex virus (HSV).
      <br/>
      Tissue-specific promoters may include the muscle beta-actin promoter or the thymidine kinase promoter.
      <br/>
      An inducible or regulatable promoter, for example, may include a growth hormone regulatable promoter, a promoter under the control of lac operon sequences or an antibiotic inducible promoter or a Zinc-inducible metallothionein promoter.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The vector should include an expression control sequence comprising a promoter (e.g., inducible or constitutive promoters described above) DNA sequence, and may include, but is not limited to, an enhancer element, an RNA processing sequence such as an intronic sequence for splicing of a transcript or a polyadenylation signal (e.g., from simian virus-40 (SV40) or bovine growth hormone (BGH)), a signal sequence for secretion of the expressed protein, or one or more copies of immunostimulatory DNA sequences known as CpG motifs.
      <br/>
      The vector should also include one or more of the following DNA sequences: bacterial origin of replication sequences, a selectable marker, which may be for antibiotic resistance (e.g., kanamycin) or for non-antibiotic resistance (e.g.,  BETA -galactosidase gene).
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Oligonucleotides having unmethylated CpG dinucleotides have been shown to activate the immune system (A.
      <br/>
      Krieg, et al., "CpG motifs in Bacterial DNA Trigger Directed B Cell Activation" Nature 374:546-549 (1995)).
      <br/>
      Depending on the flanking sequences, certain CpG motifs may be more immunostimulatory for B cell or T cell responses, and preferentially stimulate certain species.
      <br/>
      Copies of CpG motifs in DNA expression vectors act as adjuvants facilitating the induction of an immune response against an expressed protein.
      <br/>
      A CpG motif, a stretch of DNA containing CpG dinucleotides within a specified sequence, may be as short as 5-40 base pairs in length.
      <br/>
      Multiple CpG motifs may be inserted into the non-coding region of the expression vector.
      <br/>
      When a humoral response is desired, preferred CpG motifs will be those that preferentially stimulate a B cell response.
      <br/>
      When cell-mediated immunity is desired, preferred CpG motifs will be those that stimulate secretion of cytokines known to facilitate a CD8+ T cell response.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Other CpG motifs have be found to inhibit immune responses.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment of the application, these immunoinhibitory CpG motifs would be removed or mutated in a DNA expression vector used by the methods of this invention, without disrupting the expression of polypeptides therefrom.

      An additional preferred embodiment of this invention relates to the administration of a vector containing one or more different DNA sequences, one sequence encoding an antigen and the others encoding polypeptides which may or may not be antigenic.
      <br/>
      For example, the vector may encode two antigens from the same pathogen.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the different antigen(s) may induce an immune response against a different pathogen and thus serve as a multivalent vaccine.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the other polypeptides may serve to enhance an immune response against a targeted pathogen (e.g., helper epitopes, cytokines, carrier polypeptides, cholera toxin subunits, or other immunostimulants).
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      When two or more polypeptide-encoding DNA sequences are present in one vector, the transcription of each antigen-encoding DNA sequence may be directed from its own promoter.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, one promoter may drive the expression of two or more antigen-encoding DNA sequences joined in frame to each other to express a fusion protein.
      <br/>
      For example, VP2 and VP3 proteins of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) may be fused.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, DNA sequences encoding two or more antigens from different diseases may be joined to form a multivalent vaccine when expressed.

      <br/>
      In a more preferred embodiment, the envelope proteins of hepatitis B virus will be the small and major protein (also referred to as surface antigen).

      Alternatively, the DNA sequences encoding additional antigens may be administered by using a second vector containing such sequences.
      <br/>
      Such sequences may encode antigens from the same pathogen or different pathogens, or cytokines, cholera toxin subunits, or other immunostimulants.
      <br/>
      Such a vector may be administered concurrently or sequentially with the first expression vector.
      <br/>
      A preferred embodiment of this invention is the concurrent administration of expression vectors.
      <br/>
      One vector may be induced to express protein simultaneously with or after expression of protein from the other vector.

      Rainbow trout were euthanized by an overdose of tricaine (0.1% w/v).
      <br/>
      Zebra fish were killed by immersion in ice.
      <br/>
      The muscle or gills of the fish were removed on ice, homogenized, centrifuged to pellet cellular debris, and the supernatants containing soluble proteins were assayed for luciferase activity.
      <br/>
      Luciferase assays were carried out using a kit commercially available from Promega Corporation.
      <br/>
      Light emission in relative light units (RLU) was quantitated by a luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) over a ten second interval and background values from control samples were subtracted.

      Nanogram amounts of plasmid DNA were able to induce detectable protein expression in both the injected muscle as well as more distant cells (e.g., in gills), showing that different types of cells, possibly including antigen presenting cells (APC), are transfectable by plasmid DNA and are capable of synthesis of foreign protein.
      <br/>
      Cells distant to the site of injection (i.e. gills) expressed lower amounts of protein than the injected muscle cells.

      Zebra fish and trout are not closely related species of fish.

      Cationic polymer liposomes designated Q203, Q205, Q206, Q208, Q250, and QX were obtained from Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany.
      <br/>
      Cationic polymer liposomes are composed of a mixture of cationic polymers and neutral lipids.
      <br/>
      Such transfection reagents were prepared as described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application entitled, "A Novel Class of Cationic Reagents for High Efficient and Cell-Type-Specific Introduction of Nucleic Acids into Eukaryotic Cells", incorporated by reference herein.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      For example, a cationic polymer (either Q203, Q205, Q206, Q208, Q250 or QX, described below in Table 7) and a neutral lipid, dioleoyloxiphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) were mixed together for a final concentration of 2 mM in chloroform, which was then evaporated off in a rotary evaporator at 60 (degree)  C. The mixture was dried for 10 minutes under a reduced pressure of 10 to 15 mbar.
      <br/>
      Under sterile conditions, endotoxin free deionized water was added to the mixture, which was then heated while stirring at 60 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      Next, Q203, Q205, Q250, and QX were sonicated once for 300 seconds at 60 (degree)  C. In the case of Q250, trans  BETA  carotene was added to a final concentration of 0.37 mM before sonication.
      <br/>
      Q206 and Q208 were not sonicated but were stirred at 60 (degree)  C. until the solutions became transparent or slightly opalescent.
      <br/>
      The total concentration of DOPE+cationic polymer for all liposomes was 2 mM.
      <br/>
      The concentration of DOPE in each liposome can be calculated by multiplying the X(DOPE) value in Table 7 by 2 mM so that, for example, Q203-containing liposomes are 1.7 mM DOPE and 0.3 mM Q203. Table 7 (below) summarizes the cationic polymer liposomes used in the methods of this invention.

      Purified pCMVA -VP3 DNA (encoding the VP3 protein of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus) was prepared as described previously for pCMV-luc DNA and injected intramuscularly in mice or trout.
      <br/>
      Each of three adult female BALB/C mice received 100  MU g in tibialis anterior muscle while a single one-year old female trout received 200 ug in the tail muscle.

      Two weeks later, the humoral immune response against the expressed antigen was determined by ELISA assay of plasma taken from the mice and fish to detect anti-VP3 antibody.

    <p num="109">
      The ELISA assay was performed using standard techniques.
      <br/>
      In particular, 96-well plates were coated with infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) particles, blocked with a non-specific protein, and then washed.
      <br/>
      Ten-fold serial dilutions of trout or mice plasma and control plasma (obtained from non-injected mice and fish or from animals injected with control DNA not encoding VP3) were put in the appropriate wells (100  MU l/well) were incubated for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      After washing, bound anti-VP3 antibodies in trout and mouse plasma were detected by addition of horse-radish peroxidase-labeled (HRP) mouse anti-trout or goat anti-mouse IgG monoclonal antibodies, respectively.
      <br/>
      Amounts of bound antibody were quantitated by reaction with O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, which is cleaved by HRP producing a color measurable by a spectrophotometer at OD450.

      Furthermore, the collective results show that an immune response can be induced if the protein is antigenic, for example a protein of a fish pathogen.
