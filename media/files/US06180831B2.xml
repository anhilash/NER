    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      BETA -Hydroxyaldehydes are significant as starting compounds for the production of compounds such as, e.g., dicarboxylic acids and their derivatives.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, diols such as, e.g., 1,3-propane diols, can be produced by the hydrogenation of  BETA -hydroxyaldehydes. 1,3-Propane diols can be used as monomeric structural units in the production of polyesters or polyurethanes, as starting materials for the synthesis of cyclic compounds as well as for a number of other substances.
    </p>
    <p num="4">It is known that  BETA -hydroxyaldehydes can be produced by reacting 1,2-oxiranes with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of catalysts.</p>
    <p num="5">U.S. Pat. No. 3,463,819 describes a method for the production of  BETA -hydroxypropionaldehyde and 1,3-propanediol in which, inter alia, ethylene oxide in the presence of toluene as well as in the presence of diethylether/benzene, 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethanedicobalt hexacarbonyl, carbon monoxide and hydrogen are reacted with each other.</p>
    <p num="6">U.S. Pat. No. 3,456,017 describes a method for the production of propanediol and  BETA -hydroxypropionaldehyde in which ethylene oxide, a tertiary phosphino-modified cobalt carbonyl catalyst, carbon monoxide and hydrogen are reacted with each other.</p>
    <p num="7">U.S. Pat. No. 5,256,827 describes the hydroformylation of ethylene oxide in the presence of oxidized, tertiary phosphine-complexed carbonyl catalysts.</p>
    <p num="8">The known methods have the disadvantage that a very great amount of catalyst relative to the amount of ethylene oxide must be used, Furthermore, reaction promoters must be added.</p>
    <p num="9">The invention has the object of developing a method for the production of  BETA -hydroxyaldehydes which does not have these disadvantages.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">The invention provides a method of producing  BETA -hydroxyaldehydes in which 1,2-oxiranes are reacted with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of transitional metal compounds which are modified with phosphorus-oxygen ligands or nitrogen-oxygen ligands and which act as catalyst.</p>
    <p num="11">
      According to the invention, 1,2-oxiranes (epoxides) are hydroformylated with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a cobalt-carbonyl catalyst modified with phosphorus-oxygen chelate ligands or nitrogen-oxygen chelate ligands.
      <br/>
      The reaction products are essentially  BETA -hydroxyaldehydes (and their oligomers) and, in small amounts, the corresponding 1,3-diols.
      <br/>
      When the term " BETA -hydroxyaldehydes" is used below it signifies the monomers as well as the dimers such as, e.g., 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-hydroxy- 1,3-dioxane in the case of the hydroformylation of ethylene oxide as well as trimers and higher oligomers of the corresponding  BETA -hydroxyaldehydes.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Oxiranes containing 2 to 30 carbon atoms can be used, for example, as the oxiranes.
      <br/>
      Epoxides having an oxygen bridge in the 1,2 position are preferably used.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Saturated hydrocarbons with vicinal epoxides with up to 10 carbon atoms can be used as oxiranes in the method of the invention.
      <br/>
      These compounds, also named epoxyalkanes, can have cyclic or acyclic, long-chain or branched-chain structures.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Acyclic epoxides can be those epoxides in which the carbon atoms of the epoxy unit are not a component of a carbocyclic ring.
      <br/>
      Such compounds are, e.g., ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, isobutylene oxide, 1,2-epoxypentane, 1,2-epoxy-4-methylpentane, 1,2-epoxyoctane, 3-cyclohexyl-1,2-epoxypropane, 3,4-epoxynonane, 1,2-epoxy-2,2,4-trimethylhexane and 1,2-epoxydecane.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Cyclic epoxides can be those epoxides in which the carbon atoms of the epoxy unit are part of a carbocyclic ring.
      <br/>
      Such epoxycycloalkanes can be, e.g.: cyclohexene oxide, cyclopentene oxide, cyclooctane oxide, 1,2-epoxy-4-methylcyclohexane, 4,5-dimethyl-1,2-epoxycyclohexane, 2,3-epoxy-decahydronaphthalene and 1,2-epoxy-4-propylcyclohexane.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In general, the use of acyclic epoxides is preferred.
      <br/>
      In particular, acyclic epoxides with a carbon-atom number up to 6 carbon atoms in which the epoxy group is terminal, such as, for example an acyclic 1,2-epoxyalkane, can be used.
      <br/>
      Of these compounds, ethylene oxide as well as propylene oxide are particularly preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Cobalt-carbonyl catalysts modified with phosphorus-oxygen chelate ligands can be used as catalysts in the method of the invention.</p>

      For example, salts with organic or inorganic anions can be used as cobalt compounds.
      <br/>
      Carbon monoxide complexes of cobalt are preferred.
      <br/>
      Dicobalt octacarbonyl is an especially preferred cobalt compound.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      There are a number of methods for the production of cobalt carbonyl catalysts modified with phosphorus-oxygen ligands or P--O and N--O chelate ligands.
      <br/>
      It is possible, for example, to heat cobalt complexes such as, e.g., dicobalt octacarbonyl and a suitable ligand together.
      <br/>
      The ligand will replace a corresponding number of carbonyl functions and yield the desired catalytic precursor in this manner.
      <br/>
      It should be taken into consideration that a coordination of the ligands is possible via the phosphorus atom or nitrogen atom as well as via the oxygen atom.
      <br/>
      If this reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent it is possible to obtain the complex in crystalline form, by cooling.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      A further possibility is in situ production.
      <br/>
      For this, cobalt compounds such as, e.g., cobalt octacarbonyl and a suitable ligand are added successively into the reaction solution.
      <br/>
      The catalytically active complex forms under the selected reaction conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="47">The ratio of ligand to cobalt is preferably between 0.1:1 and 5:1.</p>
    <p num="48">
      For example, 0.5 to 0.0001 mole catalyst can be used relative to 1 mole epoxide.
      <br/>
      This amount is preferably approximately 0.2 to 0.002 mole.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The hydroformylation method of the invention can be carried out at temperatures in a range of 30 (degree) -150 (degree)  C. and pressures between 50 and 300 bar.
      <br/>
      The method is preferably carried out at 70 (degree) -120 (degree)  C. and pressures between 90 and 200 bar.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The method of the invention comprises the reaction of an epoxide in the presence of a catalyst with hydrogen and carbon monoxide.
      <br/>
      A ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide between 6:1 and 1:1 is preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Compounds which are liquid at the given temperatures and pressures and inert to the reactants and catalysts can be used as solvent.
      <br/>
      These are, for example, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorine-containing aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons as well as linear and cyclic ethers.
      <br/>
      Preferred solvents are benzene, toluene, diethylether, MTBE and tetrahydrofuran.
    </p>
    <p num="52">The method of the invention has the following advantages:</p>
    <p num="53">The hydroformylation of 1,2-epoxides can be carried out in such a manner that the  BETA -hydroxyaldehydes are formed selectively to a high degree and in high yields.</p>
    <p num="54">The use of promoters is not necessary.</p>
    <p num="55">The method of the invention makes possible an improvement in the yield (60-70%) and in the selectivity (80-90%).</p>
    <p num="56">The yields in the hydroformylation of higher epoxides are clearly greater than those which can be achieved with known methods.</p>
    <p num="57">
      Compared to the known method according to U.S. Pat. No. 3,463,819, the method of the invention has the advantage that a significantly smaller amount of catalyst is required.
      <br/>
      Thus, instead of 5 g catalyst for 3 g ethylene oxide only 400 mg catalyst is required for 2.2 g ethylene oxide.
    </p>
    <p num="58">No defined phosphinic oxide is used in the method according to U.S. Pat. No. 5,256,827.</p>
    <p num="59">The method of the invention, in which a defined phosphinic oxide compound is used, achieves distinctly greater yields although no promoters are used.</p>
