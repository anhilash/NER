      <br/>
      A coating method by the use of a rotary atomizing head type coating system (21), permitting to make multiple color changes in the course of a coating operation by providing a plural number of paint cartridges (35) of different colors which can be replaceably and removably loaded on the coating system.
      <br/>
      The coating method for the coating system includes: a paint cartridge loading step of setting a paint cartridge (35) of a specified color in a housing (22); a coating step of supplying paint in the loaded paint cartridge to a rotary atomizing head (30); a paint cartridge unloading step of unloading the paint cartridge (35) from the housing (22) after finishing a predetermined coating operation; and a washing step of feeding a washing fluid from an atomizing head washing device (57) to the front side of the rotary atomizing head (30) to wash away deposited residues of a previous color therefrom.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when changing the color of paint, a coating operation in a new color can be started simply after washing the rotary atomizing head (30) from front side and replacing the paint cartridge by a new one.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to a coating method by the use of a rotary atomizing head type coating system, particularly suitable for use, for example, in coating vehicle bodies or the like which require changes of the paint color in the course of a coating operation.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Generally, rotary atomizing head type paint coating systems have been in wide use for coating vehicle bodies and the like.
      <br/>
      In connection with coating operations of by a coating system of this class, there are increasing demands for measures which can reduce the amounts of paint and solvent which have to be discarded as waste each time when changing the paint color in the course of a coating operation, as well as for measures which can cope with as many paint color changes as possible.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Noteworthy as a first prior art in this regard is Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. H8-229446 which discloses a rotary atomizing head type coating system incorporating measures for reducing the amounts of waste paint and solvent and for coping with an increased number of paint colors.
      <br/>
      This rotary atomizing head type coating system employs paint cartridges of different colors which can be replaceably set in position on the system according to color specifications of a coating object such as vehicle bodies or the like.
      <br/>
      This prior art coating system is not equipped with a cleaning device for washing off residues of a previous color, and there is unable to fulfill the functions as required of the coating systems of this sort.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      There have also been known the so-called automatic coating systems (e.g., as described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. S63-175662) which are configured to perform a coating operation automatically for a vehicle body or the like according to a programmed routine.
      <br/>
      In a prior art automatic coating system of this sort, which is herein referred to as a second prior art for the convenience of explanation, a plural number of paint cartridges of different colors are located in predetermined positions within a working area of a working mechanism such as a coating robot or the like, and automatically changed from one cartridge to another at the time of a change of paint color.
      <br/>
      Further, in the case of the automatic coating system of the second prior art, in order to permit replacements of paint cartridges (changes of paint color), a hose is connected to the coating system to feed a washing fluid to a rotary atomizing head of the system.
      <br/>
      Provided internally of the coating system and in communication with the washing fluid hose is a washing fluid passage leading to the rotary atomizing head.
      <br/>
      At the time of washing off residues of a previous color from the rotary atomizing head, a washing fluid is spurted toward the rotary atomizing head through the washing fluid supply hose and passage.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Further, described in an application, which was internationally published in the WIPO gazette under WO 97/3470, is an automatic coating system which is noteworthy, for example, as a third prior art.
      <br/>
      The automatic coating system according to this third prior art includes a working mechanism which is located within a coating area, a coating machine having an atomizing unit and supported on the working mechanism, a plural number of paint cartridges which are filled with paint of different colors and interchangeably mounted on the coating system, and a cartridge changing device which functions to support and interchangeably load the paint cartridges on the coating machine.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the case of the automatic coating system of the third prior art with the arrangements just described, a hose is connected to the coating system to feed a washing fluid to the latter in a manner similar to the above-mentioned second prior art.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Indicated at 21 is the rotary atomizing head type coating system (hereinafter referred to simply as "coating system" for brevity) which is mounted on the coating robot 1.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIGS. 2 and 3, the coating system 21 is largely constituted by a housing 22, a coating machine 28, feed tube passage holes 27 and 34, and a paint cartridge 35.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The housing 22 is formed of an engineering plastic, for example, such as PTFE, PEEK, PEI, POM, PI, PET or the like, and attached to the fore distal end of the wrist 5.
      <br/>
      The housing 22 is constituted by a neck portion 23 to be detachably fixed to the wrist 5 of the coating robot 1 through a clamp member 23A, and a head portion 24 which is formed at and with the fore distal end of the neck portion 23.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In this instance, a coating machine mount portion 25 and a cartridge mount portion 26, both of a hollow cylindrical shape, are formed on the front and rear sides of the head portion 24, respectively.
      <br/>
      Further, a female connector portion 26B and a male connector portion 26C are formed separately in a bottom portion 26A of the cartridge mounting portion 26.
      <br/>
      The female connector portion 26B is engaged with a male connector portion 36A of a cartridge cylinder 36, which will be described hereinafter, while the male connector portion 26C is engaged with a female connector portion 36B of the cylinder 36.
      <br/>
      The female and male connector portions 26B and 26C of the cartridge mounting portion 26 function as positioning couplers which determine the position of the cartridge cylinder 36 relative to the cartridge mounting portion 26 in the circumferential direction when connected and coupled therewith.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Denoted at 27 is the feed tube passage hole on the side of the housing, which is provided to extend between and in communication with the coating machine mounting portion 25 and the cartridge mounting portion 26 of the housing.
      <br/>
      The feed tube passage hole 27 on the side of the housing includes a feed tube passage portion 27A of a small diameter which is located on the front side, and a tapered conical recess 27B which is located on the rear side.
      <br/>
      In this instance, the feed tube passage portion 27A is formed in coaxial relation with a feed tube passage 34 on the side of the coating machine, which will be described hereinafter.
      <br/>
      The conical recess 27B functions as a positioning coupler to hold the paint cartridge 35 in position in axial and radial directions in cooperation and by fitting engagement with a conical recess 38 on the cartridge 35 as will be described hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Indicated at 28 is the coating machine which is fitted in the coating machine mounting portion 25 of the head portion 24.
      <br/>
      The coating machine 28 is largely constituted by an air motor 29, a rotary atomizing head 30 which is put in rotation by the air motor 29, and a shaping air ring 31 which is provided on the front side of the air motor 29.
    </p>
    <p num="25">In this instance, the air motor 29 is constituted by a motor case 29A to be fitted into the coating machine mounting portion 25, a stepped axial bore 29B which is formed axially through the motor case 29A and varied stepwise in diameter in the axial direction to have a front large diameter portion and a rear small diameter portion, a rotational shaft 29C which is extended axially through the large diameter portion of the axial bore 29B and projected forward of the motor case 29A at its fore end, an air turbine 29D which is securely fixed to the rear end of the rotational shaft 29C, and a static-pressure air bearing 29E which is provided in the motor case 29A and located around the large diameter portion of the axial bore 29B in small gap relation with the rotational shaft 29C.</p>
    <p num="26">
      Designated at 30 is the rotary atomizing head which is mounted on the air motor 29 at the fore distal end portion of the rotational shaft 29C.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, the rotary atomizing head 30 is constituted by a bell cup 30A which is formed in a bell-like shape, a hub member 30B of a disk-like shape which is fitted in a center portion on the front side of the bell cup 30A, a paint spreading surface 30C which is formed on the front side of the bell cup 30A radially on the outer side of the hub member 30B for spreading paint into a film, a paint reservoir 30D which is defined on the back side of the hub member 30B, a plural number of washing fluid inlet holes 30E which are provided in center portions on the front side of the hub member 30B to let a washing fluid flow into the paint reservoir 30D from the front side of the hub member 30B, and a large number of paint outlet holes 30F which are provided in outer peripheral portions of the hub member 30B to guide paint, which is supplied thereto from the feed tube 39, toward the paint spreading surface 30C.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The rotary atomizing head 30 is put in high speed rotation by the air motor, whereupon the paint which supplied to the paint reservoir 30D through the feed tube 39 is guided toward the paint spreading surface 30C through the respective paint outlet holes 30F.
      <br/>
      Then, the paint on the paint spreading surface 30C is spread into a thin film and atomized into fine particles under the influence of centrifugal force.
      <br/>
      As a result, the atomized paint particles are charged with a high voltage as described hereinafter, and caused to fly toward a coating object 61 to deposit thereon, traveling along an electrostatic field which is formed between the rotary atomizing head and the coating object 61, which will be described hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Indicated at 31 is the shaping air ring which is attached to the coating machine mounting portion 25 of the head portion 24 in such a way as to hold the air motor 29 fixedly in position from the front side.
      <br/>
      The shaping air ring 31 is provided with a large number of shaping air outlet holes 31A annularly on and around the outer peripheral side thereof.
      <br/>
      Through these shaping air outlet holes 31A, shaping air is spurted out toward paint releasing edges of the rotary atomizing head 30 for shaping charged paint particles into a predetermined spray pattern as soon as they are released from the rotary atomizing head 30.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Denoted at 32 is a high voltage generator which is provided within the neck portion 23 of the housing 22.

      <br/>
      Through a high voltage cable 32A, for example, the output side of the high voltage generator 32 is electrically connected to the air motor 29, so that a high voltage is applied to the rotary atomizing head 30 from the high voltage generator 32 through the rotational shaft 29C of the air motor 29 for charging the paint directly.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, in case sprayed paint particles are to be charged indirectly by means of an external charging system, the output voltage of the high voltage generator 32 is directly supplied to an external electrode which is provided on or in the vicinity of the shaping air ring 31.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Indicated at 33 are a plural number of air passages which are provided in the neck portion 23 of the housing 22 and which are connected to the control air source 7 through the air hose 7A.

      <br/>
      In this particular embodiment, one air passage alone is shown to represent the plural number of similar air passages.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In this instance, a turbine air passage supplies air to the air turbine 29D of the air motor 29.
      <br/>
      A bearing air passage supplies air to the static-pressure air bearing 29E of the air motor 29.
      <br/>
      A brake air passage supplies braking air to the air turbine 29D to brake its rotation.
      <br/>
      Further, a shaping air passage supplies air toward the shaping air outlet holes 31A of the shaping air ring 31.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Denoted at 34 is a feed tube passage hole on the side of the coating machine, which is extended axially through the rotational shaft 29C and motor case 29A of the air motor 29.
      <br/>
      The feed tube passage hole 34 on the side of the coating machine is opened at its rear or base end into a feed tube passage portion 27A of the feed tube passage hole 27 on the side of the housing, and at its front end into the paint reservoir 34D of the rotary atomizing head 30.
      <br/>
      Further, the feed tube passage hole 34 on the side of the coating machine is formed coaxially aligned relation with the feed tube passage portion 27A of the feed tube passage hole 27 on the side of the housing.

    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Indicated at 35a, 35b . . . 35n are paint cartridges of color a, color b and color n (hereinafter referred to collectively as "paint cartridges 35" for the convenience of explanation), respectively, which hold different paint colors separately and independently for supply to the rotary atomizing head 30.
      <br/>
      Each one of these paint cartridges 35 is arranged to be inserted into the feed tube passage holes 27 and 34 to supply paint of a particular color independently to the rotary atomizing head 30.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 5, the cartridges 35 are largely constituted by a cartridge cylinder 36, a conical nose-like projection 38 which is provided on the front end face of the cylinder 36, a feed tube 39 which is extended axially forward from the conical projection 38 to provide therein a paint passage 39A leading from the cartridge cylinder 36, a piston 40 which is fitted in the cartridge cylinder 36 as a movable partition wall, and a thinner passage 43 which is provided on the side of the paint cartridge to supply thinner as a paint extruding liquid.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The cartridge cylinder 36, which is a main body of the paint cartridge 35, is formed of engineering plastic similarly to the housing 22 and in the shape of a cylinder of a suitable diameter which can be detachably fitted in the cartridge mounting portion 26 of the housing.
      <br/>
      An O-ring 37 is fitted in a fore position on the outer periphery of the cartridge cylinder 36 to hermetically seal the gap space between the cartridge cylinder 36 and the cartridge mounting portion 26.
      <br/>
      Further, a male connector portion 36A and a female connector portion 36B are provided at the fore end of the cartridge cylinder 36 in confronting positions relative to the female and male connector portion 26B and 26C on the part of the cartridge mounting portion 26, respectively.
      <br/>
      In addition, the cartridge cylinder 36 is provided with a grip portion 36C at its rear end, which is gripped by an operator when mounting or dismantling the cartridge 35.
      <br/>
      The male and female connector portions 36A and 36B also function as positioning couplers which determine the position in the circumferential direction of the cartridge cylinder 36 on the cartridge mounting portion 26.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Indicated at 38 is a conical coupling projection which is formed integrally with the cartridge cylinder 36.
      <br/>
      When the cartridge 35 is mounted on the cartridge mounting portion 26 of the housing 22, the conical projection 38 is coupled with the conical coupling recess 27B, thereby determining the position of the cartridge 35 in both axial and radial directions.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Indicated at 39 is a feed tube which is provided at a fore end of the concial coupling projection 38.
      <br/>
      A paint supply passage 39A is formed coaxially through the feed tube 39.
      <br/>
      The base or rear end of the paint supply passage 39A is connected to a paint reservoir chamber 41 which will be described hereinafter, while its fore end is opened toward the rotary atomizing head 30.
      <br/>
      The feed tube 39 is provided with a valve seat portion 39B which is formed by reducing the diameter of a fore end portion of the paint supply passage 39A.
      <br/>
      A valve body 46B of a paint valve 46, which will be described hereinafter, is seated on and off the valve seat portion 39B.
      <br/>
      The feed tube 39 has such a length that its fore distal end is extended into the paint reservoir 30D of the rotary atomizing head 30 when the paint cartridge 35 is mounted on the cartridge mounting portion 26 of the housing 22.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      On the other hand, a piston 40 is fitted in the cartridge cylinder 36 for sliding movements in the axial direction.
      <br/>
      By the piston 40, the cartridge cylinder 36 is partitioned into the paint reservoir chamber 41 which is in communication with the paint supply passage 39A of the feed tube 39 through a communication passage 41A, and a thinner chamber 42 or an extruding liquid chamber which holds thinner therein as an extruding liquid.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Indicated at 43 is a thinner passage on the side of the cartridge.
      <br/>
      This thinner passage 43 on the side of the cartridge is formed axially in and along the outer periphery of the cylinder 36.
      <br/>
      One end of the thinner passage 43 is opened in the fore end face of the male connector portion 36A of the cylinder 36, while the other end is communicated with the thinner chamber 42.
      <br/>
      Through the thinner passage 43 on the side of the cartridge, thinner is supplied to the thinner chamber 42 to push the piston 40 forward in the direction of the feed tube 39.
      <br/>
      By this forward movement of the piston 40, the paint which is filled in the paint reservoir chamber 41 is extruded toward the rotary atomizing head 30.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The thinner which is used as an extruding liquid is selected from a electrically insulating type or from a high resistance type in order to prevent leaks through the thinner of the high voltage which is applied by the high voltage generator 32.

      As an extruding liquid, the thinner contributes to keep the inner wall surfaces of the cartridge cylinder 36 constantly in a wet state, preventing the paint from getting dry and sticking as the piston 40 is displaced therealong.
      <br/>
      Consequently, thanks to stabilization of the frictional resistance in the sliding contact between the piston 40 and the cylinder 36, the piston 40 can be moved very smoothly.
      <br/>
      In addition, the hermetical seal between the piston 40 and the cartridge cylinder 36 can be improved in tightness.

      <br/>
      Waste liquid resulting from the washing operation on the rotary atomizing head 30 is collected to the above-mentioned waste liquid tank through the waste liquid pipe 60.
    </p>
    <p num="55">With the arrangements described above, the coating system 21 is employed in the present embodiment for a coating method as described below with reference to FIGS. 6 through 10.</p>
    <p num="56">
      Firstly, a piece of work or coating object 61 is coated with paint of the color a by the use of the paint cartridge 35a in the manner as follows.
      <br/>
      In a first cartridge loading step, as shown in FIG. 7, the paint cartridge 35a which is filled with paint of color a is picked up from the cartridge holder table 56, and loaded or mounted on the housing 22 of the coating system.
      <br/>
      When loading the paint cartridge 35a on the housing 22, the cartridge cylinder 36 is fitted into the cartridge mounting portion 26 of the head portion 24 while passing the feed tube 39 through the conical recess 27B of the feed tube passage hole 27 on the side of the housing, the feed tube passage portion 27A and feed tube passage hole 34 on the side of the coating machine.
    </p>
    <p num="57">Further, when loading the paint cartridge 35a, the vacuum space 51 which is defined between the cartridge mounting portion 26 and the cartridge cylinder 36 is vacuumed through the suction passage 50 to hold the paint cartridge 35a fixedly and securely against the housing 22 with suction force, preventing the paint cartridge from falling off the housing.</p>
    <p num="58">
      In a next coating step, the air motor 29 is started to put the rotary atomizing head 30 in high speed rotation, while spurting out shaping air through the respective shaping air outlet holes 31A of the shaping air ring 31 and applying a high voltage to the paint a from the high voltage generator 32.
      <br/>
      In this state, extruding thinner is quantitatively supplied to the thinner chamber 42 of the cartridge cylinder 36 from the thinner feeding device 12 through the thinner passages 48 and 43.
      <br/>
      Consequently, as seen from FIG. 8, the paint of the color a in the paint reservoir chamber 41 is supplied to the rotary atomizing head 30 through the feed tube 39, and sprayed toward the coating object 61.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      When sprayed, the paint of the color a is centrifugally divided into minute particles and applied with a high voltage on the rotary atomizing head 30 to take the form of charged fine particles.
      <br/>
      The charged paint particles are shaped into a suitable spray pattern by shaping air which is spurted out through the respective shaping air outlet holes 31A and caused to fly toward and deposit on the coating object 61, traveling along an electrostatic field which is formed between the rotary atomizing head and the coating object 61.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      A coating step is succeeded by a cartridge unloading step as follows.
      <br/>
      In a cartridge unloading step, firstly the coating system 21 is moved to and located in a cartridge unloading position as shown in FIG. 7 by operating the vertical and horizontal arms 3 and 4 of the coating robot 1.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the front side of the coating machine 28 is put in the waste liquid collecting container 58 in face to face relation with the washing nozzle 59.
      <br/>
      In this state, air is supplied to the vacuum space 51 through the ejection air passage 52 to cancel the suction grip which has been holding the paint cartridge 35a fixedly against the cartridge mounting portion 26.
      <br/>
      Then, as indicated by arrows in FIG. 9, the paint cartridge 35a is gripped by a gripper 62 and axially extracted out of the housing 22 and returned to the cartridge holder table 56.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      Succeeding to the cartridge unloading step is an atomizing head washing step as follows.
      <br/>
      In this step, the coating robot 1 is operated to hold the front side of the coating machine 28 in the atomizing head washing device 57 as shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      Besides, the rotary atomizing head 30 is put in high speed rotation by the air motor 29.
      <br/>
      In this state, as shown in FIG. 10, washing thinner is spurted out from the washing nozzle 59 toward the front side of the rotary atomizing head 30.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Under the influence of centrifugal force, the washing thinner which is supplied to the front surface of the hub member 30B is caused to flow from the center toward the paint spreading surface 30C of the bell cup 30A to wash away paint residues P1 from the paint spreading surface 30C.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the washing thinner which is allowed to enter the paint reservoir 30D through washing fluid inlet holes 30E of the hub member 30B flows along inner wall surfaces of the paint reservoir 30D and the back side of the hub member 30B to wash away paint residues P2 therewith as it flows out through paint outlet holes 30F.
      <br/>
      The spent thinner resulting from the washing operation is caught in the waste liquid collecting container 58 and collected into a waste liquid tank through the waste liquid pipe which is connected to the container 58.
    </p>
    <p num="63">Upon finishing in this manner a coating operation with the paint cartridge 35a of the color a, for example, the paint cartridge 35b of color b is picked up from the cartridge holder table 56 and loaded on the housing 22 to carry out a coating operation in color b in a manner similar to the above-described coating operation in color a.</p>
    <p num="64">
      Thus, according to the present embodiment, the housing 22 of the coating machine is mounted on the wrist 5 of the coating robot 1, while paint cartridges 35a, 35b . . . 35n which are filled with paint of different colors a, b, . . . n are placed in predetermined positions.
      <br/>
      After this preparatory step, a cycle of coating operation is started for the coating object 61, with a cartridge loading step in which the paint cartridge 35 is loaded into the housing 22 of the machine, followed by a coating step in which the paint is supplied from the cartridge 35 to the rotary atomizing head 30 and sprayed on the coating object 61, a cartridge unloading step in which the paint cartridge 35 is unleaded from the housing 22, and a washing step in which the rotary atomizing head 30 is washed to removed deposited paint residues therefrom.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Thus, according to the present embodiment, the provision of a plural number of paint cartridges of different colors makes it possible to cope with multiple color changes by the use of a single coating system 21 in a reliable manner and to broaden the range of application of the coating system.
      <br/>
      Besides, other paint colors can be added simply by providing a corresponding number of paint cartridges 35, without necessitating to reconstruct the coating system 21.
    </p>
    <p num="66">In addition, since the coating system 21 employs a plural number of paint cartridges 35 of different colors replaceably and interchangeably, it can reduce the amount of paint to be discharged or discarded at the time of a color change and contribute to shorten the washing time, minimizing the amounts of waste paint and thinner to a level which is friendly to the environment.</p>
    <p num="67">
      Further, the omission of a paint feed hose from the coating system precludes the possibilities of high voltage leaks even in the case of a metallic paint or a water base paint of low electrical resistance.
      <br/>
      It follows that the coating system 21 can find a wide range of applications involving various kinds of paint.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Further, the atomizing head washing device 57 for cleaning the rotary atomizing head 30 is provided separately from the coating system 21.
      <br/>
      This can preclude leaks of high voltage through thinner or other washing fluid, and permits to simplify a high voltage shielding (voltage block) structure.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Moreover, the coating system 21 is provided with the paint valve 46 which turns on and off the paint supply, along with the thinner valve 54 which turns on and off the supply of extruding thinner.
      <br/>
      Therefore, as the paint and thinner valves 46 and 54 are opened and closed in response to spray-on and spray-off command signals, the paint spray can be started and stopped immediately on these command signals.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Accordingly, in a coating operation, the coating system can control on-off of the paint spray according to a programmed routine with higher reliability, forming coatings which are improved in quality, particularly, uniform in thickness.
      <br/>
      Besides, at the time of extracting the paint cartridge 35 out of the housing 22 for replacement, there is no possibility of the paint dripping down from the feed tube 39.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Referring now to FIGS. 11 to 14, there is shown a second embodiment of the coating method according to the present invention, which has a feature in that a washing step is carried out before unloading a paint cartridge.

      In the following description of the second embodiment, those component parts which are common with the foregoing first embodiment are simply designated by common reference numerals or characters to avoid repetition of same explanations.

      More particularly, described below is a case in which a coating object or a piece of work 61 is coated with paint of color a by the use of the paint cartridge 35a.

      <br/>
      At this time, air is sucked out of the vacuum space 51 through the air suction passage 50 to hold the paint cartridge 35a fixedly to the housing 22 with suction force.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      In the next coating step, the rotary atomizing head 30 is put in high speed rotation by the air motor 29, while at the same time shaping air is spurted out through the respective shaping air outlet holes 31A and a high voltage is applied to the paint of color a from the high voltage generator 32.
      <br/>
      Then, in this state, paint-extruding thinner is quantitatively supplied to the thinner chamber 42, thereby pushing the piston 40 forward to feed the paint of color a in the paint reservoir chamber 41 toward the rotary atomizing head 30 to start spraying the paint a on the coating object 61.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The coating step is followed by a washing step.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, the vertical and horizontal arms 3 and 4 of the coating robot 1 are operated to move and locate the coating system 21 in the cartridge replacing position shown in FIG. 12. In this state, as shown in FIG. 13 thinner is spurted out through the washing nozzle 59 and supplied toward the front side of the rotary atomizing head 30 which is put in high speed rotation by the air motor 29.

      As a result, in the washing step, the thinner flow on the front surface of the hub member 30B is directed from the center toward the paint spreading surface 30C of the bell cup 30A under the influence of centrifugal force to wash away deposited paint residues P1 from the paint spreading surface 30C.
      <br/>
      Besides, along with thinner which has entered the paint reservoir 30D through the washing fluid inlet holes 30E of the hub member 30B, deposited paint residues P2 on the inner surfaces of the paint reservoir 30D and on the back side of the hub member 30B are washed away.
      <br/>
      Further, paint residues P3 on a fore end portion of the feed tube 39 are washed away with part of the thinner which has entered the paint reservoir 30D.
      <br/>
      After washing various parts in this manner, the thinner which flows out through the paint outlet holes 30F is collected into the waste liquid collecting container 58.

    <p num="76">In a next cartridge unloading step, the cartridge 35a released from the cartridge mounting portion 26 by cancellation of the suction grip, and as seen from the FIG. 14, gripped in a gripper member 62 and axially extracted from the housing 22 and returned to the cartridge holder table 56.</p>
    <p num="77">
      Thus, the present embodiment, with the arrangements just described, can produce substantially the same operational effects as in the foregoing first embodiment.

      In this particular embodiment, however, the rotary atomizing head is cleaned in a washing step immediately after a coating step, namely, prior to a cartridge unloading step.
      <br/>
      Therefore, fore end portions of the feed tube 39 of the cartridge 35 can be washed clean simultaneously at the time of washing the rotary atomizing head 30.
      <br/>
      Thus, clogging of the feed tube 39 can be prevented because residues of a previous color are washed away from fore end portions of the feed tube before unloading the paint cartridge 35 from the rotary atomizing head 30.

      In this washing step, the rotary atomizing head 30 is washed by the use of the cleaning cartridge 71 by a washing operation which consists of three phases, i.e., a cleaning cartridge loading phase, a thinner discharging phase and a cleaning cartridge unloading phase.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      In the cleaning cartridge loading phase, firstly the cleaning cartridge 71 is set on the cartridge mounting portion 26 of the housing 22.
      <br/>
      At this time, air is sucked to hold the cleaning cartridge 71 fixedly to the housing 22 with suction force.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      In the thinner discharging phase or washing fluid delivering phase, as shown in FIG. 17, the rotary atomizing head 30 of the coating machine 28 is placed in the waste liquid collecting container 72 by operating the vertical and horizontal arms 3 and 4 of the coating robot 1.
      <br/>
      In this state, the rotary atomizing head 30 is put in high speed rotation by the air motor 29, while extruding thinner is supplied to the cleaning cartridge 71 to spout wash thinner in the cleaning cartridge 71 toward the rotary atomizing head 30, thereby washing away deposited paint residues of color a from the rotary atomizing head 30.
    </p>
    <p num="88">In the next cleaning cartridge unloading phase, after canceling the suction grip, the cleaning cartridge 71 is unloaded from the housing 22 to end a washing operation on the rotary atomizing head 30.</p>
    <p num="89">
      The present embodiment, with the arrangements just described, can produce substantially the same operational effects as the foregoing embodiments.
      <br/>
      Especially in this case, a cartridge which is of the same construction as the paint cartridge 35 can be used as the cleaning cartridge 71, so that the rotary atomizing head 30 can be washed by equipments of simple construction and of lower cost.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      In the foregoing embodiments, the coating system 21 is shown as being mounted on the wrist 5 of the coating robot 1.
      <br/>
      However, the present invention is not limited to this particular form shown.
      <br/>
      For example, if desired, the coating system 21 may be mounted on a working mechanism such as a reciprocator or the like.
      <br/>
      In such a case, since a reciprocator usually has a limited movable range, it is desirable that the atomizing head washing device 57 and the waste liquid collecting container 72 are arranged to be movable.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      Further, the cartridges 35 and 71 in the foregoing embodiments are provided with the piston 40, thereby extruding paint or thinner.
      <br/>
      However, in place of the piston 40, there may be employed a bellows tube which is filled with paint and arranged to extrude paint as it is pushed into a contracted from.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      Further, in the foregoing embodiments, the axial bore 29B of the air motor 29 is shown as being formed in a stepped form including a rear small-diameter portion and a front large-diameter portion, and the rotational shaft 29C is received in the large-diameter portion of the axial bore 29B.
      <br/>
      However, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to this particular form.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown in the modification of FIG. 18, there may be employed an air motor 81 which has a rotational shaft 81C extended through an axial bore 81B which has almost a uniform diameter in the axial direction.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Further, in the foregoing embodiments, air is sucked out of the vacuum space 51 through the air suction passage 50 to hold the cartridge 35 or 71 fixedly against the housing 22 by a suction grip.
      <br/>
      However, the present invention is not limited to this arrangement.
      <br/>
      For example, the cartridge 35 or 71 may be fixed in position by means of a lock member which is provided on the side of the housing 22 and adapted to engage with a locking hole which is provided on the side of the cartridges 35 and 37.
    </p>
    <p num="94">Further, although thinner is used as an extruding liquid by way of example in the foregoing embodiments, water or other extruding liquid may be applied depending upon the type of paint or high voltage application system to be used.</p>
    <p num="95">Industrial Applicability</p>
    <p num="96">As clear from the foregoing particular description, according to the present invention, a washing fluid is supplied to the front side of a rotary atomizing head after finishing a coating operation by the use of a paint cartridge, washing away deposited paint residues of a previous color from the rotary atomizing head to prepare for a coating operation in a new color.</p>
    <p num="97">
      Accordingly, by providing a plural number of paint cartridges which are filled with paint of different colors or types, it becomes possible to make multiple color changes in the course of a coating operation by a single rotary atomizing head type coating system, enhancing the reliability in operation and broadening the range of application of the coating system.
      <br/>
      Besides, since the paint cartridge is not connected to any paint supply hose or the like, it becomes possible to prevent leaks of high voltage through paint even in a coating operation using a paint of low electrical resistance like metallic paint and water base paint, making the coating system operative with a diversity of paint and as a result enhancing its reliability.
    </p>
    <p num="98">Further, the rotary atomizing head can be washed from front side while a cartridge is still mounted on the housing of the coating system, so that deposited paint residues can be washed away from the feed tube of the cartridge simultaneously with the washing of the rotary atomizing head, preventing clogging of the feed tube.</p>
    <p num="99">Moreover, by providing a cleaning cartridge which is filled with a washing fluid, along with a plural number of paint cartridges of diversified colors, it becomes possible to make color changes at multiple points in the course of a coating operation in a facilitated and economical manner.</p>
