    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      There is no doubt that alpha hydroxyacids, alpha ketoacids and related compounds are therapeutically effective for topical treatment of various cosmetic conditions and dermatologic disorders including dry skin, acne, dandruff, keratoses, age spots, wrinkles and disturbed keratinization.
      <br/>
      However, the compositions containing these acids may irritate human skin on repeated topical applications due to lower pH of the formulations.
      <br/>
      The irritation may range from a sensation of tingling, itching and burning to clinical signs of redness and peeling.
      <br/>
      Causes for such irritation may arise from the following:
    </p>
    <p num="9">Upper layers of normal skin have a pH of 4.2 to 5.6, but the compositions containing most alpha hydroxyacids or alpha ketoacids have pH values of less than 3 0 (slashed zero)  For example, a topical formulation containing 7.6% (1 M) glycolic acid has a pH of 1.9, and a composition containing 9% (1 M) lactic acid has the same pH of 1.9. These compositions of lower pH on repeated topical applications can cause a drastic pH decrease in the stratum corneum of human skin, and provoke disturbances in intercorneocyte bondings resulting in adverse skin reactions, especially to some individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
    <p num="10">Moreover, with today's state of the art it is still very difficult to formulate a lotion, cream or ointment emulsion which contains a free acid form of the alpha hydroxyacid, and which is physically stable as a commercial product for cosmetic or pharmaceutical use.</p>
    <p num="11">
      When a formulation containing an alpha hydroxyacid or alpha ketoacid is reacted equimolarly or equinormally with a metallic alkali such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide the composition becomes therapeutically ineffective.
      <br/>
      The reasons for such loss of therapeutic effects are believed to be as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The intact skin of humans is a very effective barrier to many natural and synthetic substances.
      <br/>
      Cosmetic and pharmaceutical agents may be pharmacologically effective by oral or other systematic administration, but many of them are much less or totally ineffective on topical application to the skin.
      <br/>
      Topical effectiveness of a pharmaceutical agent depends on two major factors; (a) bioavailability of the active ingredient in the topical preparation and (b) percutaneous absorption, penetration and distribution of the active ingredient to the target site in the skin.
      <br/>
      For example, a topical preparation containing 5% salicylic acid is therapeutically effective as a keratolytic, but that containing 5% sodium salicylate is not an effective product.
      <br/>
      The reason for such difference is that salicylic acid is in bioavailable form and can penetrate the stratum corneum, but sodium salicylate is not in bioavailable form and cannot penetrate the stratum corneum of the skin.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In the case of alpha hydroxyacids, a topical preparation containing 5% glycolic acid is therapeutically effective for dry skin, but that containing 5% sodium glycollate is not effective.
      <br/>
      The same is true in case of 5% lactic acid versus 5% sodium lactate.
      <br/>
      The reason for such difference is that both glycolic acid and lactic acid are in bioavailable forms and can readily penetrate the stratum corneum, but sodium glycollate and sodium lactate are not in bioavailable forms and cannot penetrate the stratum corneum of the skin.
    </p>
    <p num="14">When a formulation containing an alpha hydroxyacid or alpha ketoacid is reacted equimolarly or equinormally with ammonium hydroxide or an organic base of smaller molecule the composition still shows some therapeutic effects for certain cosmetic conditions such as dry skin, but the composition has lost most of its potency for other dermatologic disorders such as wrinkles, keratoses, age spots and skin changes associated with aging.</p>
    <p num="15">
      It has now been discovered that amphoteric compositions containing alpha hydroxyacids, alpha ketoacids or related compounds, and also the compositions containing dimeric or polymeric forms of hydroxyacids overcome the aforementioned shortcomings and retain the therapeutic efficacies for cosmetic conditions and dermatologic disorders.
      <br/>
      The amphoteric composition contains in combination an amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric compound and at least one of the alpha hydroxyacids, alpha ketoacids or related compounds.
      <br/>
      Such amphoteric system has a suitable pH, and can release the active form of an alpha hydroxyacid or alpha ketoacid into the skin.
      <br/>
      The dimeric and polymeric forms of alpha, beta or other hydroxyacids in non-aqueous compositions have a more desired pH than that of the monomeric form of the hydroxyacids.
      <br/>
      The non-aqueous compositions can be formulated and induced to release the active form of hydroxyacids after the compositions have been topically applied to the skin.
      <br/>
      The cosmetic conditions and dermatologic disorders in humans and animals, in which the amphoteric compositions containing the dimeric or polymeric forms of hydroxyacids may be useful, include dry skin, dandruff, acne, keratoses, psoriasis, eczema, pruritus, age spots, lentigines, melasmas, wrinkles, warts, blemished skin, hyperpigmented skin, hyperkeratotic skin, inflammatory dermatoses, skin changes associated with aging and as skin cleansers.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      I.
      <br/>
      Amphoteric and Pseudoamphoteric Compositions
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Amphoteric substances by definition should behave either as an acid or a base, and can be an organic or an inorganic compound.
      <br/>
      The molecule of an organic amphoteric compound should consist of at least one basic and one acidic group.
      <br/>
      The basic groups include, for example, amino, imino and guanido groups.
      <br/>
      The acidic groups include, for example, carboxylic, phosphoric and sulfonic groups.
      <br/>
      Some examples of organic amphoteric compounds are amino acids, peptides, polypeptides, proteins, creatine, aminoaldonic acids, aminouronic acids, lauryl aminopropylglycine, aminoaldaric acids, neuraminic acid, desulfated heparin, deacetylated hyaluronic acid, hyalobiuronic acid, chondrosine and deacetylated chondroitin.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Inorganic amphoteric compounds are certain metallic oxides such as aluminum oxide and zinc oxide.</p>
    <p num="19">
      Pseudoamphoteric compounds are either structurally related to true amphoteric compounds or capable of inducing the same function when they are incorporated into the compositions containing alpha hydroxyacids or ketoacids.
      <br/>
      Some examples of pseudoamphoteric compounds are creatinine, stearamidoethyl diethylamine, stearamidoethyl diethanolamine, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine, quaternary ammonium hydroxide and quaternium hydroxide.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The amphoteric composition of the instant invention contains in combination an alpha hydroxyacid or alpha ketoacid and an amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric compound.
      <br/>
      There are two advantages of utilizing an amphoteric or the like compound in the therapeutic composition containing an alpha hydroxy or ketoacid.
      <br/>
      These are (a) the overall pH of the composition is raised, so that the composition becomes less or non-irritating to the skin and (b) some alpha hydroxy or ketoacid molecules react with the amphoteric compound to form a quadruple ionic complex which acts as buffering system to control the release of alpha hydroxy or ketoacid into the skin, therefore, eliminating the skin irritation and still retaining the therapeutic efficacies.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The following are some examples. 2-Hydroxyethanoic acid (glycolic acid) 1 M aqueous solution has pH 1.9. The pHs of compositions change to 3.0 and 3.2 when arginine 0.5 M and creatinine 0.5 M respectively are incorporated into the formulations. 2-Hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) 1 M aqueous solution has pH 1.9. The pHs of compositions change to 3.1 and 6.9 when arginine 0.5 M and 1.0 M respectively are incorporated into the formulations. 2-Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (methyllactic acid) 1 M aqueous solution has pH 1.9. The pHs of compositions change to 3.3, 3.4 and 3.2 when 0.5 M each of arginine, creatinine and 4-aminobutanoic acid respectively are incorporated into the formulations. 2-Hydroxybutane-1,4-dioic acid (malic acid) 1 M aqueous solution has pH 1.8, but the pH of the composition changes to 3.0 when creatinine 0.5 M is incorporated into the formulation.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Ideally, an amphoteric compound should contain both anionic and cationic groups or functional groups capable of behaving both as an acid and a base.
      <br/>
      Although inorganic amphoteric compounds such as aluminum oxide, aluminum hydroxide and zinc oxide may be utilized, organic amphoteric compounds have been found to be more efficient in formulating therapeutic compositions of the instant invention.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Organic amphoteric and pseudoamphoteric compounds may be classified into three groups, namely (a) amino acid type, (b) imidazoline and lecithin amphoterics and (c) pseudoamphoterics and miscellaneous amphoterics.</p>

    </p>
    <p num="32">
      (b) Imidazoline and lecithin amphoterics.
      <br/>
      The amphoteric compounds of imidazoline derived type are commercially synthesized from 2-substituted-2-imidazolines obtained by reacting a fatty acid with an aminoethylethanolamine.

      (c) Pseudoamphoterics and miscellaneous amphoterics.
      <br/>
      Many pseudoamphoteric compounds are chemically related or derived from true amphoterics.
      <br/>
      For example, creatinine is derived from creatine.
      <br/>
      Other pseudoamphoteric compounds may include fatty amide amines such as stearamidoethyl diethylamine, stearamidoethyl diethanolamine and stearamidopropyl dimethylamine.
      <br/>
      Other pseudoamphoteric related compounds include quaternary ammonium hydroxide and quaternium hydroxide.
    </p>
    <p num="34">In accordance with the present invention, the alpha hydroxyacid, the alpha ketoacids and the related compounds which are incorporated into amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric compositions for cosmetic conditions and dermatologic disorders may be classified into three groups.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The first group is organic carboxylic acids in which one hydroxyl group is attached to the alpha carbon of the acids.
      <br/>
      The generic structure of such alpha hydroxyacids may be represented as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="36">(Ra) (Rb) C (OH) COOH</p>
    <p num="37">
      where Ra and Rb are H, F, Cl, Br, alkyl, aralkyl or aryl group of saturated or unsaturated, isomeric or non-isomeric, straight or branched chain or cyclic form, having 1 to 25 carbon atoms, and in addition Ra and Rb may carry OH, CHO, COOH and alkoxy group having 1 to 9 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      The alpha hydroxyacids may be present as a free acid or lactone form, or in a salt form with an organic base or an inorganic alkali.
      <br/>
      The alpha hydroxyacids may exist as stereoisomers as D, L, and DL forms when Ra and Rb are not identical.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Typical alkyl, aralkyl and aryl groups for Ra and Rb include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, pentyl, octyl, lauryl, stearyl, benzyl and phenyl, etc.
      <br/>
      The alpha hydroxyacids of the first group may be divided into (1) alkyl alpha hydroxyacids, (2) aralkyl and aryl alpha hydroxyacids, (3) polyhydroxy alpha hydroxyacids, and (4) polycarboxylic alpha hydroxyacids.

      The second group of compounds which may be incorporated into amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric compositions for cosmetic conditions and dermatologic disorders, is organic carboxylic acids in which the alpha carbon of the acids is in keto form.
      <br/>
      The generic structure of such alpha ketoacids may be represented as follows:
      <br/>
      (Ra) CO COO(Rb)
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      wherein Ra and Rb are H, alkyl, aralkyl or aryl group of saturated or unsaturated, isomeric or non-isomeric, straight or branched chain or cyclic form, having 1 to 25 carbon atoms, and in addition Ra may carry F, Cl, Br, I, OH, CHO, COOH and alkoxy group having 1 to 9 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      The alpha ketoacids may be present as a free acid or an ester form, or in a salt form with an organic base or an inorganic alkali.
      <br/>
      The typical alkyl, aralkyl and aryl groups for Ra and Rb include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, pentyl, octyl, lauryl, stearyl, benzyl and phenyl, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In contrast to alpha hydroxyacids the ester form of alpha ketoacids has been found to be therapeutically effective for cosmetic and dermatologic conditions and disorders.
      <br/>
      For example, while ethyl lactate has a minimal effect, ethyl pyruvate is therapeutically very effective.
      <br/>
      Although the real mechanism for such difference is not known, we have speculated that the ester form of an alpha ketoacid is chemically and/or biochemically very reactive, and a free acid form of the alpha ketoacid is released in the skin after the topical application.

    <p num="51">II. Dimeric and Polymeric Forms of Hydroxyacids</p>
    <p num="52">
      When two or more molecules of hydroxycarboxylic acids either identical or non-identical compounds are reacted chemically to each other, dimeric or polymeric compounds will be formed.
      <br/>
      Such dimeric and polymeric compounds may be classified into three groups, namely (a) acyclic ester, (b) cyclic ester and (c) miscellaneous dimer and polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      (a) Acyclic ester.
      <br/>
      The acyclic ester of a hydroxycarboxylic acid may be a dimer or a polymer.
      <br/>
      The dimer is formed from two molecules of a hydroxycarboxylic acid by reacting the carboxyl group of one molecule with the hydroxy group of a second molecule.
      <br/>
      For example, glycolyl glycollate is formed from two molecules of glycolic acid by eliminating one mole of water molecule.
      <br/>
      Likewise, lactyl lactate is formed from two molecules of lactic acid.
      <br/>
      When two molecules of different hydroxycarboxylic acids are intermolecularly reacted, a different dimer is formed.
      <br/>
      For example, glycolyl lactate is formed by reacting the carboxyl group of lactic acid with the hydroxy group of glycolic acid.
      <br/>
      The polymer is formed in a similar manner but from more than two molecules of a hydroxycarboxylic acid.
      <br/>
      For example, glycoly glycoly glycollate is formed from three molecules of glycolic acid.
      <br/>
      Copolymer is formed from two or more than two different kinds of hydroxycarboxylic acids.
      <br/>
      For example, glycolyl lactyl glycollate is formed from two molecules of glycolic acid and one molecule of lactic acid.

      <br/>
      Ra and Rb in monomer unit 2, 3, 4 and so on may be the same or the different groups from that in monomer unit 1.

    <p num="68">
      We have discovered that topical formulations or compositions containing specific alpha hydroxyacids or alpha ketoacids, or related compounds are therapeutically very effective for certain skin disorders without utilizing any amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric systems.
      <br/>
      The alpha hydroxyacids and the related compounds include 2-hydroxyethanoic acid, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, 2-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, 2-phenyl 2-hydroxyethanoic acid, 2,2-diphenyl 2-hydroxyethanoic acid, 2-phenyl 2-methyl 2-hydroxyethanoic acid and 2-phenyl 3-hydroxypropanoic acid.
      <br/>
      The alpha ketoacids and their esters include 2-ketopropanoic acid, methyl 2-ketopropanoate and ethyl 2-ketopropanoate.
      <br/>
      The mentioned skin disorders include warts, keratoses, age spots, acne, nail infections, wrinkles and aging related skin changes.
    </p>
    <p num="69">In general, the concentration of the alpha hydroxyacid, the alpha ketoacid or the related compound used in the composition is a full strength to an intermediate strength, therefore the dispensing and the application require special handling and procedures.</p>
    <p num="70">If the alpha hdyroxyacid, or the alpha ketoacid or the related compound at full strength (usually 95-100%) is a liquid form at room temperature such as 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, 2-ketopropanoic acid, methyl 2-ketopropanoate and ethyl 2-ketopropanoate, the liquid compound with or without a gelling agent is directly dispensed as 0.5 to 1 ml aliquots in small vials.</p>
    <p num="71">
      If the alpha hydroxyacid, or the alpha ketoacid or the related compound at full strength is a solid form at room temperature such as 2-hydroxyethanoic acid, 2-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, 2-phenyl 2-hydroxyethanoic acid, 2,2-diphenyl 2-hydroxyethanoic acid and 2-phenyl 3-hydroxypropanoic acid, the solid compound is first dissolved in a minimal amount of vehicle or vehicle system such as water, or ethanol and propylene glycol with or without a gelling agent.
      <br/>
      For example, 2-hydroxyethanoic acid 70 g is dissolved in water 30 g, and the 70% strength solution thus obtained is dispensed as 0.5 to 1 ml aliquots in small vials.
      <br/>
      If a gelling agent is used, 0.5 to 3% of for example, hydroxyethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose or carbomer may be incorporated into the above solution.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      To prepare an intermediate strength (usually 20-50%), the alpha hydroxyacid, alpha ketoacid or related compound either a liquid or solid form at room temperature is first dissolved in a vehicle or vehicle system such as water, acetone, ethanol, propylene glycol and butane 1,3-diol.
      <br/>
      For example, 2-hydroxyethanoic acid or 2-ketopropanoic acid 30 g is dissolved in ethanol 56 g and propylene glycol 14 g, and the 30% strength solution thus obtained is dispensed as 7 to 14 ml aliquots in dropper bottles.

      For topical treatment of warts, keratoses, age spots, acne, nail infections, wrinkles or aging related skin changes, patients are advised to apply a small drop of the medication with a toothpick or a fine-caliber, commonly available artist's camel hair brush to affected lesions only and not surrounding skin.
      <br/>
      Prescribed applications have been 1 to 6 times daily for keratoses and ordinary warts of the hands, fingers, palms, and soles.
      <br/>
      For age spots, acne, nail infections, wrinkles and aging related skin changes topical applications have been 1 to 2 times daily.

      Very often, frequency and duration of applications have been modified according to clinical responses and reactions of the lesions and the patient or responsible family member is instructed accordingly.
      <br/>
      For example, some clinical manifestations other than pain have been used as a signal to interrupt application.
      <br/>
      These manifestations include distinct blanching of the lesions or distinct peripheral erythema.

    <heading>TEST RESULTS</heading>
    <p num="250">
      In order to determine whether amphoteric and pseudoamphoteric compositions of the instant invention were therapeutically effective for various cosmetic conditions and dermatologic disorders, a total of more than 90 volunteers and patients participated in these studies.
      <br/>
      Some participating subjects were given two preparations; an amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric composition containing an alpha hydroxyacid or the related compound, and a vehicle placebo.
      <br/>
      Others were given multiple preparations containing a known pharmaceutical agent such as a corticosteroid with or without incorporation of an amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric composition consisting of an alpha hydroxyacid or the related compound of the instant invention.
      <br/>
      The amphoteric and pseudoamphoteric compositions were formulated according to the Examples described in the previous section.
    </p>
    <p num="251">1. Common dry skin.</p>
    <p num="252">
      Human subjects having ordinary dry skin or with moderate degrees of dry skin as evidenced by dryness, flaking and cracking of the skin were instructed to apply topically the lotion, cream or ointment containing an alpha hydroxyacid or the related compound in amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric composition, on the affected area of the skin.
      <br/>
      Topical application, two to three times daily, was continued for two to four weeks.
    </p>
    <p num="253">
      In all the 28 subjects tested, the feeling of the skin dryness disappeared within a week of topical application.
      <br/>
      The rough and cracked skin became less pronounced and the skin appeared normal and felt smooth after several days of topical treatment.
      <br/>
      The alpha hydroxyacids and the related compounds which have been found to be therapeutically effective when incorporated into the amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric compositions for dry skin are as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="254">2-hydroxyethanoic acid (glycolic acid), 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid), 2-methyl-2-hydroxypropanoic acid (methyllactic acid), phenyl 2-hydroxyethanoic acid (mandelic acid), phenyl 2-methyl-2-hydroxyethanoic acid (atrolactic acid), 3-phenyl-2-hydroxypropanoic acid (phenyllactic acid), diphenyl 2-hydroxyethanoic acid (benzilic acid), gluconolactone, tartaric acid, citric acid, saccharic acid, malic acid, tropic acid, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, gluconic acid, 3-hydroxybutanoic acid, quinic acid, ribonolactone, glucuronolactone, galactonolactone, pyruvic acid, methyl pyruvate, ethyl pyruvate, phenylpyruvic acid, benzoylformic acid and methyl benzoylformate.</p>
    <p num="255">
      The ordinary dry skin conditions, once restored to normal appearing skin, remained improved for some time until causes of dry skin, such as low humidity, cold weather, excessive contact pressure, detergents, soaps, solvents, chemicals, etc., again caused recurrence of the dry skin condition.
      <br/>
      On continued use it was also found that twice daily topical application of an amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric composition containing an alpha hydroxyacid or the related compound of the instant invention prevented the development of new dry skin lesions.
    </p>
    <p num="256">2. Severe dry skin.</p>
    <p num="257">
      In severe dry skin, the skin lesions are different from the ordinary dry skin.
      <br/>
      A main cause of severe dry skin is inherited genetic defects of the skin.
      <br/>
      The involved skin is hyperplastic, fissured and has thick adherent scales.
      <br/>
      The degree of thickening is such that lesions are palpably and visually elevated.
      <br/>
      The thickened adherent scales cause the surface of involved skin to be markedly rough and uneven.
      <br/>
      These two attributes of thickness and texture can be quantified to allow objective measurement of degree of improvement from topically applied test materials as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="258">
      --
      <br/>

      <br/>
      --  smooth
    </p>
    <p num="259">By means of such parameters, degrees of change in lesions can be numerically recorded and comparisons made of one treated site to another.</p>
    <p num="260">In order to evaluate the amphoteric and pseudoamphoteric compositions of the instant invention, a total of 6 patients having severe dry skin conditions were treated with the compositions containing an alpha hydroxyacid or the related compound.</p>
    <p num="261">
      Tested areas were of a size convenient for topical applications, i.e., circles 5 cm in diameter demarcated with a plastic ring of that size inked on a stamp pad.
      <br/>
      The medicinal lotions or creams were topically applied by the patient in an amount sufficient to cover the treatment sites.
      <br/>
      Applications were made three times daily and without occlusive dressings.
      <br/>
      Applications were discontinued at any time when resolutions of the lesion on the treatment area was clinically judged to be complete.
    </p>

    <p num="266">3. Psoriasis.</p>
    <p num="267">
      The involved skin in psoriasis is hyperplastic (thickened), erythematous (red or inflamed), and has thick adherent scales.
      <br/>
      The degree of thickening is such that lesions are elevated up to 1 mm above the surface of adjacent normal skin; erythema is usually an intense red; the thickened adherent scales cause the surface of involved skin to be markedly rough and uneven.
      <br/>
      These three attributes of thickness, color and texture can be quantified to allow objective measurement of degree of improvement from topically applied test materials as follows.

    <p num="277">5. Oily Skin and Skin Cleanse.</p>
    <p num="278">
      Human subjects having oily skin or blemished skin as well as acne patients having extremely oily skin participated in this study.
      <br/>
      Amphoteric and pseudoamphoteric compositions containing alpha hydroxyacids or the related compounds were formulated in solution or gel form.
    </p>
    <p num="279">
      Each participating subject received a solution or a gel preparation containing an alpha hydroxyacid or a related compound in an amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric composition.
      <br/>
      The participating subjects were instructed to apply topically the solution or gel medication on the affected areas of forehead or other part of the face.
      <br/>
      Three times daily applications were continued for 2 to 6 weeks.
    </p>
    <p num="280">
      The degree of improvement of oily skin as well as the rate of improvement of acne lesions were clinically evaluated.
      <br/>
      Most participants reported that oiliness of skin disappeared within one to two weeks of topical administration, and the skin so treated became smooth and soft.
      <br/>
      Many participating subjects preferred gel preparations than solution compositions.
      <br/>
      It was found that all the participants showed substantial improvements on oily skin and acne lesions by six weeks of topical administration of amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric compositions containing alpha hydroxyacids or the related compounds of the instant invention.
    </p>
    <p num="281">
      Those alpha hydroxyacids and the related compounds which have been found to be therapeutically effective for oily skin and as skin cleansers include: benzilic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, methyllactic acid, mandelic acid, pyruvic acid, ethyl pyruvate, methyl pyruvate, tropic acid, malic acid, gluconolactone, 3-hydroxybutanoic acid, glycolide and polyglycolic acid.
      <br/>
      As a skin cleanser for oily skin or acne-prone skin, the amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric composition containing an alpha hydroxyacid or the related compound may also be incorporated with other dermatologic agents.
      <br/>
      For example, an amphoteric gel composition may consist of both an alpha hydroxyacid and erythromycin or tetracycline.
    </p>
    <p num="282">6. Acne</p>
    <p num="283">
      Amphoteric and pseudoamphoteric compositions containing alpha hydroxyacids or the related compounds of the instant invention in a solution or gel form were provided to patients having comedongenic and/or papulopustular lesions of acne.
      <br/>
      Each participating patient was instructed to apply topically the composition on the involved areas of the skin such as forehead, face and chest.
      <br/>
      Three times daily administration was continued for 6 to 12 weeks.
    </p>
    <p num="284">
      The degree and rate of improvement on acne lesions were clinically evaluated.
      <br/>
      It was found that acne lesions consisting mainly of comedones improved substantially after 6 to 8 weeks of topical administration with the amphoteric or the pseudoamphoteric composition containing an alpha hydroxyacid or the related compound.
      <br/>
      The time for complete clearing of comedongenic acne treated with the amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric composition of the instant invention varied from 6 to 12 weeks.
    </p>
    <p num="285">
      As a topical treatment for papulopustular and/or pustular acne the amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric composition containing an alpha hydroxyacid or the related compound may incorporate in addition an antiacne agent.
      <br/>
      The antiacne agents include antibiotics such as erythromycin, tetracycline, clindamycin, meclocycline and minocycline, and retinoids such as retinoic acid.
      <br/>
      Such combination compositions have been found to be therapeutically more effective for topical treatment of severe acne.
    </p>
    <p num="286">7. Age Spots</p>
    <p num="287">
      Many small and large discolored lesions, commonly called age spots on the face and the back of the hands are benign keratoses, if they are not variants of actinic keratoses.
      <br/>
      Very few of such age spots are true lentigines, therefore alpha hydroxyacids and the related compounds may be effective in eradicating most age spots without concurrent use of skin bleaching agents such as hydroquinone and monobenzone.
      <br/>
      However, additional beneficial effects have been found when a skin bleaching agent such as hydroquinone or monobenzone is also incorporated into the compositions of the instant invention for age spots involving pigmented lesions.
    </p>
    <p num="288">
      Amphoteric and pseudoamphoteric compositions containing alpha hydroxyacids or the related compounds, with or without incorporation of hydroquinone were provided to volunteer subjects and patients having age spot keratoses, melasma, lentigines and/or other pigmented lesions.
      <br/>
      Each participating subject received two products, i.e., with or without the addition of 2% hydroquinone to the amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric composition containing an alpha hydroxyacid or the related compound.
    </p>
    <p num="289">
      The volunteer subjects and patients were instructed to apply topically one medication on one side of the body such as left side of the face or on the back of the left hand, and the other medication on the other side of the body such as on right side of the face or on the back of the right hand.
      <br/>
      Specific instructions were given to the participating subjects that the medications were applied three times daily to the lesions of age spot keratoses, melasmas, lentigines and/or other pigmented lesions.
      <br/>
      Clinical photos were taken of participating subjects before the initiation of the topical treatment and every 4 weeks during the course of treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="290">
      At the end of 4 to 8 weeks, improvement of age spot keratoses was clinically discernible.
      <br/>
      After 4 to 6 months of topical treatment, substantial improvement of age spot keratoses occurred in the majority of subjects tested.
      <br/>
      Complete eradication of age spot keratoses occurred after 6 to 9 months of topical administration with the amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric compositions of the instant inventions.
    </p>
    <p num="291">Amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric compositions containing both an alpha hydroxyacid or the related compound and hydroquinone were judged to be more effective in eradicating pigmented age spots, melasma, lentigines and other pigmented lesions.</p>
    <p num="292">
      The alpha hydroxyacids and the related compounds which have been found to be therapeutically effective for age spots with or without combination with hydroquinone include glycolic acid, lactic acid, methyllactic acid, mandelic acid, pyruvic acid, methyl pyruvate, ethyl pyruvate, benzilic acid, gluconolactone, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid and tropic acid.
      <br/>
      For flat or slightly elevated seborrheic keratoses on the face and/or the back of the body, amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric compositions containing higher concentrations of alpha hydroxyacids or the related compounds have been found to be effective in eradicating such lesions.
    </p>
    <p num="293">Actinic keratoses may be successfully treated with amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric compositions containing alpha hydroxyacids or the related compounds in combination with an antimetabolite agent such as 5-fluorouracil.</p>
    <p num="294">8. Warts.</p>
    <p num="295">
      Eradications of common warts by topical application of amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric compositions require higher than usual concentrations of alpha hydroxyacids or the related compounds in the formulations.
      <br/>
      The amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric compositions were formulated as a liquid or light gel form, and dispensed usually as 0.5-1 ml aliquots in small vials.
    </p>
    <p num="296">
      Topical applications were made discreetly to wart lesions by adult patients or by responsible adult family members.
      <br/>
      For ordinary usual warts of hands, fingers, palms and soles topical applications were made 2 to 4 times daily, and were continued for 2 to 6 weeks.
      <br/>
      Generally, the overlying stratum corneum of the wart lesion change in appearance after several weeks topical application of the composition.
      <br/>
      In most cases, the wart lesion simply fell off.
      <br/>
      The skin then healed normally without forming any scars.
    </p>
    <p num="297">We have also found that when a dermatologic agent such as 5-fluorouracil is incorporated into the amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric compositions containing alpha hydroxyacids or the related compounds, the medications have been very effective for topical treatment of warts without using higher concentrations of alpha hydroxyacids or the related compounds.</p>
    <p num="298">The alpha hydroxyacids and the related compounds which have been found to be therapeutically effective for topical treatment of warts with or without incorporation of 5-fluorouracil include glycolic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, ethyl pyruvate, methyl pyruvate and mandelic acid.</p>
    <p num="299">
      Topical formulations and compositions containing specific alpha hydroxyacids, alpha ketoacids or the related compounds at full strengths or high to intermediate concentrations prepared according to Examples 54 and 55, without utilizing amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric systems, have also been tested for ordinary warts of the hands, fingers, palms and soles.
      <br/>
      Participating patients have been advised to apply a small drop of the medication with a toothpick or a fine caliber brush to the center of a wart lesion only.
      <br/>
      Prescirbed applications have been 3 to 6 times daily, and are continued until the patient feels pain.
    </p>
    <p num="300">
      For the more rough-surfaced wart, the duration of application has been as short as one or a few days.
      <br/>
      For lesions with more compact, less permeable stratum corneum, the time to experience gpain has been longer.
      <br/>
      Frequency and duration of applications have been modified according to other clinical responses and reactions of lesions, and the patient or responsible family member is instructed accordingly.
    </p>
    <p num="301">
      For example, some clinical manifestations other than pain have also been used as a signal to interrupt application.
      <br/>
      These manifestations have included distinct blanching of the lesions or distinct peripheral erythema.
      <br/>
      Very often, discomfort is the usual signal of clinical reactions.
    </p>
    <p num="302">
      Generally, the overlying stratum corneum of the wart lesions became loose, and the whole wart lesion simply fell off.
      <br/>
      The skin then healed normally without forming any scars.
    </p>
    <p num="303">9. Athlete's Foot and Nail Infections</p>
    <p num="304">
      Amphoteric and pseudoamphoteric compositions containing both an antifungal agent and one of the alpha hydroxyacids or the related compounds were provided to patients having frequent recurrence of fungal infections involving the foot.
      <br/>
      The antifungal agents include clotrimazole, miconazole, ketoconazole and griseofulvin.
      <br/>
      When both feet but not toe nails were involved in the infection, the patients were instructed to apply topically the compositions of the instant invention on the left foot, and a brand-name antifungal product on the right foot.
      <br/>
      Three times daily applications were continued for one to four weeks.
      <br/>
      The degree and rate of improvement on skin lesions were clinically evaluated, and comparison was made one side of the body against the other.
      <br/>
      It was found that the skin lesions improved much faster with the amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric compositions containing both the antifungal agent and the alpha hydroxyacid or the related compound.
      <br/>
      The alpha hydroxyacids or the related compounds seemed to enhance the efficacies of the antifungal agents, and also to eliminate the discomforts such as itching, tingling, burning and irritation due to fungal infections.
      <br/>
      When toe nails were not involved the infected skin generally healed within one to two weeks from topical application of the amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric composition containing both an antifungal agent and an alpha hydroxyacid or the related compound.
    </p>
    <p num="305">
      Fungal infections of the nails are very difficult to treat, because antifungal products to date are not therapeutically effective for topical treatment of nails.
      <br/>
      One of the reasons is that most antifungal drugs have not been formulated as bioavailable forms in the commercial products.
      <br/>
      When tow nails were involved in the infections, patients were provided with amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric compositions containing in combination an antifungal agent and an alpha hydroxyacid or an alpha ketoacid at higher concentrations ranging from 20 to 99%, dispensed as 1-2 ml aliquots in small vials.
      <br/>
      The patients were instructed to apply topically the compositions discreetly to the infected nail surface by means of a fine calibre paint brush. the technique was the same as for application of nail polish, that is careful avoidance of contact with lateral nail folds or any peri-ungual skin.
      <br/>
      Once or twice daily applications were continued for 2 to 8 weeks.
    </p>
    <p num="306">
      As mentioned above, while brand-name antifungal products are usually not effective against fungus infections within or underneath the nail, it was found that the amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric compositions containing an antifungal agent and an alpha hydroxyacid or alpha ketoacid were therapeutically effective in eradicating fungal infections of the nails.
      <br/>
      Such treatment may cause in some instances the treated nail plate to become loose and eventually fell off from the nail bed.
      <br/>
      This happened quite naturally without any feeling of pain nor bleeding, and the skin lesion healed quickly with normal growth of a new nail.
    </p>
    <p num="307">10. Wrinkles</p>
    <p num="308">
      Wrinkles of skin may be due to natural aging and/or sun damage.
      <br/>
      Most fine wrinkles on the face are due to natural or innate aging, while coarse wrinkles on the face are the consequence of actinic or sun damage.
      <br/>
      Although the real mechanism of wrinkles formation in the skin is still unknown, it has been shown that visible fine wrinkles are due to diminution in the number and diameter of elastic fibers in the papillary dermis, and also due to atrophy of dermis as well as reduction in subcutaneous adipose tissue.
      <br/>
      Histopathology and electron microscopy studies indicate that coarse wrinkles are due to excessive deposition of abnormal elastic materials in the upper dermis and thickening of the skin.
      <br/>
      At present there are no commercial products which have been found to be therapeutically effective for topical eradication of wrinkles, although retinoic acid (tretinoin) has been shown to be beneficial for sun damaged skin.
    </p>
    <p num="309">
      In order to determine whether the amphoteric or pseudoamphoteric composition containing the alpha hydroxyacids, alpha ketoacids or the related compounds are therapeutically effective for wrinkles, patients and volunteer subjects participated in this study.
      <br/>
      The participants were instructed to apply the formulations of the instant invention twice daily on areas of facial wrinkles for 4 to 12 months.
      <br/>
      All participants were told to avoid sun exposure, and to use sunscreen products if exposure to sunlight was unavoidable.
      <br/>
      Photographs of each side of the face for each participant were taken at the beginning of the study and repeated at one to three-month intervals.
      <br/>
      The participants were asked not to wear any facial make-up at the time of each office visit.
      <br/>
      Standardized photographic conditions were used including the use of same lot of photographic film, the same light source at two feet from the face, aimed at a locus on the frontal aspect of each cheek.
      <br/>
      Each time photographs were taken with camera aimed perpendicular to the cheek.
      <br/>
      At the end of study twenty two participants had been entered into the study for at least four months.
      <br/>
      Clinical evaluations and review of photographs have revealed substantial reductions in facial wrinkles of the temporal region and cheek area on at least one side of the face in eighteen cases.
      <br/>
