    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates generally to the manufacture of nonwoven webs by meltblowing and/or or spunbond processes.
      <br/>
      In one aspect, it relates to an apparatus with interchangeable meltblowing and spunbond dies.
      <br/>
      In another aspect, the invention relates to a novel filament drawing or stretching device.
      <br/>
      In still another aspect, the invention relates to the in-line manufacture of spunbond-meltblown laminates.
    </p>
    <p num="2">Nonwoven fabrics have received commercial application in a variety of industries ranging from medical, diapers, filtration, apparel, draperies, absorption, environmental, to name but a few of such uses.</p>
    <p num="3">
      The term "nonwoven" refers to a sheet, web or batt of directionally or randomly oriented fibers, made by bonding or entangling the fibers through mechanical, thermal, or chemical means.
      <br/>
      Nonwoven fabrics exclude paper and products which are woven, knitted, tufted, or felted by wet milling.
      <br/>
      The fibers generally are man-made synthetics.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Although nonwovens may be made by a number of processes, the most popular processes currently in use are meltblowing and spunbond processes.
      <br/>
      Meltblowing is a process for the manufacture of a nonwoven fabric wherein a molten thermoplastic is extruded from a die tip to form a row of filaments (e.g. fibers).
      <br/>
      The fibers exiting from the die tip are contacted with converging sheets or jets of hot air to stretch or draw the fibers down to microsize diameter.
      <br/>
      The fibers are then deposited onto a collector in a random manner and form a nonwoven fabric.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The spunbond process involves the extrusion of continuous filaments through a spinneret.
      <br/>
      The extruded filaments are maintained apart and the desired orientation of the filaments are achieved by rotating the spinneret, by electrical charges, by controlled air streams, or by the speed of the collector.
      <br/>
      The filaments are collected on the collector and bonded by passing the layer of filaments through compacting roll and/or hot row calendering.
      <br/>
      Spunbonded webs generally have large average diameter (e.g. 12-100 microns, typically 15-50 microns) which are heavier and stiffer then meltblown fibers (e.g. 0.5-15 microns, typically 1-10 microns).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A paper presented at "Fiber Producer Conference 1983", in Greenville, S.C., entitled "Nonwoven Fabrics: Spunbonded and Meltblown Processes" describes the two processes in detail.
      <br/>
      The disclosures of this paper are incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the terms "fibers" and "filaments" when used in connection with nonwovens are interchangeable.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The meltblown fabrics are characterized as soft, porous with good hand, but are deficient in strength properties such as tensile strength and are not very wear resistant.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the spunbond fabrics possess good strength properties and wear resistant but are not as flexible as meltblown fabrics.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      It was discovered several years ago that the properties of the meltblown and spunbond fabrics could be combined by a laminate consisting of at least one layer of the meltblown web and at least one layer of the spunbond web. U.S. Pat. No. 4,041,203 discloses such a laminate.
      <br/>
      Over the years, improvements have been made in the laminate, the most popular being the so called S-M-S structure (spunbond-meltblown-spunbond) wherein a meltblown layer is flanked by two spunbond layers.
      <br/>
      The layers may be bonded together by compaction or by calendering, and exhibit outstanding strength properties, energy absorption, tensile strength, and tear resistance, and yet possess a soft, flexible feel or hand.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The S-M-S structures can be made by laminating the preformed webs or can be made by in-line operations wherein (a) spunbond filaments are laid on a moveable collector forming a first layer, (b) meltblown filaments are deposited on the first layer, and finally, (c) a second layer of spunbond filaments is deposited on top of the meltblown layer.
      <br/>
      The three layered structure then can be bonded together.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The in-line operation thus requires two spunbond apparatus and one meltblowing apparatus.
      <br/>
      The spunbond apparatus are large structures because of the long distance of the collector from the spinneret and are not readily adapted to other processes such as meltblowing.
      <br/>
      The meltblowing apparatus, on the other hand, employs a relatively short distance from the die to the collector and is not readily adapted to the spunbond process.
      <br/>
      The in-line apparatus thus is restricted to manufacturing only one type of laminate: the S-M-S laminate or portions thereof.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus which features interchangeable dies.
      <br/>
      That is, a spunbond apparatus can be readily converted to a meltblowing apparatus; or alternatively, a meltblowing apparatus can be readily converted to a spunbond apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      It is further an object of the present invention to provide a multi-station, in-line spinning operation or method wherein each station can be selectively operated to produce a spunbond web, or a meltblown web.
      <br/>
      The flexibility of each station permits the selective manufacture of a variety of laminates which include meltblown and/or spunbond layers in different combinations.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      It is a further object of the present invention to provide a meltblowing die with a filament drawing device to increase the filament drawdown and produce finer filaments.
      <br/>
      The filament drawing device can also be used with advantage on the spunbond apparatus.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      Because of the complexity of the structures embodied in the present invention, the invention will be described first, and with general reference, to the three station in-line assembly (FIG. 1), followed by the description of the various components thereof, including the melt spinning assembly, the meltblowing die insert, the spunbond die insert, the filament drawing device, and an alternative design for the meltblowing assembly.
      <br/>
      Following the description of the various components, the operation of the assembly will be described illustrating the flexibility of the multi-station line, particularly with respect to the interchangeability of the dies at each station.
    </p>
    <p num="16">General Description of the Multi-Station Line (FIGS. 1 and 2)</p>
    <p num="17">
      The stations 10A, 10B and 10C of the multi-station line may include many identical components.
      <br/>
      The same reference numerals will designate the corresponding component at each station.
      <br/>
      For example, the extruder at each station is designated by reference numeral 22.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring specifically to station 10A, this station comprises a support structure which may be in the form of four vertical legs 11 interconnected by cross beams 12.
      <br/>
      Each of the legs 11 are hollow and are concentrically mounted over interior legs 13 which are anchored to the floor.
      <br/>
      The legs 11 and 13 may be of any cross section but are preferably square and are sized to permit telescopic movement therebetween.
      <br/>
      The means for telescopically moving the outer legs 11 in relation to the inner legs 13 may take a variety of forms including hydraulic rams.
      <br/>
      The preferred means, however, is a conventional screw jack assembly 50 located at the upper end of each leg 11 as illustrated in FIG. 13. The jack assembly 50 comprises a gear box 55 driven by drive shaft 59 which turns screw 60.
      <br/>
      Screw 60 is threaded to bushing 69 affixed to the upper end of leg 11.
      <br/>
      Turning the screw 60 in one direction raises the legs 11 and support structure 15.
      <br/>
      Turning the screw 60 in the opposite direction lowers the legs 11 and support structure 15.
      <br/>
      The support structure 15 and equipment mounted thereon is thus moveable vertically between an upper position (station 10A) and a lower position (station 10B).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      A melt spinning assembly, shown generally as 16, is mounted on the moveable support structure 15 by air pipes which include a pair of vertical air pipes 18 (see FIG. 2) and a horizontal pipe section 19.
      <br/>
      There are two pairs of air pipes 18, one pair being mounted on each side of the melt spinning assembly 16.
      <br/>
      One pair, shown in FIG. 2, is connected to opposite ends of air box 20 of the melt spinning assembly 16 as described in detail below.
      <br/>
      The horizontal pipe 19 of each pair of pipes may be secured to cross beam 12.
      <br/>
      Thus the melt spinning assembly 16 is suspended on the moveable support structure 15. (The term "melt spinning assembly" is used herein in the generic sense referring to both meltblowing and spunbond die assemblies.) An extruder 22 is mounted on the moveable support structure 15 as illustrated in FIG. 2 and comprises hopper 23, barrel 24, and polymer feed line 25.
      <br/>
      The polymer feed line 25 delivers polymer melt to the melt spinning assembly 16 as described in more detail below.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Positioned directly under the melt spinning assembly 16 and in alignment therewith are a pair of air quench ducts 26 and a filament drawing device 27.
      <br/>
      These two components, 26 and 27, are both supported on a platform 28 in stacked relationship by brackets (see FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      The pair of ducts 26 defame a quench zone 49 therebetween.
      <br/>
      The drawing device 27 is also constructed as a pair of conduits defining a filament drawing or stretching zone 46 therebetween.
      <br/>
      The vertical space between the quench ducts 26 and the drawing device 27 may include sheet metal housing 47 and the vertical space between drawing device 26 and platform 28 may include sheet metal housing 48.
      <br/>
      The platform 28 has an opening 32 formed therein.
      <br/>
      The filaments 30 discharging from the melt spinning assembly the descend through the quench zone 45, housing 47, draw zone 46, housing 48, opening 32 and are deposited on belt or conveyor 36.
      <br/>
      The components 26, 27, 47 and 48 are mounted on a wheeled carriage 33, as illustrated in FIG. 2, so that this assembly may be moved as a unit to the operating position (FIG. 2) or moved at right angles to the conveyor 36 to an inoperative position.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The conveyer 36 traverses all three stations as illustrated in FIG. 1 and is adapted to collect filaments from each station.
      <br/>
      The conveyor 36 is perforated or a fine-mesh screen to permit the passage of air therethrough.
      <br/>
      Vacuum means 25 positioned under conveyor 36 at each station may be used to withdraw the air and debris.
    </p>
    <p num="22">Air is delivered to the quenching ducts 26 as shown schematically at 34, and air is delivered to the filament drawing device 27 as shown at 35.</p>
    <p num="23">
      Station 10C is substantially identical to station 10A, both of which depict the spunbond mode of the equipment mounted thereon.
      <br/>
      The melt spinning assembly 16 at these stations are provided with spunbond die inserts as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Station 10B represents the meltblowing mode of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      In this mode, the carriage 33 and equipment mounted thereon is moved to the inoperative position and therefore does not appear in FIG. 1 for station 10B.
      <br/>
      In this station, the moveable support structure 15 is moved to its lower position.
      <br/>
      The lower position of the moveable support structure 15 is required because of the short distance between the meltblowing die outlet and the conveyor 36.

      The operation of the three station line shown in FIG. 1 is as follows: spunbond filaments 30 are deposited on the conveyor 36 forming a filament layer 42.
      <br/>
      Layer 42 is carried under the meltblowing die at station 10B which deposits meltblown filaments thereon forming layer 43.
      <br/>
      These layers are carried under station 10C where another layer 44 of spunbond filaments are laid thereon.

      As the fibers pass through housing 38, drawing zone 146 and housing 39, the downwardly converging sheets of air contact the meltblown filaments imparting drag forces to further drawdown the fibers.
      <br/>
      The additional drawdown by the use of the filament drawing device produces microsized fibers in the range of 0.5 to 5 microns, preferably 1 to 2 microns.

    <p num="73">Operating Procedure</p>
    <p num="74">
      The multi-station line shown in FIG. 1 illustrates the mode for manufacturing a spunbond-meltblown-spunbond (S-M-S) laminate.
      <br/>
      In station 10A, the spinning assembly 16 is provided with a spunbond die insert 97 and the moveable support structure 15 is adjusted to the upper position to provide the desired DCD.
      <br/>
      The quench ducts 26 and filament stretching device 27 are moved into place.
      <br/>
      In station 10B, the carriage 33 with the equipment mounted thereon has been removed and the melt spinning assembly 16 is provided with a meltblowing die insert 96.
      <br/>
      The moveable support structure 15 is positioned at its lower position placing the spinning assembly 16 at its proper meltblowing DCD.
      <br/>
      Station 10C is identical to station 10A.
      <br/>
      The operations are commenced by spinning continuous filaments from the spunbond die 97 of station 10A.
      <br/>
      The filaments pass through the quenching zone 45 which not only cools the filaments but maintains them apart to prevent the filament from sticking together.
      <br/>
      The quenched filaments pass through the stretching zone 46 of device 27 where air discharging therefrom further drawsdown and attenuates the filaments.
      <br/>
      The filaments are deposited on the conveyor 36 in a random fashion.
      <br/>
      The spunbond filaments have an average diameter of 12 to 50 microns, preferably 15 to 40 microns.
      <br/>
      Air passes through the conveyor 36 and is withdrawn by the vacuum system 25.
    </p>
    <p num="75">Layer 42 is conveyed under the spinning assembly of station 10B wherein a microsized fibers having an average fiber diameter of 0.5 to 15 microns, preferably 1 to 10 microns, most preferably 2 to 6 microns, is blown onto layer 42 forming meltblown layer 43 on spunbond layer 42.</p>
    <p num="76">
      The two layer laminate is then conveyed under Station 10C wherein another layer 44 of spunbond filaments are deposited on top of the meltblown layer 43, completing the S-M-S structure.
      <br/>
      The three layer structure may then be passed through a calendering or other device to bond the layers together in the conventional manner.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      Based on the description contained herein, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the apparatus of the present invention offers flexibility not attainable with prior art devices.
      <br/>
      By selectively modifying the stations, the line can produce, in addition to S-M-S structure, the following laminates:
    </p>
    <p num="78">S-S, M-M, S-M, M-S using only two of the stations.</p>
    <p num="79">S-S-S, M-M-M wherein each layer may have different properties, or additives, or colors.</p>
    <p num="80">S-S-M, M-S-M, M-M-S, S-M-M, M-S-S lamination using all three stations.</p>
    <p num="81">
      The following summarizes the more important features of the present invention:
      <br/>
      (a) a moveable support structure for meltblowing or spunbond.
      <br/>
      (b) a melt spinning assembly adapted to receive either meltblowing or spunbond die inserts.
      <br/>
      (c) a meltblowing die having an auxiliary or supplementary filament stretching device.
      <br/>
      (d) a novel filament stretching device that can be used with spunbond or meltblowing dies.
