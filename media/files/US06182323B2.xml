    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to the manufacture of objects.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention provides a technique including a system for manufacturing an ultraclean "scrubbing" brush or surface treatment device for the manufacture of integrated circuits, for example.
      <br/>
      Merely by way of example, the present invention is applied to a scrubbing device for the manufacture of integrated circuits.
      <br/>
      But it will be recognized that the invention has a wider range of applicability; it can also be applied to the manufacture of semiconductor substrates, hard disks, flat panel displays, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In the manufacture of electronic devices such as integrated circuits, the presence of particulate contamination, trace metals, and mobile ions on a wafer is a serious problem.
      <br/>
      Particulate contamination can cause a wide variety of problems such as electrical "opens" or "shorts" in the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      These opens and shorts often lead to reliability and functional problems in the integrated circuit that has the opens or shorts.
      <br/>
      Mobile ion and trace metal contaminants can also lead to reliability and functional problems in the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      The combination of these factors is the main source of lower device yields on a wafer, thereby increasing the cost of an average functional device on the wafer.
      <br/>
      In the manufacture of highly integrated devices, planarizing techniques have been used.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Chemical-mechanical polishing ("CMP") is a commonly used technique for planarizing a film on the wafer prior to subsequent processing of the wafer.
      <br/>
      CMP often requires an introduction of a polishing slurry onto a surface of a film on the semiconductor wafer as the wafer is being mechanically polished against a rotating polishing pad.
      <br/>
      The slurries typically are water based and can contain fine abrasive particles such as silica, alumina, and other abrasive materials.
      <br/>
      After polishing is complete, the processed wafers must be cleaned to completely remove residual slurry and other residue from the polishing process in order that the surface is ready for other processing steps such as etching, photolithography, and others.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      To clean residual slurry material from the surface of the polished surface, cleaning brushes have been used.
      <br/>
      These cleaning brushes are often a member that is cylindrical in shape, which generally rotates along a center axis of the cylindrical shaped member.
      <br/>
      The cleaning brushes are also often made of a foam or porous polymeric material such as polyvinyl alcohol ("PVA").
      <br/>
      A combination of rotational movement of the brush and force or pressure placed on the brush against the wafer causes residual slurry materials to be removed from the surface of the wafer.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, it has been found that the brushes themselves often contain residual materials from the brush manufacturing process.
      <br/>
      These residual materials include, among others, residual particles and impurities such as ions and particulate contamination.
      <br/>
      Given that brushes are often "dirty" from a manufacturer, it is often difficult to maintain cleanliness of an integrated circuit manufacturing process by using such dirty brushes.
    </p>
    <p num="6">From the above, it is seen that an improved technique for cleaning a surface treatment device is highly desired.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      According to the present invention, a technique including a treatment device for cleaning surfaces is provided.
      <br/>
      In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides an ultraclean or microclean surface treatment device which includes a scrubbing brush for the manufacture of substrates for the electronics industry.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a novel porous polymeric device, e.g., an ultraclean brush.
      <br/>
      The device includes an elongated porous polymeric member, which has an outer surface for removing residual particles from a surface of a substrate.
      <br/>
      Among other features, the member includes a polyvinyl alcohol bearing compound, where the elongated member has a calcium ion impurity concentration of less than about 1 part per million.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the present device is much cleaner than conventional devices.

    <p num="9">
      In an alternative embodiment, the present invention provides a surface treatment device.

      The device is a porous polymeric member including an outer surface for removing residual particles from a surface of a substrate such as a wafer or hard disk.
      <br/>
      The porous polymeric member is made of at least a polyvinyl alcohol bearing compound, which may be known as PVA, but is not limited.
      <br/>
      The porous polymeric member also has a calcium ion impurity concentration of less than about 1 part per million, and a sodium ion concentration of less than about 0.1 part per million.
      <br/>
      The porous polymeric member is substantially free from loose portions (e.g., un-cross-linked) of the porous polymeric member greater than about 1 micron in size, or greater than about 0.5 micron in size, or greater than about 0.1 micron in size.

    <p num="10">
      Numerous advantages are achieved using the present invention over conventional techniques.
      <br/>
      For example, the present invention provides an ultraclean or microclean brush product in some embodiments.
      <br/>
      The present brush product is cleaner and tends to introduce fewer particles or impurities onto a substrate to be processed.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the present brush product is cleaner "out of the box." That is, the present brush product is much cleaner on delivery than conventional products, which are now on the market at the filing date of this present application.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the present brush product is easier to use and provides for a more efficient manufacturing process, which is important in the manufacture of integrated circuits, for example.
      <br/>
      The present invention can also be applied to other porous polymeric products.
      <br/>
      These and other advantages or benefits are described throughout the present specification and are described more particularly below.

    <p num="13">
      FIG. 1 is a simplified diagram of surface treatment devices according to embodiments of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This Fig. is merely an illustration and should not limit the scope of the claims herein.
      <br/>
      One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.
      <br/>
      As shown, the devices or porous polymeric products (e.g., foam or sponge products) can range in size and shape, depending upon the application.
      <br/>
      According to an embodiment, the device can be shaped as brush rollers 101, which have protrusions thereon, or brush rollers 103 that have smooth surfaces.
      <br/>
      These brush rollers have shapes and sizes to meet the particular cleaning application for devices such as semiconductor wafers, hard disks, and other applications.
      <br/>
      The device can also be in the form of wipes 105, disks 107, and custom applications 109.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the device can be in the form of puck brushes 111 and plugs 113.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the device can be in other shapes and sizes depending upon the application.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In a specific embodiment, the devices are made using a suitable material that is firm, porous, elastic, and has certain abrasion resistiveness.
      <br/>
      In most embodiments, the main raw starting material for the device is polyvinyl alcohol, but can be others.
      <br/>
      As merely an example, polyvinyl alcohol is used to form a polyvinyl acetal porous elastic material.
      <br/>
      The porous material varies in characteristic depending upon cleanliness, type of pore forming agent or process, type of aldehyde employed for the conversion of a polyvinyl alcohol to a polyvinyl acetal, and other factors.
      <br/>
      These factors also include the relative proportions of reactants, reaction temperature and time, and the general condition and starting materials in the manufacturing process.
      <br/>
      Cleanliness of the manufacturing process is also important in the manufacture of these devices.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Cleaning effectiveness of the device also depends upon a porosity and pore size of the device.
      <br/>
      In most embodiments, the porosity can be more than about 85%.
      <br/>
      In devices where porosity is less than 85% polyvinyl acetal porous elastic material may have poor flexibility.
      <br/>
      In most embodiments, the porosity is less than about 95%, since a greater porosity value may provide poor strength.
      <br/>
      Other characteristics include a desirable average pore size or opening.
      <br/>
      The pore size opening in some embodiments ranges from about 10 micron to about 200 micron.
      <br/>
      In devices where the average pore opening is less than 10 micron, the porous elastic material may have poor elasticity and/or flow properties, thus making the performance of the cleaning roll unsatisfactory.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the average pore opening of more than 200 microns can be unsuitable for a cleaning roll because of inconsistent pore configuration.
      <br/>
      Of course, the selected pore size and porosity depend upon the application.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The polyvinyl acetal porous elastic material usable for the present invention can be produced in a known manner, for example, by dissolving at least one polyvinyl alcohol having an average degree of polymerization of 300 to 3,000 and a degree of saponification of not less than 80% in water to form a 5% to 30% aqueous solution, adding a pore forming agent to the solution, and subjecting the solution to reaction with an aldehyde such as formaldehyde or acetaldehyde until the device becomes water-insoluble.
      <br/>
      The polymer is 50 to 70 mole % of acetal units.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments, where the polymer has less than 50 mole % of acetal units, the retained polyvinyl alcohol may ooze out from the product upon use and undesirably contaminate the article to be cleaned.
      <br/>
      Where the polymer has more than 70 mole % of acetal units, the device may have poor elasticity and flexibility in other embodiments.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Although the above devices are generally described in selected shapes and sizes, alternative configurations can also be used.
      <br/>
      As merely an example, the polymeric product can have a gear-like configuration, which has numerous parallel grooves formed at an angle to the roll.
      <br/>
      Additionally, protrusions or projections on the surface of the foam product can include a variety of shapes, e.g., circular, ellipsoidal, rectangular, diamond, or the like.
      <br/>
      The total surface area occupied by the projections can range in value from about 10% and greater, or about 15% to 65%, or greater than about 65%.
      <br/>
      Of course, the particular shape and size of the foam product depends upon the application.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Other techniques can also be used to manufacture porous polymeric devices used for surface treatment applications.
      <br/>
      These techniques include, among others, an air injected foam or sponge product as well as others.
      <br/>
      The device can also be made of polyurethane, and others.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The present devices have fewer impurities and/or particulates than conventional foam products.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the concentration ranges of the impurities are shown in, for example, Table 1A.
      <br/>
      These impurity concentrations compare a conventional brush with the present brush.
      <br/>
      Concentrations are noted in parts per million and were derived using ion chromatography or ICPMS.

      Based upon Table 1B, it is clear that the present invention provides a cleaner device that conventional ones.
      <br/>
      In particular, the concentration of calcium, for example, which is detrimental to integrated circuits, is less than about 0.10 parts per million ("PPM") from a conventional value of about 7.3 PPM. Additionally, the other impurities also have been substantially reduced by way of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The present invention achieves these results by way of a novel cleaning procedure, which is described below in more detail.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      FIG. 2 is a simplified diagram of a cleaning system 200 according to an embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This Fig. is merely an illustration and should not limit the scope of the claims herein.
      <br/>
      One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.
      <br/>
      The simplified diagram shows a system 200, used to clean porous polymeric products (e.g., foam, sponge) to microclean or ultraclean levels.
      <br/>
      System 200 includes a variety of features such as a chemical source region 201, and a chemical metering region 203.
      <br/>
      A variety of chemicals used for cleaning are available in the chemical source region 201.
      <br/>
      These chemicals include, among others, acids, bases, solvents, and chelating agents.
      <br/>
      The chemicals preferably include hydrochloric acid (HCl) 223, ammonium hydroxide (NH4 OH) 225, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) 227, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 229, but are not limited to these.
      <br/>
      Each of these chemical sources is coupled to a metering pump 221 through one of a plurality of lines 222, 224, 226, and 228.
      <br/>
      Line 222 connects metering pump 221 (P-1) to the HCl source, line 224 connects metering pump 221 (P-2) to the NH4 OH source, line 226 connects metering pump 221 (P-3) to the IPA source, and line 228 connects metering pump 221 (P-4) to the EDTA source.
      <br/>
      All of these lines combine at a manifold, which directs the chemical or fluid to line 213, which connects to the washer/extraction unit 209.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the lines may be kept apart to be separate from each other.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The chemical source region is made of a suitable enclosure for preventing chemicals from escaping into the environment or plant floor.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments, the source region is made by a chemically non-reactive material such as polypropylene, Kynar (tm) , Teflon (tm) , polyvinyl chloride, or others.
      <br/>
      In most embodiments, the source region is double contained.
      <br/>
      That is, chemicals escaping from any of the sources are trapped and drain out of the source region without escaping to the plant floor or environment.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the chemical source region is triple contained.
      <br/>
      Of course, the type of source unit used depends upon the nature and types of chemicals.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Pumps (P-1, P-2, P-3, P-4) are commonly controlled by a chemical distribution controller 205, which is electrically connected by line 219.
      <br/>
      Line 219 separates into a plurality of lines to control each of the pumps for metering purposes.
      <br/>
      As merely an example, the metering pumps are capable of handling a wide variety of corrosive chemicals and solvents.
      <br/>
      These pumps are often units made by a company called Nova Systems, but can be others.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Chemical distribution controller 205 communicates to the pumps through line 219 that separates into independent lines to metering pumps.
      <br/>
      Chemical distribution controller 205 can be any suitable unit for metering chemicals from one of a plurality of chemical sources through one of a plurality of metering pumps.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, multiple pumps can be actuating to bring in more than one chemical source into the washer/extraction unit.
      <br/>
      The controller has input/output modules, which receive and transmit signals to and from selected system elements.
      <br/>
      The controller is sufficiently chemical resistant and is durable for manufacturing operations.
      <br/>
      As merely an example, the controller is a product called Novalink, which is made by a company called Nova Systems.
      <br/>
      Of course, other controllers can also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      To oversee the operation of the system including the washer/extraction unit, a washer/extraction unit controller 207 couples to controller 205 through line 217, and couples to washer/extraction unit 209 through line 215.
      <br/>
      The controller has a variety of input and output modules.
      <br/>
      These modules are used to interface with sensors, motors, pumps, and the like from the washer/extraction unit, as well as other apparatus or devices.
      <br/>
      The controller is a microprocessor based unit which is coupled to memory, including dynamic random access memory, and program storage devices.
      <br/>
      A variety of process recipes can be stored in memory of the controller.
      <br/>
      The controller is also sufficiently chemical resistant and is durable for manufacturing operations.
      <br/>
      As merely an example, the controller from the Dubix machine.
      <br/>
      Of course, other controllers can also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Also shown is a waste stream 211 from the washer/extraction unit.
      <br/>
      The waste stream removes used fluids or undesirable fluids from the washer extraction unit.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, the waste fluid stream is chemically balanced and is safe to health, environment, and property.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments, washer/extraction unit uses a specific process recipe that produces an environmentally safe waste stream.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the waste stream must be treated before returning fluids back to the environment.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the waste stream is balanced or pH balanced to meet environmental specifications.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The washer/extraction unit is used with a variety of process recipes to clean and remove impurities from the foam product or products.
      <br/>
      The unit can be any suitable washing machine-type unit with a variety of cleaning and rinsing cycles, which are programmable.
      <br/>
      As merely an example, the unit is a product made by a company known as Dubix, but can be others.
      <br/>
      The unit is made of a suitable material to be chemically resistant and clean to reduce any possibility of particulate contamination or the introduction of impurities onto the foam products.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, the unit is a spin/rinse unit, which rotates a basket in a circular manner, to clean and remove impurities from the foam product.
      <br/>
      The spin/rinse unit is preferably made of stainless steel or another relatively non-reactive material that does not introduce impurities into the porous polymeric product.

      In an alternative embodiment, the present invention provides a ware washing machine according to an embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The ware washing machine can be in the form of commercial dish washing machines and the like, which are to be used to carry out the techniques of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Among ware washing machines, the present invention uses door loading and/or conveyor type machines.
      <br/>
      Door loading machines operate on a "batch" basis in which articles (e.g., porous polymeric or sponge products) are loaded into the machine, the articles are placed through various cycles such as wash, rinse, and others.
      <br/>
      After completing the cycles, the articles are removed.
      <br/>
      In conveyor type machines, for example, the articles including the sponge or porous polymeric products are placed in one end of the machine, passed through the device, and subjected to various operations based on their location in the device.
      <br/>
      The ware washing machine can use any suitable control systems.
      <br/>

    <p num="46">
      In a specific embodiment, the present method uses a step of performing a pre-wash (step 336) with clean water or ultra-clean deionized water.
      <br/>
      The pre-wash step removes loose particulate contamination from the product.
      <br/>
      The clean water also dissolves any water soluble contaminates from the product.
      <br/>
      The water has a resistivity of greater than 18 megohm about ninety percent (or greater) of the time with a 17.6 megohm minimum.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the pre-wash step is often maintained at room temperature or a temperature of less than about 60 (degree)  C. The temperature is maintained at these temperature ranges to prevent any deformation of the product, which is often sensitive to high temperatures.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      A solvent wash is performed (step 337) to the product.
      <br/>
      The solvent wash preferably introduces a relatively concentrated isopropyl alcohol (i.e., IPA) or any other solvent (e.g., reagent alcohol, ethyl alcohol) into the washer/extraction unit, which is often filled with clean water or other fluid.
      <br/>
      The solvent is suitable for dissolving any loose particulate contamination from the product.
      <br/>
      The loose particulate contamination can include any un-cross-linked polymers from the product.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the contamination can include any small and loose portions of the polymeric product.
      <br/>
      It is generally believed that the solvent dissolves portions of loose polymers from the product and washes them away.
      <br/>
      The IPA solvent is often maintained at a concentration of about 0.5% and less, but not lower than 0.05%, which reduces efficiency of the solvent wash process.
      <br/>
      A higher concentration than about 8%, however, may dissolve the product itself, which causes damage to such product.
      <br/>
      The solvent is preferably aqueous.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments, the solvent wash occurs in an agitation cycle of the washer/extraction unit.
      <br/>
      The agitation cycle is generally performed in a "gentle" mode, which reduces a possibility of excessive foaming.
      <br/>
      An aggressive cycle is generally not used since excessive foaming can occur in some embodiments.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      A rinse step 338 can follow the solvent wash step.
      <br/>
      The rinse step generally removes any solvent along with any residual organic contaminants from the product.
      <br/>
      It occurs by draining the solvent from the product, filling the washer/extraction unit with clean water, agitating the product, draining the product, and using centrifugal force to extract residual liquid from the product.
      <br/>
      Of course, the exact sequence of steps depends upon the application.
      <br/>
      The rinse step is often maintained at a temperature of about 20 (degree)  C. or less than about 60 (degree)  C. to prevent any damage or deformation of the product.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the rinse step occurs using "cold" water, which is either at about room temperature or slightly less than room temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      An acid wash (step 339) takes place to remove, for example, to remove any trace metals (e.g., iron, aluminum, copper) from the product.
      <br/>
      In particular, a liquid or gas including acid is introduced into the washer/extraction unit.
      <br/>
      In most embodiments, the acid is mixed with water for proper dilution.
      <br/>
      The acid wash can occur using a single or multiple steps.
      <br/>
      The acid wash is generally maintained at a concentration level between 0.3 and 0.6 weight ("wt") percent.
      <br/>
      A concentration level below 0.04 wt percent will not maintain the target pH of less than two.
      <br/>
      A concentration above 2 wt percent may cause degradation of the product.
      <br/>
      The acid wash does not generally have any incidental limitations such as foaming or the like.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it generally occurs using an aggressive or "high" wash cycle in some embodiments.
      <br/>
      The acid wash also occurs at a temperature of less than about 60 (degree)  C. or about room temperature.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the acid can be any suitable compound such as hydrochloric acid (e.g., HCl), sulfuric acid, citric acid, and others.
      <br/>
      However, strong oxidizing acids, such as nitric acid, typically cannot be used because they may damage the product.

      <br/>
      In a multi-step caustic wash method, a first caustic wash occurs to the product using a solution containing ammonium hydroxide.
      <br/>
      The ammonium hydroxide is at a concentration ranging from about 0.05% to about 5.0%, but can also be at other concentrations.
      <br/>
      High concentrations, however, are generally not desirable due to noxious fumes and the like.
      <br/>
      Extremely low concentrations generally reduce the effectiveness of the washing step.
      <br/>
      The caustic washing step removes a portion of negative ions or particles with a negative zeta potential from the product according to some embodiments.
      <br/>
      Negative ions are also removed from the product by way of a concentration gradient according to some embodiments.
      <br/>
      The caustic wash step is maintained at a temperature of about 15 (degree)  C.-20 (degree)  C. and less than about 60 (degree)  C. to prevent any damage to the product, which is temperature sensitive.
      <br/>
      The caustic wash step also can occur using a gentle cycle or an aggressive cycle, depending upon the application.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments, the caustic wash step does not allow for any introduction of a sodium bearing compound such as sodium hydroxide or a potassium bearing compound such as potassium hydroxide.
      <br/>
      These compounds are generally detrimental to electronic devices such as integrated circuits, hard disks, and the like.

    <p num="52">
      A chelating step (step 342) occurs to remove additional trace metals from the product.

      <br/>
      The chelating step "grabs" trace metals from the basic solution.
      <br/>
      By way of the basic solution, these metals do not precipitate out.

      The second caustic wash, which is noted above, removes or "scavenges" any remaining impurities such as calcium, magnesium, and others.

      One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.
      <br/>
      The scrubbing process uses the cleaned devices according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      As shown in the Fig., a semiconductor product wafer cleaning system 401 has two brush stations, a first comprising cylindrical PVA brushes 402 and 403, and a second comprising cylindrical PVA brushes 404 and 405.
      <br/>
      On each of the brushes, there are projections 406 also made of PVA.
      <br/>
      The brushes are mounted on spindles 407, 408, 409 and 410 so that they are barely touching and rotate in the direction indicated.
      <br/>
      Deionized water and, if used, any cleaning chemistries are sprayed from nozzles 411 and 412 and pumped 413 through the brushes from the spindles.
      <br/>
      The combination of the water and brush contact acts to remove residual cleaning composition from a semiconductor product wafer 414 which is passed through the brushes in the cleaning stations.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      In order to remove the slurry or other residue, deionized water is pumped through holes in the spindle to saturate the tubular brushes.
      <br/>
      Additionally, deionized water sprayed from nozzles above and below impinges the wafers.
      <br/>
      As the brushes rotate over the surface of the wafer, they tend to pick up and trap in the brush surface particles of the slurry and other residue of the cleaning composition.
      <br/>
      The slurries which eventually contaminate the cleaning brushes and render them ineffective for further cleaning comprise the slurries and other cleaning compositions described in the background section of this application.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The cleaning brushes used in post CMP cleaning operations is employed in connection with resilient foam brushes such as those used on the Synergy wafer cleaning system manufactured by OnTrak Systems, Inc. of Milpitas, Calif.
      <br/>
      This system employs multiple sequential cleaning stations wherein each station comprises a pair of tubular brushes made of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in the form of a foam.
      <br/>
      Each brush has a length of approximately 10 in. (25.4 cm), an outside diameter of approximately 23/8 in. (6.0 cm) and an inside diameter of approximately 11/4 in. (3.2 cm), and has an outer cylindrical surface covered with foam projections approximately 3/16 in. (0.5 cm) in height and A in. (0.7 cm) in diameter.
      <br/>
      Each brush is rotatably mounted on a spindle through which may be pumped water to saturate the brush and the brushes at each station are spaced so that the surfaces approximately contact each other.
      <br/>
      Given the resilience of the foam, this permits thin semiconductor wafers containing the cleaning composition residue to pass between the pairs of brushes as they rotate.
      <br/>
      Typically, as the cleaning system will have two (2) stations, with each station having a pair of the brushes as described above.
      <br/>
      The wafers pass directly from one station through the other.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      The semiconductor product wafers which may be cleaned by the system referenced herein include silicon, silicon nitride, silicon oxide, polysilicon or various metals and alloys.

      To prove the operation and principle of the present invention, experiments have been performed.
      <br/>
      In these experiments, a system according to the present invention was made and used to show superior cleaning of sponge or porous polymeric products.
      <br/>
      The system used was a washer/extraction unit made by Dubix.
      <br/>
      A plurality of dirty sponge products were introduced into the system.
      <br/>
      As merely an example, the information in Table 1A and 1B show conventional impurity concentrations in a polymeric sponge product made by Kanebo Limited, but is not limited to this vendor.
      <br/>
      The sponge products were received in lengths of about 350 mm.
      <br/>
      They were cut to form a plurality of sponge products, each having a length of about 250 mm and less.
      <br/>
      These sponge products were loaded into the washer/extraction unit made by Dubix.
      <br/>
      A recipe was programmed into the washer/extraction unit by way of a computer software interface.
      <br/>
      The interface was provided by a company called Nova Systems, but is not limited to this vendor.
      <br/>
      As merely an example, the washer/extraction unit was programmed using the recipe in Table 2.
      <br/>
      As shown, the Table lists a sequential order of steps (e.g., 1, 2, 3); operation (e.g. rinse, wash); process times (in minutes and seconds); general information (e.g., gentle wash cycle, normal wash cycle); water temperature (e.g., cold, hot); liquid level (in percentages); solution type (e.g., water, alcohol); and solenoid times.
