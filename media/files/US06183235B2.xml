      A precision injection molding apparatus is provided with servo mechanisms in various portions of the apparatus including a resin injection portion to provide precise feedback control of resin weighing, blending, and injection of weighed and blended resin into a die cavity between closed dies, a die opening and closing portion to provide precise feedback control for driving a movable die from a spaced position into a closed position relative to a fixed die to provide the die cavity, a gate cutting portion to provide precise feedback control of gate cutting, a molding ejecting portion to provide precise feedback control of ejecting a formed molding and a molding removing portion to provide precise feedback control for removing the molding from between opened dies.
      <br/>
      Because servo mechanisms are used, there is no variation in repetitive response accuracy of motion and speed of operation can be increased in terms of cycle speeds without loss of accuracy.

    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to an electrically-operated injection molding machine using a servo motor as a drive source of the injection molding process, and more specifically to an electrically-operated injection molding machine for super-precision molding using servo motors for a product eject process and a molding removal process as well as an injection compression molding method using the relevant machine.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The injection molding machine using servo motors for drive sources of each process has been popularly used now.
      <br/>
      However, even in such event, servo motors are used at most for drive sources, such as (1) injection into die cavities of weighed resin, (2) weighing of blended resin, (3) opening and closing of dies, (4) gate cutting, etc., and there has been no case in which servo motors are used in the product eject process.
      <br/>
      This is because as shown in FIG. 21, the location of screw mechanism for gate cutting is concentrated with an extremely large number of mechanisms, and an air cylinder has conventionally been used for drive sources of the product eject pin for a device that can be barely contained in this portion.
    </p>
    <p num="3">First Problem</p>
    <p num="4">
      As observed recently, when the high cycle of injection molding machines advances gradually, the time for removing ejected products causes problems.
      <br/>
      An attempt to shorten time naturally requires accurate response at this portion.
      <br/>
      However, the air cylinder has limitations in response speed as well as variations in response timing, and the shortening and improvement in accuracy in product removal from the air cylinder have reached their limits.
    </p>
    <p num="5">To show one example, assume that the desired production cycle time per product is 3 seconds, the time assigned from eject to product removal is 0.12-0.15 second, whereas when an air cylinder is used, 0.2 second is required, and approaches by the air cylinder become extremely difficult.</p>
    <p num="6">In addition, because there are variations in repetitive response accuracy of the air cylinder on order of 0.01 second, an allowance from 0.02-0.05 second must be provided for timing of product removal carried out by a product removing equipment (not illustrated), and when still higher cycle is aimed at, the air cylinder has a problem of large time loss in shortening of the overall time.</p>
    <p num="7">Second Problem</p>
    <p num="8">
      In the electrically-operated injection molding machine of the conventional example using servo motors, each servo motor is feedback controlled in each process based on the program data for servo control.
      <br/>
      This takes in the data from the encoder equipped to the relevant servo motor into CPU for arithmetic, and the position, speed, torque, etc. are feedback controlled as specified in the program.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      However, this kind of control method is an indirect control method of the position, speed, torque, etc. via the encoder equipped to the servo motor, and has been unable to directly detect injection pressure, weighed resin pressure, and die clamping force, etc. actually applied to the screw and dies and to feedback control based on the actually detected data.
      <br/>
      That is, because it was unable to find any place to install a pressure sensor for directly detecting the die clamping force applied to the dies, it was unable to directly detect the die clamping force and carry out feedback control.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Third Problem</p>
    <p num="11">In the electrically-operated injection molding machine which uses many servo motors, using one servo motor for one operating mechanism results in too many servo motors, causing disadvantages of not only enormous equipment costs but also complicated control.</p>
    <p num="12">Fourth Problem</p>
    <p num="13">
      Recently, the digital technique has been popularized in various fields including data processing, images, and music, and as a natural consequence, for example, CD, MD, DVD, and other digital substrates have been put into practical use.
      <br/>
      In particular, in PVD substrates, it is required to transfer super fine protrusions and recessions formed on dies accurately to moldings, and hydraulically-controlled conventional injection molding machines are no longer able to satisfy the requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Consequently, injection molding machines which use many servo motors as described above, though partly, have been developed.
      <br/>
      And as this kind of increased precision of injection moldings advances, not only injection molding machines but also injection molding methods have continuously evolved.
      <br/>
      In this kind of injection molding machines, the following will govern the substrate accuracy.
    </p>
    <p num="15">For example, taking molding of optical disk substrates for example, warpage of moldings, adhesion of foreign matter, void, discoloration by gas, molding cycle, etc. constitute extremely important factors, but above all, the biggest problems are (1) super fine pitch, (2) pit transferability of depth, (3) realization of double refraction of 50 nm or less, and it is possible to suppress double refraction by alleviating (photoelasticity coefficient * main stress difference �=shear stress+thermal stress�).</p>
    <p num="16">Now in substrate molding, (1) microvoids and (2) micro flowmarks can be mentioned for factors that check transferability of fine protrusions and recesses.</p>
    <p num="17">
      That is, when resin flows along fine protrusions and recessions, air entrapping phenomena occurs in the resin flow in the front and the rear of the wall of fine protrusions and recessions, and fine air pools are formed.
      <br/>
      This fine air pool causes degraded transferability, and the countermeasure is to suppress resin solidification by high-speed filling as much as possible and to complete filling.
      <br/>
      However, this was insufficient. by conventional injection molding method.
      <br/>
      In addition, timing of injection compression is an important factor.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The foregoing description can be summarized as follows.
      <br/>
      In these several years, practical application and its development of digital substrates have been remarkable, and new deployment of injection molding machines and injection molding technique has been called for.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the demand for still higher cycle of forming speed has been exceptional, and for a solution, adoption of the servomechanism of all the drive units has been promoted.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      (1) It is the screw mechanism for ejection for removing moldings from dies and direct detection of resin filling pressure and clamping force to dies at the die portion that constitute bottlenecks in adopting servomechanism.
      <br/>
      Even if pressure sensors are intended to be installed to the movable die side for directly detecting resin filling pressure or die clamping force, there is a limitation in space, and even when the pressure sensor is installed on the movable die side, there is a restriction in that the screw mechanism for ejection is unable to be installed unless some special construction is adopted, and in addition, it is also a limit in space.
    </p>
    <p num="20">(2) The adoption of servomechanism naturally means feedback control, but because in conventional cases, actual resin filling pressure and die clamping force were unable to be detected, they must be processed by feedback control using the data from the encoder attached to the servo motor.</p>
    <p num="21">(3) The reduced number of servo motors is quoted as one of the requirements together with adoption of servomechanism.</p>
    <p num="22">(4) Another object of requirements for adoption of servomechanism lies in improvement of transferability of super fine protrusions and recessions for, for example, optical digital substrates.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="23">Now, problems the present invention intends to solve are described as follows in due order.</p>
    <p num="24">
      To consider in this way, if further higher cycle is intended, epochmaking innovation in the product eject system has been desired with respect to the first problem to be solved, because the product ejection by an air cylinder has already reached its limit.
      <br/>
      In other words, the object of this invention is (1) to develop a novel mechanism that can substitute for the cylinder system in order to achieve still higher cycle and to enable product removal without time loss in linkage with this new mechanism, and (2) to be able to install the new mechanism that substitutes for the cylinder system smoothly to a complicated gate cut mechanism portion.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In the second problem to be solved, because the servo motor is used for a driving source, it is an object of this invention not only to achieve higher cycle but also to directly detect weighed resin pressure and die clamping force exerted to dies in order to carry out feedback control.
      <br/>
      In particular, it is an object of this invention to enable direct detection of die clamping force on the die mechanism side, which has been considered impossible.
    </p>
    <p num="26">The third problem to be solved is to allow one servo motor to carry out two or more tasks to reduce the number of servo motors, because the use of many servo motors results in increased costs and complication of control, and it is an object of this invention to achieve reduction in manufacturing costs and simplification in control without degrading the performance by allowing one servo motor to cover gate cutting and molding ejection processes.</p>
    <p num="27">The fourth problem to be solved is to develop an injection molding method in an electrically-operated injection molding machine using servo motors for simultaneously achieving requirements for higher cycle of forming, improved transferability of fine protrusions and recessions formed on the dies, and stabilization of the molding quality, and control of speed for injecting weighed resin to die cavity, control of gate cutting timing, die compression speed, and die compression pressure as well as positional control of dies for achieving uniform molding thickness must be properly carried out to achieve this, and these requirements have never been achieved with the capabilities of conventional equipment which has employed a hydraulically-driven die compression forming method.</p>
    <p num="28">The fifth problem to be solved is to further improve the transferability of fine protrusions and recessions by eliminating fine air pools generated between fine protrusions and recessions and the solidified skin layer through eliminating the generation of the solidified skin layer as much as possible with further improvement in the die compression forming method.</p>

      With the foregoing description, the ejection member (27) comprises the center ejection bar (27a), its straight portion (27b), center pin (27c), product ejection operating bar (57), coupling bar (28), (55), product ejection pins (27d), and returning spring (29).

      When the molding (26) is ejected, the gate portion (26a) coming together with the molding (26) is dropped first by the center pin (27c), and then ejection of the molding (26) follows.

      In said molding ejection process, the beginning, the product ejection operating bars (57) are located at the home position by being pulled back as shown in FIG. 2, and the coupling bar (28) on the product ejection pins (27d) are held away from said product ejection operating bars (57).

      Next, the center pin (27c) is protruded first when the servo motor (51) is operated, as described above, and that, the product ejection pins (27d) are protruded to eject the molding (26).
      <br/>
      Naturally, the operating relation is not limited to this, the product ejection operating bar (57) may come in contact with the coupling bar (28) on the product ejection pin (27d) so that both may be ejected simultaneously.

      Then, the product removal equipment (S) will be described.
      <br/>
      The servo motor (45) of the product removal equipment (S) is mounted on the movable die plate (18), and in this embodiment, a product removing arm (47) is mounted on the servo motor (45) via an actuator (46).
      <br/>
      An absorption pad (48) is equipped at the end portion of the product removing arm (47).

      Now, because the reciprocating operation distance of the actuator (46) that operates for removing the molding (26) is short, the cylinder is sufficient for use of the actuator (46), but it is possible to use a servo motor instead of the cylinder.
      <br/>
      When a servo motor is used, the removal timing can be completely coincided, and loss time can be zeroed, but when a cylinder is used, the responsibility is inferior to that of the servo motor, and slight loss time may be generated.

      Now, the operation of this invention will be described.
      <br/>
      When the material resin (3c) is charged into a material feeder hopper (16) and the rotation servo motor (11) is operated to rotate the screw (4), the material resin (3c) is gradually fed into the injection cylinder (13).
      <br/>
      After that, because the injection cylinder (13) is heated with the heater (14) wrapped around its outer circumference, the material resin (3c) that has entered the injection cylinder (13) is gradually melted and is blended by the rotating operation of the screw (4).
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      With the rotation of the screw (4), the molten blended resin (3b) is fed to the top end direction of the injection cylinder (13) and stored at the top end portion.
      <br/>
      For this reaction, the screw (4) gradually reverses and eventually reaches the predetermined reverse stop position.
      <br/>
      At this point, the resin weighing is completed.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      On the other hand, on the dies (1), as shown in FIG. 2, die clamping first takes place.
      <br/>
      That is, the dies control servo motor (31) is operated, the rotation force is transmitted to the driven pulley (34) via the driving pulley (32) and the timing belt (33).
      <br/>
      The driven pulley (34) is rotated to advance the cross head driving shaft (34a) screwed down to the driven pulley (34) in the right direction in the drawing FIG. 2, which, in turn, propels the cross head (35), and the dies opening and closing toggle (T) is stretched by the cross head.
      <br/>
      In this process, the movable die (1b) equipped to the movable die plate (18) moves in the direction of the stationary die (1a) and the movable die (1b) is pressed to the stationary die (1a) with a specified pressure by said toggle (T).
      <br/>
      Die clamping takes place in this manner.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      Next, under this die clamping condition, the screw (4) is moved toward the dies (1) by the injection servo motor (12).
      <br/>
      The weighed and blended molten resin (3a) stored at the top end portion of the injection cylinder (13) is injected into the die cavity (2).
      <br/>
      The injection speed is controlled to an optimum by the controller (8).
      <br/>
      After the weighed molten resin (3b) is injected and filled inside the die cavity (2), gate cut is carried out successively.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      After the gate cutting, the servo motor (40) for rotating the driving pulley (41) works the driven pulley (43) via the timing belt (42) while dies clamping is underway.
      <br/>
      As the screw shaft (30a) is screwed down to the nut portion (43a) of the driven pulley (43), the screw shaft (30a) and the hollow gate cutting bar (30b) connected to the top end of the screw shaft (30a) advances in the direction of the gate (1c) made in the stationary die (1a).
      <br/>
      By this gate cutting, the die cavity (2) is completely isolated from the outside.
    </p>
    <p num="86">When gate cutting is finished as described above, the die clamping condition is held or further tightened under this condition to press the filled resin (3) solidifing in the cavity (2) with extremely strong force, transferring micro-fine protrusions and recessions formed on the inner surface (5) of the die cavity (2) (see FIG. 3).</p>
    <p num="87">
      When solidification of filled resin (3) is finished by cooling, the servo motor (31) is reversed, the toggle mechanism (T) is loosened, and the movable die (1b) is separated from the stationary die (1a).
      <br/>
      In this process, the molding (26) is moved with the movable die (1b) as-fitted in the die cavity (2) of the movable die (1b) (see FIG. 4).
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      Lastly, when die opening is finished, the ejection servo motor (51) is operated, the driving pulley (52) is rotated by the ejection servo motor(51), and the driven pulley (54) is rotated by the driving pulley (52) via the timing belt (53).
      <br/>
      By this operation, the center ejection bar (27a) screwed down in the nut portion (54a) of the driven pulley (54) advances together with the eject coupling bar (55) mounted on the end of the screwed portion (27s).
    </p>
    <p num="89">Prior to the contact of the product ejection operating bar (57) to the coupling bar (28) fixed to the product ejecting pins (27d), the center pin (27c) connected to the screw shaft (30a) projects and drops the gate portion (26a) adhering to the top end of the center pin (27c) together with the molding (26) (see FIG. 5).</p>
    <p num="90">
      After the dropping of said gate portion (26a), the servo motor (51) further continues to operate this process, the product ejection operating bar (57) is then advanced more to press the coupling bar (28) fixed to the product ejection pins (27d).
      <br/>
      When the product ejecting pins (27d) slightly project from the inner surface (5) of the die cavity (2), they press on the outer circumferential edge of the molding (26) where is the super fine protrusions and recessions non-molded portion (see FIG. 6).
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      And with the timing of the separation sound, the product removing equipment (S) is operated.
      <br/>
      That is, because ejection of the molding (26) is carried out by the ejection servo motor (51), the reproducibility of the timing has an extremely high accuracy.
      <br/>
      And because the operation of the servo motor (51) is inputted successively to the controller (8), the servo motor (45) of the product removing equipment (S) can be operated in step with the operation of the servo motor (51).
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      When the servo motor (45) is operated in step with the operation of the servo motor (51), the arm (47) which is waiting outside the dies (1) is rotated by a certain angle to insert the tip end portion having the absorption pad (48) inside the parting surface of the dies (1) and stopped in front of the molding (26), and then, the actuator (46) is operated to move the absorption pad (48) of the arm (47) indirection of the molding (26) and absorbs the molding (26) at the moment, when the molding (26) is ejected.
      <br/>
      And then, the actuator (46) is reversely operated to remove the molding (26) from the die cavity (2), and finally the servo motor (45) is reversely operated to take out the molding (26) to the outside of the dies (1).
    </p>
    <p num="93">This series of operation takes place in 0.12 to 0.15 second, and the loss time in a series of operations from the beginning of ejection to the product removal becomes the minimum, contributing to the improvement in increased cycles.</p>
    <p num="94">To describe the operation of pressure sensors (7) and (15), because the pressure sensor (7) is mounted between the movable die plate (18) and the housing (5), the die clamping force at the time of die clamping by the toggle mechanism (T) is directly applied to the pressure sensor (7), enabling the direct detection of the die clamping force.</p>

      The relevant graph compares the compression molding method (first method) utilizing the electrically-operated injection molding machine (A) according to this invention and the injection molding method by the conventional hydraulic injection molding machine, with pressure as ordinate and time as abscissa.
      <br/>
      Curves shown with the solid line indicate the first control example of the compression molding method according to this invention, and the solid line on the upper side is a set pressure of the movable die (1b) and that on the lower side indicates the actual reaction force of the movable die (1b) detected with the pressure sensor (7).
    </p>
    <p num="135">Curves shown with the broken line indicate the conventional example, and the broken line on the upper side is a set pressure of the movable die by the hydraulic drive and that on the lower side are outputs of hydraulic sensors (not illustrated) installed to the hydraulic circuit.</p>
    <p num="136">
      In the conventional example, hydraulic drive is used for dies compression, and the compression pressure is detected with the hydraulic sensor installed to the hydraulic circuit, and it is controlled to coincide with the set pressure.
      <br/>
      However, in the case of hydraulic control, due to temperature changes of pressurized oil as well as various changes in viscosity, etc., or indirect detection of resin pressure detected via pressurized oil, or various factors such as difference between dynamic friction and static friction of the movable die, etc., the actual resin pressure inside the dies dynamically changes to show the wave form, and does not coincide with the set pressure.
      <br/>
      That is, the die compression pressure is set from the start of the injection process (0) to dies opening (R3) as shown in the broken line on the upper side and the compression pressure of the movable die should be hydraulically controlled to vary in accord with the set pressure, but in actuality, such condition does not occur.
      <br/>
      That is, the output from the hydraulic sensor equipped in the dies driving hydraulic circuit begins to be provided when injection begins, resin begins to be filled inside the die cavity, and the resin begins to come in contact with the movable die after a while.
      <br/>
      This point is shown with (s).
      <br/>
      Thereafter, as resin is filled, the output shown by the hydraulic sensor rapidly builds up and after it reaches the peak (S1), the output wave form of the resin pressure undulates due to the above-mentioned reasons.
      <br/>
      In other words, the resin pressure inside the die cavity dynamically changes, and does not coincide with the set pressure.
      <br/>
      In addition, there is a limit in the injection speed due to hydraulic drive, and resin is injected at a comparatively slow speed as shown in (0 --&gt; R1) of FIG. 19. Consequently, a thin resin film is generated on the surface of the filled resin (3) and transferability is degraded.
    </p>
    <p num="137">The injection process is finished at point (R1), and the operation moves to the dies compression process (R1 --&gt; R2), which is a pre-stage of the pressure holding process, but at this stage, pressure applied to each portion of filled resin is not uniform because of undulating pressure, and the internal stress of the molding increases, resulting in increased birefringence.</p>
    <p num="138">
      As against this, in this invention, since the resin pressure of the filled resin (3) is directly detected with the pressure sensor (7), it is possible to follow the compression pressure control in real time by the movable die (1b), the former half stage of the pressure-holding process, or the positional in real time by the movable die (1b), the latter half stage of the pressure-holding process.
      <br/>
      The injection speed can be controlled following the direct detection by the pressure sensor (7) within the range of the injection process (px --&gt; P1).
      <br/>
      Point (px) is an intersection between the vertical line (H1) drawn from the output initiation point of the pressure sensor (7) and the injection set speed curve (0 --&gt; P1).
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      Next description will be made on the operation of the fourth embodiment (A4).
      <br/>
      The process from charging the material resin (3c) into the material feeder hopper (16) to completion of resin weighing is the same as that of the first embodiment (A1) and the description is omitted.
      <br/>
      The injection and filling process and pressure holding process thereafter will be discussed as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      The rotating speed of the screw (4) during this period (weighing process) is controlled by taking in output signals from the pulse generator (11a) into the controller (8), comparing them with the set value, and carrying out either feedback control or feed-forward control or a combination of both on the rotation servo motor (11) in such a manner to trace the set value.
      <br/>
      This point is common to all the embodiments (A1) through (A5).
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      Upon completion of resin weighing, the operation moves to the injection and filling process as described before, but when resin (3) is filled, the injection speed of the screw (4) is controlled by taking in output signals from the pressure sensor (15) into the controller (8), comparing them with the set value, and carrying out either feedback control or feed-forward control or a combination of both on the injection servo motor (12) in such a manner to trace the set value.
      <br/>
      This point is common to all the embodiments (A1) through (A5).
    </p>
    <p num="142">The dies compression molding operation (first method) of the dies (1) at the time of resin filling will be described later.</p>
    <p num="143">The rotating speed of the injection servo motor (12) is detected by the pulse generator (12a).</p>
    <p num="144">
      Since the injection speed is preferably controlled by the resin pressure of the filled resin (3) inside the die cavity (2) because it is direct, when the filled resin (3) comes in contact with the movable die (1b) at point (px) and data begins to be outputted from the pressure sensor (7) on the resin pressure, the injection speed control by the pressure sensor (15) may be switched to the injection speed control by the pressure sensor (7).
      <br/>
      This point is described referring to FIG. 19. Because (0 --&gt; P1) region is the injection process, speed control is carried out, and in (0 --&gt; px) of it, injection speed control by the pressure sensor (15) takes place, and in (px --&gt; P1) of it, the injection speed control by the pressure sensor (7) takes place.
      <br/>
      Needless to say, injection speed control by the pressure sensor (15) may be carried out throughout the whole (0 --&gt; P1).
    </p>
    <p num="145">Because injection of weighed resin (3a) is carried out by the injection servo motor (12), high-speed injection extremely close to the setting volve is possible, and injection can be completed before thin resin film is formed on the filled resin (3) surface, and transferability can be remarkably improved.</p>
    <p num="146">
      Thereafter, gate cutting takes place at such timing (P1) that the gate cutting member (30) operates to cut the gate when the pressure sensor (7) indicates the specified value.
      <br/>
      Consequently, because gate cutting is carried out every time at the same resin pressure, the same amount of resin (3) is filled stably in the die cavity (2) every time.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      Then, operation moves to the pressure-holding process �(P1) --&gt; (P3)�. The resin pressure inside the die cavity (2) is directly detected by the pressure sensor (7) for control in the pressure control region which is the former-half stage of the pressure-holding process.
      <br/>
      It is possible to provide the compression pressure nearly close to the setting to the filled resin (3) It makes the internal stress of the filled resin (3) enable further reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      When operation moves to the position control �(P2) --&gt; (P3)� which is the latter-half stage of the pressure-holding process, filled resin (3) is nearly solidified, and the position of the movable die (1b) must be accurately controlled so that the thickness becomes uniform.
      <br/>
      As described above, because a given amount of resin (3) is filled in the die cavity (2) every time, if the detection value of the pressure sensor (7) is constant, the thickness becomes constant.
      <br/>
      Consequently, controlling the detection value of the pressure sensor (7) at the position control stage to the setting naturally brings the movable die (1b) position to a constant position, and the thickness of the molding (26) becomes constant.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      The above process is described in terms of the movement of the dies (1).
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4 �1�, first of all, when die clamping is carried out the core(5b) of the stationary die (1a) fits into the die cavity (2) of the movable die (1b).
      <br/>
      However, at this point, the toggle (T) is not completely extended, and a small clearance (t) is provided between parting faces.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the die cavity (2) becomes wider than that at the die clamping time.
    </p>
    <p num="150">
      Then, the injection servo motor (12) is worked for operating the screw mechanism portion (10), and the screw (4) is moved in the direction of the dies (1).
      <br/>
      The weighed and blended molten resin (3a) at the top end of the cylinder (13) is injected into the die cavity (2) (see FIG. 4 �2�).
      <br/>
      The injection speed is optimally controlled by the controller (8).
      <br/>
      The molten weighed resin (3a) is injected and filled in the die cavity (2).
      <br/>
      When the resin (3a) comes in contact with the die cavity (2) of the movable die (1b) and pressurizes the dies (1), the filling pressure is detected by the pressure sensor (7).
      <br/>
      In this process, as described above, because the die cavity (2) is set slightly wider, the molten blended resin (3b) is filled additionally in the amount equivalent to that.
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      The above processes (0 --&gt; P1) is controlled by the pressure sensor (15), or (0 --&gt; px) by the pressure sensor (15) and (px --&gt; P1) by the pressure sensor (7).
      <br/>
      Because this injection process is carried out in such a manner to follow the setting value by the injection servo motor (12), filling is finished before thin resin film is formed on the filled resin (3).
    </p>
    <p num="152">After that, gate cutting takes place, when the pressure sensor (7) indicates the specified value (P1), and feed of resin (3a) to the die cavity (2) is immediately stopped. (see FIG. 18 (3))</p>
    <p num="153">
      That is, operating the servo motor (40) to rotate the driven pulley (43) with the dies (1) clamping underway advances the gate cutting member (30), and blocks the gate(1c) of the stationary die (1a) at its top end.
      <br/>
      By this operation, the die cavity (2) is completely isolated from the outside with extra filled resin (3), which is equivalent to the portion (or position) the movable die (1b) did not advance.
    </p>
    <p num="154">
      Then, the die control servo motor (31) is operated again to further advance the cross head driving shaft(34a), and the cross head (35) is pressed to advance to further extend the toggle (T) so that the movable die plate (18) is pressed against the stationary die (1a) with a specified pressure.
      <br/>
      With this operation, the filled resin (3) is compressed with extremely strong pressure, and super-fine recessions and protrusions on the super-finely recessed and protruded inner surface (5) of the die cavity (2) are accurately transferred to the surface of the filled resin (3) that begins to solidify (see FIG. 18 �4�).
      <br/>
      Because the dies (1) are compressed while the resin pressure is directly detected with the pressure sensor (7), uniform die compression at high reproducibility can be carried out every time.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      Now, after that this condition, the movable die (1b) is held so that the resin pressure achieves the specified value with directed by the pressure sensor (7), till the filled resin (3) becomes solid body solidifies.
      <br/>
      By this operation, the molding (26) with high reproducibility and uniform thickness (s) can be achieved every time.
    </p>
    <p num="156">Upon completion of solidification of the filled resin (3), the die control servo motor (31) is reversely worked to separate the movable die (1b) from the stationary die (1a) as shown in FIG. 18 �5�. In this event, the molding (26) moves together with the movable die (1b).</p>
    <p num="157">Lastly, the operation moves to FIG. 18 �6�, when the die opening by the servo motor (40) is finished to project the gate cutting member (30) from the die cavity (2), the molding (26) is separated from the movable dies(l) and recovered.</p>
    <p num="158">Now, the second procedure of the die compression molding method according to this invention will be described in detail, but this is an improvement of the first procedure described in the fourth embodiment (A4), and the operation is described referring to FIG. 20.</p>
    <p num="159">
      As shown in FIG. 20 �1�, the movable die (1b) moves toward the stationary die (1a), and the core of the stationary die (1a) fits into the die cavity (2) of the movable die (1b), after that, the dies (1) is clamped.
      <br/>
      However, at this point, the toggle (T) is not completely extended and a wider clearance (t) than that at the time of gate cutting in FIG. 20 �3� is provided between cavity faces clearance between cavity faces is shown with (T).
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      Under this condition, injection filling takes place, as shown in FIG. 20 �2�, the weighed resin (3a) is injection-filled while the movable die (1b) moves in the die closing direction from (T) to (t).
      <br/>
      In this event, the skin layer tries to be generated on the resin (3) surface from the moment of the injection, but since the movable die (1b) is moving in the die closing direction, the resin (3) flows in the inner surface (5) of the die cavity (2) of the movable die (1b) at higher speed, and the formation or growth of the skin layer is suppressed, and consequently, the generation of super-fine air pools is suppressed, and the resin (3) faithfully adheres to the inner surface (5) where super-fine recessions and protrusions are formed.
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      Successively, gate cutting takes place (see FIG. 20 �3�) at such timing (P1) that the gate cutting member (30) operates when the pressure sensor (7) indicates a specified value and protrudes from the movable die (1b) under traveling to carry out gate cutting, and shuts up the die cavity (2) from the gate(1c).
      <br/>
      The clearance between cavity surfaces of the movable die (1b) and the stationary die (1a) at this moment is (t).
    </p>
    <p num="162">Because gate cutting is carried out every time at the same resin pressure, the resin (3) of the same amount is stably filled in the die cavity (2) every time (however, since the width (t) is greater than the width (s) of the molding (26), the filled volume becomes greater than the volume of the molding (26)).</p>
    <p num="163">Because (t) is greater than the final thickness (S) of the molding (26), the resin (3) is filled in the die cavity (2) more than the volume of the molding (26).</p>
    <p num="164">Gate cutting is carried out by operating the servo motor (40) with the movable die (1b) under traveling for die clamping to rotate the driven pulley (43), and allowing the gate cutting member (30) to advance from the movable die (1b) under traveling, and blocking the gate (1c) of the stationary die (1a) at the top end, and the movable die (1b) is completely isolated from the outside with the resin (3) additionally filled.</p>
    <p num="165">
      The above process (0 --&gt; P1) is controlled by the injection pressure sensor (15) or (0 --&gt; px) is controlled by the injection pressure sensor (15) and (px --&gt; P1) controlled by the pressure sensor (7).
      <br/>
      This injection filling process is carried out in such a manner to follow the setting valve by the injection servo motor (12).
      <br/>
      In this case because the movable die (1b) is traveling during the resin (3) injected to the die cavity (2) the filled resin (3) increases the relative speed to the movable die (1b) in cooperation with the motion of the movable die (1b), and quickly flows in contact with the inner surface (5) of the die cavity (2) while constantly exposing the new inside resin to the surface.
      <br/>
      As a result, filling is finished before thin resin film is formed on the filled resin (3), and this hinders generation of super-fine air pools that impairs transferability.
      <br/>
      Consequently, super-fine recessions and protrusions formed on the die cavity (2) of side can be transferred to the molding (26) with remarkably excellent transferability.
    </p>
    <p num="166">Then, the operation moves from the pressure-holding process �(P1) --&gt; (P3)� to the removing process, but the pressure-holding process and removing process are same as those of the first procedure, and the description will be omitted.</p>
    <p num="167">
      The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof.
      <br/>
      The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims than by the foregoing description and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein.

    <heading>EFFECTS</heading>
    <p num="168">Effect �1� of the Invention</p>
    <p num="169">As described above, according to this invention, because all the injections operations are feedback controlled by the servo motors, the timing, injection speed, pressurizing speed, pressurizing pressure, and all others can be freely controlled, and as a result, the increased cycle can be enabled.</p>
    <p num="170">In particular, servo motors are used for driving sources of projection and removal of moldings after completion of molding, there is no variation in repetitive response accuracy of operation, and the loss time of product removal timing by the product removal equipment can be 0.01 second or less, enabling the achievement of the ultimate high cycle of operation.</p>
    <p num="171">Because the gate cutting screw mechanism and the ejection screw mechanism are arranged in line and the screw shaft of the ejection screw mechanism is inserted in the screw shaft of the gate cutting screw mechanism, the gate cutting screw mechanism and the ejection screw mechanism with complicated mechanism can be smoothly arranged in one place.</p>
    <p num="172">Effect �2� of the Invention</p>
    <p num="173">According to this invention, because the above-mentioned controls are carried out still more accurate control is enabled by direct detection of injection pressure, weighed resin pressure, and die clamping force by pressure sensors.</p>
    <p num="174">In particular, as installing a pressure sensor between the movable die plate, the housing and directly detecting the die clamping force actually applied to the dies, which has been assumed to be difficult, has been first enabled with this invention.</p>
    <p num="175">Effect �3� of the Invention</p>
    <p num="176">According to this invention, because all the motions of injection operations are controlled by servo motors, the timing, injection speed, pressurizing speed, pressurizing pressure, and all other factors can be freely controlled, and as a result, increased cycle can be achieved.</p>
    <p num="177">Because the feedback control in the above-mentioned controls is carried out still more accurate control is enabled by direct detection of injection pressure, weighed resin pressure, and die clamping force by pressure sensors.</p>
    <p num="178">In particular, as installing a pressure sensor between the movable die plate and the housing, directly detecting the die clamping force actually applied to the dies, which has been assumed to be difficult, has been made easy with this invention.</p>
    <p num="179">Effect �4� of the Invention</p>
    <p num="180">Because in this invention, pressure sensors are installed to detect reaction force of the die by filled resin in the die cavity and to control at least either one of injection process for filling resin in the die cavity or the subsequent pressure holding process based on the output data, or to carry out control of the whole or part of the above-mentioned processes, the data concerning the filled resin can be directly obtained from the pressure sensor, and each process can be accurately controlled real-time.</p>
    <p num="181">In addition, the timing control can be real-time and accurate by controlling the operation timing of the gate cutting member based on the output data from the pressure sensor.</p>
    <p num="182">It is also possible to carry out the above-mentioned control real-time and accurately by controlling the resin injection speed from the injection mechanism portion into the dies based on the output data from the pressure sensor.</p>
    <p num="183">Effect �5� of the Invention</p>
    <p num="184">
      Because the movable die is continuously moved to the die closing direction from the initiation of injection and filling of weighed resin to initiation of die clamping, the filled resin cooperates with the motion of the movable die, and in particular, it comes in contact with the inner surface of the die cavity on the movable die side and flows, and the formation of the skin layer on the resin surface is impeded.
      <br/>
      Consequently, when super-fine recessions and protrusions are formed on the inner surface of the die cavity on the movable die side, the transferability is remarkably improved with this method.
    </p>
    <p num="185">In addition, because the filled resin of the volume greater than the volume of the molding is filled in the die cavity for compression molding and the resin is compressed to the volume of the molding, the molding becomes a high-density substrate, and is free of variations in density, contributing to the improvement of quality.</p>
