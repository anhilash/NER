    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a cyclopropylacetylene derivative, an intermediate for the synthesis of the cyclopropylacetylene derivative and a process for the preparation of the same.
      <br/>
      The cyclopropylacetylene derivative produced by the process of the present invention is useful as an intermediate in synthesis of a compound having a cyclopropane skeleton, for example, a benzoxazinone derivative (L-743726), which has anti-HIV activity (Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 36, page 8937 (1995)).
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Background</p>
    <p num="4">
      Recently, a large number of physiologically active substances having a cyclopropane skeleton have been discovered.
      <br/>
      Examples of known methods of producing cyclopropylacetylene, which is useful as an intermediate for the synthesis of these compounds, include: (I) a method in which 5-chloropentyne is reacted with n-butyllithium (Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 36, page 8937 (1995)); and (2) a method in which cyclopropyl methyl ketone is reacted with phosphorus pentachloride in carbon tetrachloride to produce 1,1-dichloro-1-cyclopropylethane, which is subsequently dehydrochlorinated by potassium tert-butoxide (Synthesis page 703 (1972)).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      However, in method (1), the yield of the raw starting material 5-chloropentyne in the reaction by which it is produced is as low as 57% (Journal of American Chemical Society, Vol. 67, page 484 (1945)), and method (2) gives many byproducts and, therefore, produces relatively low yields of the target product.
      <br/>
      Therefore, these methods are of limited industrial utility for the production of cyclopropylacetylene.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Another method by which cyclopropylacetylene is prepared requires the reaction of a propynol derivative with an alkyl (di)halide in liquid ammonia in the presence of lithium amide to give an acetylene derivative (Bulletin de la Societe Chimique de France, pages 201-204 (1968)).
      <br/>
      However, no method of transforming the obtained acetylene derivative to a compound having a cyclopropane skeleton is disclosed or suggested therein.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Another reaction which is known is the ethynylation of cyclopropylacetylene with acetone or cyclopropyl methyl ketone to give 2-methyl-4-cyclopropyl-3-butyn-2-ol or 2,4-dicyclopropyl-3-butyn-2-ol (Izvetiya Akademii Nark SSSR, Seriya Khimicheskaya, pages 1339-1344 (1978)), but no description for the reverse reaction is provided.</p>

    <p num="30">An embodiment of a process of synthesis of the present invention is in stepwise detail below.</p>
    <p num="31">Step 1:</p>
    <p num="32">In step 1 an acetylene derivative (II) or a cyclopropane derivative (III) is prepared by reacting a propynol derivative (I) with a propane derivative (VI) in the presence of a base</p>
    <p num="33">
      The leaving groups on the 1- and 3-positions of the propane derivative (VI) may be identical or different.
      <br/>
      The use of leaving groups having different leaving properties is preferable to avoid an excessive reaction.
      <br/>
      Suitable propane derivative (VI) having such properties include 1-bromo-3-chloropropane, 1-iodo-3-chloropropane, 1-iodo-3-bromopropane 1-methanesulfonyloxy-3-chloropropane, 1-p-toluenesulfonyloxy-3-chloropropane or the like.
      <br/>
      Among them 1-bromo-3-chloropropane is typically preferred because of its availability.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Suitable bases for the reaction include methyllithium, n-butyllithium, sec-butyllithium, tert-butyllithium and other alkyllithium compounds; phenyllithium and other aryllithium compounds: methylmagnesium chloride, ethylmagnesium bromide and other alkylmagnesium halides; lithium amide, sodium amide, potassium amide, lithium diethylamide, lithium diisopropylamide, lithium bistrimethylsilylamide, sodium bistrimethylsilylamide, potassium bistrimethylsilylamide, bromomagnesium diisopropylamide and other metal amides; lithium methoxide, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, sodium tert-butoxide, potassium tert-butoxide and other metal alkoxides; sodium hydride, potassium hydride and other alkali metal hydrides and others.
      <br/>
      When the amount of the base is 2 or more equivalents, preferably from 2 equivalents to 10 equivalents, relative to the propynol derivative (I), a cyclopropane derivative (III) is predominantly obtained.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when a reaction is conducted using less than 2 equivalents, preferably 1 or more equivalent and less than 2 equivalents of the base relative to the propynol derivative (I) at a reaction temperature of 0 (degree)  C. or lower, preferably -40 (degree)  C. or lower, an acetylene derivative (II) is predominantly obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The reaction may usually be conducted in any solvent as long as it does not adversely affect the reaction.
      <br/>
      Examples of the solvent include diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane and other ethers; pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, petroleum ether, benzene, toluene, xylene and other hydrocarbons; N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, hexamethylphosphoric triamide and other amides; dimethyl sulfoxide; ammonia; methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, butylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine and other amines; or mixtures of these solvents.
      <br/>
      The amount of the solvent employed is preferably within the range from 1 to 200 times as much as the weight of the propynol derivative (I).
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The reaction is carried out by reacting a base with a mixture of a propynol derivative (I) and a solvent under an inert gas atmosphere and subsequently adding a propane derivative (VI) to the resulting mixture.
      <br/>
      The reaction temperature preferably ranges from -100 (degree)  C. to 100 (degree)  C., more preferably from -50 (degree)  C. to 30 (degree)  C. for the purpose of preparing cyclopropane derivative (III).
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The prepared acetylene derivative (II) or cyclopropane derivative (III) can be isolated and purified in the usual manner for isolation and purification of organic compounds.
      <br/>
      By way of illustration, the reaction mixture is poured into water, aqueous ammonium chloride solution or the like, subjected to extraction with an organic solvent such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate or methylene chloride, and the extract is washed, if necessary, with an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, water, a saline solution or the like to remove any acidic substance and any water-soluble substance.
      <br/>
      The extract is then dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, anhydrous magnesium sulfate or the like and thereafter concentrated.
      <br/>
      The crude product obtained can be, as necessary, purified by distillation, chromatography, recrystallization or the like.
      <br/>
      However, the crude product can be employed without purification for the next reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="38">Step 2:</p>
    <p num="39">
      In step 2 a cyclopropane derivative (III) is prepared by reacting an acetylene derivative (II) with a base.
      <br/>
      Suitable bases include methyllithium, n-butyllithium, sec-butyllithium, tert-butyllithium and other alkyllithium compounds; phenyllithium and other aryllithium compounds; methylmagnesium chloride, ethylmagnesium bromide and other alkylmagnesium halides; lithium amide, sodium amide, potassium amide, lithium diethylamide, lithium diisopropylamide, lithium bistrimethylsilylamide, sodium bistrimethylsilylamide, potassium bistrimethylsilylamide, bromomagnesium diisopropylamide and other metal amides; lithium methoxide, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, sodium tert-butoxide, potassium tert-butoxide and other metal alkoxides; sodium hydride, potassium hydride and other alkali metal hydrides.
      <br/>
      The base is preferably used in an amount ranging from 1 equivalent to 3 equivalents relative to acetylene derivative (II).
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Usually, a reaction may be conducted in any solvent as long as it has no adverse affect on the reaction.
      <br/>
      Suitable solvents include diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane and other ethers; pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, petroleum ether, benzene, toluene, xylene and other hydrocarbons; N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, hexamethylphosphoric triamide and other amides; dimethyl sulfoxide; ammonia; methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, butylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine and other amines; or mixtures of these solvents.

      The reaction temperature preferably ranges from -100 (degree)  C. to 100 (degree)  C., more preferably -50 (degree)  C. to 30 (degree)  C. .

      Thus cyclopropane derivative (III) prepared can be isolated and purified by the usual techniques employed for the isolation and purification of organic compounds.

      By way of example, the reaction mixture is poured into water, aqueous ammonium chloride solution or the like, and then extracted with an organic solvent such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, methylene chloride or the like.

      The extract obtained is washed, if necessary, with an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, water, a saline solution or the like to remove any acidic substance and any water-soluble substance.

      The crude product prepared can be, as necessary, purified by distillation, chromatography, recrystallization or the like.

    <p num="43">Step 3:</p>
    <p num="44">In step 3 a cyclopropylpropynol derivative (IV) is prepared by removing the protecting group for the hydroxyl group of a cyclopropane derivative (III)</p>
    <p num="45">
      When the protecting group for the hydroxyl group is a tri-substituted silyl group, cyclopropylpropynol derivative (IV) can be prepared by any commonly desilylation method.

      Such methods include a method of reacting cyclopropane derivative (III) with tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran, a method of reacting cyclopropane derivative (III) with hydrofluoric acid in water, a method of reacting cyclopropane derivative (III) with acetic acid in water or in a solvent mixture of tetrahydrofuran and water, and a method of reacting cyclopropane derivative (III) with potassium carbonate in methanol.
      <br/>
      When the protecting group for a hydroxyl group is an acetal group, a cyclopropylpropynol derivative (IV) can be prepared by a commonly employed deacetalation method, including for example a method of reacting cyclopropane derivative (III) with an acid in an alcoholic solvent.

      The reaction described above of protecting the hydroxyl group of the propynol compound can be conducted in the following manner: For example, the hydroxyl group can be protected by a tri-substituted silyl group by reacting a tri-substituted silyl halide such as trimethylchlorosilane, tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane or tert-butyldiphenylchlorosilane with the propynol compound in the presence of an organic base such as triethylamine or pyridine.
      <br/>
