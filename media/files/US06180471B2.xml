      <br/>
      A method of fabricating a high voltage semiconductor device.
      <br/>
      A semiconductor substrate doped with a first type dopant and comprising a gate is provided.
      <br/>
      A cap oxide layer is formed on the gate optionally.
      <br/>
      A first ion implantation with a light second type dopant at a wide angle is performed to form a lightly doped region.
      <br/>
      A spacer is formed on a side wall of the gate.
      <br/>
      A second ion implantation with a heavy second type dopant is performed, so that a heavily doped region is formed within the lightly doped region.

    <p num="5">
      The modern integrated circuit techniques is developed towards the direction of narrower line width and shorter channel length of a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS).
      <br/>
      By applying a constant voltage, the lateral electric field in the channel is increased as reducing the channel length.
      <br/>
      Thus, the electron in the channel is accelerated, and the energy of the electron is increased, especially in the vicinity between the channel and the source/drain region.
      <br/>
      The energy of the electron is higher than the energy of an electron under thermal equilibrium.
      <br/>
      Some of the electron in the channel tunnels through the oxide layer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the produced hole flows into the substrate, and a leakage current occurs.

    <p num="6">
      To reduce the hot electron effect, a lightly doping process is performed at the vicinity between the source/drain region and the channel before the formation of a heavily doped source/drain region.
      <br/>
      An LDD structure is formed, and the leakage current is prevented.

      <br/>
      After patterning, a gate 4 is formed.
      <br/>
      The formation of the oxide layer 2 is to moderate the scattering of subsequent implanted ions due to collision with the silicon atoms of the substrate in an amorphous form.
      <br/>
      The diffusion of ions into the P-type semiconductor substrate is thus avoided.

      The implantation ions are, for example, phosphorous ions (P31) having a concentration of 1 * 1013 /cm2 to 1 * 1014 /cm2 with an energy between 30 KeV to 100 KeV.

      The implantation ions are, for example, phosphorous or arsenic ions with a concentration of about 1 * 1014 /cm2 to 1 * 1015 /cm2 at an energy about 100 KeV to 200 KeV.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="18">
      In the invention, a cap oxide layer is formed on the gate before performing ion implantation for forming a lightly doped region.
      <br/>
      Thus, the gate is not further doped and damaged by the implanted ions.
      <br/>
      A lightly doped region is formed by a first ion implantation with a wide angle.
      <br/>
      Thus, the implanted ions can reach the region under the gate without performing thermal drive-in process.
      <br/>
      The cross diffusion during thermal drive-in is therefore prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Referring to FIG. 2A, on a P-type semiconductor 100, a gate oxide layer 102 is formed, for example, by thermal oxidation.
      <br/>
      A conductive layer such as a poly-silicon layer 104 is formed on the gate oxide layer 102, for example, by chemical vapour deposition (CVD).
      <br/>
      An oxide layer 106 is formed on the conductive layer 104.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Referring FIG. 2B, the gate oxide layer 102, the conductive layer 104, and the oxide layer 106 are patterned to form a gate formed of the gate oxide layer 102a and the conductive layer 104a, with a cap oxide layer 106a.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Referring to FIG. 2C, lightly doped regions 108, 110, that is, lightly dope source/drain regions, are formed by ion implantation with a wide angle, for example, 7 (degree)  to 45 (degree) . The implanted ions, for example, phosphorous ions (p31), have a concentration of about 1 * 1013 /cm2 to 1 * 1014 /cm2 with an energy about 150 KeV to 500 KeV.
      <br/>
      The ions reach the region under the gate by a wide angle implantation without further thermal drive-in process.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the cross diffusion of ions between the gate and the lightly doped region 108, 110 is prevented.
      <br/>
      In addition, the formation of the cap oxide layer 106a protects the gate from being damaged during ion implantation.
      <br/>
      Due to the very high energy, the implanted depth of the ions is about 0.2  MU m to 0.6  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Referring to FIG. 2D, a silicon oxide layer is formed, for example, by CVD and patterned to form a spacer on a side wall 112 of the gate.
      <br/>
      In addition to isolate two lightly doped region 108 and 110, the formation of spacer is used as a mask for the subsequent heavily doping process to form a heavily dope region, that is, a heavily doped source/drain region.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Referring to FIG. 2E, heavily doped regions 108a, 110a, that is, heavily dope source/drain regions, are formed within the lightly doped regions by ion implantation with an angle, for example, 0 (degree)  to 7 (degree) . The implanted ions, for example, phosphorous ions (P31) or arsenic ions, have a concentration of about 1 * 1014 /cm2 to 1 * 1015 /cm2 with an energy about 100 KeV to 200 KeV.
      <br/>
      An LDD structure is thus formed.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In the invention, a wide angle ion implantation is performed instead of a conventional ion implantation with a thermal drive-in.
      <br/>
      The cross diffusion of ions between the gate and the doped region caused by thermal drive-in process is prevented.
      <br/>
      In addition, the wide angle ion implantation is easily operated, that is, the doped region and the depth of implantation are easily control.
      <br/>
      The devices can be fabricated uniformly.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the formation of a cap oxide protects the gate from being damaged during ion implantation.
      <br/>
      The characteristics of the devices, for example, the threshold voltage is not degraded.
      <br/>
      The reliability of the device is hence enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="25">With the above LDD structure, a high voltage semiconductor device is fabricated with a higher reliability and an improved characteristic.</p>
