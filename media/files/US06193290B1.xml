      <br/>
      A device for carrying a rail car coupling knuckle.
      <br/>
      The device includes an open end, a closed end and a retaining pin for securing the open and closed ends together.
      <br/>
      The open end includes a pair of substantially parallel tubes that are fixedly attached to a metal plate.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the tubes have substantially equal inner diameters.
      <br/>
      One of the tubes has a flange near one end and an opening near the other end.
      <br/>
      The closed end includes a pipe and a tube that are fixedly attached to a metal plate.
      <br/>
      Preferably the pipe and the tube of the closed end is substantially parallel to each other so as to be in alignment with the tubes of the open end.
      <br/>
      The outer diameter of the pipe of the closed end is slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the tube of the open end.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the outer diameter of the other tube of the open end is slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the tube of the closed end.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the pipe of the closed end can be inserted into the tube of the open end, and the tube of the open end can be inserted inside the tube of the closed end while one of the tubes supports the rail car coupling knuckle.
      <br/>
      The retaining pin can be inserted into openings in the tubes to hold the open and closed ends together while carrying the rail car coupling knuckle.

    <heading>CROSS-NOTING TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
    <p num="1">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/071,268 filed Jan. 13, 1998.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates in general to a carrying device, and in particular, to a device that facilitates the carrying of a rail car coupling knuckle.</p>
    <p num="3">
      The device which detachably connects one rail car to another is called a rail car coupling knuckle.
      <br/>
      Rail car coupling knuckles have a tendency to become damaged or broken while a train is in transit or in the process of changing cars and/or adding cars to the train.
      <br/>
      Thus, rail car coupling knuckles are replaced often by railroad personnel.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      As all railroad personnel know, it is difficult and dangerous to carry a rail car coupling knuckle because rail car coupling knuckles are extremely heavy and difficult to grasp when carrying from the place of storage to the repair point.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is desirable to provide a rail car coupling knuckle carrying device to more safely carry the rail car coupling knuckle and decrease the number of injuries to railroad personnel.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      This invention relates to a device for carrying a rail car coupling knuckle.
      <br/>
      The rail car coupling knuckle carrying device comprises an open end, a closed end, and a retaining pin for holding the open end and closed end together.
      <br/>
      The open end includes a plate and first and second tubes fixedly attached to the plate and are preferably substantially parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      One of the first and second tubes is capable of receiving the rail car coupling knuckle.
      <br/>
      The closed end includes a plate and a post and a third tube.
      <br/>
      The post and the third tube are fixedly attached to the plate and are preferably substantially parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      The post of the closed end is capable of being received in one of the first and second tubes of the open end, and the third tube of the closed end is capable of being received in the other one of the first and second tubes of the open end.
      <br/>
      The retaining pin, which can be generally L-shaped or generally U-shaped is inserted through openings in the open and closed ends to securely hold them together.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Various objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment, when read in light of the accompanying drawings.</p>

      To use the rail car coupling knuckle carrying device 10, the retaining pin 18 or 18' is first removed from the openings 30 and 40.
      <br/>
      Of course, if the open and closed ends 14 and 16 are already separated, this step is not necessary.
      <br/>
      Next, the open and closed ends 14 and 16 are separated from each other by pulling both ends apart such that the pipe 22 is no longer received in the tube 34 and the tube 36 is no longer received in the tube 26.
      <br/>
      Then, the tube 36 is inserted through the rail car coupling knuckle 12, as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Next, the pipe 22 is inserted into the tube 34 of the open end 16, and the tube 36 is inserted into the tube 26 of the closed end 14 such that the openings 30 and 40 are aligned.
      <br/>
      Then, the retaining pin 18, 18' is inserted into the openings 30 and 40 to securely hold the closed and open ends 14 and 16 together.
      <br/>
      The railroad personnel can then easily carry the rail car coupling knuckle 12 by grasping the tube 34 or by using a carrying strap (not shown) attached to the openings 21 and 33.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the flanges 28 and 38 on the closed and open ends 14 and 16, respectively, act as stops to prevent the rail car coupling knuckle 12 from sliding on the tube 36 while it is being carried by the railroad personnel.
      <br/>
      Removal of the rail car coupling knuckle 12 can be achieved by performing the reverse procedure.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In the preferred embodiment, the post 22 and the tube 26 of the closed end 14 and substantially parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      In addition, the tubes 34 and 36 of the open end 16 are also substantially parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the post 22 is substantially aligned with the tube 34, and the tube 26 is substantially aligned with the tube 36.
      <br/>
      However, it should be appreciated that the invention can be practiced with any arrangement in which the post 22 and the tube 26 of the closed end 14 are in substantial alignment with the tube 34 and the tube 36 of the open end 16.
