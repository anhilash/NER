    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to an animal feeder and more particularly to a feeder having a drum feed transport device which is operated by an animal whereby to transfer feed from a hopper to a feed trough and further wherein the feed collecting and discharge compartment is formed as a separate removable unit.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Various animal feeders are known wherein feed is placed in a hopper and transferred to a feed trough below the hopper by an animal actuating a bar or other mechanism which is actuatable by the nose or the head of the animal.
      <br/>
      As the animal strikes or displaces the bar or other similar mechanism, in a certain direction, feed is released into the feed trough.
      <br/>
      Examples of such feeders are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,246,678 and 5,275,130.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      A disadvantage of prior art animal feeders of the above-reference type is that they comprise complex mechanisms which often encounter mechanical break down or get jammed by the feed, rendering the feeder, or sections thereof, inoperative.
      <br/>
      Their mechanisms are also difficult to repair and most of these repairs must be done on site.
      <br/>
      Also, many of these mechanisms are provided with adjustable slot openings through which feed is released.
      <br/>
      Depending on the size of the feed grains it is necessary to adjust these slots.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if the type of feed is changed, the feeder needs to be re-adjusted.
      <br/>
      This procedure disturbs the animals feeding at regular time intervals.
      <br/>
      Prior art feeders are also difficult to clean and not perfectly sanitary.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Another disadvantage of the prior art feeders is that the feed release mechanism which is actuated by the animals also requires adjustment depending on the size of the animals feeding.
      <br/>
      For example, a forty pound pig will hit the feed release bars with more power than will do a small pig of half that size.
      <br/>
      Also, smaller pigs cannot make long actuating head strokes.
      <br/>
      Still further, farm feed is now being provided in very fine dry particle size and is very slick and can easily flow out of the hopper trough small openings and accordingly can trickle continuously in the feed trough through the discharge slot, if not perfectly closed.
      <br/>
      The discharge mechanisms also often jam by the accumulation of feed or larger feed particles.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">It is therefore a feature of the present invention to provide an animal feeder which substantially overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of the prior art.</p>
    <p num="6">Another feature of the present invention is to provide an animal feeder wherein feed is discharged from a feed hopper to a feed trough through a drum having feed transport cavities capable of accepting feed having grains of different sizes.</p>
    <p num="7">Another feature of the present invention is to provide an animal feeder provided with feed discharge drums capable of discharging feed from a feed hopper to a feed trough and constructed such as to prevent feed from seeping from the hopper to the trough without actuating the discharge drum to predetermined positions.</p>
    <p num="8">Another feature of the present invention is to provide an animal feeder having a feed hopper provided with a removable feed collecting and discharge compartment making it easy to clean the feeder and to repair the feed collecting and discharge compartment, if necessary.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="13">
      Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to FIGS. 1 and 2, there is shown the animal feeder 10 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The feeder is comprised of a feed hopper 11 which is provided with opposed side walls 11' and inclined guide walls 12 for directing feed 13 contained within the hopper towards a feed collecting compartment 14 disposed in a lower section of the feed hopper.
      <br/>
      The top end 11" may be open or closed with a lid.
      <br/>
      The feed collecting compartment is provided with one or more, herein two, spaced-apart feed discharge drums 15 whereby to discharge the feed 13 from the hopper 11 into a feed trough 16 located spaced below the feed collecting compartment 14.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      As shown in FIG. 3, the feed collecting compartment is a removable feed collecting and discharge compartment 14 which is seatingly secured in the lower section 17 of the hopper 11.
      <br/>
      The feed collecting and discharge compartment 14 is provided with vertically extending handles 18 secured to a vertically extending frame 19 projecting upwardly to a top end 20 of the feed hopper, as shown in FIG. 2, whereby to position and remove the compartment 14 from the lower section 17 of the hopper.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The removable feed collecting and discharge compartment 14 has opposed spaced-apart parallel side walls 21, end walls 21' and the discharge drums 15 are secured between the spaced apart side walls on respective central support axles 22.
      <br/>
      An outwardly angled support wall 23 projects from a respective opposed straight top edge 24 of the side walls 21 for seating support engagement on opposed ones of the inclined guide walls 12 of the hopper 11, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      As better seen in FIG. 8, inclined lower guide walls 25 are secured between the spaced-apart side walls 21 and are provided with a straight horizontal lower wall section 26 which terminates in a straight edge 38 which is in frictional contact across the circumferential side wall 27 of the drums 15.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Referring now to FIGS. 3 to 7, there will be described the construction of the drums 15 and their position in the discharge compartment 14.
      <br/>
      As hereinshown, the drums are circular drums having a flat circumferential side wall 27 and opposed flange walls 28 which project or protrude radially above the circumferential side wall 27 along opposed side end edges thereof.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 3, 6 and 7, the removable feed collecting and discharge compartment 14 is also provided with outwardly angled support walls 23 formed in end walls 30 as illustrated in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Such end walls 30 have arcuate cut-outs 29 in their lower edge which are disposed in frictional contact on the portion of the circumferential side wall 27 of the drums, which section extends into the feed collecting compartment.
      <br/>
      These end walls 30 are disposed inside a respective one of the flanges 28 as is illustrated in FIG. 7 to create a barrier to prevent feed from seeping about the discharge drums 15.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      As can be seen from FIGS. 4 and 5, each of the drums 15 are provided with one or more, herein two, opposed feed transport cavities 31.
      <br/>
      These cavities are located above a horizontal diametrical axis 32 of the drum when at its neutral position.
      <br/>
      The drums as hereinshown are solid blocks of Teflon with the cavities 31 being machined therein.
      <br/>
      Drum actuatable means in the form of a weighted bar element 32 extends from the circumferential side wall 27 of the drum and is secured thereto along a diametrical axis which is transverse to the transverse axis 32.
      <br/>
      The bar element 32 depends from the drum above the feed trough 16.
      <br/>
      The purpose of this actuatable bar element is to provide a means for the animal, such as a pig 35, as shown in FIG. 2, to actuate or push the bar with its nose or head sideways whereby to cause the drum to rotate on its axle 32 to displace the discharge cavities 31 to transport feed, in a manner as will be described later.
      <br/>
      This weighted bar 32 further provides a positioning means to automatically position the drum at a non-discharge neutral position, as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      In other words, when the bar is pivoted to one side it will automatically come back to rest on its vertical axis 33 wherein the discharge cavities 31 are positioned, as shown in FIG. 4, in a non-feed transport position and accumulate feed therein form the hopper.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The feed discharge cavities 31 also have a downwardly inclined lower wall 37 to facilitate the discharge of feed as shown in FIG. 10. A feed arresting bar 9 is also secured across the front open end of each cavity 31 midway of the height of the end wall 8 to obstruct the free flow of feed from the hopper to the feed trough 16 when the drum is displaced towards the discharger position, 30 as illustrated by FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      The bar 9 is constructed of stainless steel and has a diameter of 1/4 inch.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Stopper means in the form of arresting pins 34 also project from the circumferential side wall 27 of the drum and disposed at predetermined locations on opposed sides of the weighted bar 36 and below the transverse axis 32 whereby to limit the arcuate displacement of the drum.
      <br/>
      When rotated, these bars will hit the lower wall section 37 of the inclined walls 25 preventing further rotation of the drum by the displacement of the weighted bar 36.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Referring to FIGS. 8 to 10 there is shown the operation of the discharge drums 15.
      <br/>
      At FIG. 8, the drum is at a neutral position where the cavities accumulate feed.
      <br/>
      At FIG. 9, the utility of the feed arresting bar 9 is illustrated showing its obstruction of the feed in the hopper to prevent a free discharge flow towards the feed trough 16.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 10 it can be seen that the inclined lower wall 37 of the cavities 31 facilitates complete discharge of the feed 13.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 9, the rod 9 extends to the circumferential side wall 27 of the drum and in close relationship with the free straight edge 36 of the lower wall section 26 of the inclined wall 25 to arrest or impede the free flow of feed 13 form the discharge compartment 14 to the feed trough 16 via the cavity 31 during the displacement of the drum to its discharge position as shown in FIG. 10. Once rotated to predetermined positions, the feed transport cavity 31 is moved below the lower wall section 26 of the lower guide wall 25 and the feed 13 is discharged into the feed trough 16, as shown in FIG. 10.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      As shown in FIG. 2, the lower section 17 of the feed hopper 11 is provided with an elongated vertical opening 40 through which feed is released.
      <br/>
      The inclined guide walls 12 slope towards this vertical opening to direct feed into the feed collecting compartment 14.
      <br/>
      In order to strengthen the lower section 17 of the feed hopper and to provide clearance for the hardware disposed outside the side walls 21 of the removable feed collecting and discharge compartment 14, and to further provide ease of installation of the compartment 14, the side walls of the vertical opening 40 are outwardly angled such as shown at 41.
    </p>
    <p num="22">As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the animal feeder 10 of the present invention is also provided with a water feed conduit 50 provided with an actuatable valve 51 at a lower end thereof which is actuatable by the feeding animal whereby water can be discharged in the feed trough 16 when required.</p>
    <p num="23">
      Although the feed collecting and discharge compartment 14 is hereinshown as a removable compartment it is conceivable that this compartment can be fixed to the side walls of the hopper and form an integral part thereof.
      <br/>
      However, this would make the hopper difficult to clean and may not provide the quality of sanitation that the design as hereinshown obtains.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, although the animal feeder as hereinshown utilizes two drums to provide four feed stations 53, two on each side of the hopper housing 11, many more of these drums can be provided in series in a large hopper with several more feeding stations.
      <br/>
      The hopper, as well as the removable feed collecting and discharge compartment, are constructed of stainless steel material for sanitation purpose.
