    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to the field of inflator devices for inflating airbag occupant restraints mainly for the protection of occupants of automobiles and trucks although it also is applicable to the protection of occupants of other vehicles and for inflating other inflatable objects.
      <br/>
      In particular, by means of die present invention, a more efficient utilization of the energy in a propellant is attained resulting in the need for a lower amount of propellant than in currently existing inflators, and thus a smaller inflator, to inflate a given size inflatable object.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished in part through a more efficient aspirating nozzle design and an improved geometry of a gas generator that houses the propellant.
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention also relates to an airbag system for use in vehicles having multiple airbags where the possibility exists that more than two airbags will be deployed in a given accident resulting in excessive pressure within the passenger compartment of the vehicle, and which optionally utilize the inflator devices described above.</p>
    <p num="4">The present invention also relates to airbag systems including inflator devices using wider classes of propellants that produce gases that are toxic to humans if breathed for an extended time period.</p>
    <p num="5">The present invention additionally relates to an efficient airbag module whereby much of the electronics which are part of the airbag system are associated with the module including occupant sensing components, the backup power supply and diagnostic circuitry.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      Most airbag modules in use today are large, heavy, expensive, and inefficient.
      <br/>
      As a result, airbags are now primarily only used for protecting the passenger and driver in a frontal impact, although at least three automobile manufacturers currently offer a small airbag providing limited protection in side impacts.
      <br/>
      The main advantage of airbags over other energy absorbing structures is that they utilize the space between the occupant and vehicle interior surfaces to absorb the kinetic energy of the occupant during a crash, cushioning the impending impact of the occupant with the vehicle interior surfaces.
      <br/>
      Airbags have been so successful in frontal impacts that it is only a matter of time before they are effectively used for side impact protection, protection for rear seat occupants and in place of current knee bolsters.
      <br/>
      Substantial improvements, however, must be made in airbags before they assume many of these additional tasks
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A good place to start describing the problems with current airbags is with a calculation of the amount of energy used in a typical airbag inflator and how much energy is required to inflate an airbag.
      <br/>
      By one analysis, the chemical propellant in a typical driver's side inflator contains approximately 50,000 foot pounds (68,000 joules) of energy.
      <br/>
      A calculation made to determine the energy required to inflate a driver's side airbag yields an estimate of about 500 foot pounds (680 joules).
      <br/>
      A comparison of these numbers shows that approximately 99% of the energy in a chemical propellant is lost, that is, generated but not needed for inflation of the airbag.
      <br/>
      One reason for this is that there is a mismatch between the output of a burning propellant and the inflation requirements of an airbag.
      <br/>
      In engineering this is known as an impedance mismatch.
      <br/>
      Stated simply, propellants naturally produce gases having high temperatures and high pressures and low gas flow rates.
      <br/>
      Airbags, on the other hand, need gases with low temperatures and low pressures and high gas flow rates.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In view of this impedance mismatch, inflators are, in theory at least, many times larger then they would have to be if the energy of the propellant contained within the inflator were efficiently utilized.
      <br/>
      Some attempts to partially solve this problem have resulted in a so-called "hybrid" inflator where a stored pressurized gas is heated by a propellant to inflate the airbag.
      <br/>
      Such systems are considerably more energy efficient, however, they also require a container of high pressure gas and means for monitoring the pressure in that container.
      <br/>
      Other systems have attempted to use aspiration techniques, but because of the geometry constraints of current car inflator designs and mounting locations, and for other reasons, currently used aspiration systems are only able to draw up to about 30% of the gas needed to inflate an airbag from the passenger compartment.
      <br/>
      Theoretical studies have shown that as much as 90% or more of the gas could be obtained in this manner.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Furthermore, since inflators are large and inefficient, severe restrictions have been placed on the type of propellants that can be used since the combustion products of the propellant must be breathable by automobile occupants.
      <br/>
      It is of little value to save an occupant from death in an automobile accident only to suffocate him from an excessive amount of carbon dioxide in the air within the passenger compartment after the accident.
      <br/>
      If inflators operated more efficiently, then alternate, more efficient but slightly toxic propellants could be used.
      <br/>
      Also, current inflators are made from propellants, namely sodium azide, which are not totally consumed.
      <br/>
      Only about 40% of the mass of sodium azide propellants currently being used, for example, enters the airbag as gas.
      <br/>
      This residual mass is very hot and requires the inflator to be mounted away from combustible materials further adding to the mass and size of the airbag system and restricts the materials that can be used for the inflator.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      It is a persistent problem in the art that many people are being seriously injured or even killed today by the airbag itself.
      <br/>
      This generally happens when an occupant is out-of-position and against an airbag module when the airbag deploys.
      <br/>
      In order to open the module cover, sometimes called the deployment door, substantial pressure must first build up in the airbag before enough force is generated to burst open the cover.
      <br/>
      This pressure is even greater if the occupant is in a position that prevents the door from opening.
      <br/>
      As a result, work is underway to substantially reduce the amount of energy required to open the deployment doors and devices have been developed which pop off the deployment door or else cut the deployment door material using pyrotechnics, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      One reason that this is such a significant problem is that the airbag module itself is quite large and, in particular, the airbags are made out of thick, heavy material and packaged in a poor, folded geometry.
      <br/>
      The airbag, for example, which protects the passenger is housed in a module which is typically about one third as long as the deployed airbag.
      <br/>
      All of this heavy airbag material must be rolled and folded inside this comparatively small module, thus requiring substantial energy to unfold during deployment.
      <br/>
      This situation could be substantially improved if the airbag module were to have an alternate geometry and if the airbag material were substantially lighter and thinner and, therefore, less massive and folded mainly parallel to the inflator.
      <br/>
      Even the time to deploy the airbag is substantially affected by the mass of the airbag material and the need to unfold an airbag with a complicated folding pattern.
      <br/>
      Parallel folding, as used herein, means that the airbag material is folded with the fold lines substantially parallel to the axis of the inflator without being folded over lengthwise as is now done with conventional airbag folding patterns.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Devices are under development that will monitor the position of the occupant and prevent the airbag from deploying if the occupant is dangerously close to the module where lie or she can be seriously injured by the deployment.
      <br/>
      Some systems will also prevent deployment if the seat in connection with which the airbag operates is unoccupied.
      <br/>
      An alternate approach is to move the deployment doors to a location away from normal occupant positions.
      <br/>
      One such location is the ceiling of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      One problem with ceiling mounted airbags is that the distance required for the airbag to travel, in some cases, is longer and therefore a larger airbag is needed with greater deployment time.

      With the use of light airbag materials, such as thin plastic film, as disclosed in the above referenced patent applications Ser.
      <br/>
      Nos. 08/247,763 and 08/539,676, and the use of more efficient inflators, both of these problems can be solved especially for the front and rear seat passengers.
      <br/>
      The driver poses a different problem since it would be difficult to position a ceiling mounted airbag module where the airbag would always be projected properly between the occupant and the steering wheel.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      This problem for the driver's airbag system is not the concept of mounting the airbag on the ceiling, but the design of the steering wheel and steering column.
      <br/>
      These designs come from the time when the only way of steering an automobile was through mechanical linkages.
      <br/>
      The majority of vehicles manufactured today have power assisted steering systems and, in fact, most drivers would have difficulty steering a car today if the power steering failed.
      <br/>
      If servo power steering were used, the need for a mechanical linkage between a steering wheel, or other such device, and the power steering system would no longer be necessary.
      <br/>
      Servo power steering for the purposes here will mean those cases where the linkage between the manually operated steering device, which regardless of what that device is, will herein be called a steering wheel, is done with a servo system either electrically or hydraulically and the system does not have an operative mechanical connection between the steering wheel and the steering mechanism which moves the wheels.
    </p>
    <p num="14">The problem of educating the general population, which has become secure in the feeling of a steering wheel and steering column, might be insurmountable if it were not for the substantial safety advantage resulting from substituting servo power steering for conventional steering systems and using a non-steering wheel mounted airbag module for the driver.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The steering wheel and steering column are among the most dangerous parts of the vehicle to the occupant.
      <br/>
      Small people, for example, who are wearing seatbelts can still be seriously injured or killed in accidents as their faces slam into the steering wheel hubs.
      <br/>
      The problem of properly positioning an airbag, when the comfort and convenience features of telescoping and tilting steering columns are considered, results in substantial safety compromises.
      <br/>
      Deployment induced injuries which result when a small person is close to the steering wheel when the airbag deploys have already caused several deaths and numerous serious injuries.
      <br/>
      Future vehicles, therefore, for safety reasons should be constructed without the massive steering wheel and steering column and substitute therefor a servo steering assembly.
      <br/>
      With this modification, a ceiling mounted airbag module, such as discussed herein, becomes feasible for the driver as well as the other seating positions in the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The front seat of the vehicle today has an airbag for the passenger and another for the driver.
      <br/>
      In some accidents, an occupant, and particularly a center seated occupant, can pass between the two airbags and not receive the full protection from either one.
      <br/>
      If a ceiling mounted airbag system were used, a single airbag could be deployed to cover the entire front seat greatly simplifying the airbag system design.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      One method of partially solving many of these problems is to use an efficient aspirated airbag system.
      <br/>
      There have been numerous patents granted on designs for airbag systems using aspirated inflators.
      <br/>
      In these patents as well as in the discussion herein the term "pumping ratio" is used.
      <br/>
      The pumping ratio as used in the art is defined as the ratio of the mass of gas aspirated from the environment, either from inside or outside of the vehicle, to the mass of gas generated by burning the propellant.
      <br/>
      A brief description of several pertinent patents, all of which are included herein by reference, follows:
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      U.S. Pat. No. 2,052,869 to Coanda illustrates the manner in which a fluid jet is caused to change direction, although no mention is made of its use in airbags.
      <br/>
      This principle, the "Coanda effect", is used in some implementations of the instant invention as well as in U.S. Pat. No. 3,909,037 to Stewart discussed below.
      <br/>
      It's primary contribution is that when used in inflator designs, it permits a reduction in the length of the nozzle required to efficiently aspirate air into the airbag.
      <br/>
      No disclosure is made of a pumping ratio in this system and in fact it is not an object of Coanda to aspirate fluid.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,204,862 to Hadeler also predates the invention of vehicular airbags but is nonetheless a good example of the use of aspiration to inflate an inflatable structure.
      <br/>
      In this device, an inflating gas is injected into an annular converging-diverging nozzle and some space efficiency is obtained by locating the nozzle so that the flow is parallel to the wall of the inflatable structure.
      <br/>
      No mention is made of a pumping ratio of this device and furthermore, this device is circular.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,632,133 to Hass provides a good example of a nozzle in a circular module with a high pumping ratio in an early construction of an airbag.
      <br/>
      Although analysis indicates that pumping ratios of 4:1 or 5:1 would be difficult to achieve with this design as illustrated, nevertheless, this reference illustrates the size and rough shape of an aspirating system which is required to obtain high pumping ratios using the prior art designs.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,909,037 to Stewart provides a good example of the application of the Coanda effect to airbag aspirating inflators.
      <br/>
      Stewart, nevertheless, still discards most of the energy in the propellant which is absorbed as heat in the inflator mechanism.
      <br/>
      Most propellants considered for airbag applications burn at pressures in excess of about 1000 psig.
      <br/>
      Stewart discloses that the maximum efficiency corresponding to a 5:1 pumping ratio occurs at inflator gas pressures of about 5 to about 45 psig.
      <br/>
      In order to reduce the pressure, Stewart utilizes a complicated filtering system similar to that used in conventional inflators.
      <br/>
      Stewart requires the use of valves to close off the aspiration ports when the system is not aspirating.
      <br/>
      Through the use of the Coanda effect, Stewart alludes to a substantial reduction in the size of the aspiration system, compared to Hass for example.
      <br/>
      Also, Stewart shows only a simple converging nozzle through which the burning propellant is passed.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,833,996 to Hayashi et al. describes a gas generating apparatus for inflating an airbag which is circular and allegedly provides an instantaneous pumping ratio of up to 7:1 although analysis shows that this is unlikely in the illustrated geometry.
      <br/>
      The average pumping ratio is specified to be up to 4:1.
      <br/>
      This invention is designed for the driver side of the vehicle where unrestricted access to the aspirating port might be difficult to achieve when mounted on a steering wheel.
      <br/>
      The propellant of choice in Hayashi et al. is sodium azide which requires extensive filtering to remove particulates.
      <br/>
      No attempt has been made in this design to optimize the nozzle geometry to make use of a converging-diverging nozzle design, for example.
      <br/>
      Also, the inflator has a roughly conventional driver side shape.
      <br/>
      It is also interesting to note that no mention is made of valves to close off or restrict flow through the aspiration port during deflation.
      <br/>
      Since most aspiration designs having even substantially smaller pumping ratios provide for such valves, the elimination of these valves would be a significant advance in the art.
      <br/>
      Analysis shows, however, that the opening needed for the claimed aspiration ratios would in general be far too large for it also to be used for exhausting the airbag during a crash.
      <br/>
      Since this is not discussed, it should be assumed that valves are required but not illustrated in the figures.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,264 to Cuevas describes an aspirating/venting airbag module assembly which includes a circular gas generator and contemplates the use of conventional sodium azide propellants or equivalent.
      <br/>
      The aspiration or pumping ratio of this inflator is approximately 0.2:1, substantially below that of Hayashi et al., but more in line with aspiration systems in common use today.
      <br/>
      This design also does not require use of aspiration valves which is more reasonable for this case, but still unlikely, since the aspiration port area is much smaller.
      <br/>
      Again, no attempt has been made to optimize the nozzle design as is evident by the short nozzle length and the low pumping ratio.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,909,549 to Poole et al. describes a process for inflating an airbag with an aspiration system but does not discuss the aspiration design or mechanism and merely asserts that a ratio as high as 4:1 is possible but assumes that 2.5:1 is available.
      <br/>
      This patent is significant in that it discloses the idea that if such high pumping ratios are obtainable (i.e., 2.5:1 compared with 0.2:1 for inflators in use), then certain propellants, which would otherwise be unacceptable due to their production of toxic chemicals, can be used.
      <br/>
      For example, the patent discloses the use of tetrazol compounds.
      <br/>
      It is interesting to note that there as yet is no commercialization of the Poole et al. invention which raises the question as to whether such high aspiration ratios are in fact achievable with any of the prior art designs.
      <br/>
      Analysis has shown that this is the case, that is, that such large aspiration ratios are not achievable with the prior art designs.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,928,991 to Thorn describes an aspirating inflator assembly including aspiration valves which are generally needed in all high pumping ratio aspiration systems.
      <br/>
      Sodium azide is the propellant used.
      <br/>
      Pumping ratios of 1:1 to 1.5:1 are mentioned in this patent which by analysis is possible.
      <br/>
      It is noteworthy that the preamble of this patent discloses that the state of the art of aspirating inflators yields pumping ratios of 0.1:1 to 0.5:1, far below those specified in several of the above referenced earlier patents.
      <br/>
      Once again, little attempt has been made to optimize the nozzle design.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,004,586 to Hayashi et al. describes a sodium azide driver side inflator in which the aspirating air flows through a series of annular slots on the circumference of the circular inflator in contrast to the earlier Hayashi et al. patent where the flow was on the axis.
      <br/>
      Similar pumping ratios of about 4:1 are claimed however, which by analysis is unlikely.
      <br/>
      Once again, aspiration valves are not shown and the reason that they can be neglected is not discussed.
      <br/>
      An inefficient nozzle design is again illustrated.
      <br/>
      The lack of commercial success of these two Hayashi patents is probably due to the fact that such high pumping ratios as claimed are not in fact achievable in the geometries illustrated.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,060,973 to Giovanetti describes the first liquid propellant airbag gas generator wherein the propellant burns clean and does not require filters to trap solid particles.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is one preferred propellant for use in the instant invention.
      <br/>
      This system however produces a gas which is too hot for use directly to inflate an airbag.
      <br/>
      The gas also contains substantial quantities of steam as well as carbon dioxide.
      <br/>
      The steam can cause burns to occupants and carbon dioxide in significant quantities is toxic.
      <br/>
      The gas generator is also circular.
      <br/>
      Aspirating systems are therefore required when using the liquid propellant disclosed in this patent, or alternately, the gas generated must be exhausted outside of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,129,674 to Levosinski describes a converging-diverging nozzle design which provides for more efficient aspiration than some of the above discussed patents.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, the airbag system disclosed is quite large and limited in length such that the flow passageways are quite large which requires a long nozzle design for efficient operation.
      <br/>
      Since there is insufficient space for a long nozzle, it can be estimated that this system has a pumping ratio less than 1:1 and probably about 0.2:1. Once again a sodium azide based propellant is used.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,207,450 to Pack, Jr. et al. describes an aspirated air cushion restraint system in which no attempt was made to optimize the nozzle design for this sodium azide driver side airbag.
      <br/>
      Also, aspiration valves are used although it is suggested that the exhaust from the airbag can be made through the aspirating holes thereby eliminating the need for the flapper valves.
      <br/>
      No analysis, however, is provided to prove that the area of the aspiration holes is comparable to the area of the exhaust holes normally provided in the airbag.
      <br/>
      Although no mention is made of the pumping ratio of this design, the device as illustrated appears to be approximately the same size as a conventional driver side inflator.
      <br/>
      This, coupled with an analysis of the geometry, indicates a pumping ratio of less than 1:1 and probably less than 0.2:1. The statement that the aspiration valves are not needed also indicates that the aspiration ratio must be small.
      <br/>
      Large inlet ports which are needed for large aspiration ratios are generally much larger than the typical airbag exhaust ports.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,286,054 to Cuevas describes an aspirating/venting motor vehicle passenger airbag module in which the principal of operation is similar to the '264 patent discussed above.
      <br/>
      Once again the aspiration pumping ratio of this device is 0.15:1 to 0.2:1 which is in line with conventional aspirated inflators.
      <br/>
      It is interesting to note that this pioneer in the field does not avail himself of designs purporting to yield higher pumping ratios.
      <br/>
      Again the nozzle design has not been optimized.
    </p>
    <p num="31">Other U.S. patents which are relevant to the instant invention but which will not be discussed in detail are: U.S. Pat. No. 3,158,314 to Young et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,370,784 to Day, U.S. Pat. No. 5,085,465 to Hieahim, U.S. Pat. No. 5,100,172 to Van Voorhies et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,193,847 to Nakayama, U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,259 to Conlee et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,423,571 to Hawthorn.</p>
    <p num="32">None of the prior art inflators contain the advantages of the combination of (i) a linear inflator having a small cross section thereby permitting an efficient nozzle design wherein the length of the nozzle is much greater than the aspiration port opening, (ii) a non sodium azide propellant which may produce toxic gas if not diluted with substantial quantities of ambient air, and (iii) an inflator where minimal or no filtering or heat absorption is required.</p>
    <p num="33">
      It is interesting to note that in spite of the large aspiration pumping ratios mentioned and even claimed in the prior art references mentioned above. and to the very significant advantages which would result if such ratios could be achieved, none has been successfully adapted to an automobile airbag system.
      <br/>
      One reason is that pumping ratios which are achievable in a steady state laboratory environment are more difficult to achieve in the transient conditions of an actual airbag deployment.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      None of these prior art designs have resulted in a thin linear module which permits the space necessary for an efficient nozzle design as disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      In spite of the many advantages claimed in the prior art patents, none have resulted in a module which can be mounted within the vehicle headliner trim, for example, or can be made to conform to a curved surface.
      <br/>
      In fact, the rigid shape of conventional airbag modules has forced the vehicle interior designers to compromise their designs since the surface of such modules must be a substantially flat plane.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      With respect to airbag systems including a plurality of inflatable airbags or unconventionally large airbags and inflators therefor, automobile manufacturers are now installing more than two airbags into a vehicle.
      <br/>
      The placement of both side and rear seat airbags have in fact taken place by at least one manufacturer each; Nissan for rear airbags and Volvo, General Motors and Ford for side airbags.
      <br/>
      However, Nissan has stated that it cannot provide more than a total of two airbags in the vehicle and that it will not offer a front passenger side airbag for those vehicles that have a rear seat airbag.
      <br/>
      With respect to the Volvo, General Motors and Ford airbags, these side airbags will not deploy when the frontal airbags do because if more than two airbags would be deployed in a vehicle at the same time, the pressure generated by the deploying airbags within the passenger compartment of the vehicle creates large forces on the doors.
      <br/>
      These forces may be sufficient to force the doors open and consequently, if the doors of the vehicle are forced open during a crash, vehicle occupants might be ejected, greatly increasing the likelihood of serious injury.
      <br/>
      In addition, the pressure generated within the passenger compartment creates excessive noise which can injure human beings.
    </p>
    <p num="36">In addition to airbags for side impacts and rear seats, it is likely that airbags will be used as knee bolsters since automobile manufacturers are having serious problems protecting knees from injury in crashes while providing the comfort space desired by their customers.</p>
    <p num="37">
      As soon as three or more airbags are deployed in an accident, provisions should be made to open a hole in the vehicle to permit the pressure generated by the deploying airbags to escape.
      <br/>
      What has not heretofore been appreciated, however, is that once there is a significant opening from the vehicle to the outside, the requirements for the composition of the inflator gases used to inflate the airbags change and inflators which generate a significant amount of toxic gas become feasible, as will be discussed below.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The primary gas generating propellant used in airbag systems today is sodium azide.
      <br/>
      This is partially due to the fact that when sodium azide burns, in the presence of an oxidizer, it produces large amounts of Nitrogen gas.
      <br/>
      It also produces sodium oxide which must be retained in the inflator since sodium oxide, when mixed with moisture, becomes lye and is very toxic to humans.
      <br/>
      Thus, current inflators emit only nitrogen gas into the passenger compartment which occupants can breath for a long period of time in a closed passenger compartment without danger.
      <br/>
      The sodium azide inflators also are large to accommodate the fact that about 60% of the gas generating material remains in the inflator with only about 40% emerging as gas.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Other propellants, including nitrocellulose, nitroguanidine, and other double base and triple base formulations, as well as a large number of liquid propellants, exist which could be used to inflate airbags, however they usually produce various quantities of gases containing compounds of nitrogen and oxygen plus significant amounts of carbon dioxide.
      <br/>
      In many cases, the gases produced by these other propellants are only toxic to humans if breathed over an extended period of time.
      <br/>
      If the toxic gas were removed from the vehicle within a few minutes after the accident then many of these propellants would be usable to inflate airbags.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Much of the energy released when sodium azide burns in the inflator is removed from the gas by the cooling and filtering screens.
      <br/>
      In some designs, the sodium oxide must be trapped by the filters which requires that the gas be cooled to the point where sodium oxide condenses.
      <br/>
      In all designs, the gas is cooled so that the temperature of the gas in the airbag will not cause burns to the occupants.
      <br/>
      In all current designs, a substantial amount of the energy in a propellant is lost through this cooling process which in turn necessitates that the inflator contain more propellant.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Airbag systems have primarily been installed within the instrument panel or steering wheel of automobiles.
      <br/>
      As a result, although numerous attempts have been made to create aspirated inflator systems, they have only been used on the passenger side and their efficiency has been low.
      <br/>
      In aspirated inflator systems, part of the gas to inflate the airbag is drawn in from the passenger compartment.
      <br/>
      However, in a typical passenger side airbag system in use today where aspiration is employed, substantially less that about 30% of the gas which inflates the airbag comes from the passenger compartment.
      <br/>
      In view of the large size of conventional sodium azide inflators and woven airbags, there is limited room for the airbag system and it is difficult to design aspirating systems which will fit within the remaining available space.
      <br/>
      One reason is the resistance of the air flow through the instrument panel into the aspirator.
      <br/>
      Another reason for the low efficiency of aspirated inflator systems is that the aspirated systems used today have inefficient nozzle designs.
      <br/>
      Theoretical studies of aspiration systems, such as described herein, show that the percentage of gas drawn in from the passenger compartment could be raised to as high as about 75% or even 90%.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      One airbag aspiration method is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,909,549 (Poole et al.) Poole et al. describes a method for inflating an airbag in which a substantially non-toxic primary gas mixture is diluted with outside air by passing the primary gas mixture through at least venturi to aspirate the air.
      <br/>
      Poole et al. does not suggest that the outside air should come from the passenger compartment and therefore does not provide a solution to the problem of excessive pressure being generated in the passenger compartment upon deployment of multiple airbags, as discussed above.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      If alternate, more efficient propellants are used and if the gas produced thereby is exhausted at a much higher temperature, more of the energy would be available to heat the gas which is flowing from the passenger compartment to the airbag thus further increasing the efficiency of the system and reducing the amount of propellant required.
      <br/>
      Since cooling screens are not necessary and since the efficiency of the propellant is high, the inflator can be made very small providing the extra space needed to design efficient aspirating nozzles.
    </p>
    <p num="44">Since many alternate propellants produce toxic gases, their use becomes practical (i) if the quantity used is substantially reduced, (ii) if means are provided to prevent the gas from entering the occupant compartment, or (iii) if means exist within the vehicle to exhaust the toxic gas from the vehicle shortly after the airbag is deployed.</p>
    <p num="45">
      Finally, today the airbag electronics are housed separate and apart from the airbag module and the energy needed to initiate the inflator is transmitted to the airbag module after the crash sensor has determined that the airbag deployment is required.
      <br/>
      This has resulted in many failures of the airbag system due to shorted wires and other related causes.
      <br/>
      This and other problems could be solved if the crash sensor electronics send a coded signal to the airbag module and the electronics associated with the module decoded the signal to initiate the inflator.
      <br/>
      The diagnostics circuitry can then also be part of or associated with the module along with the backup power supply which now also becomes the primary power supply for the module.
    </p>
    <p num="46">These and other problems of current airbag systems are solved by the invention disclosed herein and described in detail below.</p>

      In accordance with the invention, an airbag deployment system comprises at least one module housing, at least one deployable airbag associated with each housing, inflator means associated with each housing for inflating the airbag(s) to deploy, e.g., into the passenger compartment, airbag inflation determining means for determining that deployment of the airbag(s) is/are desired, and respective electronic control means arranged within or proximate each housing and coupled to a respective inflator means and to the airbag inflation determining means for initiating the inflator means to inflate the airbag(s) in the respective housing upon receiving a signal from the airbag inflation determining means.
      <br/>
      The control means include a power supply for enabling initiation of the inflator means.
      <br/>
      The airbag inflation determining means preferably generate a coded signal when deployment of the airbag(s) is desired and the control means receive the coded signal and initiate the inflator means based thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      The system may also comprise position-sensing means coupled to the control means of each housing for detecting the position of an occupant to be protected by the deployment of the airbag from the housing.
      <br/>
      In this case, the control means initiate the respective inflator means to inflate the airbag(s) in the respective housing in consideration of (or based in part on) the detected position of the occupant.
      <br/>
      The position sensing means may be arranged within the respective housing.
      <br/>
      Also, the position sensing means may comprise a wave transmitter for transmitting waves into the passenger compartment and a wave receiver for receiving waves from the passenger compartment, the wave transmitter and wave receiver both being coupled to the control means.
      <br/>
      The control means may send a signal to the wave transmitter to cause the wave transmitter to transmit the waves into the passenger compartment.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments, there are several housings and the system thus may include delay means arranged in association with at least one housing for providing a delay in the inflation of the airbag(s) therein initiated by the control means associated with the housing upon receiving the signal from the airbag inflation determining means.
      <br/>
      The delay means provide variable delays in the inflation of the airbag(s) in the housings such that the airbag(s) in the housings inflate at different times.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      The system may also include diagnostic means arranged within each housing for determining the status of the control means, and monitoring means coupled to each diagnostic means for receiving the status of the control means associated with each module and providing a warning if the control means of any module fails.
      <br/>
      The airbag inflation determining means and control means may be arranged on a single vehicle bus.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The aspect of reducing the concentration of toxic gas in the passenger compartment resulting from airbag deployment in the present invention is centered around solving the problem of an excess build up of pressure when more than two airbags (or an unconventionally large airbag) are deployed in an accident by reducing the pressure before, during and/or after deployment of a plurality of airbags.
      <br/>
      Initially, care is taken to reduce the problem by not deploying any unnecessary airbags by detecting the presence of occupants on particular seats.
      <br/>
      Thus, if there is no front seat passenger present then the airbags designed to protect such an occupant are not inflated.
      <br/>
      This is not for the purpose of minimizing the repair costs as is the object of other similar systems, but to control the pressure buildup when multiple airbags are deployed.
      <br/>
      After a decision is made as to what seats need to be protected, the next step is to determine how many airbags are needed to provide the best protection to the vehicle occupants in those seats.
      <br/>
      This might require the deployment of a knee airbag, especially if the occupant is not wearing a seatbelt, and of a side head protection airbag if the frontal impact has an angular component which might cause the occupant's head to strike the A-pillar of the vehicle, for example.
      <br/>
      When the total number of airbags deployed exceeds a given number, means are then provided to open a hole in the vehicle to reduce the pressure buildup.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      Other factors are taken into account to determine the particular given number of deploying airbags which necessitate the opening of a hole.
      <br/>
      These include the use of highly aspirated airbags systems.
      <br/>
      Aspirated systems are in use today but not for the purpose of reducing the pressure buildup in the vehicle caused by the deployment of multiple airbags.
      <br/>
      Indeed, it has been the case that no more than two airbags have yet been deployed in a vehicle accident.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      An unexpected result of the pressure reducing features of the present invention is the fact that now propellants which have heretofore not been considered for airbags can now be used which substantially reduce the cost and improve the performance of airbag systems.
      <br/>
      A further unexpected result of the incorporation of the electronics into the module feature of the present invention is that the reliability of the system is substantially improved.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      In one embodiment, the airbag module in accordance with the invention is long and thin and can conveniently be made in any length and bent into almost any generally linear shape.
      <br/>
      This module is typically mounted on or slightly below a surface in the passenger compartment such as the ceiling, instrument panel, seat or knee bolster support structure.
      <br/>
      When the deployment of the module is initiated, a cover is released and a thin, preferably film, airbag is inflated using a highly aspirated inflator using a clean propellant which if undiluted might be toxic to humans.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      More particularly, in certain embodiments in accordance with the invention, the airbag module comprises an elongate housing having a length in the longitudinal direction which is substantially larger than a width or thickness thereof in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction, an airbag situated within the housing, inflator means arranged in the housing for producing pressurized gas to inflate the airbag, mounting means for mounting the module in the passenger compartment, initiation means for initiating the inflator means to produce the pressurized gas in response to the crash of the vehicle, and the housing comprises cover means for releasable retaining the airbag.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the length of the housing is at least ten times larger than the width or the thickness of the housing thereby permitting mounting of the module with minimal penetration below a mounting surface of the passenger compartment.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the inflator means and airbag extend in the longitudinal direction of the housing and the inflator means are elongate and have a length which is more than half the length of the airbag measured in the longitudinal direction when the airbag is inflated.
      <br/>
      The airbag system also optionally includes means for reducing the concentration of toxic gas in the passenger compartment which are ideally activated upon deployment of the airbag.
    </p>
    <p num="90">The inflator means may comprise a gas generator having a length substantially in the longitudinal direction of the housing exceeding ten times a width or thickness of the gas generator in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction.</p>
    <p num="91">Furthermore, the housing includes an elongate support base mounted to a surface of the passenger compartment by the mounting means and which has a catch at each longitudinal side,. In this embodiment, the cover means comprise a tab engaging with the catch to retain the cover means, the tab being released from the catch during deployment of the airbag.</p>
    <p num="92">
      In another embodiment, the inflator means comprise an elongate gas generator including a propellant for producing pressurized gas to inflate the airbag which has a length at least ten times its width or thickness.
      <br/>
      The mounting means are then structured and arranged to mount the module substantially onto a peripheral surface of the passenger compartment while the initiation means are structured and arranged to initiate the gas generator to produce the pressurized gas in response to the crash of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The cover means cover the airbag prior to the production of the pressurized gas and the housing further includes removal means for enabling removal of the cover means to permit the deployment of the airbag.
      <br/>
      The surface of the passenger compartment to which the module is mounted is a back surface of a front seat of the vehicle, an instrument panel in the vehicle, possibly in such a position as to afford protection to the knees of a front seat occupant during the crash of the vehicle, or the ceiling of the vehicle, e.g., at a location in front of a front seat of the vehicle and suitable for mounting the module for protecting occupants of the front seat in a frontal impact or at a location along a side of the vehicle and suitable for mounting the module for protecting occupants of both front and rear seats in a side impact or at a location behind a front seat of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      In yet another embodiment, the inflator means comprises an elongate gas generator for producing the pressurized gas to inflate the airbag and therefore, the initiation means are structured and arranged to initiate the gas generator to produce the pressurized gas in response to the crash of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The module further includes aspiration means for combining gas from the passenger compartment with the pressurized gas from the gas generator and directing the combined gas into the airbag.
      <br/>
      Such aspiration means may comprise a linear nozzle leading from a combustion chamber in the gas generator and having a converging section followed by a diverging section and ending at a mixing chamber in the module, whereby the pressurized gas flows from the combustion chamber through the linear nozzle into the mixing chamber, and means defining at least one aspiration inlet port such that gas from the passenger compartment flows through the aspiration inlet port into the mixing chamber.
      <br/>
      The mixing length is at least fifty times the minimum thickness of a jet of the pressurized gas from the gas generator within the nozzle.
      <br/>
      The mixing chamber comprises nozzle means defining a converging section and a diverging section arranged after the converging section in a direction of flow of the combined pressurized gas and gas from the passenger compartment.
      <br/>
      The dimensions of the converging-diverging nozzle and aspiration inlet port(s) are selected so that the gas entering the airbag is at least about 80 percent from the passenger compartment.
      <br/>
      The aspiration means may also comprise a pair of nozzle walls extending in the longitudinal direction at a respective side of the gas generator, such that the gas generator is situated between the nozzle walls and the pressurized gas from the gas generator is directed into a mixing chamber defined in part between the nozzle walls, and springs for connecting the nozzle walls to the support base.
      <br/>
      The springs have a first position in which the nozzle walls are proximate to the support base and a second position in which the nozzle walls are spaced apart from the support base.
      <br/>
      The springs are extended to the second position during production of the pressurized gas to separate the nozzle walls from the support base to define aspiration inlet ports between the nozzle walls and the support base.
      <br/>
      In this case, the module also includes support shields connected to and extending between the nozzle walls.
      <br/>
      The support shields define the mixing chamber prior to deployment of the airbag and are forced outward to define a second converging-diverging nozzle leading from the mixing chamber to the airbag through which the pressurized gas flows.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      The gas generator preferably comprises an elongate housing, which may be made of plastic, having a length at least 10 times its thickness or width, propellant dispersed in an interior of and substantially along the length of the gas generator housing, igniter means for initiating burning of the propellant; and gas generator mounting means for mounting the gas generator in the passenger compartment.
      <br/>
      The gas generator housing comprises at least one opening through which gas passes from the interior of the gas generator into the airbag.
      <br/>
      The opening(s) has/have a variable size depending on the pressure of the gas in the interior of the gas generator housing.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      The present invention also relates to an occupant protection system for a vehicle including an airbag module and having power steering means comprising a steering wheel opposed to a driver side portion of a front seat, a servo control system and means for connecting the steering wheel to the control system, e.g., a deformable support member.
      <br/>
      The mounting means mount the module in the passenger compartment apart from the steering wheel of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      In this case, the occupant protection system comprises yieldable steering wheel support means for enabling the steering wheel to be displaced away from a position opposed to a driver when situated in the driver side portion of the front seat.
      <br/>
      The module is thus structured and arranged such that the airbag after deployment cushions the driver from impact with surfaces of the passenger compartment.
      <br/>
      As such, it is possible to provide a single airbag module to provide protection for the entire front seat which would deploy an airbag from one side of the vehicle to the other side.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      It is also envisioned that a single airbag module can provide protection for both a front seat occupant and a rear seat occupant on the same side of the vehicle, In this case, the mounting means mount the airbag module to a surface of the passenger compartment such that it extends in a horizontal direction from a front portion of the passenger compartment toward a rear portion of the passenger compartment adjacent a side of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The module would deploy an airbag extending substantially across the entire side of the vehicle alongside the front seat and the rear seat.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      Furthermore, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, and as explained below, that it is ideal to vary the size of the nozzle of the gas generator through which gas generated by the burning propellant flows in response to variations in the pressure in the chamber in which the propellant is burning.
      <br/>
      To this end, the present invention includes a gas generator having a housing, propellant dispersed in all interior thereof, igniter means for initiating burning of the propellant, and gas generator mounting means for mounting the gas generator housing to the support base and spaced from the support base to define a nozzle therebetween and which comprise elastic support brackets arranged in the nozzle between the gas generator housing and the support base or strips of deformable material, which deforms as a function of temperature variation, arranged in the nozzle between the gas generator housing and the support base.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      In yet another embodiment, the airbag module comprises an airbag, an inflator for producing pressurized gas to inflate the airbag and which comprises a housing, a gas generator arranged therein, and a variable exit opening from the housing through which gas from the gas generator flows to inflate the airbag.
      <br/>
      The size of the variable exit opening is controlled by the pressure within the housing.
      <br/>
      The remaining structure of this module may be as described above.

    <heading>DEFINITION OF TERMS</heading>
    <p num="100">The following terms will be used in the description of the invention and for the sake of clarity are defined here.</p>
    <p num="101">
      The "A-pillar" of a vehicle and specifically of an automobile is defined as the first roof supporting pillar from the front of the vehicle and usually supports the front door.
      <br/>
      It is also known as the hinge pillar.

    <p num="102">The "B-Pillar" is the next roof support pillar rearward from the A-Pillar.</p>
    <p num="103">The "C-Pillar" is the final roof support usually at or behind the rear seats</p>
    <p num="104">
      The term "squib" represents the entire class of electrically initiated pyrotechnic devices capable of releasing sufficient energy to cause a vehicle window to break.
      <br/>
      It is also used to represent the mechanism which starts the burning of an initiator which in turn ignites the propellant within an inflator.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      The term "airbag module" generally connotes a unit having at least one airbag, gas generator means for producing a gas, attachment or coupling means for attaching the airbag(s) to and in fluid communication with the gas generator means so that gas is directed from the gas generator means into the airbag(s) to inflate the same, initiation means for initiating the gas generator means in response to a crash of the vehicle for which deployment of the airbag is desired and means for attaching or committing the unit to the vehicle in a position in which the deploying airbag(s) will be effective in the passenger compartment of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      In the instant invention, the airbag module may also include occupant sensing components, diagnostic and power supply electronics and componentry which are either within or proximate to the module housing.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="106">
      Referring to the accompanying drawings wherein the same reference numerals refer to the same or similar elements, an airbag module constructed in accordance with the teachings of the invention and adapted for mounting, e.g., on a ceiling 105 in a passenger compartment 195 of a motor vehicle to protect rear seat occupants in collisions and particularly frontal collisions, is shown generally at 100 in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The airbag module 100 is elongate and includes an inflator module 120 and an airbag 110 made substantially of plastic film which is coupled to the inflator module 120.
      <br/>
      The airbag module 100 is attached to a mounting surface of the vehicle which, in the illustrated embodiment, is a middle region of the ceiling 105 by fastening means 107.
      <br/>
      The airbag module 100, or at least the airbag 110 housed therein, is dimensioned so that it extends across substantially the entire distance between the side windows.
      <br/>
      The airbag module 100, and more particularly the inflator module 120, is also coupled to a sensor and diagnostic module 180 which receives input data and determines if an accident involving the vehicle is of such severity as to require deployment of the airbag 110.
      <br/>
      If so, the sensor and diagnostic module 180 sends a signal to the inflator module 120 to start the process of deploying the airbag, i.e., by initiating the burning of a propellant housed within a gas generator portion of the inflator module 120 as described in more detail below.
      <br/>
      Module 100 may also be attached to the ceiling of the vehicle in a position to deploy the airbag between the dashboard and any front-seated occupants.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      FIG. 2A is a cross-sectional view of the airbag module 100 prior to inflation of the airbag 110.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2A, the airbag module 100 includes a protective cover 150 which partially defines a housing of the airbag module 100 and as such, encloses the airbag 110 and an interior portion of the airbag module 100 and prevents contaminated particles from entering the interior of the airbag module 100.
      <br/>
      Shortly after the inflator module 120 is directed to initiate burning of the propellant, the protective cover 150 is released as a direct result of the burning propellant and the folded airbag 110 begins to inflate using a combination of gases from both the gas generator portion of the inflator module 120 and, through aspiration, from the passenger compartment 195 of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      The term "airbag" as used herein means either the case where the airbag module 100 contains a ingle airbag, as in most conventional designs, or where the airbag module 100 contains a plurality of airbags, possibly one inside another or several airbags inside a limiting net having a smaller volume than the volume of the airbags (see the disclosure of the '763 and '676 applications), or where the airbag module 100 contains a single airbag having a plurality of compartments which deploy in concert to protect an occupant.
      <br/>
      The term "inflator" as used herein means the gas generator plus all other parts required to deliver gas to the airbag including the aspiration system if present.
      <br/>
      The term "gas generate", on the other hand, refers only to the propellant, its housing and all other parts required to generate gas.
      <br/>
      In non-aspirated implementations, the inflator and the gas generator are the same.
      <br/>
      The terms "propellant" and "gas generator" are used here as equivalents.
      <br/>
      The term "cover" as used herein means any type of covering for enclosing an interior portion of the airbag module 100, or at least for overlying the airbag 110 per se, to protect the same and may even constitute a simple covering on an outermost region of the airbag 110.
      <br/>
      Thus, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the cover may be the material which forms the outer peripheral surface of the passenger compartment, e.g., fabric, without deviating from the objects of the invention.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the covering may actually be a surface of the airbag itself coated to appear like a cover.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      FIG. 2B is a view of the airbag module 100 of FIG. 2A after the initial stage of airbag inflation where the initial gas from the gas generator has generated sufficient pressure within the interior of the airbag module 100 to force the release of the cover 150.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2C shows the airbag 110 in its inflated condition and is a view taken along lines 2C--2C of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The cover 150 may also be released by other means such as pyrotechnic means.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 2A, 2B and 2C, the airbag module 100 is substantially elongate and the inflator module 120 comprises an elongate gas generator made from an approximately rectangular-cross-section housing, such as a tube 121, with at least one opening 122 therein for outflow of gas generated thereby.
      <br/>
      A propellant 127 in the form of a solid material is affixed to the inner surface of the walls of tube 121 in a significant portion of the interior of tube 121.
      <br/>
      The surface of the propellant 127 not engaging a wall of the tube 121 is coated with a layer of pyrotechnic igniter mix 128 such as a coating made from nitrocellulose and BKNO3, or other suitable materials, to aid in starting burning of the propellant 127.
      <br/>
      This layer of igniter mix 128 also serves to seal the propellant 127 from the environment, i.e., the atmosphere.
      <br/>
      If the material of the igniter mix 128 is made at least partially from nitrocellulose or another appropriate sealant, then another seal to isolate the propellant from the atmosphere is not required and the propellant 127 is effectively hermetically sealed.
      <br/>
      A screen member 129 is also positioned within tube 121 in a position spaced from the layer of igniter mix 128 covering the propellant 127 and adjacent to the opening(s) 122 to prevent any particulate matter from leaving the tube 121.
      <br/>
      A chamber 125 is thus defined between the screen member 129 and the layer of igniter mix 128.
      <br/>
      Although any screen member 129 will inherently provide some initial cooling of the gas from the propellant 127, this is simply an ancillary benefit.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, for cases where the selected propellant 127 is known to burn at too high a temperature, the screen member 129 can be made thicker so as to also serve as a heat sink, i.e., its size can be regulated to affect the temperature of the gases generated by the burning propellant 127 and expelled from the gas generator 120.
      <br/>
      Upon receiving a signal from the sensor and diagnostic module 180, an electronic module (not shown) ignites a squib at one end of the inflator module 110 (FIG. 1) which ignites the igniter mix 128 which in turn ignites the propellant 127.
      <br/>
      The propellant 127 burns in a direction from the surfaces coated by the igniter mix 128 toward wall 123 (FIG. 2A), which is opposed to the wall of the tube 121 having the opening(s) 122 until the propellant 127 is totally consumed.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the size of the tube 121 can be regulated, i.e., elongated or widened, depending on the propellant used and ideally minimized based on appropriate selection of the propellant and the required gas output parameters of the gas generator, without deviating from the scope of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="111">The airbag module 100 also includes, external of the tube 121 and in fluid communication with the opening(s) 122, a mixing chamber 130 in which the gas from the gas generator 120 resulting from the burning of the propellant 127 and gas from the passenger compartment 195, e.g., air, entering through an aspiration nozzle or inlet ports or inlet slits 135 are combined, and from which the combined gases are delivered to the airbag 110 through a port or nozzle, i.e., converging-diverging nozzle 115 (FIGS. 2B and 2C).</p>
    <p num="112">
      The airbag module 100 also comprises elongate U-shaped nozzle walls 160 (which define the nozzle 115 therebetween), base 114 which is mounted to the ceiling 105, or other mounting surface, by the fastening members 107 (FIG. 1) and support springs 145.
      <br/>
      The gas generator 120 is attached to base 114 by brackets 170 which will be described in more detail below (FIG. 2F).
      <br/>
      Each of the nozzle walls 160 has two leg portions 160a1, 160a2 extending from opposite end regions of a base portion 160b.
      <br/>
      At least one of the springs 145, two in the illustrated embodiment, is attached to leg portion 160a1 of each nozzle wall 160 and, as shown in FIG. 2A, prior to airbag inflation are maintained in a compressed state so that the walls 160 are proximate to the base 114, i.e., the aspiration inlet ports 135 are substantially closed.
      <br/>
      Attached to the base portion 160b of each nozzle wall 160 is a spring shield 155 which supports and protects the material of the airbag 110 during the initial inflation period, as shown in FIG. 2B, prior to the start of the aspiration when the gases are hot, keeping the airbag 110 from blocking the inlet to the inflator module 120 from the passenger compartment 195.
      <br/>
      Prior to inflation of the airbag 110, the spring shields 155 exert pressure against the folded airbag 110 to force the same against the cover 150.
      <br/>
      During inflation, the spring shields 155 are designed to be forced outward by the expulsion of gases from the gas generator 120 and help start the airbag deployment process since the cover 150 no longer acts to restrain the airbag 100, and then the support shields 155 form the converging and diverging portions of the low pressure part of the aspiration nozzle 115.
      <br/>
      The ends of the airbag 110 are connected to leg portions l60a2.
      <br/>
      This process uses the high pressure gas from the inflator to initiate deployment of the airbag prior to the start of the aspiration process.
      <br/>
      In this maimer, the initial force needed to release the cover and start the airbag deployment is provided by the initial burning of the propellant.
      <br/>
      In some cases, two propellant formulations are used.
      <br/>
      A first rapidly burning mixture to provide an initial high pressure for cover release and initial deployment, followed by a slower burning propellant for inflating the airbag with aspirated air.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      In view of this construction, the airbag 110 is not circular but rather is elongate as shown in FIG. 1 Some of the advantages of this non-circular airbag 110 is its ease of manufacture from flat plastic film sheets as described in copending patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/539,676 and its ease in parallel folding the airbag into the module 100.
      <br/>
      In this regard, it is noted that in view of the elongated shape of the airbag 110, it can be folded lengthwise in the airbag module 100.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      In operation, shortly after the propellant 127 has been ignited by the igniter mix 128 and the cover has been released, high pressure gas begins to flow through screen 129, through opening(s) 122 and out through a converging-diverging nozzle 117,118,119, also referred to as a convergent-divergent nozzle.
      <br/>
      The nozzle 117,118,119 extends along the longitudinal sides of the inflator module 120.
      <br/>
      This nozzle has the effect of causing a jet of the combustion gases to achieve a high supersonic velocity and low pressure and to spread to rapidly fill the mixing chamber 130 formed by an outer wall of tube 121, nozzle walls 160 and spring shields 155.
      <br/>
      This causes a low pressure to occur in the mixing chamber 130 causing substantial amounts of gas to flow through aspirator inlet ports 135, which are opened by the expansion of springs 145 forcing nozzle walls 160 to move away from base 114 as shown, e.g., in FIGS. 2B and 2C. The converging portion 117 of the nozzle is constructed so that its cross-sectional area gradually decreases until throat 118.
      <br/>
      After throat 118, the cross-sectional area of the diverging portion 119 of the nozzle gradually increases toward exit 132.
      <br/>
      Thus, after the throat 118, there is a significant continuation of the nozzle to provide for the diverging portion 119.
      <br/>
      An approximate analysis of an aspirating system similar to that of this invention appears in the Appendix.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      The pressure then begins to build in the mixing chamber 130 until sufficient pressure is obtained to finish expelling the cover 150 causing springs 145 to expand even more, support shields 155 to be opened to fully open the nozzle 115 and airbag 110 to be further deployed.
      <br/>
      Prior to release, the cover 150 is retained by a catch 152.
      <br/>
      Upon pressurization of the mixing chamber during airbag deployment, a tab 153 on cover 150 is pulled from under catch 152 releasing the cover.
      <br/>
      Since the pressure builds at the end of the module which is initially ignited by the squib, not shovel, the tab 153 is initially released at that end and then is rapidly pulled out from under catch 152 progressing to the end furthest away from the squib.
      <br/>
      This process can be facilitated by removal of either the tab 153 or catch 152 at the squib end of the airbag module 100.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the cover 150 is easily released yet retains the airbag 110 during normal vehicle operation.
      <br/>
      One important feature of the invention is that since the flow out of the high-pressure nozzle is supersonic, the pressure rise needed to further expel the cover 150 will not affect the flow through the nozzle.
      <br/>
      This is true as long as the flow remains supersonic which, in the preferred design, is set to permit a ten fold pressure rise to expel the cover 150 over that which should be required.
      <br/>
      Since relatively little pressure is required to expel the cover 150, if an object is loading the cover 150 in one location in the longitudinal direction of the tube 121, the pressure will be released by flowing out to the sides of the obstruction, i.e., at other longitudinal locations.
      <br/>
      This design is unique in that the pressure buildup never reaches the point that it will cause injury to an out-of-position occupant.
      <br/>
      Even if the entire cover 150 is restrained, which is virtually impossible, the cover 150 will release the gas to the sides.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      Although the airbag 110 is stored in a compact arrangement as shown in FIG. 2A, when it deploys, the aspiration inlet ports 135 and the converging-diverging nozzle 115 become quite large especially when compared with the size of the high pressure nozzle 117,118,119.
      <br/>
      It is because of this geometry that very high aspiration pumping ratios are achievable in the invention compared to the prior art.
      <br/>
      Representative dimensions for the high-pressure nozzle are about 0.054 inches for the converging portion 117 of the nozzle, about 0.0057 for the minimum opening or throat 118, to about 0.1 inches at the exit 132 of the nozzle in the diverging portion 119.
      <br/>
      Representative dimensions for the aspirating nozzle on the other hand are about 1 inch at the inlet ports 135, about 2 inches at the minimum double clearance, i.e., the minimum distance between spring shields 155.
      <br/>
      The length of the mixing portion of the nozzle is about 2 inches for the illustrated design.
      <br/>
      It is the ratio of the minimum high pressure gas jet thickness, here about 0.0057 to the length on the mixing channel, here about 2 inches, which is only made possible by the design disclosed herein where the gas jet is very long and thin.
      <br/>
      The dimensions provided here are illustrative only and the actual dimensions will vary according to the particular application and the particular gas generate used.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      FIG. 2D shows the state of the airbag module 100 when the propellant 127 has completed its burning cycle and the pressure has dropped in the module 100 and the springs 145 are acting to move the walls 160 in a direction toward the base 114. i.e., toward their initial position in which the inlet port 135 are substantially closed.
      <br/>
      The springs 145 do not return the walls 160 completely to their initial position but rather maintain a sufficient opening between base 114 and walls 160 to permit the gases to vent from the airbag 110 as it is loaded by an occupant, i.e., so that gases will flow in an opposite direction through inlet port 135 than the direction of gas flow during inflation of the airbag 110.
      <br/>
      Springs 145 are typically made from flat strips of spring steel.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      In the nozzle, the gas flow initially converges to a very thin cross section which in one preferred design is about 0.005 inches.
      <br/>
      It then expands becoming supersonic and emerges from the high-pressure nozzle as a sheet canted or slanted at an angle with respect to the incoming aspirated air.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2C, the gas from the gas generator 120 flows in a direction F2 whereas the gas from the passenger compartment 195 flows from the aspirating inlet ports 135 in a direction FP which is at an angle  ALPHA  to the direction F2.
      <br/>
      This interaction between the two planar flows at an angle promotes efficient mixing of the two gas flows as the flow downstream and into the airbag.
      <br/>
      In most cases, the angles of the two flows can be adjusted in the design to assure this efficient mixing.
      <br/>
      In some cases, additional measures are implemented such as varying the directions of the combined flows to further promote mixing before the gas mixture enters the airbag 110.
      <br/>
      The design illustrated in the figures provides ample space for the gas flows to mix after their initial impact.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      In accordance with the invention, the length of the gas generator 120 is measured in a horizontal or longitudinal direction perpendicular to the direction of the flow of the gas and is the longest dimension of the device.
      <br/>
      The length of the nozzle 117,118,119, on the other hand, is measured in the direction of the gas flow and perpendicular to the length of the gas generator 120.
      <br/>
      A distinctive feature of the inflator module of this invention is that its length is much longer that its width or thickness and the length of the mixing chamber is much longer than the minimum thickness of the high pressure jet.
      <br/>
      It is this ratio which governs the completeness of the mixing of the gases generated by the propellant 127 and the gases from the passenger compartment 195 which in turn governs the pumping ratio and thereby permits the large pumping ratios achieved here in contrast to the constructions disclosed in the prior art patents discussed above.
      <br/>
      This is achieved by using a very long and thin jet of high pressure gas which is achieved by the elongate airbag module 100 disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      It is known in the art that the volume of gas flowing from a gas generator is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the jet times its length, but the ability of the jet to mix rapidly with the aspirating air is determined by the surface area of the jet.
      <br/>
      By using the thin linear geometry disclosed herein, the ratio of surface area to cross section area is maximized which in turn maximizes the amount of air which can be pumped and thus the pumping ratio.
      <br/>
      Other geometries can achieve high pumping ratios only by increasing the mixing length.
      <br/>
      In most implementations, however, this is not practical since there is insufficient space in the vehicle.
      <br/>
      This is the main reason that current inflators are limited to pumping ratios of substantially less than 1:1.
      <br/>
      In the case described above, the ratio of the mixing length to the minimum jet diameter is greater than 200:1.
      <br/>
      In most cases, in the implementation of this invention this ratio will exceed 100:1 and in all cases 50:1.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the ratio of the length of the gas generator 120 to the minimum thickness of the gas jet in the case described in FIG. 1 and FIGS. 2A-2F is greater than 4000:1.
      <br/>
      In most cases, this ratio will be greater than 1000:1 and preferably it will be greater than 100:1.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      Referring now to FIG. 2F, it can be seen that the nozzle walls 160 are solid and extend in the longitudinal direction of the tube 121.
      <br/>
      Similarly, spring shields 155 are connected to the walls 160 over substantially the entire length of the walls 160.
      <br/>
      However, springs 145 are thin members which are connected only at discrete locations to the walls 160 such that upon release of the springs 145 during airbag inflation, gas from the passenger compartment 195 can flow around and between the springs 145 into the mixing chamber 130.
      <br/>
      Although two springs 145 are shown, it is of course possible to have a single spring or more than two springs.
      <br/>
      Further, it is important to note that the length of the gas generator 120 does not have to be the same as the length of the nozzle walls and the module 100.
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      Further, it is a known property or characteristic of propellants, e.g., propellant 127 situated in the tube 121, that their burn rate is dependent on the surrounding pressure, in this case the pressure in chamber 125 in the tube 121.
      <br/>
      The gas flow rate out of chamber 125 depends on the flow resistance through the opening(s) 122 and the clearance at the throat 118 between the outer wall of the tube 121 and the base 114.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2F, this clearance is nominally set by supporting brackets 170 which are connected to the tube 121 at one end region and to the base 114 at an opposite end region.
      <br/>
      The brackets 170 are designed to hold the tube 121 at a certain distance from base 114.
      <br/>
      These brackets 170 can be designed to operate in three different ways: (i) as a fixed support, (ii) as a flexible support, or (iii) as a support which changes with temperature.
      <br/>
      In general, brackets 170 serve to fix the minimum clearance at throat 118 between the gas generator 120 as a unit and the support base 114.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      If brackets 170 operate as fixed supports, then the inflator will have a response which varies with temperature as is the case with all conventional inflator designs.
      <br/>
      This greatly increases the total amount of propellant which is required as discussed below.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      If support brackets 170 are made elastic or flexible, supports 126 are arranged in the converging portion 117 of the nozzle defined by the tube 121 and the support base 114 (FIG. 2E).
      <br/>
      The brackets 170 then spring-load the tube 121 against the supports 126 so that the tube 121 can lift off of supports 126 when the pressure is sufficient to overcome the spring force of supports which act in the compression direction to keep tube 121 close to the base 114.
      <br/>
      In this case, the clearance at throat 118 between the tube 121 and base 114 increases, which reduces the flow restriction which in turn reduces the pressure within chamber 125 resulting in a nearly constant propellant burn rate and thus an inflator which operates relatively independent of temperature.
      <br/>
      The supports 126 are in the form of projections which are arranged at a plurality of spaced apart discrete locations between the base 114 and the gas generator tube 121 and fix the minimum clearance for the case where the support brackets 170 are elastic or flexible.
    </p>
    <p num="124">Alternately, the brackets 170 can be made from strips of bimetallic material and, through a proper choice of materials and geometry, the brackets 170 will deform over temperature to vary the clearance at throat 118 also with the ambient temperature in order to increase the clearance at throat 118 with temperature thus reducing the flow resistance and reducing the pressure in chamber 125 with temperature providing partial compensation for the variation in the combustion rate of the gas generated as a function of temperature.</p>
    <p num="125">
      In general, the burn rate of propellants increases with ambient temperature and also with pressure, the so-called pressure exponent.
      <br/>
      The techniques described here are used to control the pressure in chamber 125 to offset the often uncontrollable changes in ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      By keeping the pressure in chamber 125 relatively constant through the techniques described above, or even decreasing the pressure in chamber 125 with temperature, the propellant bun rate is kept approximately constant.
      <br/>
      This serves to reduce the variation in the inflator gas output as a function of temperature.
      <br/>
      At cold temperatures, when the propellant tends to burn slowly, the clearance at throat 118 will be reduced and the pressure will build up increasing the propellant burn rate until the flow of gas out of chamber 125 is sufficient to relieve the pressure.
      <br/>
      Similarly, at high temperatures, when the propellant tends to burn at a higher rate, the pressure will be relieved reducing the pressure and slowing down the burn rate.
      <br/>
      In this maimer, the invention provides a sort of self-correcting system for providing a substantially constant propellant burn rate, based on adjustment in pressure in the chamber 125, regardless of the ambient temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      Conventional inflators, which do not have this pressure adjusting mechanism, produce higher gas flow rates at high ambient temperature than at low temperature since the resistance to the gas flow rate out of the inflator ports is constant.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a greater gas generating capacity is required at cold temperatures than at high temperatures and the inflators must be designed with sufficient propellant to handle the cold temperature case.
      <br/>
      Thus, a larger quantity of propellant is needed for conventional inflators by as much as a factor of two than would be the case in the inflator described above.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      A further advantage of the elastic pressure adjustment system described above is that since the inflator nozzle 117,118,119 opens as a function of the pressure in the chamber 125, it would not be possible for the inflator module 120 to explode in a fire which can be a problem in conventional designs.
      <br/>
      Thus, in general, a device called a "match" or auto-igniter which is used in conventional inflators to start the propellant burning in the case where the vehicle is on fire, for example, is not required for the gas generator described herein particularly when the elastic brackets 170 are used.
      <br/>
      It is also in general not required since the total amount of propellant used is small and it is distributed along a significant length.
      <br/>
      Thus, the confinement pressures required for the propellant to detonate do not occur in this design rendering this design inherently safer than the design of conventional inflators.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      Different propellants have different rates of combustion which has a significant effect on the geometry of the gas generator.
      <br/>
      For propellants with slow burn rates, the ratio of the burning surface width to the thickness of the solid propellant will have to increase.
      <br/>
      For slow burning propellants, therefore, the width of the tube 121 in a direction parallel to the igniter mix 128 may be much larger than the thickness of propellant 127.
      <br/>
      In other cases, the width of the tube 121 might become significantly less than the thickness of the propellant 127.
      <br/>
      This design therefore can accommodate a wide variety of propellant chemistries, and particularly those which produce small amounts of toxic gas which have heretofore been unusable, and therefore design is not limited to any particular propellant.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      In particular, FIG. 2G illustrates a case where a very slow burning propellant 127 is used and thus a wide thin geometry has been chosen for the inflator module 120.
      <br/>
      In this case, a tube is not used and the inflator module comprises the propellant 127 which is attached by an adhesive to a piece of formed metal 161 or other similar member positioned to define a constricting nozzle with the base.
      <br/>
      This geometry has the significant advantage of simplicity as can be readily seen in the illustration.
      <br/>
      It has another advantage in that propellants having slow burn rates can be used which heretofore could not be used.
      <br/>
      Slow burn rate propellants require very thin structures with a large surface area.
      <br/>
      If such propellants are formed into tablets as is conventionally done in conventional inflators, they would lack sufficient structural strength and be prone to breakage.
      <br/>
      If the tablets break, the surface area is increased and the propellant burns faster.
      <br/>
      This would be an uncontrollable property of these tablets such that the burn rate of various inflators depends on how many tablets break.
      <br/>
      Since this is unacceptable, there is a practical lower limit for the burn rates for propellants used in conventional inflator designs.
      <br/>
      This, therefore, restricts that classes of propellants which can be used.
      <br/>
      This restriction does not apply to the present invention since the propellant 127 is supported by metal piece 161 and therefore can be made very thin without fear of breakage.
      <br/>
      The metal piece 161 is also provided with appropriate curved sections to define a converging-diverging nozzle 117,118,119 with the support base 114.
      <br/>
      Also in this embodiment, a layer of igniter mix 128 may be coated onto the propellant 127.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      Although in the preferred implementations of the invention described above, the propellant is placed within the tube 121, in some cases it is desirable to place the gas generator in another location and to use the tube geometry described above to distribute the gas to the high-pressure nozzle.
      <br/>
      Thus, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that it is not required to generate gas within the inflator housing tube per se but it is possible to generate the gas in an auxiliary structure and direct the generated gas into the tube which then merely distributes the gas.
      <br/>
      Such an embodiment is illustrated schematically in FIG. 2H where an inflator 280 is illustrated in a position connected to tube 121 by a conduit through which gas generated in inflator 280 would be conducted into the tube 121.
      <br/>
      The inflator 280 is shown here for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to indicate the actual size or location of the inflator.
      <br/>
      Naturally, if a conventional inflator were used, it would be considerably larger than 280.
      <br/>
      Such an inflator 280 could be placed adjacent to, or in the vicinity of, the tube 121 or at a more remote location with the gas being transmitted to tube 121 through any type of tube.
      <br/>
      Such an arrangement is particularly useful when the chosen propellant does not burn clean and the effluent must be filtered.
      <br/>
      Although the inflator now feeds gas to the tube from one end, the remainder of the operation of the module is the same as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      As should now be evident, the aspirated inflator of the present invention has significant advantages over other aspirated inflators currently used in conventional airbag systems.
      <br/>
      In particular, large openings are provided in the form of the inlet slits ports 135 on either side of the aspirating nozzles.
      <br/>
      These ports 135 permit the flow of gas from the passenger compartment 195 into the aspirating nozzle through ports 135 with a short, low flow resistance, flow path.
      <br/>
      Once the cover 150 is removed from the airbag system and initial airbag deployment has begun, the module pops open and the inlet ports 135 are open to allow the entrance of the passenger compartment gas.
      <br/>
      The outlet passage from the inflator passes through a converging-diverging nozzle as described above which causes a smooth developed supersonic flow pattern in the emerging gas.
      <br/>
      The gas leaves the nozzle 117,118,199 at exit 132 and enters the mixing chamber 130 at a position near the throat of the aspirating nozzle 115 defined by walls 160 and shields 155 after which the aspirating nozzle 115 diverges, see FIGS. 2C and 2D, to create the minimum pressure at the throat to aid in drawing in the maximum amount of gas from the passenger compartment 195 through inlet ports 135.
      <br/>
      Using this design, total pumping ratios of up to 10:1 of passenger compartment to generated gas result and instantaneous ratios of up to 20:1 have been proven feasible.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      The deployment of the airbag 110 is timed so that, as shown in FIG. 2D, after the airbag 110 is fully inflated and the gas generator 120 has stopped generating gas, i.e., all of the propellant 127 has been burned, the occupant begins to press against the deployed and inflated airbag 110.
      <br/>
      As a result of the impact of the occupant against the inflated airbag 110, the gas in the airbag 110 begins to flow back through the nozzle 115 defined by spring shields 155 and walls 160 and back out into the passenger compartment 195 through the aspiration inlet ports 135, which thus function as outlet ports at this juncture.
      <br/>
      In view of absence of gas flow from the gas generator 120, the nozzle 115 defined by spring shields 155 and walls 160 is smaller than during the flow of gas from the gas generator 120 and, the support springs 145 pull walls 160 closer to the base 114 thereby reducing the size of aspiration inlet ports 135.
      <br/>
      By this method and design, the flow resistance of the aspiration inlet ports 135 for this return flow will, by design of the support springs 145, be optimum regardless of the particular propellant used or the particular airbag geometry.
      <br/>
      Naturally other geometries and structures are possible which, for example, entirely close off the exhaust ports after the gas generation has stopped and only open when the pressure within the airbag increases above a designed value.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      Thus, after the propellant 127 in the tube 121 has finished burning, as a result of a pressure difference between the area proximate and within the gas generator 120 and the interior of the airbag 110, the gas inside the airbag 110 will be caused to flow back through the aspiration inlet ports 135, in a direction opposite to that during inflation of the airbag 110, gradually exhausting the gas from the airbag 110.
      <br/>
      This only happens, however, when the pressure in the gas generator 120 drops indicative of the end of the burning process.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the gases produced by the gas generator 120 are always cooled by the aspirated air through inlet ports 135 and there is no need for cooling screens inside of the gas generator 120.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      If an occupant interacts with the airbag 110 during its initial inflation phase before the cover 150 is expelled in one preferred design, the pressure in the chamber 130 will rise, the flow of gas into the airbag 110 in preparation for deployment will be stopped, and gas from the gas generator 120 will flow out through aspiration inlet ports 135.
      <br/>
      This construction prevents injury to an occupant who is loading the cover 150, i.e., resting against the same, prior to inflation of the airbag 110 in the manner described above.
      <br/>
      In current airbag module designs, if an occupant loads the airbag cover or casing, the pressure will continue to build up behind the cover until thousands of pounds of force are available to force the cover open and thereby injure or kill the "out-of-position" occupant.
      <br/>
      In another preferred design, the aspiration inlet ports are not uncovered until after the cover is released and the airbag is partially deployed.
      <br/>
      Since the total motion of the module surface is still small compared with conventional airbag modules, the injury sustained by the occupant is minimized.
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      An additional advantage to using the aspirating ports 135 as the exhaust ports for an "out-of-position" occupant is that gas does not start flowing out of the airbag 110 until the gas generator 120 stops producing gas.
      <br/>
      In contrast, in current airbag module designs the gas begins flowing out of the airbag immediately as the airbag is being inflated.
      <br/>
      The design that is described herein, therefore, conserves inflator gas and permits the use of a smaller amount of propellant in the inflator.
      <br/>
      The combination of this effect and pressure compensation effect described above can reduce the propellant required to inflate the airbag by a factor of two or more, thus again substantially reducing the size and cost of the inflator and the quantity of toxic gases which are exhausted into the passenger compartment and widening the class of propellants available for use with airbags.
      <br/>
      The total compartment pressure rise which results from the deployment of multiple airbags is also substantially reduced.
      <br/>
      However, even if a significant amount of toxic gas is exhausted into the passenger compartment during deployment of the airbag, the sensor and diagnostic module 180 may be coupled to a number of different arrangements for reducing the concentration of toxic gas in the passenger compartment resulting from the deployment of multiple airbags or unconventionally large airbags (which aspect is discussed in greater detail below).
      <br/>
      Thus, the airbag module 100 described above may be implemented in a comprehensive airbag system in connection with a toxic gas reducing arrangement.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      As discussed above, in some situations with conventional inflators, but not with the inflator of this invention, the occupant may be so out-of-position as to be already leaning against the airbag module when the sensor and diagnostic module signals that the airbag should be deployed.
      <br/>
      This is a particularly serious situation since deceleration of the vehicle may cause the occupant to exert a significant force against the airbag cover preventing it from opening.
      <br/>
      The inflator module will begin producing gas and if the flow out of the inflator module is resisted, the pressure in the inflator module will increase even exceeding about 1000 psi if necessary until the resistance is overcome and the cover opens.
      <br/>
      This can result in very large forces against the head or chest of the occupant and result in serious injury or even death.
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      Several inflator designers and manufacturers are experimenting with variable output inflators where the gas flow from the inflator is reduced.
      <br/>
      However, this will not solve this problem but only delay the pressure buildup for a few milliseconds with the same eventual catastrophic results.
      <br/>
      The design used herein eliminates this problem since even though the occupant may load one portion of the cover 150 at one location in the longitudinal direction of the cover 150 preventing it from opening by the release of latch 152, and even if he were able to entirely block the removal of the cover 150, the build-up of gas in the module 100 will cause a slight bulge in the cover 150 causing it to pop free of the base 114 and the gas will begin flowing out through inlet ports 135 as soon as the pressure exceeds a design value which is significantly below that required to oppose the force of an occupant leaning against the airbag module cover 150.
      <br/>
      Note, however, for many of the preferred mounting locations of the airbag module 100 of this invention, such as on the ceiling of the vehicle, it is very difficult for the occupant to get into a position where lie/she is against the module cover 150.
      <br/>
      Also, note that for some applications, some additional motion of the cover is permitted in order to permit an initial airbag deployment before the aspiration begins.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      In conventional airbag module designs, the cover is cut open during the deployment process.
      <br/>
      The expulsion method used here has the advantage of simplicity since no cutting of the material is necessary and it also permits a rapid opening of the aspiration inlet ports which is important to the inflator design disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      If properly designed, the cover release mechanism requires little force to release the cover and yet is very difficult to detach from outside the module.
      <br/>
      Thus, the cover is released before significant pressures occur in the module, reducing the danger of deployment-induced injuries to the occupants.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      Another preferred embodiment of the invention in which there is sufficient space for the formation of aspirating channels behind the mounting surface on which the airbag module is mounted is illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B. Aside from the direction of movement of the airbag module 100 to open aspirating channels, the operation of this embodiment is essentially the same as the embodiment discussed above.
      <br/>
      However, in contrast to the embodiment in FIGS. 2A-2H, in this case, the gas generator 120 and base 114 are displaceable and are moved away from a mounting surface 190 in one direction during airbag deployment whereas the airbag 110 is deployed in an opposite direction.
      <br/>
      To enable this relative movement of the gas generator 120 and base 114 relative to the fixed mounting surface 190, the leg portion l60a2 of each of the walls 160 is attached to the mounting surface 190.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3A, the base 114 is mounted in engagement with the mounting surface 190 on one side thereof, which is the side to which the walls 160 extend.
      <br/>
      On the opposite side of the mounting surface 190, the latches 152 are mounted so that the cover 150 is detachably connected to the mounting surface 190 by tabs 153 engaging with the latches 152.
      <br/>
      Thus, in this embodiment, instead of connecting the base 114 to, e.g., the ceiling of the vehicle as in FIG. 1, the walls 160 are connected to the mounting location, such as the instrument panel or knee bolster structure, of the vehicle and would not be substantially displaced during deployment of the airbag 110.
      <br/>
      In this context, the instrument panel of the vehicle is defined so as to include the knee bolster area of the vehicle from which airbags used as knee bolsters would be deployed.
    </p>
    <p num="140">In an alternative embodiment, the inflator module 110 can be mounted in a position with the aspirating ports 135 open providing there is sufficient space available and thus, this invention is not limited to the preferred embodiments whereby the inflator module 110 expands on deployment.</p>
    <p num="141">
      One particular application for the design of FIG. 3A is for use as a knee protection airbag as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 illustrates a preferred embodiment of the present invention used as a knee protection device for the front driver and passenger occupants.
      <br/>
      The airbag module is shown deployed generally at 200 in FIG. 4 and includes an airbag 210.
      <br/>
      The airbag 210 is designed to interact with the driver's knees, not shown, and with the body of an occupant who may be lying down, also not shown.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the airbag 210 protects not only the knees of the driver from injury but also protects a child lying on the front seat, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      Knee airbags have heretofore been commercially used only as part of the front passenger airbag system where they have been inside of and in conjunction with the passenger airbag and inflated by the passenger airbag inflator.
      <br/>
      Current front passenger airbag systems are all mid or high mount systems where it is no longer convenient to mount a knee airbag inside of the passenger airbag or to use the same inflator.
      <br/>
      The exemplifying embodiment shown in FIG. 4 uses a separate airbag system with its own inflator.
      <br/>
      This is only now made practical by the low cost efficient airbag module design disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      The airbag module 200 for controlling inflation of the knee airbag 210 may have any of the constructions disclosed herein.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      FIG. 5 illustrates another possible mounting location for the airbag module, shown generally at 300, in accordance with the invention and including a deployable airbag 310.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the airbag 310 will be deployed from the ceiling in the event of a side impact of sufficient severity that an occupant's head would otherwise be injured.
      <br/>
      This implementation is significant since the airbag for the front and rear seats are combined, i.e., the airbag deploys along substantially the entire side of the vehicle alongside both the front seat and the rear seat, which results in significantly greater protection in side impacts when the windows are broken.
      <br/>
      The airbags are less likely to project outside of the windows if they are restrained by the B-pillar 320 and other vehicle structures such as the A-pillar 322 as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      This support is achieved since the module extends forward almost to the windshield and is mounted adjacent to but somewhat away from the side of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      When the airbag deploys, therefore, it is partially restrained by the A-pillar further aiding the retention of the occupant's head within the vehicle.
      <br/>
      As noted above, airbag 310 may comprise a number of airbags controlled to deploy simultaneously by means of a common inflator system and the airbag module 300 for controlling inflation of the side airbag 310 may have any of the constructions disclosed herein.

      As discussed above, the steering wheel and steering column are among the most dangerous objects in the automobile.
      <br/>
      Even with airbags and seatbelts many people are still injured and killed by an impact with a steering wheel rim, spokes or hub, or by the airbag as it is deployed from the steering wheel hub.
      <br/>
      The steering column also significantly interferes with the operation of many knee bolster designs causing significant leg and knee injuries.
      <br/>
      With today's technology, neither the steering wheel nor steering column are necessary and only bring harm to drivers.
      <br/>
      Naturally, a substantial educational program is necessary to wean people away from the false feeling of security of a substantial steering wheel and steering column.
      <br/>
      However, if it can be shown to the population that a vehicle with a servo electronic steering system (called steer-by-wire) is considerably safer, then the battle can be won.
      <br/>
      Such a system is commnon in commercial aircraft although a steering wheel is still usually used.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      One implementation of a driver protection airbag system which is deployed from the ceiling 490 coupled with a steer-by-wire system is illustrated at 400 in FIG. 6 which is a partial cutaway view of a driver in an automobile.
      <br/>
      The conventional steering wheel and column have been eliminated from this vehicle and a thinner, lighter steering wheel 460, which projects from an instrument panel 470, is provided instead.
      <br/>
      The steering wheel 460 is attached to a deformable column 480 which is supported by the instrument panel 470.
      <br/>
      In the event of an accident, the steering column 480 easily bends at the connection point 482 with the instrument panel 470 and permits the steering wheel 460 to be displaced or to be rotated out of the way, i.e., to make room for the deploying airbag as illustrated in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a single airbag 410 is deployed downward from the ceiling 490 to protect all occupants in the front seat of the vehicle, and thus is elongate extending substantially across the entire width of the passenger compartment of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="146">
      If some energy absorption is desired, the steering wheel support 480 can be made in the form of an elastica spring which has the property that it will provide a nearly constant force versus deflection relationship which can be designed to aid the energy absorption of the airbag.
      <br/>
      The steering wheel and support in FIG. 6 is shown with the airbag wrapped around which somewhat reduces the energy absorption effects of the airbag.
      <br/>
      Other implementations are to pull the steering wheel into the instrument panel space using pyrotechnics, a mechanical linkage (as in the Pro-Con-Tem system) or to release the support so that the airbag itself moves the steering wheel out of the way.
      <br/>
      Naturally, if alternate steering systems can be sold to the public, the steering wheel and support can be eliminated entirely and replaced by a device mounted onto or between the seats or on the floor, for example.
      <br/>
      Even steering mechanisms mounted to the door or ceiling are possible.
      <br/>
      Many other steering systems which do not interfere with the airbag will now be evident to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      FIG. 7 illustrates the positions of front and rear seat airbags as well as of the steering wheel and steering support after the airbags have deployed and the occupants have begun moving forward.
      <br/>
      Deployment of the front and rear seat airbags may be controlled to occur simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      FIG. 8 illustrates another implementation of the airbag module of this invention.
      <br/>
      In this case the module 510 is mounted to the rear of the front seats 525 of the vehicle and is designed for those cases where a ceiling mounted system is not desired or practical.
      <br/>
      In this case, two airbag modules 510 are provided, one in the back of each of the front seats 525.
      <br/>
      Naturally, a single airbag can be used for vehicles with bench seats.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      A primary advantage of the linear, elongated module disclosed herein is that it can be mounted on the surface of the ceiling, instrument panel, seat back, or other appropriate surface.
      <br/>
      In some cases, the module is literally attached to the mounting surface while more commonly it is recessed so that the surface of the module is approximately flush with the surrounding surfaces prior to deployment.
      <br/>
      In most cases, however, the depth of penetration into the mounting surface will be small and less than 1/5 of the module length and in most cases less than 1/10 of the module length.
      <br/>
      For the purposes of this disclosure, therefore, mounting on a surface will mean mounting so that the penetration into the surface will be less than 1/5 of the module length.

    <p num="150">
      The preferred material for the gas generator housing of this invention is steel in order to withstand the pressure and temperature from the burning propellant.
      <br/>
      It is possible to make the inflator housing from a high temperature plastic, however, the propellant tube in this case will be considerably thicker.
      <br/>
      Plastic can be used in the inflator of this invention since the propellants generally used burn completely in a very short time period and do not leave a hot residue.
      <br/>
      Thus, there is little time for the heat to penetrate into the plastic housing.
      <br/>
      For this same reason, the inflator of this invention can be mounted adjacent to combustible materials without fear of starting a fire.
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      In the preferred embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 of the airbag module of this invention, the length of the module was approximately the same as the length of the airbag.
      <br/>
      This permits the airbag, especially if made of film, to be easily rolled or folded with the portions of the airbag which project beyond the module easily accommodated without the special endwise folding required in conventional inflators.
      <br/>
      This results in a uniform geometry and symmetry for the airbag module and permits the module to be easily made in any convenient length.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the long thin design permits the module to be bent somewhat so as to conform to the surface of the location where it is mounted.
      <br/>
      This geometry also permits the airbag to unfold much more easily and in considerably less time than with conventional designs.
      <br/>
      Thus, the airbag system of this invention can be deployed in less time with less force and thus with less danger of deployment induced injuries than with conventional designs.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      In a particular example used in this application, the cover is mechanically pushed off by the expansion of the airbag, or the displacement of the module, progressively from one end to the other much like a zipper.
      <br/>
      In other applications it may be required to pyrotechnically cut or eject the cover which would require separate pyrotechnic devices.
      <br/>
      Also, in the examples illustrated herein, the module cover has been pushed off and removed from the module.
      <br/>
      Although this is the preferred method, other designs could remove the cover by cutting an opening in the material which covers the module.
      <br/>
      In such cases, the existence of the module could be completely hidden through the use of a seamless covering and only cut open when it is required for deployment of the airbag.
      <br/>
      For the purposes herein, therefore, removal of the cover will include any method by which an opening is provided to permit the airbag to deploy.

      The propellant and gas generator assembly has been shown with an approximate rectangular cross section so that once the propellant begins burning the surface area neither decreases or increases as the inflator propellant is consumed.
      <br/>
      In some cases, it may be desirable to vary the burn rate of the propellant by changing the surface area which is burning.
      <br/>
      If the cross section area of the inflator, and thus of the propellant, were made triangular, for example, with a wider base and narrower top, the rate of gas generation would increase as the propellant burns.
      <br/>
      Conversely, if the base of the propellant were narrower then the top, the opposite would occur and the propellant will begin burning fast and slow down with time.
      <br/>
      Naturally, the shape of the inflator housing can be infinitely varied to achieve any reasonable variation in propellant burn rate with time desired.
      <br/>
      For complicated shapes it is necessary to cast the propellant in place in the tube which also helps the propellant to adhere to the surfaces of the gas generator housing.

      It is also noted that U.S. Pat. No. 5,060,973 discloses the use of a liquid propellant patent.
      <br/>
      Central to this patent is the method of injecting the liquid from its container into a combustion chamber.
      <br/>
      A liquid propellant has an important advantage that many such propellants, and the particular one disclosed in this patent, burn without producing solid particles which could clog the high pressure nozzle or burn holes in a film airbag.
      <br/>
      The purpose of the injection system is to control the burning rate of the fuel.
      <br/>
      In solid fuel inflators, this is done by shaping the surface of the propellant as discussed above.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      The burning surface can also be controlled in the geometry of the inflator in accordance with the present invention by increasing the viscosity of the liquid through an emulsifying process or, alternately, by placing a solid matrix within the tube which is non-combustible such as one made from glass fibers.
      <br/>
      These fibers therefore serve to hold the liquid propellant in a position where the burning surface area is known and thus the burning rate controlled.
      <br/>
      Naturally, other methods of controlling the liquid burn rate without resorting to an injection system will now become apparent to those skilled in the art.

      Tabs 153 are placed in the cover to interlock with corresponding catches 152 on the module housing base.
      <br/>
      When pressure builds beneath the airbag, it causes the airbag to bulge pulling tabs 152 out of engagement with catches 152 in the progressive manner as described above.
      <br/>
      The cover is then free to move and will in general be projected downward by the deploying airbag.
      <br/>
      It has a low density, however, and will not cause injury even if it impacts an occupant.
    </p>
    <p num="158">
      In the example shown in FIG. 9, the cover 150 can be attached to the airbag by an adhesive or other suitable means.
      <br/>
      When the airbag deploys the cover adheres to the airbag on the side away from the occupant thereby generally preventing interaction between the occupant and the cover.
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      With the development of the film airbag as described in the copending patent applications referenced above, and the inflator design described herein, a very thin airbag module is possible which can be made in any length.
      <br/>
      Typically, the module length will exceed about 10 to 20 times the width or thickness of the module, and in all cases at least about 5 times.
      <br/>
      The length of the gas generator will typically be about 40 to 80 times its thickness and in all cases at least about 10 times.
      <br/>
      This shape permits the module to be easily mounted in many locations and to be bent or curved to match the interior shape of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      For example, one could be positioned so as to conform to the ceiling to protect rear seat occupants.
      <br/>
      Another one could stretch the length of the car on each side to protect both front and rear occupants from head injuries in side impacts.
      <br/>
      A similar system can be used for a deployable knee bolster, and eventually a single module can be used for both the passenger and driver in frontal impacts when used in conjunction with an servo electronic steer-by-wire system, for example.
      <br/>
      With the economics described above, airbags of this type would be very inexpensive, perhaps one-fifth to one-tenth the cost of current airbag systems offering comparable, or inferior, protection.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      The airbags described herein would be easily and inexpensively replaceable.
      <br/>
      They would require only a single connection to the vehicle safety system.
      <br/>
      Although the bags themselves would not be reusable, in some cases the airbag covers could be.
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      The designs illustrated herein are simple and because of their small cross-section can be easily mounted to conform to interior vehicle surfaces.
      <br/>
      They are very efficient, in some cases requiring less than 1/10 of the amount of propellant which is required by competitive conventional systems.
      <br/>
      The particular designs are also easily manufactured.
      <br/>
      Since they use less propellant, the noise and problems with high pressures when multiple airbags are deployed are greatly reduced.
      <br/>
      They also offer protection in cases such as the sleeping child which has heretofore not been available.
      <br/>
      These designs as disclosed herein, therefore, provide all of the objects and advantages sought.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      Furthermore, several different airbags are shown for protecting occupants of the vehicle, i.e., the rear airbag 100 shown in FIG. 1, the knee airbag 210 shown in FIG. 4, the side airbag 310 shown in FIG. 5 and the front seat airbag 410 shown in FIG. 6 Simultaneous deployment of any combination of or even all of these airbags may be initiated by the sensor and diagnostic module 180 upon determining that a crash requiring deployment of such airbag(s) is required.
      <br/>
      Thus, the sensor and diagnostic module 180 may determine that deployment of only the front airbag, knee airbag and the side airbag are desired, for example in the case of a frontal crash, or possibly only the side and rear seat airbags in the event of a side impact.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, sensor and diagnostic module 180 may be designed to detect frontal impacts requiring deployment of airbags as well as side impacts requiring deployment of airbags and rear impacts requiring deployment of airbags.
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      In the following, a vehicle having multiple airbags, preferably arranged in connection with any one of the constructions of the airbag module described above (but which arrangement is not essential to the invention), is described in conjunction with toxic gas reducing arrangements which serve to reduce the concentration of toxic gas in the passenger compartment during or after deployment of the airbags.
      <br/>
      These toxic gas reducing arrangements may of course also be used even for vehicle with only a single airbag.
    </p>
    <p num="164">
      A perspective view of a vehicle having several deployed airbags for both front and side protection is shown in FIG. 10. The vehicle includes frontal protection airbags 1110,1112,1120,1122 and side/head protection airbags 1130,1132, each of which is coupled to an airbag module (not shown) whereby each module may include one or more airbags as well as gas generation means for inflating the airbag(s), attachment means for attaching the airbag to and in fluid communication with the gas generator means and initiation means for initiating the gas generator means in response to a crash of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      A rear window 1170 of the vehicle has been broken or ejected for the reasons and in the manner described below.
      <br/>
      The driver side frontal airbag 1110 has been deployed as well as the ceiling mounted side head protection airbag 1130.
      <br/>
      In this case, the sensing system for controlling the deployment of the airbags, not shown but which is coupled to all of the airbag modules, detected that the crash had an angular component which might have resulted in head injuries to the occupant from impacts with an A-pillar 1140 or a side window 1150 of the vehicle, so the sensing system determined that deployment of the side head protection airbags 1130 and 1132 was warranted, along with deployment of the frontal protection airbags 1110, 1120 and 1122.
      <br/>
      The front passenger seat was unoccupied, which was detected by the occupant position sensor, not shown, and therefore the corresponding frontal protection airbag 1112 and left side protection airbags (not shown) were not deployed.
      <br/>
      Since both rear seats were occupied, the appropriate rear seat protection airbags 1132, 1120 and 1122 were deployed.
      <br/>
      It is thus possible to selectively control or determine which airbags of a plurality of airbags, e.g., side/head protection airbags, frontal protection airbags, in a passenger compartment of a vehicle should be deployed depending on the crash conditions to thereby avoid unnecessary airbag deployment.
      <br/>
      Although the sensing system which determines which airbags require deployment is not shown, this system may include or be connected to occupant sensing means for sensing which seats are occupied.
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      As described above and in patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/247,763, a desirable inflator for use in this airbag system is of the non-sodium azide highly aspirated type and the most desirable airbags are made from plastic films.
      <br/>
      By using such inflators, the pressure rise in the passenger compartment resulting from deployment of the airbag is kept to a minimum.
      <br/>
      If the pressure rise is still excessive, it is easily vented by the removal of the glass from the rear window 1170 by suitable means as described below.
      <br/>
      In this case, even though multiple toxic inflators are used, the concentration of toxic gas in the vehicle is quickly reduced as a result of the absence of the window 1170 and the fact that the inflator gases are hotter than the ambient temperature and thus rise to the ceiling and then flow out of the broken window 1170.
    </p>
    <p num="166">
      Obviously, although the rear window 1170 was chosen for removal, any of the side windows could also have been chosen or even a sunroof if one is present, and even though a single window was chosen, multiple windows could also be removed or forcibly broken.
      <br/>
      In some cases described below, the glass in the window will be broken and in others it will be ejected.
      <br/>
      If the window is made from tempered glass, it will break into small harmless pieces which will be ejected from the vehicle due to the higher pressure within the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="167">
      The airbag systems shown in FIG. 10 provide protection of the occupant against impacts with various vehicle structural members such as the A-pillar, B-pillar and C-pillar (see the definitions above).
      <br/>
      Federal law now requires protection from impacts with these pillars which is difficult to achieve due to the limited space available for padding and therefore the law is weak and thus not very effective.
      <br/>
      A side impact airbag such as 1130 coming down from the ceiling can offer excellent protection from impacts with these pillars.
      <br/>
      For this reason, it will be desirable in many cases to deploy the side bags when the frontal impact airbag is deployed since a significant number of occupants are still being injured in frontal impacts, even though the airbag deployed, by impacts with the A-pillar and the B-pillar.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      The airbag system shown in FIG. 10 includes airbags coming out of the steering wheel, the ceiling and the back of the front seat.
      <br/>
      It is obvious though that airbag modules can be mounted at other locations in the passenger compartment such as the lower instrument panel for knee protection or the ceiling for driver protection or rear passenger protection, as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      FIGS. 11A, 11B and 11C illustrate various methods by which the glass in a window can be removed, in order to provide for a reduction in the pressure generated in the passenger compartment by the deployment of airbags as well to enable the exhaust of toxic gases therefrom.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 11A, a fragmented partially schematic cross section view of a pyrotechnic window breaking mechanism is illustrated generally at 1200.
      <br/>
      It comprises a wire 1212 leading from a vehicle crash sensor system shown schematically at 1214 and an electric squib, primer or detonator 1210 which is housed in a housing and is positioned against a portion of window glass 1215.
      <br/>
      When the sensor system 1214 determines that the vehicle is experiencing a crash, for which deployment of an airbag is warranted.
      <br/>
      It sends a signal to the airbag module, not shown, and a separate circuit also carries a current or other electronic signal to the window breaking squib 1210 through wire 1212.
      <br/>
      When the squib 1210 is ignited a small but strong shock impulse is transmitted to the glass surface which is sufficient to shatter the window 1215.
      <br/>
      As noted above, the squib represents the entire class of electrically initiated pyrotechnic devices capable of releasing sufficient energy to cause a vehicle window to break.
      <br/>
      Some such devices, for example, use a heated bridge wire while others use a semiconductor bridge or a laser initiation system.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      In FIG. 11B, an electromechanical window breaking mechanism is illustrated generally at 1220 and comprises a housing abutting against a portion of window glass 1215.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a current or other signal from the vehicle crash sensor system 1214 releases a spring loaded impacting plunger 1222 arranged in the housing and having a hardened sharp tip 1224 similar to a machinist's center punch.
      <br/>
      When the tip 1224 travels through a release aperture in the housing and impacts the glass 1215, it causes the glass 1215 to shatter.
      <br/>
      An alternative to the electrical release of the plunger 1222 would be to use a mechanical sensor which responds to the crash itself It is well known that a spring loaded center punch if impinged onto a window of an automobile will shatter the glass.
      <br/>
      Their use by vandals and thieves for this purpose is why their sale to the general public is not permitted in at least one state.
    </p>
    <p num="171">
      Another method for removing the glass from a window is illustrated in FIG. 11C which is a fragmented cross section view of a window release mechanism where the window is completely ejected from the vehicle when the pressure in the vehicle exceeds a predetermined design value.
      <br/>
      This value is selected such that the window can only be ejected if more than two airbags are deployed.
      <br/>
      In this case, pressure on the glass surface 1215 creates a force along edges 1216 of the glass which is normally positioned within a mounting structure and retained therein by a gasket 1217.
      <br/>
      When that force exceeds the retaining force of the mounting gasket 1217, the window is released and is ejected by the gas pressure within the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="172">
      An alternate method to enable removal of glass during deployment of more than one airbag as a result of excessive pressure generated within the passenger compartment by deploying airbags is to design the temper in the glass so that if the glass is stressed by internal vehicle pressure above a predetermined amount, the outer surface of the window would be placed into tension at which point it shatters.
      <br/>
      The breaking of a vehicle window is not a serious condition and in fact it almost always happens in side impact accidents where an airbag is desired.
      <br/>
      In another implementations, not shown, the force created by the pressure on the entire window or door surface is used to deform all or part of a mechanism to the point that a spring loaded impacting pin is released to shatter the window in a similar manner as described above.
      <br/>
      Naturally, other methods will now be obvious to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="173">
      As discussed above, in addition to providing a release for the excessive pressure associated with the deployment of multiple airbags, a prime reason for creating a large opening in the vehicle in the event of an accident, is to permit the use of propellants other than sodium azide whereby toxic gases produced by these propellants would be exhausted from the passenger compartment through the broken or removed window.
      <br/>
      If the passenger compartment of the vehicle is vented, vis-a-vis the aperture created by the shattered or removed glass, nitrocellulose, nitroguanidine, and other double and triple base formulations, tetrazole (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,909,549 to Poole et al.) or similar propellants can be used for all of the inflators in the airbag system in view of the fact that the passenger compartment is no longer sealed and any toxic gases would be vented out of the passenger compartment.
      <br/>
      This is not done now because of the excessive amount of carbon dioxide, and other contaminants, which are produced and the requirement that the gas in the passenger compartment be breathable for some set period such as one hour.
      <br/>
      If one of the above propellants is used in conjunction with a glass shattering or removal system, the size and weight of an inflator could be reduced by a factor of two or more and, if efficient aspirating systems are also used, an additional factor of about four can be achieved resulting in an inflator which is about one eighth the size of conventional inflators.
    </p>
    <p num="174">
      An alternate method of eliminating the buildup of toxic gas in the passenger compartment is to exhaust one or more of the airbags out of the vehicle as shown in one example in FIG. 12. In this embodiment, the gas in ceiling-mounted airbag 1310 is exhausted into a vent 1330 located in a ceiling 1340 of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Vent 1330 leads outside of the vehicle and thus as the airbag 1310 deflates the gas does not enter the vehicle passenger compartment where it would be breathed by the occupants.
      <br/>
      Naturally, this technique could be used by other airbags which are mounted in the door or instrument panel.
      <br/>
      There has been a reluctance to use this technique for the front passenger frontal impact protection airbag since this would require that a hole be placed in the firewall partially defeating the very purpose of the firewall which is to prevent fumes or even flames from the engine compartment from entering the passenger compartment.
      <br/>
      This would not be a problem for the ceiling or door mounted airbags.
    </p>
    <p num="175">
      An example of a knee airbag is illustrated in FIG. 13 which is a perspective view of a knee restraint airbag illustrating the support of the driver's knees and also for a sleeping occupant lying on the passenger seat of the vehicle (not shown).
      <br/>
      The knee support airbag shown generally at 1400 comprises a film airbag 1410 which is composed of several smaller airbags 1411, 1412, 1413, and 1414 as disclosed above.
      <br/>
      Alternately, the knee airbag can be made from a single film airbag as disclosed in patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/539,676 referenced above.
      <br/>
      The knee support airbag can be much larger than airbags previously used for this purpose and, as a result, offers some protection for an occupant, not shown, who is lying asleep on the vehicle seat prior to the accident.
    </p>
    <p num="176">
      With the development of the film airbag and the inflator design above, a very thin airbag module becomes possible as disclosed in patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/247,763 referenced above.
      <br/>
      Such a module can be made in any length permitting it to be used at many locations within the vehicle.
      <br/>
      For example, one could be positioned on the ceiling to protect rear seat occupants.
      <br/>
      Another one would stretch the length of the car on each side to protect both front and rear occupants from head injuries in side impacts.
      <br/>
      A module of this design lends itself for use as a deployable knee restraint as shown in FIG. 13. Eventually, especially when drive-by-wire systems are implemented and the steering wheel and column are redesigned or eliminated, such an airbag system will be mounted on the ceiling and used for the protection of all of the front seat passengers and driver in frontal impacts.
      <br/>
      With the economics described above, airbags of this type will be very inexpensive, perhaps one-fifth the cost of current airbag modules offering similar protection.
    </p>
    <p num="177">
      As mentioned above, when multiple airbags are deployed in a crash, the sound pressure level becomes excessive to the point that injuries to human car drums can result.
      <br/>
      To minimize such injuries, airbag system designers have resorted to staging the deployment of the driver and passenger airbags so that the peak deployment noise pressure is reduced.
      <br/>
      These systems have the delay circuitry as part of the sensor and diagnostic circuitry which complicates the design of this circuitry and increases its cost and reduces the reliability of the system.
      <br/>
      An alternate and much simpler system is disclosed in FIG. 14A which is a detailed cross section view showing the inflator squib incorporating a pyroteclnic delay element.
    </p>
    <p num="178">
      FIG. 14 shows an airbag module 1510 having one airbag 1500 connected therewith, although it is of course possible to have a plurality of airbags connected to a single module, and the module is connected to sensor and diagnostic circuitry, shown schematically at 1580, which sends current or a signal to all of the airbag modules connected thereto which are to be deployed in a particular crash.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 14, module 1500 comprises the airbag 1510 and an inflator assembly 1520 coupled thereto.
      <br/>
      The inflator assembly 1520 comprises a chamber housing a propellant 1530, an initiator 1535 coupled through passages in the inflator assembly to the propellant 1530 and a squib assembly 1540 engaging with the initiator 1535.
      <br/>
      The squib assembly 1540 is connected to the sensor and diagnostic circuitry 1580 which will determine activation of the squib assembly 1540 and thus ignition of the propellant 1530 to generate gas for inflating the airbag 1500.
      <br/>
      The squib assembly 1540 is shown in an expanded view in FIG. 14A taken within the circle labeled 14A in FIG. 14. The squib assembly 1540 comprises a burn-wire electrically initiated squib 1541 and a pyroteclnic delay element 1542 adjacent thereto.
      <br/>
      The squib 1541 is spaced and isolated from the initiator 1535 by the delay element 1542 thereby avoiding premature initiation.
      <br/>
      The delay element 1542 is capable of providing any desired delay from fractions of a millisecond to several milliseconds and is sometimes made from a coiled tube containing a propellant or other pyrotechnic material.
      <br/>
      Such delay devices are well known to those skilled in the art of designing pyrotechnic delays primarily for military uses.
    </p>
    <p num="179">
      An alternate mechanical method can be used since pyrotechnic delay elements yielding a few millisecond delay are expensive.
      <br/>
      One embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 14B which shows a delay producing device where the electric squib assembly 1540 causes the ignition of a burn-wire electrically initiated squib 1541 which upon ignition releases a firing pin 1546.
      <br/>
      The firing pin 1546 is then propelled by a spring 1547 through a passage in the squib assembly 1540 into a stab primer 1548 which initiates deployment of the airbag, by means of the activation of the initiator 1535.
      <br/>
      The length of travel and the mass of the firing pin can be adjusted to provide the required delay.
      <br/>
      In the normal position, the squib 1541 retains the firing pin 1546 against the expansion force of the spring 1547.
    </p>
    <p num="180">
      The use of aspiration, where the gas to inflate the airbag is substantially obtained from the passenger compartment itself, is also desirable in order to reduce pressures and the amount of toxic gas within the passenger compartment of the vehicle, Aspiration systems are currently in use for passenger side frontal impact airbag systems, but the aspiration ratios are quite low.
      <br/>
      Typically, as discussed in detail above, only about 30% of the gas used to inflate the airbag comes from the passenger compartment with the remainder coming from the burning propellant.
      <br/>
      This percentage can be greatly increased by the careful design of the aspirating nozzle to where as much as about 90% or more of the gas comes from the passenger compartment as discussed above.
      <br/>
      The use of high aspiration ratios also permits the use of hotter gases from the gas generator since the vehicle passenger compartment air is used to dilute and thus cool the inflator gases.
      <br/>
      Thus, in general, the gas from the inflator does not need to be cooled and cooling screens are not needed.
    </p>
    <p num="181">
      If an airbag is attached to the vehicle ceiling and the inlet from the passenger compartment into the inflator takes the form of a narrow but long slit running along the length of the inflator, then an efficient design for the nozzle is possible as disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      In this case, the ports that are used for the gas flow from the passenger compartment to enter the airbag can also be used as the exit orifices for the gas to flow out of the airbag during the crash.
      <br/>
      An additional advantage results in this case in that the inflator gases are exhausted high in the passenger compartment of the vehicle making it even more likely that they will flow out of the vehicle through the window which has been broken open or removed for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p num="182">
      This is illustrated in FIG. 15 which is a perspective view of a ceiling mounted airbag system having exit ports at the ceiling level for gas to flow out of the airbag.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 15, a long thin airbag module 1600 is positioned in the vehicle ceiling as described herein.
      <br/>
      When the occupant presses against an airbag 1610 during the crash, pressure builds within the airbag 1610 causing the gas within the airbag to flow back through the module opening 1640 and into the passenger compartment 1650 at the ceiling level.
      <br/>
      Since the exiting gas is hot, it flows out of the rear window, not shown, which has been broken or removed, and thus out of the passenger compartment and into the atmosphere.
      <br/>
      By using the aspirating nozzle as an exit orifice, it is unnecessary to place vent holes within the airbag itself.
      <br/>
      This is particularly an advantage when film airbags are used.
    </p>
    <p num="183">
      In some implementations either due to the geometry of the vehicle, the inability to achieve high aspiration ratios, or the necessity to cool the inflator gases, the breaking of one or more windows may not be sufficient to remove enough of the toxic gases to pass the required breathability tests.
      <br/>
      The main toxic gas will be carbon dioxide which as it cools will settle in the lower parts of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      If an occupant, because of unconsciousness or for some other reason, has his mouth below the window level, he may be forced to breath an excessive amount of the toxic gas and be injured.
      <br/>
      For these cases, it is necessary to create an air passage lower in the vehicle than the possible locations of the occupant's mouth.
      <br/>
      One implementation is illustrated in FIG. 15 which is a partial view of the interior of a vehicle showing a blowout panel located in a low position in the passenger compartment.
    </p>
    <p num="184">
      As shown in FIG. 15, and in more detail in FIG. 15A, a hole 1680 has been pyrotechnically opened in a location below the seat by shattering a frangible seal in cover 1682 by means of a squib 1684.
      <br/>
      The squib 1684 is connected to and initiated by the same sensor and diagnostic circuitry which is used as discussed above for breaking the glass in a window.
      <br/>
      Naturally, many other techniques exist for creating an air passage low in the vehicle.
      <br/>
      In some cases, for example, it might even be desirable to blow open a vehicle door perhaps 10 seconds after the accident, which may be achieved by appropriate door opening mechanisms (represented schematically in FIG. 15 as 1686).
      <br/>
      This has the added advantage of helping to provide egress for injured occupants.
    </p>
    <p num="185">
      In rare cases, the ventilation provided by breaking a window even with the addition of a hole in the lower part of the passenger compartment is insufficient to remove the toxic gas in time to prevent any danger of injury to the occupants.
      <br/>
      When this occurs, a small electrically or pyrotechnically driven fan can be mounted in an opening 1690 as shown in FIGS. 15 and 15B.
      <br/>
      This fan shown at 1692 in FIG. 15B which is a partial perspective view of the fan assembly of FIG. 15. In the event of an accident which requires deployment of more than one airbag, a fan 1692 powered by the vehicle's electrical system through wires 1694 is turned on for a period of time to pull gas from the lower part of the vehicle forcing it to flow through doors 1696.
      <br/>
      Alternately, the fan can be powered by its own power supply comprising a battery or capacitor, or even by pyrotechnic means.
    </p>
    <p num="186">
      Naturally, if the total number of airbags deployed in an accident can be reduced, then the above disclosed methods of removing the toxic gas may not be required.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in another preferred embodiment of this invention, each airbag has an associated occupant position sensor to assure that there is an occupant present at a particular seating position before the airbags associated with that seating position are deployed.
      <br/>
      Generally, there would be no reason to deploy an airbag if the seat is unoccupied.
      <br/>
      More sophisticated versions of occupant position sensors can also determine out of position occupants, the presence of a rear facing child seat and of children laying on the seat.
    </p>
    <p num="187">
      In a refinement of this embodiment, more of the electronics associated with the airbag system is decentralized and housed within or closely adjacent to each of these airbag modules.
      <br/>
      Each module has its own electronic package containing a power supply and diagnostic and sometimes also the occupant sensor electronics.
      <br/>
      One sensor system is still used to initiate deployment of all airbags associated with the frontal impact.
      <br/>
      To avoid the detrimental noise effects of all airbags deploying at the same time, each module sometimes has its own, preferably pyrotechnic, delay as discussed above.
      <br/>
      The modules for the rear seat, for example, can have a several millisecond firing delay compared to the module for the driver, and the front passenger module can have a lesser delay.
      <br/>
      Each of the modules sometimes also has its own occupant position sensor and associated electronics.
      <br/>
      In this configuration, there is a minimum reliance on the transmission of power and data to and from the vehicle electrical system which is the least reliable part of the airbag system, especially during a crash.
      <br/>
      Once each of the modules receives a signal from the crash sensor system, it is on its own and no longer needs either power or information from the other parts of the system.
      <br/>
      The main diagnostics for a module can also reside within the module which transmits either a ready or a fault signal to the main monitoring circuit which now needs only to turn on a warning light if any of the modules either fails to transmit a ready signal or sends a fault signal.
    </p>
    <p num="188">
      The placement of electronic components in or near the airbag module is quite important.
      <br/>
      The placement of the occupant sensing as well as the diagnostics electronics within or adjacent to the airbag module has additional advantages to solving several current important airbag problems.
      <br/>
      There have been numerous inadvertent airbag deployments caused by wires in the system becoming shorted.
      <br/>
      Then, when the vehicle hits a pothole, which is sufficient to activate the arming sensor or otherwise disturb the sensing system, the airbag deploys.
      <br/>
      Such an unwanted deployment of course can directly injure an occupant who is out-of-position or cause an accident that results in occupant injuries.
      <br/>
      If the sensor were to send a coded signal to the airbag module rather than a DC voltage with sufficient power to trigger the airbag, and if the airbag module had stored within its electronic circuit sufficient energy to initiate the inflator, then these unwanted deployments would be prevented.
      <br/>
      A shorted wire cannot send a coded signal and the short can be detected by the module resident diagnostic circuitry.
    </p>
    <p num="189">
      This would require that the airbag module contain the backup power supply which further improves the reliability of the system since the electrical connection to the sensor, or to the vehicle power, can now partially fail, as might happen during an accident, and the system will still work properly.
      <br/>
      It is well known that the electrical resistance in the "clockspring" connection system, which connects the steering wheel mounted airbag module to the sensor and diagnostic system, is marginal in design and prone to failure.
      <br/>
      The resistance of this electrical confection must be very low or there will not be sufficient power to reliably initiate the inflator squib.
      <br/>
      To reduce the resistance to the level required, high quality gold plated connectors are used and the wires must also be of unusually high quality.
      <br/>
      Due to space constraints, however, these wires have only a marginally adequate resistance thereby reducing the reliability of the driver airbag module and increasing its cost.
      <br/>
      If, on the other hand, the power to initiate the airbag were already in the module then only a coded signal need be sent to the module rather than sufficient power to initiate the inflator.
      <br/>
      Thus, the resistance problem disappears and the module reliability is increased.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the requirements for the clockspring wires become less severe and the design can be relaxed reducing the cost and complexity of the device.
      <br/>
      It may even be possible to return to the slip ring system that existed prior to the implementation of airbags.
    </p>
    <p num="190">
      Under this system the power supply can be charged over a few seconds, since the power does not need to be sent to the module at the time of the required airbag deployment because it is already there.
      <br/>
      Thus, all of the electronics associated with the airbag system except the sensor and its associated electronics would be within or adjacent to the airbag module.
      <br/>
      This includes optionally the occupant sensor, the diagnostics and the backup power supply, which now becomes the primary power supply, and the need for a backup disappears.
      <br/>
      When a fault is detected a message is sent to a display unit located typically in the instrument panel.
    </p>
    <p num="191">
      The placement of the main electronics within each module follows the development path that computers themselves have followed from a large centralized mainframe base to a network of microcomputers.
      <br/>
      The computing power required by an occupant position sensor, airbag system diagnostics and backup power supply is greater than that required by a single point sensor.
      <br/>
      For this reason, it is more logical to put this electronic package within or adjacent to each module.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the advantages of a centralized single point sensor and diagnostic system fade since most of the intelligence will reside within or adjacent to the individual modules and not the centralized system.
      <br/>
      A simple and more effective CrushSwitch sensor such as disclosed in patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/024,076, for example, now becomes more cost effective than the single point sensor and diagnostic system which is now being widely adopted.
      <br/>
      Finally, this also is consistent with the migration to a bus system where the power and information are transmitted around the vehicle on a single bus system thereby significantly reducing the number of wires and the complexity of the vehicle wiring system.
      <br/>
      The decision to deploy an airbag is sent to the airbag module sub-system as a signal not as a burst of power.

    <p num="192">
      A partial implementation of the system as just described is depicted schematically in FIG. 16 which shows a view of the combination of an occupant position sensor and airbag module designed to prevent the deployment of the airbag for a seat which is unoccupied or if the occupant is too close to the airbag and therefore in danger of deployment induced injury.
      <br/>
      The module, shown generally at 1700, comprises an airbag 1710, an inflator assembly 1720 for the airbag 1710, an occupant position sensor containing an ultrasonic transmitter 1722 and an ultrasonic receiver 1724.
      <br/>
      The module 1700 also contains an electronic package 1730 coupled to each of the inflator assembly 1720, the transmitter 1722 and the receiver 1724 and which performs the functions of sending the ultrasonic signal to the transmitter 1722 and processing the data from the occupant position sensor receiver 1724.
      <br/>
      In addition, the electronic module monitors the power supply voltage, to assure that sufficient energy is stored to initiate the inflator assembly 1720 when required, and power the other processes, and reports periodically to the central diagnostic module, shown schematically at 1760, to indicate that the module is ready or sends a fault code if a failure has been detected.
      <br/>
      A CrushSwitch sensor is also shown schematically at 1880, which is the only discriminating sensor in the system.
      <br/>

      As mentioned above, several propellants, including nitrocellulose, nitroguanidine, and other double base and triple base formulations and tetrazole, now become candidates for use in vehicles with more than one airbag module.
      <br/>
      The main requirement for this invention is that the gases produced can be breathed for a short time by occupants without causing injury.
      <br/>
      The time period would of course depend on the vehicle and the method chosen for exhausting the toxic gas from the passenger compartment.
      <br/>
      All such propellants which fall into this class, that is propellants which can be safely breathed for short periods of time, are referred to here as toxic airbag propellants.
      <br/>
      Other propellants of course exist which are so toxic that they would never be considered as candidates for airbag inflators.
      <br/>
      This class of propellants are not even considered here and therefore fall outside the class of toxic airbag propellants as used herein.
      <br/>
      Toxic as applied to a gas for the purposes herein means non breathable for more than a few minutes without causing harm to humans.

      Although several preferred embodiments are illustrated and described above, there are possible combinations using other geometries, materials and different dimensions for the components that perform the same functions as described and illustrated herein.
      <br/>
      This invention is not limited to the above embodiments and should be determined by the following claims.
      <br/>
      For example, the reducing means for reducing the concentration of toxic gas in the passenger compartment of the vehicle in conjunction with deployment of the at least one airbag may be coupled to an element of the airbag module which would indicate deployment of the airbag or may be a completely separate system which is positioned to detect or sense deployment of the air bag and activate accordingly.
      <br/>
      Also, for example, although the airbag is described as being a film airbag, it must be understood that this is only a preferred embodiment and that the airbag can be made of any other material, even though this may detract from efficient operation of the airbag module.
      <br/>
      Lastly, a variety of different processes for inflating an airbag so as to provide a high pumping ratio, i.e., a high ratio of gas from the passenger compartment to pressurized gas from the inflator means, as well as to achieve the numerous objects mentioned above, are also within the scope of the invention disclosed herein as are different configurations of the electronic circuits.
      <br/>
      It is quite possible to house the passenger side electronic circuit within the passenger module instead of adjacent to it and it is also possible to house the electronic circuitry within either the passenger or driver electronic circuitry.

    <p num="197">
      Gas at high pressure and temperature is generated in the chamber of the inflator.
      <br/>
      This gas flows through a convergent-divergent nozzle, to emerge near the throat of a larger convergent-divergent nozzle.
      <br/>
      Both nozzles are two-dimensional and symmetric about the center plane.
      <br/>
      Passenger compartment air enters the larger nozzle and begins to mix with the inflator gas where the inflator gas emerges from its nozzle.
      <br/>
      At the end of a mixing section the two streams are substantially uniformly mixed.
      <br/>
      The mixing section is followed by a divergent section where some of the velocity of the mixed stream is converted back into pressure sufficient to fill the airbag.

      The inflator gas emerges from its nozzle as a supersonic jet at high speed and relatively low static pressure and temperature.
