      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to an organic electroluminescent device having excellent light-emitting properties.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      An organic electroluminescent device (which will hereinafter be called "organic EL device" ) is a light-emitting device which makes use of the principle that when an electric field is applied, a fluorescent material emits light in response to the charge recombination of holes injected from an anode and electrons injected from a cathode.
      <br/>
      After C. W. Tang et al. of Eastman Kodak Company reported a low-voltage-driven organic EL device using a double layered structure (C. W. Tang, S. A. Vanslyke, Applied Physics Letters, 51, 913(1987) and the like), studies on an organic EL device have been briskly carried out.
      <br/>
      Tang et al. reported an organic EL device using tris(8-hydroxyquinolinol aluminum) in a light-emitting layer and a triphenyldiamine derivative to a hole-transporting layer.
      <br/>
      This stacked structure gives such advantages as an improvement in the injection efficiency of holes into the light-emitting layer; blocking of electrons injected from a cathode, which increase the efficiency of exciton production from charge recombination; and confinement of the excitons into the light-emitting layer.
      <br/>
      A double layered structure composed of a hole-injecting and transporting layer and an electron-transporting and light-emitting layer or a triple layered structure composed of a hole-injecting and transporting layer, a light-emitting layer and an electron-injecting and transporting layer is well known as an organic EL device.
      <br/>
      In order to increase the recombination efficiency of injected holes and electrons, various improvements in the device structure or fabrication process have been introduced to such multi-layered devices.
      <br/>
      As a hole-transporting material, triphenylamine derivatives such as 4,4',4"-tris(3-methylphenylphenylamino)triphenylamine and aromatic diamine derivatives such as N,N'-diphenyl-N,N' bis(3-methylphenyl)-�1,1'-biphenyl�-4,4'-diamine, which are starburst molecules, are well known (e.g., Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 20771/1996, 40995/1996, 40997/1996, 53397/1996 and 87122/1996).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      As an electron-transporting material, oxadiazole derivatives, triazole derivatives and the like are well known.
      <br/>
      As a light-emitting material, known are chelate complexes such as tris(8-quinolinolate)aluminum complex, coumarin derivatives, tetraphenylbutadiene derivatives, bisstyrylarylene derivatives, oxadiazole derivatives and the like.
      <br/>
      Since various color light in a visible region from blue to red are obtained from these light-emitting materials, there increased expectation for industrialization of a full color organic EL device (e.g., Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 239655/1996, 138561/1995, 200289/1991 and the like).
      <br/>
      In recent days, organic EL devices with high brightness and long lifetime have been disclosed or reported, but any of them are not enough in these properties.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      An object of the present invention is to provide a material of high performance and to provide an organic EL device having high luminance.
      <br/>
      The present inventors have repeated experiments.
      <br/>
      As a result, they have found that an organic EL device having superior emission properties is obtained by using a specific 1,3-dibenzylideneindane compound as a light-emitting material.
      <br/>
      They have found that said 1,3-dibenzylideneindane compound has high carrier transporting properties and an organic EL device having superior emission properties is obtained by using said 1,3-dibenzylideneindane compound as a hole-transporting material or electron-transporting material.
      <br/>
      They have found that an organic EL device having superior emission properties is obtained by using a mixture of said 1,3-dibenzylideneindane compound and another hole or electron-transporting material.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, there is thus provided an organic electroluminescent device comprising an anode, a cathode and one or more than one organic thin-film layers including a light-emitting layer between said anode and said cathode, wherein at least one of said organic thin-film layers contains, either singly or as a mixture, a compound represented by the following formula (1):  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)

    <p num="25">
      The anode of the organic EL device injects holes into the hole-transporting layer and that having a work function of 4.5 eV or greater is effective.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of the anode material to be used for the organic EL device of the present invention include an indium tin oxide (ITO), tin oxide (NESA), gold, silver, platinum and copper.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      For the injection of electrons into the electron-transporting layer or light-emitting layer, the cathode of the organic EL device having a smaller work function is preferred.
      <br/>
      Although there is no particular limitation imposed on the cathode material, specific examples include indium, aluminum, magnesium, magnesium-indium alloy, magnesium-aluminum alloy, aluminum-lithium alloy, aluminum-scandium-lithium alloy and magnesium-silver alloy.
      <br/>
      The anode thickness is ordinarily within a range of 10 nm to 1  MU m, preferably 10 nm to 200 nm.
      <br/>
      The cathode thickness is ordinarily within a range of 10 nm to 1  MU m, preferably 50 nm to 200 nm.
      <br/>
      In the organic EL device of the present invention, either one of the anode or cathode is preferred to be transparent or semi-transparent, because such a cathode or anode can pass through an emitted light.
      <br/>
      No particular limitation is imposed on the material of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Any material that is ordinarily used as a substrate for the conventional EL device, such as glass, transparent plastics and quartz, can be used.
      <br/>
      There is no limitation on the thickness of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Each layer of the organic EL device according to the present invention can be fabricated by any method.
      <br/>
      Conventionally known methods such as vacuum deposition and spin coating can be employed.
      <br/>
      The organic thin-film layer which is to be used in the organic EL device of the present invention and contains the compound of formula (1) can be fabricated by a known method such as vacuum deposition, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or coating of a solution, which has been obtained by dissolving the compound or a mixture of the compound in a proper solvent, such as dipping, spin coating, casting, bar coating or roll coating.
      <br/>
      There is no particular limitation on the thickness of each organic layer of the organic EL device of the present invention.
      <br/>
      When the thickness of layer is too thin, defects such as pin holes tend to occur.
      <br/>
      When the thickness of layer is too thick, on the other hand, a high-applied voltage is required, which decreases the efficiency.
      <br/>
      Usually, the organic layers are therefore preferred to have a thickness within a range of several nm to 1  MU m.
