      This invent concerns new methods and compositions that are useful in treating inflammatory conditions, e.g., preventing and ameliorating cachexia, the clinical syndrome of poor nutritional status and bodily wasting associated with cancer and other chronic diseases.

    <p num="4">2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="5">
      Cachexia is a syndrome characterized by the wasting of tissue mass in diseased animals, and is grossly reflected as a loss of host weight.
      <br/>
      Cachexia is a progressive and often fatal complication found in many different chronic disease states and its consequences require that the goals of therapy should not be solely to redress the underlying disease.
      <br/>
      The loss of protein stores, loss of body weight and generally poor nutritional status of cachectic patients can be independent sources of morbidity and mortality.
      <br/>
      Also, the debilitation associated with cachexia is a significant limitation on the patient's ability to tolerate aggressive medical and surgical therapies which are directed to the primary etiology.
    </p>
    <p num="6">2.1. THE SIGNS OF CACHEXIA ARE DISTINCT FROM THOSE OF STARVATION</p>
    <p num="7">
      Cachexia is a severe, often life-threatening complication commonly encountered in association with a variety of insults: cancer, chemotherapy, radiation injury, chronic infection, trauma and surgical stress.
      <br/>
      Food intake insufficient to meet the total energy needs of the host is a constant element of the cachectic syndrome.
      <br/>
      In addition to this relative hypophagia which is a defining feature of cachexia, anorexia is also frequently encountered.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      However, studies of the syndrome indicate that cachexia is not simply due to a dietary intake of protein and carbohydrate below the needs of the host.
      <br/>
      Cachexia differs from unstressed caloric deprivation in that the pattern of wasting seen during partial or complete starvation is associated with an initial whole body lipid loss concurrent with a relative conservation of tissue protein.
      <br/>
      By contrast, cachexia is characterized by the significant loss of both lipid and protein from tissue reservoirs
    </p>
    <p num="9">2.2. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CACHEXIA AND STARVATION</p>
    <p num="10">
      The most commonly accepted general explanation for cachexia is that the host's proteins are broken down in the tissues to provide a source of amino acids.
      <br/>
      These amino acids in turn are thought to be needed for the synthesis of glucose, albumin and host defense proteins in the liver.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      This well-accepted theory suggests that therapies directed toward increasing the total intake of calories and proteins should substantially ameliorate the cachectic syndrome.
      <br/>
      However, even as drastic an intervention as total parenteral nutrition is not able to effectively treat cachexia. (Brennan, 1986 NEJM 305:375, Detsky, et al., 1987, ANN INTERN MED 107:195, McGeer, et al., 1989, ANN INTERN MED 110:734, Koretz, 1984, J CLIN ONCOL 2:534).
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In addition to the failure of supplementary nutrition as a therapeutic modality, the fundamental difference in the pattern of the losses of lipid and protein between cachexia and starvation also indicates that cachexia is neither the result solely of the abnormally increased nutritional needs due to the underlying disease nor of anorexia due to the disease's disruption of the physiologic regulation of appetite.
      <br/>
      Rather the differences suggest the presence of some fundamental changes in the host's metabolism due, directly or indirectly, to the underlying disease.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Further supporting this conclusion has been an accumulation of evidence implicating soluble host-produced regulatory and effector proteins, known as cytokines, in the chain of events which leads to cachexia.
      <br/>
      Experiments have been conducted in which the blood circulation of a normal and a cachectic animal were joined In these experiments with so-called "parabiosed" animals, it was observed that the otherwise normal animal rapidly developed cachexia although the underlying disease remains entirely with the original host.
      <br/>
      These and other observations strongly implicate circulating mediators as the proximal cause of cachexia, i.e., this catabolic condition is not the passive result of the excessive metabolic demands imposed by the growth of the invading cells or organisms, nor the simple result of a lesser food intake than that required to meet metabolic demands.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      One possibility as to the identity of these humoral factors was that the soluble mediators produced in cachexia were the same molecules as had been already identified as host immune/inflammatory-related molecules (cytokines), and shown to be secreted by lymphocytes and macrophages.
      <br/>
      The theory that these cytokines were involved in cachexia was confirmed by the observation that the administration of exogenous Tumor Necrosis Factor (also known as cachectin, herein abbreviated "TNF") to test animals mimicked many features of cachexia. (Darling et al., 1990, CANCER RES 50:4008; Beutler &amp; Cerami, 1988, ADV IMMUNOL 42:213).
      <br/>
      Further, anti-TNF antisera are able to ameliorate many, but not all, the signs of cachexia in experimental tumor systems. (Sherry, et al., 1989, FASEB J 3:1956; Langstein, et al., 1989, SURG FORUM 15:408).
    </p>
    <p num="15">2.3. THE IMPACT OF THE ROLE OF CYTOKINES IN CACHEXIA ON THE SEARCH FOR THERAPIES</p>
    <p num="16">
      It should be clear that even if all aspects of the cachectic syndrome were attributable to some single cytokine or, alternatively, to the activity of some combination of several cytokines, hormones and other humoral factors, such knowledge would not in and of itself provide a cellular or biochemical mechanism to explain the metabolic changes that underlie cachexia, nor lead directly to an effective therapy.
      <br/>
      Ultimately, cytokines must interact with target cells and induce metabolic or phenotypic changes in their targets to be of physiological and pathophysiological significance.
      <br/>
      Thus the general identification of cytokine mediation and the specific implications of particular cytokine mediators are only intermediate objectives in the determination of precisely what cellular and/or systemic metabolic changes occur to bring about the full cachectic picture.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The findings that implicate cytokines as mediators of the various cachectic syndromes, combined with the widespread focus on liver and peripheral muscle as major contributors to the metabolic changes of cachexia prompted many to look at the effects of known cytokines on liver and muscle cells and to search for new cytokines having an effect on these tissues.
      <br/>
      To date, however, no known cytokines, individually or in combination, have been shown to directly mobilize amino acids from protein stores in in vitro systems using cells typical of these presumed sites of protein breakdown in vivo.

      <br/>
      Insight into the diverse biological actions of NO has been facilitated by compounds that interfere with NOS to inhibit production of NO.
      <br/>
      Because the NOS isoforms are highly conserved, however, the available NOS inhibitors have not been found to discriminate significantly between the activities of constitutive versus inducible NOS.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Previously available NOS inhibitors have had limited success in improving survival from endotoxemia, in part because they indiscriminately suppress endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), Cobb, J. P., et al., 1992, J. EXP. MED. 176:1175-1182; Minnard, E. A., et al., 1994, ARCH SURG. 129:142-148; Billiar, T. R., 1990, et al., J LEUKOCYTE BIOL. 48:565-569.
      <br/>
      Suppression of EDRF during endotoxemia may impair survival by causing vasoconstriction and a diminution of blood flow to critical vascular beds.
      <br/>
      Hertofore there have been reported no compounds that inhibit cytokine-inducible macrophage NO without also inhibiting endothelial-derived NO.
    </p>
    <p num="21">3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="22">
      The present invention relates to methods and compounds for treating cachexia by inhibiting the production of urea, more particularly the production of urea by macrophages and the inhibition of the transport processes which mediate arginine uptake, particularly by macrophages.
      <br/>
      The method of the invention may also be used to limit or prevent the damage induced by NO-mediated responses associated with stroke, shock, inflammation and other NO-related conditions.
      <br/>
      Another object of the invention relates to inhibiting arginine uptake in the treatment of tumors or infections, where the tumor cells, the infected cells or the infectious agent requires arginine.
      <br/>
      A further object of the invention is the inhibition of the deleterious secretion of cytokines, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor, by activated macrophages.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The class of compounds useful for the purposes of the invention includes but is not limited to aromatics substituted with multiple guanylhydrazone (Ghy) moieties, more properly termed amidinohydrazones.
      <br/>
      The synthesis and use of such compounds is described.
      <br/>
      The invention further encompasses screening assays to test additional compounds for the above-noted activities, and pharmaceutical compositions useful in the practice of this method of therapy.
    </p>
    <p num="24">Because of the close relationship between urea production and the physiological synthesis of nitric oxide, the compounds of this invention can also be effective in limiting the cellular production of NO, particularly by macrophages.</p>
    <p num="25">
      While not limited to any theory of how or why the therapies described and claimed herein operate, the invention is based, in part, on the Applicants' development of the following model for cachexia: in cachexia, activated macrophages deplete the host's nitrogen pool by converting circulating arginine to nitrogenous end products that are eliminated from the body, requiring protein catabolism by the muscle and/or liver and other organs in order to replace the lost serum arginine.
      <br/>
      Thus, activated macrophages create a "nitrogen sink" that persistently drains nitrogen from the systemic pool, forcing the body to compensate by catabolizing tissue proteins to liberate amino acids as new sources of nitrogen.
      <br/>
      The model is based on the Applicants' experiments, that, while seeking to identify a factor released by activated macrophages which caused other tissues to make urea, found that activated macrophages themselves directly synthesize urea by breaking down arginine.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Activated macrophages break down arginine in two ways: (a) into urea and ornithine, or (b) into citrulline and nitric oxide (FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      The urea and nitric oxide so generated remove nitrogen from the whole body nitrogen pool since these metabolites cannot be efficiently recycled for reuse.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in cachexia, activated macrophages deplete the plasma of arginine.
      <br/>
      The body's mechanisms to maintain arginine homeostasis in the plasma will then require catabolism of protein from the muscle, liver and other organs to liberate sources of nitrogen and arginine.
      <br/>
      The discovery that arginine breakdown in the activated macrophage is a proximal cause of the inappropriate mobilization of tissue protein stores allowed for the development of the therapies described herein--i.e., interfering with arginine uptake by activated macrophages, and/or the production of urea from arginine to stem the inexorable loss of urea down the metabolic "nitrogen sink" and thus inhibit the further catabolism of protein from the tissues.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      It is a further object of invention to provide compounds and methods of their use to inhibit the production of nitric oxide by macrophages to overcome the limitation imposed by the absence of a macrophage-specific inhibitor of nitric oxide synthetase.
      <br/>
      Without limitation as to theory, we reasoned that advantage could be made of the requirement for arginine uptake by macrophages but not endothelial cells induced to produce NO.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the present invention were found to inhibit the production of NO by macrophages while having no inhibition on the production of vaso-active (endothelial derived) NO.
      <br/>
      Thus, the compounds of the invention may advantageously be used to counteract macrophage-induced, NO-mediated effects which accompany, for example, endotoxic and septic shock.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The foregoing is presented by way of illustration and not limitation.
      <br/>
      While the invention was developed with the background knowledge of the model for the physiology of cachexia, the invention itself involves the use of arginine analogs, arginomimetics, and other compounds having a non-metabolizable guanylhydrazone group(s) to inhibit the macrophage production of urea.
      <br/>
      A general class of such compounds are aromatics containing guanylhydrazones.
      <br/>
      These compounds can be synthesized by the reaction of acetylbenzenes and benzaldehydes with aminoguanidine and acid at high temperature in aqueous ethanol. (Ulrich, et al., 1982, DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH 2:219; and Ulrich &amp; Cerami, 1984 MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY 27:35, which are hereby incorporated by reference.)
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The invention is demonstrated by working examples describing the synthesis of compounds used in accordance with the invention (Section 6, infra); a whole cell assay to identify compounds that inhibit urea output (Section 7, infra); a whole cell assay to identify compounds that inhibit arginine uptake (Section 8, infra); an arginase inhibition assay (Section 9, infra); the demonstration of efficacy of the invention in an animal model system for cachexia (Section 10, infra); the demonstration of efficacy of the invention to reduce inflammation in the animal model using carrageenan-induced paw swelling (Section 11, infra); the demonstration of in vivo efficacy of the invention in preventing lipopolysaccharide-induced fatality (Section 13, infra) without blocking the effects of endothelial-derived relaxing factor (Section 12, infra) and of in vitro efficacy of the invention in preventing the secretion of Tumor Necrosis Factor by RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by LPS and  GAMMA -interferon (Section 14, infra).
      <br/>
      The results of Sections 12-14 are indicative of efficacy in preventing the morbidity and mortality associated with toxic shock or sytemic inflammatory response syndrome.
      <br/>
      Further examples show the efficacy of Compound No. 14 in reducing the severity of infarction induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery of a rat (Section 15, infra) and in reducing the growth of an experimental neoplasm in a nude mouse model (Section 16, infra).

    <p num="32">
      The present invention relates to methods and compounds for treating cachexia by inhibiting the production of urea, more particularly the production of urea by macrophages.
      <br/>
      The method of the invention may also be used to limit or prevent the damage induced by No-mediated responses associated with stroke, shock, inflammation and other NO-related conditions.
      <br/>
      To this end, the present invention relates to the inhibition of macrophage production of urea and NO, and more particularly, inhibition of induced excessive production of urea and the inhibition of the transport processes which mediate arginine uptake by macrophages.
      <br/>
      The invention further includes the inhibition of the deleterious secretion of cytokines, e.g. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF).
      <br/>
      An alternate embodiment of the invention relates to the inhibition of arginine uptake in the treatment of tumors or infections, where the tumor cells or the infectious agent requires arginine.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The class of compounds useful for the invention includes aromatics substituted with multiple guanylhydrazone moieties, more properly termed amidinohydrazones.
      <br/>
      The synthesis and use of such compounds is described.
      <br/>
      The invention further encompasses screening assays to test additional compounds for such activity and pharmaceutical compositions useful in the practice of this method of therapy.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Historically, our initial studies were directed to the discovery of an hypothesized macrophage-produced soluble mediator which caused cultured hepatocytes to produce more urea.
      <br/>
      More particularly, we undertook to find a mediator produced by stimulated or activated macrophages such as are present in many chronic disease states associated with cachexia.
      <br/>
      Control studies performed during the initial attempts to isolate a cytokine which caused increased hepatocyte urea production in vitro led to the serendipitous discovery that the activated macrophages themselves produce urea in substantial amounts.
      <br/>
      That this was relevant to in vivo conditions was confirmed by experiments demonstrating enhanced urea production by macrophages isolated from mice made cachectic by a transplanted tumor (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      These studies were further confirmed by the demonstration that the murine macrophage line RAW 264.7 responds to the macrophage activators LPS and  GAMMA IFN with increased urea production which depends on the extracellular availability of arginine (FIGS. 3-5).
      <br/>
      These studies led to the assay for pharmacologic activity, which is described in detail herein below.
      <br/>
      The compounds used in the instant invention were identified based on this assay and used in animal model systems which demonstrate the efficacy of the invention (Sections 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 16, infra).
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The foregoing results indicate that the secretion of cytokines by activated macrophages is but one aspect of the cachectic process.
      <br/>
      We developed the following model and hypothesis which is presented for explanatory purposes only and without limitation of the invention to any particular mechanism or scientific model.
      <br/>
      Equally important, in this model, are the direct metabolic processes of activated macrophages.
      <br/>
      The data indicate that in cachexia, activated macrophages make and secrete urea abundantly.
      <br/>
      The magnitude of the nitrogen loss which can be directly attributed to macrophages can be estimated from experimental culture data.
      <br/>
      Such studies show a single activated macrophage produces about 50 pg of urea/day.
      <br/>
      If one estimates that the fraction of activated macrophages is about 10% of the whole body immune cell population in a human being, then there is a total of about 1011 activated macrophages.
      <br/>
      This population could correspondingly account for the loss of about 5 grams of nitrogen per day which translates roughly to 30 grams of protein per day.
      <br/>
      This magnitude of loss represents a significant fraction of the weight loss that is observed clinically over time in chronic cachexia.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In accordance with the invention, inhibition of urea production, particularly that induced in macrophages, will reverse the process.
      <br/>
      Macrophage cellular metabolism differs from hepatic metabolism regarding the enzymes available to complete the so-called "urea cycle." In both tissues the ultimate step in urea production is a hydrolytic cleavage by the enzyme arginase of the amidino moiety of arginine to yield ornithine and urea (FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      One salient difference between macrophage and hepatic urea production is that macrophages lack substantial quantities of the enzyme ornithine transcarbamoylase and hence they cannot efficiently salvage the ornithine produced by arginase nor can they directly use ammonium (NH4) to form urea but rather must rely on an exogenous supply of arginine.
      <br/>
      Secondly, it appears that there are two arginase enzymes, both of which catalyze the hydrolytic release of urea, one found especially in macrophages and a second found typically in hepatocytes of the liver.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      These differences between macrophage and hepatic urea production have two implications: first, macrophages will selectively deplete arginine from the plasma.
      <br/>
      This circulating arginine must ultimately be replaced by protein breakdown in other tissues because the conversion of nitrogen to urea is essentially irreversible, i.e., urea cannot be further metabolized for re-use.
      <br/>
      Arginine itself is synthesized from  ALPHA -keto glutarate and ammonium by glutamate synthetase, glutamine synthetase and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase.
      <br/>
      Secondly, given that macrophage urea production depends upon arginine uptake while hepatic urea synthesis does not, it may be possible to selectively block the cachexia-associated nitrogen loss while leaving corresponding hepatic functions relatively undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In addition it may be advantageous to specifically block the macrophage form of the arginase enzyme and not the liver form.
      <br/>
      In vitro assays are described herein to detect the degree to which test compounds specifically inhibit each of these metabolic processes.
      <br/>
      These assays use the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Twenty compounds, including 15 novel compounds were tested for inhibition of macrophage urea production in an RAW 264.7 cell line assay.
      <br/>
      Six of the compounds display an IC50 of about 10  MU M or less and a further five compounds have been noted with an IC50 of greater than 10  MU M but less than about 100  MU M (see Section 7.2).
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Alternative embodiments of the present invention encompass any known means to inhibit macrophage urea production.
      <br/>
      Such methods may include but are not limited to the use of recombinant DNA methodologies.
      <br/>
      For example, a vector expressing an antisense message complementary to the mRNA of the macrophage form of arginase will be introduced into the macrophages of the cachectic host.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a ribozyme specific for the mRNA of the macrophage form of arginase could be employed.
      <br/>
      Specific introduction into macrophages of vectors appropriate to either will be obtained by use of liposome carriers.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Another embodiment of the present invention involves inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) production and particularly of the enzyme NO-synthase.
      <br/>
      NO is produced by activated macrophages and vascular endothelial cells among other cellular sources.
      <br/>
      NO has been implicated as a causative pathological factor in a variety of inflammatory conditions: particularly in circumstances of shock and of ischemic necrosis (infarction) of the myocardium and of the central nervous system.
      <br/>
      NO-synthase catalyzes the oxidation of arginine to citrulline with an accompanying release of NO.
      <br/>
      Compounds which inhibit arginine uptake will therefore be effective suppressors of NO-synthase activity at the cellular level.
      <br/>
      Further, compounds of the above noted classes may be specific inhibitors of NO-synthase at the molecular level.
      <br/>
      The data shown herein demonstrate that the compounds used in accordance with the invention inhibit NO-production without inhibiting EDRF activity.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In a still further embodiment, the invention may be used to treat toxic shock, also known as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
      <br/>
      The data described herein shows that the compounds of the invention act by two independent pathways to prevent the mortality and morbidity associated with SIRS: (a) by preventing arginine uptake and, thereby, blocking the synthesis of NO by activated macrophages; and (b) by blocking the secretion of cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF).
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      In yet another embodiment of the invention, inhibition of arginine uptake may be used to treat tumors or infections in which the tumor cells or infectious agent requires arginine.
      <br/>
      For example, tumors with arginine requirements include but are not limited to tumors of the breast, liver, lung and brain; whereas infectious agents with arginine requirements include but are not limited to Pneumocystis carinii, Trylanosoma brucei, T. congolense and T. evansi.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Examples of inhibitors which could be used in accordance with the invention include, but are not limited to, analogs of arginine; more particularly to a class of arylene compounds substituted with �(aminoiminomethyl)hydrazono�methyl moieties and �2-(aminoiminomethyl)hydrazono�ethyl moieties (hereinafter collectively "guanylhydrazones"); most preferably diphenyl compounds having 2, 3 or 4 guanylhydrazone moieties.
      <br/>
      These inhibitory compounds have one or more non-hydrolyzable analogs of the guanidino group of arginine.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Of guanylhydrazone compounds examined for activity in the present invention, compounds having only a single guanylhydrazone moiety were either inactive or required mM concentrations to achieve a 50% reduction in urea output.
      <br/>
      Benzyl and diphenyl compounds having 2, 3 or 4 guanylhydrazone moieties were active in some cases at less than 10  MU M. In all cases tested the highly active compounds inhibited not only urea production but also inhibited the transport of arginine into the cell.
      <br/>
      A preferred embodiment of the present invention are di, tri and tetra guanylhydrazone substituted phenyl compounds having two phenyl nuclei linked by an alkanediamide or two phenoxy nuclei linked by an alkane.
      <br/>
      A second preferred embodiment are triacetylphenyl or triformylphenyl tris(guanylhydrazones).
      <br/>
      Examples of such useful compounds which were known include monoarylene bisguanylhydrazone, e.g., 1,3-diacetylpyridine bis(guanylhydrazone) (2), Ulrich, 1982, a monoarylene tris(guanylhydrazone), e.g., 1,3,5-triacetylbenzene tris(guanylhydrazone) (1), Ulrich, 1984, and a bisarylene bis(guanylhydrazone), e.g., 4,4'-diacetyldiphenylurea bis(guanylhydrazone) (8), Korytnyk, W. et al., J. MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY 21:507-13, 1978.
      <br/>
      These compounds inhibit macrophage urea production in vitro at concentrations of between about 10  MU M and about 50  MU M. Further novel compounds of the present invention have inhibitory activity at five-fold lower concentrations.
      <br/>
      Such compounds include a bisarylene tris(guanylhydrazone), e.g., 3,5,4'-triacetyldiphenylurea tris(guanylhydrazone) (FIG. 17.9), a bisarylene tetrakis (guanylhydrazone), e.g., N,N'-bis(3,5-diacetylphenyl)decanediamide tetrakis (guanylhydrazone) (FIG. 17.14) and 3,3'-(ethylenedioxy)dibenzaldehyde bis(guanylhydrazone) (FIG. 17.16).
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Further contemplated within the scope of the invention are tris arylene guanylhydrazono compounds in which each arylene group bears 1 or 2 guanylhydrazonoalkyl substituents.
      <br/>
      Such compounds may be synthesized using the methods taught herein.

      <br/>
      When used in vivo, the dose of each compound should be formulated to achieve a range of circulating concentrations that include the IC50 measured in vitro.

      <br/>
      In the working examples described herein, the RAW 264.7 cell line was used.
      <br/>
      However, the invention is not limited to the RAW 264.7 cell line which could be replaced by any macrophage cell line or by activated non-transformed macrophages in a primary culture.

      In general, the whole cell assay for urea production may be conducted as follows: macrophages or endothelial cells are activated (e.g., using factors including but not limited to  GAMMA IFN and LPS as described in the examples, infra) in the presence of test inhibitors.
      <br/>
      After an appropriate time in culture, e.g., approximately overnight up to 2 days, the culture supernatant is analyzed for the presence of urea and nitric oxide.
      <br/>
      The production of urea and nitric oxide by any cell line can be measured by the same calorimetric assays used in clinical laboratories to determine the serum concentrations of these same compounds.
      <br/>
      The effects of various concentrations of inhibitor can be determined by comparison with the supernatant of control cultures which were not treated with the test inhibitor.
      <br/>
      A further control to indentify toxicity at any inhibitory dose may be included.
      <br/>
      An assay for the release of the intracellular enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, as used in the examples described infra, or an equivalent control, may be employed to such ends.

      To this end, the cells are cultured to allow them to adhere (e.g., for 2 hours to overnight) and activated (eg., using factors including but not limited to  GAMMA IFN and LPS as described in the working examples infra) in the presence of the test inhibitor.

      After an appropriate incubation time, carrier-free labeled arginine is added to the culture.
      <br/>
      After a short time period (e.g., 5 minutes) the cells are washed with a solution containing unlabeled arginine to displace any radiolabeled arginine non-specifically bound to the cells in culture.
      <br/>
      The cells are then lysed and the cell lysates analyzed for the presence of radiolabeled arginine.
      <br/>
      The effects of the test compounds are determined by comparison of incorporation of radiolabel into treated cells versus the control cell cultures which were not treated with the potential inhibitor.

      Those skilled in the art will recognize that numerous variants may be synthesized by means of these reactions and that these variants have properties in common with the compounds herein disclosed.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Reaction 1 consists of the reaction of a substituted aromatic having a primary or secondary amine, e.g., 3,5-diacetylaniline, and a dioyl dichloride, e.g., glutaryl dichloride, to yield the corresponding N,N'-diphenylalkanediamide. "Reversed" diamides can also be prepared.
      <br/>
      Acetyl and diacetylbenzoic acid can be prepared by the reaction of the corresponding substituted toluenes and KMnO4.
      <br/>
      The acids may be then activated by standard techniques and reacted with the appropriate  ALPHA , OMEGA -alkanediamines to yield the reverse "diamides".
      <br/>
      Mixed forward and reversed diamides can be synthesized by methods well known in the field of peptide synthesis.
      <br/>
      Thus, an N-t-butyloxycarbonyl amino acid may be reacted with a substituted aniline, followed by deprotection and reaction of the amino group with an activated substituted benzoic acid.
      <br/>
      When used herein the symbol "--NH(CO)--", unless otherwise indicated, includes the --(CO)NH-- isomer.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The method is not limited to dioyl dichlorides.
      <br/>
      The trichloride derivatives of trioyl compounds may be used to synthesize triphenyl alkanetriamides in a similar fashion.
      <br/>
      Suitable triacids include cyclic acids, e.g., 1,3,5-cyclohexanetricarboxylic acid (Aldrich Chem.

      <br/>
      The identical reaction may be performed wherein the dioyl chloride is replaced by trichloromethyl chloroformate to yield a diphenylurea condensation product.
      <br/>
      An alternative to Reaction 1 can be performed to yield a 1,n-(n-alkanedioxy) diarylene by reacting the 1,n-dibromoalkane, e.g., 1,2 dibromoethane and a monohydroxylarylene, e.g., 3-hydroxyacetophenone.

      In two further embodiments of the invention, an acetyl- or diacetylaryl isocyanate is reacted with an alkanediamine or, alternatively, an acetyl- or diacetylaryl amine is reacted with an alkanediyl diisocyanate to yield bis-ureido intermediates which may be reacted with aminoguanidine to form the guanylhdrazono end products.
      <br/>
      The requisite isocyanates are either commercially available or may be synthesized from from the corresponding amines by reaction with phosgene, trichloromethyl chloroformate, or bis(trichloromethyl) carbonate in toluene or xylene at elevated temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="72">Reaction 2 consists of the reaction of an acetophenone or benzaldehyde type moiety and an aminoguanidine to yield the condensation product wherein an imino-bonded (N.dbd.C) aminoguanidine replaces the ketone or carbonyl moiety of the arylene thus forming a guanylhydrazone and accompanied by the release of a water molecule.</p>

    <p num="83">5.3. USES OF THE COMPOUNDS</p>
    <p num="84">
      For any compound used in the method of the invention, the appropriate dose is one which achieves a circulating range of concentrations which encompass the IC50 determined to be effective for that compound as reported herein in Tables I, II and III or determined in the manner herein described.
      <br/>
      For example, when using Compound Nos. 1, 9, 13 or 15, for treating cachexia, inflammation, endotoxic shock or septic shock, infarction or neoplasm regardless of the formulation chosen, the amount administered should be sufficient to achieve a serum concentration or a circulating plasma concentration of between about 5  MU M and 100  MU M. When using Compound No. 14, for treating cachexia, inflammation, endotoxic shock or septic shock, infarction or neoplasm regardless of the formulation chosen, the amount administered should be sufficient to achieve a serum concentration or a circulating plasma concentration of between about 0.5  MU M and 10  MU M. As shown in the working examples, a daily parenteral dose of Compound No. 14 of about 0.4 mg/Kg, used to treat cachexia, and a single parenteral dose of 1.0 mg/Kg, to treat LPS-induced toxicity, are effective in murine models.
    </p>
    <p num="85">Based on the pharmacokinetic constants reported in Section 18, below, and the time v. concentration curve of FIG. 17, it is apparent that while single doses of between 0.4-1.0 mg/kg do not achieve sustained plasma levels of Compound No. 14 in excess of 0.5  MU M, doses in this range do achieve peak plasma levels in excess of about 0.5  MU M. Indeed, from the data presented here, it appears that daily exposures of a subject to the indicated levels for periods of 10-20 minutes or a single exposure of about an hour's duration results in a therapeutically significant effect.</p>
    <p num="86">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the dose appropriate to a given route of administration can be determined by the application pharmacological methods that are well known to those skilled in the art.</p>
    <p num="87">
      When the compounds of the present invention are used to treat chronic inflammation a dose regime should be determined by application of standard pharmacologic techniques using the above-noted dose ranges as initial points.
      <br/>
      To treat acute inflammatory conditions, a single larger dose may be administered in an alternative embodiment.
      <br/>
      As shown in the working examples, a single parenteral dose of 5.0 mg/Kg of Compound No. 14 was found effective to treat such an acute event.

    <p num="165">This section describes in detail the methods and the results of a tissue culture assay to determine the ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit urea synthesis in activated macrophages.</p>
    <p num="166">7.1. MATERIAL AND METHODS</p>
    <p num="167">
      RAW 264.7 cells are plated in microculture wells at 1 * 106 /ml in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and otherwise standard culture conditions and allowed to adhere for 5 hours.
      <br/>
      They are then activated with 25 U/ml  GAMMA IFN and 0.1  MU g/ml LPS in the presence of test inhibitors.
      <br/>
      The urea concentration present in the supernatant media, after 18 hours of culture, is determined by a colorimetric blood urea nitrogen diacetylmonoxime assay performed on an aliquot of the culture supernatant (Sigma Chem. Co., St. Louis, Mo.) and inhibition is expressed as the percentage urea compared to that of a parallel control culture treated identically except that the concentration of added inhibitor is zero.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      The production of nitrite is determined by assay of the same tissue culture supernatant by means of a calorimetric assay.
      <br/>
      Briefly, 4 parts of test solution containing 1% (w/v) sulfanilamide, 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine di-HCl (Griess Reagent), 2.5% H3 PO4 and one part media are mixed, incubated for 10 minutes and the absorbance at 560 nm determined.
      <br/>
      The nitrite concentrations are interpolated from reference curves prepared using NaNO2.
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      Various concentrations of the test compounds are included in the media of the stimulated RAW 264.7 cells in culture.
      <br/>
      The concentration of urea and/or nitrite after 18 hours of activated culture is determined and compared to the uninhibited control value obtained from at least one parallel culture.
      <br/>
      The fractional reduction is calculated for each concentration of inhibitor and the IC50 (concentration giving 50% reduction) is interpolated.
      <br/>
      Compounds were dissolved in media with mild heat (60 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      Those with limited solubility were dissolved in base.
      <br/>
      The concentration of stock solutions of those compounds which were not completely soluble was determined by OD280.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      The culture supernatants are tested for the presence of an intracellular enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to determine the degree, if any, to which the test compound has caused cell death.
      <br/>
      In the examples reported hereinafter no such cellular toxicity due to the test compounds was observed.
    </p>
    <p num="171">7.2. RESULTS</p>
    <p num="172">
      The results of the examination of guanylhydrazone compounds to measure their capacity to inhibit urea production are presented in Tables I, II and III.
      <br/>
      The most active compounds, reported in Table I, displayed IC50 of less than 10  MU M. The most active compound was an tetraguanylhydrazone decanediamide (Compound No. 14).
      <br/>
      Also highly active were the pentanediamide homolog of the above (Compound No. 13); the ethanedioxy bis(guanylhydrazone), (Compound No. 16); a mixed urea bis(guanylhydrazone) (Compound No. 9); and triacetylbenzine tris(guanylhydrazone) (Compound No. 1).
    </p>
    <p num="173">
      Compounds having either one or two phenyl nuclei were effective.
      <br/>
      When two nuclei were present their linkage by means of a urea, diamide or alkanedioxy functionality was effective.
      <br/>
      Test compounds having a single guanylhydrazone functionality were much less effective.

      <br/>
      One hour later, the medium is supplemented so as to contain 25 U/ml  GAMMA IFN and 0.1  MU g/ml LPS and the cultures incubated a further.
      <br/>
      The cells are then rinsed twice in HEPES- buffered Krebs salt solution with 0.1% glucose.
      <br/>
      Carrier-free tetra-3 H-arginine is added to each well (2.5  MU Ci/well with specific activity of 69 mCi/mmol) and the active uptake of arginine is allowed to continue for a 5 minute period after which the cells are rapidly cooled to 0 (degree)  C. by lavage with iced saline containing 10 mM unlabeled arginine to displace any externally bound label.
      <br/>
      The contents of the washed cells are solubilized in 100  MU l of formic acid and counted by standard techniques.
      <br/>
      The amount of tetra-3 H-arginine uptake as a function of time incubation time is shown in FIG. 6.

      FIG. 12 shows a Western blot that demonstrates the absence of TNF protein in the medium of cells cultured with 5 and 25  MU M concentrations of Compound No. 14. The failure of Compound No. 14-treated cells to secrete TNF can not be simply attributed to the inhibition of NO synthesis by Compound No. 14. The NOS inhibitor N-methyl-arginine (NMA), even at concentrations of 10  MU M, did not inhibit the production of TNF in this system.
      <br/>
      The inhibition of TNF production was also not attributable to the effects of arginine depletion brought on by the blockage of arginine transport.
      <br/>
      FIG. 13A shows that Compound No. 14, at a 5  MU M concentration, functioned as an inhibitor of NO synthesis, but that this inhibition could be partially overcome by the presence of between about 50 and 100  MU M arginine in the medium.

      The application of heat quickly cauterized and severed the artery which fell back onto the cortex with no underlying cortical injury.
      <br/>
      To cause a reproducible stroke the left CCA must be temporarily occluded for 30-60 minutes.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in the present model the left CCA was occluded for 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      Surgical gelfoam was placed over the craniotomy defect, and the skin incisions closed with a vicryl sutures.
      <br/>
      The animals were then returned to their cages, where they were allowed free access to food and water for 24 hours.
      <br/>
      After surgery, animals were somewhat clumsy but resumed activities including walking, eating, and drinking.

      Twenty-four hours after MCA severing, animals were anesthetized and decapitated and the brains were quickly removed without perfusion and coronally sectioned at 1 mm intervals with a brain slicer for analysis.

      Freshly prepared slices were immersed and incubated in 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) (2% in NaCl, 154 mM) for 30 minutes at 37 (degree)  C. in the dark to stain for mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity.

      Brain infarctions were visualized as areas of unstained (white) tissue which were easily contrasted with viable tissue which stained red.

      Slices were then placed in buffered 10% formalin and infarct area determined by planimetry on projected images of photographed brain slices.
      <br/>
      Infarct size for an individual animal was calculated by summing the infarct area present on each brain slice and dividing by the sum of hemisphere area for all slices for that animal (expressed as a percentage of hemisphere area for each slice).

      Animals were studied in groups of 10, and the data expressed as average stroke volume for the group.

      These differences were statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) by Student's t-test for unpaired data.

      This section describes in detail the methods and results of an animal model of tumor growth to determine the ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit tumor growth, and cause regression of tumors.

      Cells are plated in standard tissue culture flasks in DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%).
      <br/>
      Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with a mammalian expression vector constitutively secrete human TNF (CHO-TNF).
      <br/>
      The experiments with the CHO-TNF tumor were performed as follows: on the day of injection into nude mice, cells are harvested and injected intramuscularly (10-15 * 106 cells per animal) into the hindlimb of nu/nu nude mice (20 g body weight).
      <br/>
      Animals are housed and provided food and water ad libitum.
      <br/>
      Tumor growth is monitored, and when established tumors are present (during week six) the test compounds are administered daily (0.4 mg/Kg intraperitoneal, once daily).
      <br/>
      After two weeks the animals are euthanized, the tumor weighed, and measured with a caliper.

      The CHO-TNF tumor also metastasizes to the skin of these animals; the number of metastases is scored.

    <p num="233">
      This section describes experiments that measure the concentration of Compound No. 14 needed to inhibit arginine uptake and NO output.
      <br/>
      The techniques employed were described in section 7.1 supra.
    </p>
    <p num="234">
      FIG. 13A shows the effects of Compound No. 14 on the output of NO by RAW 264.7 cells that have been continuously exposed to Compound No. 14 from one hour prior to  GAMMA -IFN/LPS stimulation until completion of the assay 18 hours after stimulation.
      <br/>
      The data show that Compound No. 14 was a inhibitor of NO output that was competitively antagonized by extracellular arginine.
      <br/>
      These data indicate that the I.C.50 for Compound No. 14 in this assay, at physiologic arginine concentrations (100  MU M), was between 3 and 5  MU M.
    </p>
    <p num="235">
      As shown in FIG. 6, the peak level of arginine uptake by RAW 264.7 cells occured at about 8 hours after  GAMMA -IFN/LPS stimulation.
      <br/>
      When RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to Compound No. 14 prior to stimulation, as in FIG. 13B, and the level of arginine uptake measured at 8 hours, the I.C.50 for arginine uptake of Compound No. 14 was very similar that observed for NO output, 7.5  MU M (data not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="236">
      All effects of Compound No. 14 on macrophage NO output, however, could not be entirely attributed to an acute blockade of arginine transport.
      <br/>
      FIG. 15 shows the results observed when RAW 264.7 cells were  GAMMA -IFN/LPS-stimulated in the absence of any inhibitor and, 8 hours thereafter, the cells were exposed for minutes to Compound No. 14, whereupon arginine uptake was measured.
      <br/>
      An I.C.50 =60 +- 15  MU M (mean +- std. err., n=3) was measured when RAW 264.7 cells, that had been  GAMMA -IFN/LPS-stimulated 8 hours previously were exposed to Compound No. 14 in arginine-free buffer for 10 minutes prior to assay of arginine uptake.
      <br/>
      The results of these acute exposure experiments differed from the previously discussed, continuous exposure results in two ways.
      <br/>
      Firstly, approximately one third of the total arginine uptake occured through a Compound No. 14-independent mechanism which appeared to be present in unstimulated as well as stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.
      <br/>
      Secondly, the concentration of Compound No. 14 needed to 50% inhibit arginine uptake after  GAMMA -IFN/LPS-induced arginine transport has been established for a period of hours was greater than that needed to prevent 50% of the increased arginine uptake or NO output when Compound No. 14 was introduced prior to stimulation.
    </p>
    <p num="237">
      An intermediate level of sensitivity to Compound No. 14 was observed when  GAMMA -IFN/LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to inhibitor from 8 hours after the initial stimulation until the end of the experiment.
      <br/>
      In these experiments, NO output was measured during hours 12-24.
      <br/>
      FIG. 16 demonstrates that under such experimental conditions an I.C.50 of 20 +- 2  MU M (mean +- std. err., n=3) was observed.
    </p>
    <p num="238">
      Together these data show that when RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to Compound No. 14 prior to activation by  GAMMA -IFN/LPS, NO output and inducible arginine uptake were equally sensitive to low levels of Compound No. 14, while the arginine uptake of unstimulated RAW 264.7 was insensitive to Compound No. 14. By contrast, the arginine uptake of RAW 264.7 cells, stimulated with  GAMMA -IFN/LPS, and exposed briefly to Compound No. 14 after a delay was less sensitive to of Compound No. 14 than when Compound No. 14 was given prior to stimulation.
      <br/>
      Likewise the NO output of cells treated with Compound No. 14 hours after stimulation was shown to be less sensitive to inhibition by Compound No. 14 than was the induction of NO production by previously quiescent cells.
    </p>
    <p num="239">These data indicate that higher levels of Compound No. 14 will be required, in vivo, to block the ongoing production of NO by activated macrophages than would be needed to prevent the initiation of NO production by non-activated macrophages and that Compound No. 14 will be more effective when chronically applied than when acutely applied to cells.</p>

    <p num="241">
      A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method has been developed for a series of aromatic guanylhydrazones that have demonstrated therapeutic potential as anti-inflammatory agents.
      <br/>
      The compounds were separated using octadecyl or diisopropyl-octyl reverse-phase columns, with an acetonitrile gradient in water containing heptane sulfonate, tetramethylammonium chloride, and phosphoric acid.
      <br/>
      The method was used to reliably quantify levels of analyte as low as 78.5 ng per injection, and the detector response was linear to at least 5000 ng per injection.

      The compounds could be extracted and concentrated from biological samples using octadecylsilane solid-phase extraction columns.

      The assay system was used to determine the basic pharmacokinetics of a lead compound, Compound No. 14, from plasma concentrations following a single intravenous injection in rats.
    </p>
    <p num="242">18.1. EXPERIMENTAL MATERIALS AND METHODS</p>
    <p num="243">Chemicals</p>
    <p num="244">
      Heptane sulfonate (HS), tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC), and phosphoric acid were obtained from Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis., USA), and pentamidine isethionate from May and Baker (now Rhone-Poulenc; Dagenham, UK).
      <br/>
      HPLC-grade acetonitrile was acquired from Fisher (Fairlawn, N.J., USA) and all water was filtered and deionised by a Picopure system (Hydro Service and Supplies; Research Triangle Park, N.C., USA).
      <br/>
      All guanylhydrazones were synthesized as described (Ulrich, P. &amp; Cerami, A., 1984, J. Med. Chem. 27:35; Ulrich, P. et al., 1982, Drug Dev.
      <br/>
      Res. 2:219) and the purity confirmed by elemental analysis, proton NMR, and melting point.
      <br/>
      Chromatographic Conditions
    </p>
    <p num="245">
      A Hewlett-Packard model 1090 liquid chromatograph (Wilmington, Del., USA) equipped with an autosampler, photodiode array detector, and Chemstation operating software was used for all analyses.
      <br/>
      The columns used were either a Supelcosil LC-18 250 * 4.6 mm octadecylsilane column with 5 mm particle size (Supelco; Bellefonte, Pa., USA) or a Zorbax RX-C8 250 * 4.6 mm column with 5 mm particle size (Mac Mod Analyticals; Chadds Ford, Pa., USA) kept at room temperature.
      <br/>
      Buffer A was 10 mM HS/10 mM TMAC/4.2 mM H3 PO4 /H2 O and buffer B 10 mM HS/10 mM TMAC/4.2 mM H3 PO4 /75% CH3 CN/25% H2 O. Using a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, runs were initiated at 10%B and a linear gradient to 90%B was performed over 30 min.
      <br/>
      The column was then returned to 10%B over 7 min, followed by 3 min re-equilibration.
      <br/>
      The compounds were detected by absorbance at 265 nm, with 540 nm used as a reference wavelength.
    </p>
    <p num="246">Sample Preparation</p>
    <p num="247">
      The test compounds and the internal standard, pentamidine, were dissolved in distilled water to make 1 mg/ml stock solutions.
      <br/>
      To determine the relative retention times and peak shapes, a single test compound and the internal standard were diluted to 10  MU g/ml in distilled water, and 100  MU l injected onto the HPLC.
    </p>
    <p num="248">
      To extract the compounds, an equal volume of HPLC buffer A was added to the test sample (to which pentamidine had been added to 5  MU g/ml) before being loaded onto conditioned Supelclean C-18 solid-phase extraction cartridges.
      <br/>
      The cartridges were then washed with 1.0 ml of distilled water and eluted with 1.0 ml of 10 mM HS/10 mM TMAC/4.2 mM H3 PO4 /95% CH3 CN/5% H2 O. In some experiments, 100  MU l of this eluate was injected onto the HPLC, and, in others, the elution buffer was removed in vacuo and the pellet resuspended in HPLC buffer A before injection of 100  MU l. Standard addition curves were constructed in distilled water, human urine, and mouse plasma by the addition of various amounts of test compound and 5  MU g/ml pentamidine.
      <br/>
      These samples were either injected directly or subjected to the solid-phase extraction system previously mentioned.

    <p num="249">Pharmacokinetic Studies</p>
    <p num="250">
      Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, Ind., USA) were anesthetized with ketamine and the right carotid artery cannulated with polyethylene tubing (PE-50).
      <br/>
      The animals were given 10 mg/kg of Compound No. 14 in a single intra-arterial injection of 380  MU l. At 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360 minutes 400  MU l of blood was removed, stored at 4 (degree)  C. for 4 hr, and then centrifuged at 15,000 * g for 10 min, and the serum layer collected.
      <br/>
      Sodium azide was added to 0.01% v/v to prevent microbial growth and pentamidine was added to 5  MU g/ml.
      <br/>
      Twenty-five  MU l of the resulting sample was analyzed by the HPLC method described.
    </p>
    <p num="251">18.2. RESULTS</p>
    <p num="252">
      In designing a separation system for the aromatic guanylhydrazones, ion-pair buffers were chosen which contained 10 mM heptane sulfonate, 10 mM tetramethylammonium chloride, and 4.2 mM phosphoric acid, as these buffers had been used successfully to separate aromatic diamidines, B. J. Berger, et al., 1991, J. PHARMACOL. EXPER. THER. 256:883, which bear some structural similarity to the present compounds.
      <br/>
      Use of these buffers with a reverse-phase C-18 column was found to be ideal for the elution of Compound No. 14. Elimination of either of the ion-pair reagents from the buffer led to a complete retention of Compound No. 14 by the HPLC column (data not shown).
      <br/>
      Separation of Compound No. 14 and the internal standard, pentamidine, was performed with a Zorbax RX-C8 column.
    </p>
    <p num="253">
      While Compound No. 14 and pentamidine could easily be detected in raw serum samples, an extraction system was developed to allow for concentration of the analytes from samples containing trace amounts and also to minimise the amount of protein injected on the column.
      <br/>
      Using reverse-phase, solid-phase extraction columns (SPEC) and an elution buffer consisting of 10 mM TMAC/10 mM HS/4.2 mM H3 PO4 /95% CH3 CN, the recovery of Compound No. 14 and pentamidine was found to be 75.60 +- 13.77% and 92.27 +- 6.52% respectively from C-18 SPEC (n=6).
      <br/>
      This recovery was superior to that found for the compounds on C-8, cyanopropyl, or phenyl SPEC (data not shown).
      <br/>
      In addition, to optimize recovery, it was found beneficial to add an equal volume of HPLC A buffer to the sample before loading onto the SPEC.
      <br/>
      This step led to a 20-fold increase in recovery from C-18 SPEC.
    </p>
    <p num="254">
      Further studies with Compound No. 14 and the solid-phase extraction system demonstrated that the limit of detection was 78.5 ng per injection, and that the compound could be efficiently extracted from urine and plasma samples (data not shown).
      <br/>
      The assay was found to be linear from the limit of detection up to at least 5000 ng per injection, and gave the following regression for a plot of Compound No. 14 peak area vs. amount injected: y=267.507 * -45.251 (r2 =0.99).
      <br/>
      The method was also found to be accurate, with an intraday variation of 1.5% on samples of 1000 ng Compound No. 14 injected (n=4), and an interday variation of 9.5% on samples of 625 ng injected (n=3).
    </p>
    <p num="255">
      The HPLC method was applied towards estimating the pharmacokinetic parameters of Compound No. 14 in adult rats receiving a 10 mg/kg dose as a single intra-arterial injection.
      <br/>
      In these experiments, the solid-phase extraction step was omitted due to the small volume of each sample, and the relatively large amount of Compound No. 14 which was recovered.
      <br/>
      Typical serum decay curves were obtained (FIG. 17, solid line), and the method of residuals, Gibaldi, M., &amp; Perrier, D., 1982, PHARMACOKINETICS (Marcel Dekker, New York) pp. 433-444, was used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters (FIG. 17, dashed lines).
      <br/>
      The distribution rate constant ( ALPHA ) was found to be 0.31.+- 0 (slashed zero) 09 min-1, the elimination rate constant ( BETA ) 0.0023.+- 0 (slashed zero) 0000 min-1, the initial distribution concentration (A) 63.01 +- 43.78 mg/ml, the initial elimination concentration (B) 1.57.+- 0 (slashed zero) 14 mg/ml, the distribution half-life (t1/2 ALPHA ) 2.41.+- 0 (slashed zero) 69 min, the elimination half-life (t1/2 BETA ) 5.02.+- 0 (slashed zero) 00 hr, the volume of distribution (Vd) 2.45.+- 0 (slashed zero) 21 L, and the total clearance (CL) 5.62.+- 0 (slashed zero) 47 ml/min (n=3 for all).
      <br/>
      These values show that the compound persists in the serum for some time after a single i.a. injection.
      <br/>
      Experiments performed via intraperitoneal or oral dosing routes indicate that the drug is not rapidly absorbed, and may have a low bioavailability (data not shown).
      <br/>
      The choice of a 10 mg/kg dose is applicable, as the compound was found to have an LD50 of 50 mg/kg when given intraperitoneally and one that exceeds 1 g/kg when given orally.
