      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      This invention relates generally to the handling of hazardous wastes and other hazardous materials.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention is concerned with a new form of mobile reuse center structure for the safe handling, distribution, and storing of hazardous materials on land and afloat aboard an ocean going vessel.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      The handling and storage of hazardous materials, and particularly hazardous waste has become a problem of major proportions.
      <br/>
      Increased emphasis is being placed on the importance of assuring that solvents, fuels lubricants, paint related products, and the like are stored with adequate safeguards.
      <br/>
      Increasingly, it is being recognized that even small spills and relatively minor leakages of the growing number of substances that are toxic and are referred to as "hazardous material" can detrimentally affect persons, property, plants, animals, ground water and other aspects of ecology and the environment.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in view of the increasing concern about the lasting nature of the adverse effects that can result from spills and unchecked leakage of hazardous materials, the issue of storage and distribution of hazardous materials is receiving increased attention by law-makers, by regulatory agencies, and by those who have been elected to govern and to enforce the laws and regulations relating to hazardous materials.
    </p>
    <p num="6">There is a genuine and real need for a well designed, heavy duty hazardous material containment facility that appropriately addresses today's increasing concern for the way in which hazardous materials are handled and stored.</p>
    <p num="7">There is also a need for a hazardous material containment structure which allows the user to maintain an inventory of the hazardous materials being stored and maintained within the structure.</p>
    <p num="8">
      The above and other needs for a hazardous material containment structure were partially met by U.S. Pat. No. 5,511,908 which issued Apr. 30, 1996 to Norman S. Van Valkenburgh, Gary L. Van Valkenburgh and Edward Payne. U.S. Pat. No. 5,511,908 discloses a single self contained storage unit for the storing and handling of containers of hazardous materials which includes a secondary containment feature in the form of a base assembly having a containment pan.
      <br/>
      The base assembly of the storage unit also provides a framework for supporting a floor of removable grating which allows access to the containment pan.
      <br/>
      The storage unit of U.S. Pat. No. 5,511,908 further comprises front, rear and side walls and a roof of very sturdy construction employing interior and outer surface steel panels supported by a generally rectangular shaped tubular steel framework for each wall and the roof of the mobile safety structure.
      <br/>
      There is sandwiched between the interior and outer surface steel panels of each wall a pair of gypsum boards and R-19 insulation.
      <br/>
      The insulation allows the user of the storage unit of U.S. Pat. No. 5,511,908 to adapt the structure for use under varying climatic conditions, while the gypsum board provides the structure with at least a four hour fire rating.
      <br/>
      The framework of the storage unit has corner fittings to receive dual wheel casters and a tow bar which in combination allow a tow truck to move the safety structure from a first location to a second location.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In addition, U.S. Pat. No. 5,735,639, which issued Apr. 7, 1998 to Norman S. Van Valkenburgh, Gary L. Van Valkenburgh and Edward Payne discloses a mobile safety structure in which the self contained storage unit of U.S. Pat. No. 5,511,908 may be configured in tandem or a stacked arrangement comprising four self contained storage units.
      <br/>
      These arrangements allow for an increase in the handling and storage capacity of hazardous materials and contaminants by the mobile safety structure disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,735,639.
    </p>
    <p num="10">However, under certain conditions, such as the cleanup of a military or civilian ocean going vessel having significant amounts of jet engine fuel, paints, corrosives and other toxic materials thereon, there is requirement for a mobile containment facility to handle and safely store these hazardous materials, preferably a structure having the storage capacity of a warehouse.</p>
    <p num="11">In addition, there is a need for a mobile hazardous material containment structure at sites which are remote and generally not accessible such as ocean based drilling platforms.</p>
    <p num="12">Further, there is a need to provide for a relatively inexpensive and safe mobile hazardous material containment facility to keep cleanup cost under control while maintaining the safety and health of the personnel using the facility.</p>
    <p num="13">In addition, there is a need to provide a hazardous material containment facility for the containment and handling of hazardous materials which is compliant with various local, national and international standards relating thereto, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards, National Fire Protection Agency standards and the ISO (International organization of Standards) 1496, 9000 and 14000 Series of International Standards and MIL-S-901D, which is grade and shock criteria for water based vessels.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">The mobile reuse center structure of the present invention addresses the foregoing and other needs of hazardous material storage and handling facility by providing an environmentally safe modular storage type facility which will provide a good service life and under circumstances of reasonable use, can be moved inexpensively from site to site over the years as may be appropriate to address a series of different servicing needs for the containment and handling of hazardous materials.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The mobile reuse center structure for containment and handling of hazardous materials comprises a modular hazmat (hazardous material) containment facility which includes a base assembly having a containment pan, right side and left side walls, front and rear walls and a roof assembly.
      <br/>
      The right side wall and the front wall of the mobile reuse center structure each have a door which allow the user access to the interior of the structure by its user.
      <br/>
      The left side wall has a plurality of deflagration vents which burst open when pressure is applied to the deflagration vents as the result of an accidental vapor or gas explosion which occurs in the interior portion of mobile reuse center structure.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The base assembly of the mobile reuse center structure has at each corner thereof a corner fitting which may receive wheel casters.
      <br/>
      The base assembly is also adapted to receive a tow bar which in combination with the wheel casters allows a tow truck to move the unit from a first location to a second location.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The roof assembly of the mobile reuse center structure also has at each corner thereof a corner fitting.
      <br/>
      The corner fittings at each corner of the base and roof assembly of each modular storage unit may receive twistlock stackers.
      <br/>
      The twistlock stackers when coupled to the roof assembly corner fittings allow a drum rack to be stacked on top of and secured to the roof assembly.
      <br/>
      The drum rack includes a containment pan and a removable grating floor.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      A machinery compartment is located in the rear end of the mobile reuse center structure.
      <br/>
      The machinery compartment includes the electrical control and power distribution system for the mobile reuse center structure.
      <br/>
      Electrical equipment/components which are located in the interior or are mounted on the exterior of mobile reuse center are explosion proof when the components are less than four feet above the floor of the mobile reuse center.
      <br/>
      A fire suppression controller and fire suppression tank is located within the machinery compartment for use in fighting chemical fires which may occur within unit.
      <br/>
      The mobile reuse center structure includes the air conditioning and heating unit for distributing heat and air conditioning within the interior portion of the structure.
      <br/>
      The heating and air conditioning is provided to maintain adequate habitability in extreme exterior ambient temperature and humidity conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="19">The rear wall of the mobile reuse center structure includes a trio of expanded metal security doors which may be remove from the rear wall allowing the user of mobile reuse center structure to access the machinery compartment.</p>
    <p num="20">A better understanding of the mobile reuse center structure comprising the present invention as well as a better recognition of its advantages and novel features will be afforded to those skilled in the art from a consideration of the following detailed description of the a preferred embodiment thereof.</p>

      Referring now to FIGS. 1, 2 and 3, in overview, there is shown a mobile reuse center structure, designated generally by the reference numeral 30, for the safe handling, distribution, and storing of hazardous materials.
      <br/>
      Mobile reuse center 30 includes a base assembly 33 (FIG. 1) or skid and an assembly of upstanding walls that is supported on base assembly 33.
      <br/>
      Unit 30 also includes a roof assembly 32, that is supported atop the rectangularly shaped assembly of upstanding walls.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The assembly of upstanding walls consist of a right side wall 34, a left side wall 41, an interior wall 78 positioned toward the rear end of mobile reuse center 30 and a front wall 36.
      <br/>
      There is also located at the end of mobile reuse center 30 a rear wall 39.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      A first door frame assembly 40 is incorporated into right side wall 34 and pivotally mounts a door 42.
      <br/>
      A second door frame assembly 44 is incorporated into front wall 36 and pivotally mounts a door 46.
      <br/>
      Doors 42 and 46 control access to the interior 79 of mobile reuse center 30 from outside of mobile reuse center 30.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Four deflagration vent support frames 54 (FIG. 8) and their associated deflagration vents 52 are incorporated in left side wall 41.
      <br/>
      Deflagration vents 52 will burst open when pressure is applied to the deflagration vents 52 as the result of an accidental vapor or gas explosion which occurs in the interior portion 79 of mobile reuse center 30.
      <br/>
      For example, a hazardous chemical may be stored in the interior 79 of mobile reuse center 30, a gas leak may occur from a rupture in a stored container within interior 79 and an electrical spark could then ignite the gaseous fumes resulting in an explosion in the interior portion of unit 30.
      <br/>
      The pressure generated from the explosion causes the deflagration vents 52 to burst open releasing combustion waves, toxic gases, etc. into the atmosphere.
