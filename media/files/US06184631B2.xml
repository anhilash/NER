    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a piezoelectric inverter for driving a load using a piezoelectric transformer, and, more particularly, to a piezoelectric inverter that is preferably used as a lighting circuit for a discharge tube, such as a cold-cathode tube for use in a liquid-crystal backlight.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Small cold-cathode tubes are conventionally used as an backlight illumination source for a liquid-crystal display apparatus.
      <br/>
      To drive a cold-cathode tube, a piezoelectric transformer, rather than a magnetic transformer, is used because of the compact design and low cost thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 7-220888 discloses a driver of a backlight cold-cathode tube employing a piezoelectric transformer.
      <br/>
      According to this disclosure, a chopper circuit is connected between a direct-current power source and an inverter driving the piezoelectric transformer.
      <br/>
      The piezoelectric transformer is connected to the cold-cathode tube, and a current flowing through the cold-cathode tube is detected by a tube current detector circuit.
      <br/>
      The luminance of the cold-cathode tube is maintained constant by controlling a duty factor of the chopper circuit to maintain the tube current constant.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 9-107684 discloses a piezoelectric transformer drive circuit which controls a tube current to a desired value by making use of frequency-versus-gain characteristics of the piezoelectric transformer.
      <br/>
      Connected between an input terminal and the piezoelectric transformer are a drive voltage control circuit having no parts for rectifying and smoothing, and a voltage multiplication circuit.
      <br/>
      The drive voltage control circuit maintains constant a mean input voltage applied to the voltage multiplication circuit.
      <br/>
      A cold-cathode tube is connected to the piezoelectric transformer.
      <br/>
      Also provided is a frequency control circuit which detects a current flowing through the cold-cathode tube, and controls the tube current to a desired value taking advantage of the frequency-versus-gain characteristics of the piezoelectric transformer.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      When the input voltage to the voltage multiplication circuit increases with no drive voltage control circuit employed in the control method using the frequency-versus-gain characteristics of the piezoelectric transformer, a drive voltage frequency of the piezoelectric transformer shifts to a high frequency side where the voltage multiplication ratio or gain of the piezoelectric transformer is small, thereby cancelling the increase in the input voltage.
      <br/>
      The conversion efficiency of the piezoelectric transformer drops in a frequency region where the voltage multiplication ratio is small.
      <br/>
      In this conventional art, the drive voltage control circuit maintains constant the mean voltage to the voltage multiplication circuit, thereby maintaining the drive voltage frequency of the piezoelectric transformer to a frequency at which efficiency is high.
      <br/>
      It is therefore believed that the conventional art keeps a relatively high efficiency within a wide input voltage range.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In the conventional art disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 7-220888, the output of the chopper circuit is a direct current, and the chopper circuit is thought to be a DC-DC converter.
      <br/>
      To construct the chopper circuit of a DC-DC converter, inductors and capacitors, for rectifying and smoothing, are required.
      <br/>
      The component count of the circuit increases, and loss attributed thereto is also increased.
    </p>
    <p num="9">The piezoelectric transformer drive circuit, disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 9-107684, needs no rectifier circuit, thereby avoiding the loss attributed thereto.</p>
    <p num="10">
      The conventional art, disclosed in Japanese unexamined Patent Publication No. 9-107684, however, needs two types of feedback control: 1) frequency control for maintaining constant the tube current through a frequency control circuit, and 2) pulse width duty factor control through the drive voltage control circuit for maintaining constant the voltage input to the voltage multiplication circuit.
      <br/>
      The control circuit therefore becomes complicated, increasing costs involved.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a piezoelectric inverter which is low cost, has a simplified control circuit, free from the above problem, needs no rectifying and smoothing circuits, and reliably drives a load using a piezoelectric transformer.</p>
    <p num="12">According to one broad aspect of the present invention, a piezoelectric inverter for driving a load using a piezoelectric transformer, includes an input voltage controller, having a switching transistor and a current circulating element, for converting a direct-current input voltage into a rectangular alternating-current voltage, a piezoelectric transformer driver, connected between the input voltage controller and the piezoelectric transformer, and including an inductive element, for outputting, to the piezoelectric transformer, an alternating-current voltage having a substantially constant frequency that is lower than the frequency of an output alternating-current voltage of the input voltage controller, a first oscillator for determining an operating frequency of the input voltage controller, a second oscillator for determining an operating frequency of the piezoelectric transformer driver, the piezoelectric transformer having an input electrode and an output electrode with the input electrode thereof connected to the piezoelectric transformer driver and the output electrode thereof connected to the load, a load current detector, connected to the load, for detecting a load current, and a duty factor controller, connected to the load current detector, for controlling a duty factor of a rectangular pulse of the input voltage controller in response to the output of the load current detector so that the load current is maintained to a substantially constant target current value, wherein an oscillation frequency of the second oscillator is not higher than a frequency at which the voltage multiplication ratio of the piezoelectric transformer becomes maximized with no load applied to the output of the piezoelectric transformer, and the oscillation frequency of the second oscillator is not lower than a frequency at which the voltage multiplication ratio of the piezoelectric transformer becomes maximized with the piezoelectric transformer driving the load connected to the output thereof.</p>
    <p num="13">Preferably, the second oscillator includes a frequency divider that frequency-divides the frequency of the first oscillator, and a signal into which the frequency of the first oscillator is divided is the output of the second oscillator, and a single oscillator is shared by the first oscillator and the second oscillator.</p>
    <p num="14">Preferably, a piezoelectric inverter of the present invention further includes a temperature-compensating circuit which controls the temperature dependence of required mean output voltage of the input voltage controller, thereby compensating for the dependence of the oscillation frequency of the second oscillator on ambient temperature.</p>
    <p num="15">The temperature-compensating circuit preferably includes one of a thermistor or a temperature-compensating capacitor.</p>
    <p num="16">The target current value is preferably changed in response to an externally applied, first dimmer signal.</p>
    <p num="17">
      Preferably, a piezoelectric inverter of the present invention further includes a variable oscillation-frequency circuit that varies the oscillation frequency of one of the first and second oscillators in response to the first dimmer signal without using feedback control.
      <br/>
      The oscillation frequency of the second oscillator may be varied by varying the output frequency of the first oscillator, and then by frequency-dividing the output frequency of the first oscillator.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a piezoelectric inverter of the present invention further includes a load drive time controller which varies an on time ratio of the load in response to an externally applied, second dimmer signal by intermittently switching on and off the driving of the load.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Preferably, a piezoelectric inverter of the present invention further includes a rectifier for rectifying the load current detected by the load current detector and outputting a direct current in response to the load current, wherein, when the inverter works to set the load to be in an on state, or the load is in an on state, a voltage, substantially equal to a voltage occurring at the output of the rectifier, is applied to the output of the rectifier during a period throughout which the inverter operates to set the load to be in an off state, or the load is in an off state.</p>
    <p num="19">Preferably, a piezoelectric inverter further includes a dead-time controller for controlling a duty factor of a rectangular pulse of the input voltage controller to be not higher than a constant value, without dependence on a current flowing through the load and the output voltage of the rectifier, wherein the duty factor of the rectangular pulse controlled by the dead-time controller varies in response to an input voltage.</p>
    <p num="20">Preferably, a piezoelectric inverter further includes a circuit operation stopping unit which stops the operation of the inverter when a duration, during which the current flowing through the load fails to coincide with the target current value, exceeds a predetermined constant duration of time.</p>
    <p num="21">Preferably, a constant duration from the occurrence of an abnormal event to a stop of the operation of the circuit is varied by a constant of an externally connected component.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Preferably, an excessive rise in the output voltage of the piezoelectric transformer is prevented by varying, toward a high frequency side, the oscillation frequency of the second oscillator when the output voltage of the piezoelectric transformer exceeds a desired value.
      <br/>
      In this case, the frequency of the first oscillator may be varied, and is then frequency-divided as a frequency of the second oscillator.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, an excessive rise in the output voltage of the piezoelectric transformer may be prevented by decreasing the duty factor of the output rectangular pulse of the input voltage controller when the output voltage of the piezoelectric transformer exceeds a desired value.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a startup operation is carried out while the oscillation frequency of the second oscillator sweeps from a high frequency side to a low frequency side.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Preferably, the oscillation frequency of the second oscillator is shifted to a low frequency lower than a normal oscillation frequency thereof when the input voltage is lower than a desired frequency.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The piezoelectric inverter of this invention is used to drive a variety of loads, and is suited for use in lighting and light adjustment control of a discharge tube in particular.
      <br/>
      Such discharge tubes include, but not limited to, a cold-cathode tube for a liquid-crystal backlight.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="26">The present invention is now discussed in more detail, referring to the drawings.</p>
    <p num="27">FIG. 1 is a block diagram generally showing a piezoelectric inverter of a first embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 2 is a circuit diagram specifically showing the circuit of the piezoelectric inverter shown in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="28">
      Referring to FIG. 1, an input voltage controller 1 (input voltage control means) receives an input voltage in the piezoelectric inverter of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The input voltage controller 1 turns on and off the input voltage at a predetermined frequency, thereby converting the input voltage into a rectangular alternating-current voltage.
      <br/>
      The input voltage controller 1 is composed of a voltage stepdown chopper circuit including neither rectifying circuit nor smoothing circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      A first oscillator 2 is connected to the input voltage controller 1 through a duty factor controller 3.
      <br/>
      The first oscillator 2 is used to provide the predetermined frequency to the input voltage controller 1.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The input voltage controller 1 is connected to a piezoelectric transformer driver 4.
      <br/>
      The piezoelectric transformer driver 4 is connected to a second oscillator 5.
      <br/>
      The piezoelectric transformer driver 4 performs a switching operation at a frequency determined by the second oscillator 5.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Specifically, the piezoelectric transformer driver 4 converts the rectangular alternating-current voltage input from the input voltage controller 1 into an alternating-current voltage having the frequency derived from the second oscillator 5 as a main component thereof.
      <br/>
      The piezoelectric transformer driver 4 includes an inductive element, i.e., an inductor or an electromagnetic transformer.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The oscillation frequency of the second oscillator 5 is set to be lower than the oscillation frequency of the first oscillator 2.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the oscillation frequency of the second oscillator 5 is set to be equal to or lower than one-quarter of the oscillation frequency of the first oscillator 2.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      A piezoelectric transformer 6 is fabricated of a known Rosen-type piezoelectric transformer.
      <br/>
      The piezoelectric transformer driver 4 applies the alternating-current voltage to an input terminal of the piezoelectric transformer 6.
      <br/>
      The piezoelectric transformer 6 multiplies the input alternating-current voltage and then outputs an alternating-current voltage.
      <br/>
      The alternating-current voltage output from the piezoelectric transformer 6 is applied to a discharge tube 7 as a load.
    </p>
    <p num="34">The discharge tube 7 is connected to a current detector 8, which detects a current flowing through the discharge tube 7, namely, a load current.</p>
    <p num="35">
      A rectifier 9 is connected to an output terminal of the current detector 8.
      <br/>
      The rectifier 9 rectifies the load current detected through the current detector 8 at a certain time constant, and outputs a direct-current voltage responsive to the load current.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The rectifier 9 is then connected to the duty factor controller 3.
      <br/>
      The duty factor controller 3 compares the output voltage of the rectifier 9 to a target voltage corresponding to a predetermined target load current, and controls the duty factor of the rectangular pulse of the input voltage controller 1 so that the output voltage of the rectifier 9 coincides with the target voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In the circuit arrangement shown in FIG. 1, the voltage control means in this invention includes, in a broad sense, the input voltage controller 1, the first oscillator 2, the duty factor controller 3, the piezoelectric transformer driver 4, the second oscillator 5, the current detector 8, and the rectifier 9.
      <br/>
      The voltage control means thus controls the mean voltage of the alternating-current voltage input to the piezoelectric transformer 6 so that the current flowing through the load coincides with the target current value.
    </p>
    <p num="38">The operation of the piezoelectric inverter shown in FIG. 1 is now discussed.</p>
    <p num="39">
      At startup, a direct-current input voltage from a power source is applied to the input voltage controller 1, and is converted into a rectangular alternating-current voltage in accordance with the oscillation frequency provided by the first oscillator 2.
      <br/>
      The rectangular alternating-current voltage is then fed to the piezoelectric transformer driver 4, which in turn performs a switching operation in accordance with the oscillation frequency of the second oscillator 5 to switch on and off the input alternating-current voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The oscillation frequency of the first oscillator 2 is higher than the oscillation frequency of the second oscillator 5, and the inductive element arranged in the piezoelectric transformer driver 4 removes the frequency component derived from the first oscillator 2.
      <br/>
      The piezoelectric transformer driver 4 outputs almost no frequency component derived from the first oscillator 2 in the output voltage thereof, and the main component of the output voltage thereof is a frequency component of the second oscillator 5.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The piezoelectric transformer driver 4 drives the piezoelectric transformer 6, and the piezoelectric transformer 6 outputs a high-tension voltage at the output terminal thereof, namely, the output electrode thereof, causing the discharge tube 7 to light.
      <br/>
      When the discharge tube 7 is lit, a current, namely, a load current starts flowing therethrough.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The load current is detected by the current detector 8, and a direct-current voltage responsive to the magnitude of the load current is output by the rectifier 9.
      <br/>
      The duty factor controller 3 compares the direct-current voltage of the rectifier 9 to the constant target voltage corresponding to the target load current and controls the duty factor of the rectangular pulse of the input voltage controller 1 so that the two voltages coincide with each other.
      <br/>
      The load current is thus controlled to the target current value, and luminance of the discharge tube 7 is thus maintained constant.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      An increase in the load current due to an external disturbance is now considered.
      <br/>
      The increase in the load current causes the voltages of the current detector 8 and the rectifier 9 to rise.
      <br/>
      As a result, a difference occurs between the target voltage value and the direct-current voltage.
      <br/>
      In response to the difference, the duty factor controller 3 reduces the duty factor of the rectangular pulse.
      <br/>
      The method of reducing the duty factor is not limited to any particular method.
      <br/>
      For instance, an on time ratio of a switching element in the input voltage controller 1 is reduced, thereby lowering the mean voltage of the input voltage controller 1.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The piezoelectric transformer 6 operates at a substantially constant frequency determined by the oscillation frequency of the second oscillator 5.
      <br/>
      When the voltage input to the piezoelectric transformer driver 4 drops, the output voltage of the piezoelectric transformer driver 4 also drops accordingly.
    </p>
    <p num="45">The load current decreases, controlling the effect of the initial external disturbance.</p>
    <p num="46">When the load current drops due to an external disturbance, control in the opposite direction is performed, thereby maintaining constant the load current.</p>
    <p num="47">
      In the piezoelectric inverter shown in FIG. 1, the input voltage controller 1 converts the input voltage into the rectangular alternating-current voltage based on the oscillation frequency of the first oscillator 2, and the duty factor controller 3 compares the direct-current voltage output by the rectifier 9 to the target voltage corresponding to the target current value, and controls the rectangular pulse duty factor of the input voltage controller 1 so that the two voltages coincide with each other.
      <br/>
      The piezoelectric inverter thus controls the load current to the target load current value.
      <br/>
      Since a voltage stepdown chopper circuit having neither rectifying circuit nor smoothing circuit is employed as the input voltage controller 1, the component count is reduced, and loss involved is reduced accordingly.
      <br/>
      Since feedback control is used in the duty factor controller 3 only, the circuit arrangement of the control system is simplified.
    </p>
    <p num="48">Referring to FIG. 2, the piezoelectric inverter of this embodiment is specifically discussed.</p>
    <p num="49">
      In the circuit diagram shown in FIG. 2, the input voltage controller 1 is composed of a P-type FET1a as a switching element and a diode 1b as a current circulating element.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the source of the FET1a is connected to an input terminal IN, and the drain thereof is connected to the piezoelectric transformer driver 4.
      <br/>
      The gate of the FET1a is connected to the duty factor controller 3.
      <br/>
      The diode 1b is connected between a junction 1c of the drain of the FET1a and the piezoelectric transformer driver 4 and ground in a manner such that the forward direction thereof is aligned to the junction 1c.
    </p>
    <p num="50">The diode 1b is arranged so that no surge voltage occurs in response to a sharp change in the inductor current of the piezoelectric transformer driver 4 when the FET1a is turned off.</p>
    <p num="51">
      The piezoelectric transformer driver 4 includes two inductors 4a and 4b, and two N-type FET4c and N-type FET4d.
      <br/>
      Specifically, ends of two inductors 4a and 4b are connected to the input terminal of the piezoelectric transformer driver 4 in parallel.
      <br/>
      The other ends of the inductors 4a and 4b are respectively connected to drains of the FET4c and FET4d.
      <br/>
      The sources of the FET4c and FET4d are respectively grounded.
      <br/>
      The gates of the FET4c and FET4d are respectively connected to the second oscillator 5.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      A junction 4e of the inductor 4a and the drain of the FET4c forms one output terminal of the piezoelectric transformer driver 4, and a junction 4f of the inductor 4b and the drain of the FET4d forms a second output terminal of the piezoelectric transformer driver 4.
      <br/>
      In other words, the FET4c and FET4d form a push-pull circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The piezoelectric transformer 6 includes a pair of input electrodes 6a and 6b and an output electrode 6c.
      <br/>
      The input electrode 6a is connected to the junction 4e, and the input electrode 6b is connected to the junction 4f.
      <br/>
      The piezoelectric transformer 6 is thus driven by the alternating-current voltage output by the piezoelectric transformer driver 4.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The voltage stepped up by the piezoelectric transformer 6 is output to the output electrode 6c.
      <br/>

      It is known that insufficient impedance matching between the output impedance of the piezoelectric transformer 6 and the impedance of the discharge tube 7 causes the load current to pulsate or causes the discharge tube 7 to intermittently light.

      In the conventional art disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 7-220888, the piezoelectric transformer is self-oscillating, and thus operates at a frequency providing a maximum voltage multiplication ratio regardless of load state.

      The auto transformer 14b is arranged to compensate for a lack of voltage multiplication ratio of the piezoelectric transformer 6.

      In a region where the on duty width is too narrow in PWM (pulse-width modulation) control, gain of the control system becomes excessively large, and assuring system stability is difficult.

      When the first dimmer signal voltage becomes low, the multiplication gain of the piezoelectric transformer 6 decreases.

    <p num="153">
      The dead-time generator circuit 31 is arranged to perform a dead-time function.

      <br/>
      According to the quasi-class-E multiplication effect of the piezoelectric transformer driver 4, the output voltage of the piezoelectric transformer driver 4 is approximately 20 V peak voltage (=5 V * 3).

      When the value VFB rises in excess of a predetermined constant voltage, a capacitor 102 connected to a time-constant setting terminal of the open/short protection circuit 32 starts to be charged.

      The "constant duration of time" is varied depending on the operational conditions under which the user uses the inverter, and is specifically varied from one second to a longtime.

      <br/>
      The input voltage controller repeats on and off operations on the mean output voltage thereof, while preventing an excessive voltage from being output.
    </p>
    <p num="185">
      In the above discussion, the transistor Q102 is fully turned on, and the duty factor of the switching element of the input voltage controller 1 becomes zero percent.
      <br/>
      Reducing the duty factor down to zero percent is not a requirement.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the transistors Q101 and Q102 are used in a linear region (a half-on region) so that the input voltage to the dead-time generator circuit 31 is controlled to be an intermediate voltage, higher than zero V and lower than the reference voltage.
      <br/>
      The output of the input voltage controller 1 does not fully become zero, but agrees with a substantially constant voltage so that the piezoelectric inverter output voltage continuously coincides with a target open voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="186">In both cases, the voltage higher than the light enable voltage is continuously output, while the protection operation is performed to control the generation of excessive voltages.</p>
    <p num="187">FIG. 11 is a circuit diagram showing a piezoelectric inverter of a seventh embodiment of the present invention.</p>

      In the seventh embodiment, a piezoelectric transformer driver 54 includes two FET54a and FET54b configured in a half bridge.

      The drain of the FET54a is connected to the drain of the FET54b.
      <br/>
      The source of the FET54b is grounded.

      A capacitor 54f is connected between a junction 54e of the other end of the inductor 54d and the input electrode 6a of the piezo electric transformer6 and ground potential.

      Specifically, an LC low-pass filter composed of the inductor 54d and the capacitor 54f is connected to the output of a drive circuit having a half-bridge configuration of the FET54a and FET54b.
      <br/>
      The output voltage, from which high-frequency components have been removed by the LC low-pass filter, is added to the piezoelectric transformer 6.

    <p num="190">
      The resonance frequency of the LC filter, determined by the sum of the capacitance of the capacitor 54f and the input capacitance of the piezoelectric transformer 6 and the inductance of the inductor 54d, is substantially equalized to the drive frequency of the piezoelectric transformer 6.
      <br/>
      An optimum design is thus accomplished.

      The circuit arrangement of the piezoelectric transformer driver is not limited to any particular one.
      <br/>
      The circuit arrangement of the piezoelectric transformer driver of each preceding embodiment may be implemented.
      <br/>
      By connecting the LC low-pass filter, a voltage, from which unwanted high-frequency components are removed, is applied to the piezoelectric transformer.

      In the seventh embodiment, the input voltage is divided by resistors 201 and 202.
      <br/>
      One end of a Zener diode vz is connected to a division junction 51 of the resistors 201 and 202, and the other end thereof is connected to the base of a transistor Q201 via a resistor R52.
      <br/>
      The collector of the transistor Q201 is connected to a frequency-setting-resistor terminal of the second oscillator 25 via a resistor R203.
      <br/>
      The emitter of the transistor Q201 is grounded.
    </p>
    <p num="192">
      The input voltage is divided by the resistors R201 and R202.
      <br/>
      When the divided voltage is higher than a Zener voltage of the Zener diode Vz, the Zener diode Vz becomes conductive.
      <br/>
      As a result, the transistor Q201 is turned on, increasing the frequency of the second oscillator 25.
      <br/>
      Conversely, when the input voltage drops, turning off the transistor Q201, a resistor R203 is isolated from ground potential.
      <br/>
      The oscillation frequency of the second oscillator thus drops.
      <br/>
      During the normal operational conditions, the piezoelectric inverter operates in a high-efficiency frequency region and maintains lighting even in the event of a voltage drop in the input voltage.
      <br/>
      This operation is now discussed.
    </p>
    <p num="193">Now discussed is the piezoelectric inverter for use in a notebook personal computer with an input voltage rating of 7 to 20 V and an input voltage of 10.8 V during a battery operation.</p>
    <p num="194">
      As clearly seen from FIG. 4, the frequency giving a maximum efficiency of the piezoelectric transformer 6 is slightly higher than a frequency giving a maximum gain.
      <br/>
      With an input voltage of 10.8 V, a frequency of 57.5 kHz providing a maximum efficiency is now used.
      <br/>
      The voltage multiplication gain of the piezoelectric transformer 6 is 34 dB, and there is a margin of 5 dB to the maximum gain of 39 dB.
    </p>
    <p num="195">
      Now considered is a rare case in which the input voltage drops down to 7 V. When the frequency is fixed to 57.5 kHz, the gain of the piezoelectric transformer 6 is also fixed.
      <br/>
      The on duty of the input voltage controller 1 needs to be increased to maintain the mean output voltage of the input voltage controller 1 to a certain value.
      <br/>
      Assuming that the required output voltage of the input voltage controller 1 is 8 V, the rectangular pulse duty becomes 100%, and a SCP function is activated, stopping the inverter.

    <p num="196">
      By selecting appropriate resistances of the resistor R201, R202, and R203, the transistor Q201 is turned off with the input voltage smaller than 9 V, and the oscillation frequency set to move to 56.5 kHz, the gain of the piezoelectric transformer 6 increases to 38 dB with the input voltage of 9 V or smaller.
      <br/>
      The mean voltage of the input voltage controller 1 required for maintaining the load current drops, causing the inverter not to stop operating even from an input voltage of 7 V.
    </p>
    <p num="197">
      At an oscillation frequency of 56.6 kHz, the piezoelectric transformer presents an efficiency slightly lower than that at an oscillation frequency of 57.5 kHz. An input voltage smaller than 9 V is rarely input in actual operating conditions.

      An efficiency slightly lower in this frequency is not a problem in practice.

      When the input voltage becomes lower than a desired constant value, a circuit for changing the oscillation frequency of the second oscillator to another frequency slightly lower than normal frequency is added.

      Lighting is assured within a wide range of input voltage and at the input voltage most frequently used, the piezoelectric transformer is thus driven at a frequency that provides a maximum efficiency of the piezoelectric transformer.

      In the piezoelectric inverter of the present invention, the load is connected to the output electrode of the piezoelectric inverter, and the voltage control means controls the current flowing through the load to approximately the target current value.
      <br/>
      Since the voltage control means functions to control the mean voltage of the alternating-current voltage to the piezoelectric transformer, the load current is stabilized through single feedback control.
      <br/>
      The construction of the control circuit system is thus simplified and low cost.
      <br/>
      The input voltage controller, including the switching transistor and the current circulating element, is used for the voltage control means.
      <br/>
      When the duty factor of the input voltage controller is controlled so that the current flowing through the load approximately coincides with the target current value, a stepdown chopper circuit including the switching transistor and the current circulating element is constructed.
      <br/>
      Since the chopper circuit needs neither inductor nor capacitor for rectifying and smoothing, the component count is reduced.
      <br/>
      It is sufficient to control the duty factor of the input voltage controller, and the control system is thus simplified.
      <br/>
      A simplified and low-cost circuit arrangement thus results.

    <p num="200">Since the input voltage controller, including the switching transistor and the current circulating element, needs neither smoothing means and rectifying means, the input voltage controller is free from loss involved in such smoothing and rectifying means.</p>

      With a single feedback control loop, the load current is stabilized.
      <br/>
      In other words, the control system is simplified.
      <br/>
      A low-cost and reliable piezoelectric inverter results.

      The piezoelectric inverter may include the frequency divider to divide the frequency of the first oscillator, and when the divided one of the frequency of the first oscillator is the output of the first oscillator, the first oscillator and the second oscillator are constructed of a single oscillator circuit.

      This arrangement provides a high efficiency, and controls the unstable operation in which the load current pulsates.

      The piezoelectric inverter may also include the temperature-compensating circuit to correct the dependence of the oscillation frequency of the second oscillator on the ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      The required mean output voltage of the input voltage controller is thus controlled by the temperature compensation function.
      <br/>
      This arrangement reduces variations in the output of the input voltage controller, eliminates the need for a piezoelectric transformer having an unnecessarily higher voltage multiplication ratio, and results in a low-cost piezoelectric transformer.

    <p num="211">
      The piezoelectric inverter may also include the rectifier to rectify the load current from the load current detector and to output the direct-current voltage responsive to the load current.
      <br/>
      When the inverter works to set the load to be in an on state, or the load is in an on state, the voltage, substantially equal to the voltage occurring at the output of the rectifier, is applied to the output of the rectifier during a period throughout which the circuitry operates to set the load to be in an off state, or the load is in an off state.
      <br/>
      The variation in the duty factor of the output rectangular pulse of the duty factor controller is controlled during the burst off period.
      <br/>
      The light adjustment feature is thus improved.

      The piezoelectric inverter may further include a dead-time controller for controlling the duty factor of the rectangular pulse of the input voltage controller to be not higher than a predetermined value, without dependence on a current flowing through the load and the output voltage of the rectifier.
      <br/>
      Since the duty factor of the rectangular pulse controlled by the dead-time controller varies in response to an input voltage, an excessive rise in the output of the input voltage controller is controlled with a high input voltage and in an out-of-feedback state.
      <br/>
      Low withstand voltage, thus low-cost FETs are used for the piezoelectric transformer.

      The piezoelectric inverter may further include the circuit operation stopping unit which stops the operation of the circuit when a duration, during which the current flowing through the load fails to agree with the target current value, exceeds a predetermined constant duration of time.

    <p num="218">
      The oscillation frequency of the second oscillator is shifted to a low frequency lower than the normal oscillation frequency when the input voltage is lower than a desired frequency.

      In this arrangement, the operational frequency of the piezoelectric transformer is shifted into a lower frequency side, thereby increasing the voltage multiplication gain.
      <br/>
      This reduces the possibility of aborted lighting of the discharge tube, and causes the discharge tube to reliably light.
