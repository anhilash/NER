      Antal Orosz, et al., International Journal of Cancer, 1995, 60, 82-87, describe the use of a variety of peptidic substance P antagonists to inhibit the proliferation of small cell lung carcinoma, e.g., in the cell line designated NCl-H69).

      Paul Bunn et al., Cancer Research, 1994, 54, 3602-3610, describe another series of substance P antagonists which are also peptidic and which are capable of inhibiting in vitro growth of a number of small cell lung carcinoma cell lines (e.g., those designated NCl-H510, NCl-H345 and SHP-77).

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">The present invention relates to a method of treating cancer in a mammal, including a human, comprising administering to such mammal a therapeutically effective amount of an NK-1 receptor antagonist selected from the compounds described below.</p>
    <p num="5">"Treating cancer", as used herein, means inhibiting or controlling the proliferation of a small cell lung carcinoma, APUDoma, neuroendocrine tumor, extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma or astrocytoma.</p>
    <p num="6">A "therapeutically effective amount", as used herein, means an amount effective in treating cancer, as defined immediately above.</p>
    <p num="7">
      An "astrocytoma" is a tumor composed of astrocytes.
      <br/>
      Astrocytes are neuroglial cells of ectodermal origin, characterized by fibrous, protoplasmic or plasmatofibrous processes.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      APUDomas are tumors composed of APUD (amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation) cells.
      <br/>
      APUD cells are found scattered throughout the body (e.g., in the chromaffin system, hypothalamus, hypophysis, thyroid, parathyroids, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and pancreas) and are apparently unrelated but for sharing certain cytochemical and ultrastructural characteristics.
      <br/>
      They synthesize structurally related peptides (usually biogenic amines) that function as hormones or neurotransmitters (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, enkalphalin, somatostatin, neurotensin and substance P).
      <br/>
      ADUP cells concentrate the amino acid precursors of these amines and decarboxylate them to their respective amines.
    </p>
    <p num="9">More specifically, this invention relates to a method of treating cancer in a mammal, including a human, comprising administering to such mammal a therapeutically effective amount of an NK-1 receptor antagonist that is a compound of the formula  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="10">wherein A is a ring system selected from phenyl, naphthyl, thienyl, dihydroquinolinyl, quinolinyl and indolinyl, and wherein the sidechain containing NR2 R3 is attached to a carbon atom of ring system A;</p>
    <p num="11">

      The therapeutic agents that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids.
      <br/>
      Examples of acids that form suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts for use in this invention are those that form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, acetate, lactate, citrate, acid citrate, tartrate, bitartrate, succinate, maleate, fumarate, gluconate, saccharate, benzoate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and pamoate �i.e., 1,1'-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)�salts.
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate a therapeutic agent from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt.
      <br/>
      The acid addition salts of the base therapeutic agents of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol.
      <br/>
      Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      Those therapeutic agents of this invention that are also acidic in nature are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations.
      <br/>
      The chemical bases that are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of the therapeutic agents are those that form non-toxic base salts with the acidic therapeutic agents.
      <br/>
      Such non-toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, etc.
      <br/>
      These salts can easily be prepared by treating the corresponding acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired pharmacologically acceptable cations, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before.
      <br/>
      In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum yields of the desired final product.

    <p num="173">Other NK-1 receptor antagonists that can be employed in the methods of this invention are those compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts described in the following references: European Patent Application EP 499,313, published Aug. 19, 1992; European Patent Application EP 520,555, published Dec. 30, 1992; European Patent Application EP 522,808, published Jan. 13, 1993, European Patent Application EP 528,495, published Feb. 24, 1993, PCT Patent Application WO 93/14084, published Jul. 22, 1993, PCT Patent Application WO 93/01169, published Jan. 21, 1993, PCT Patent Application WO 93/01165, published Jan. 21, 1993, PCT Patent Application WO 93/01159, published Jan. 21, 1993, PCT Patent Application WO 92/20661, published Nov. 26, 1992, European Patent Application EP 517,589, published Dec. 12, 1992, European Patent Application EP 428,434, published May 22, 1991, European Patent Application EP 360,390, published Mar. 28, 1990, PCT Patent Application WO 95/19344, published Jul. 20, 1995, PCT Patent Application WO 95/23810, published Sep. 8, 1995, PCT Patent Application WO 95/20575, published Aug. 3, 1995 and PCT Patent Application WO 95/28418, published Oct. 26, 1995.</p>
    <p num="174">
      Generally, in carrying out the methods of this invention, the NK-1 receptor antagonist will be administered to an adult human in an amount ranging from about 0.07 to about 21 mg per kg body weight of the subject being treated per day, in single or divided doses, preferably from about 0.36 to about 4.3 mg/kg. Variations may nevertheless occur depending upon the species of the subject being treated and its individual response to said medicament, as well as on the type of pharmaceutical formulation chosen and the time period and interval at which such administration is carried out.
      <br/>
      In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.
    </p>
    <p num="175">
      The NK-1 receptor antagonists and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts that are employed in the methods of this invention are hereinafter also referred to as the "therapeutic agents".
      <br/>
      The therapeutic agents can be administered via either the oral or parenteral route.
    </p>
    <p num="176">
      The therapeutic agents may be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents by either of the routes previously indicated, and such administration may be carried out in single or multiple doses.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the novel therapeutic agents of this invention can be administered in a wide variety of different dosage forms, i.e., they may be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, hard candies, suppositories, aqueous suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs, syrups, and the like.
      <br/>
      Such carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various non4toxic organic solvents, etc.
      <br/>
      Moreover, oral pharmaceutical compositions can be suitably sweetened and/or flavored.
      <br/>
      In general, the therapeutic compounds of this invention are present in such dosage forms at concentration levels ranging from about 5.0% to about 70% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="177">
      For oral administration, tablets containing various excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and glycine may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch (and preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch), alginic acid and certain complex silicates, together with granulation binders like polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia.
      <br/>
      Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes.
      <br/>
      Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols.
      <br/>
      When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the active ingredient may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes, and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents as well, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="178">
      For parenteral administration, solutions of a therapeutic agent in either sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol may be employed.
      <br/>
      The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic.
      <br/>
      These aqueous solutions are suitable for intravenous injection purposes.
      <br/>
      The oily solutions are suitable for intraarticular, intramuscular and subcutaneous injection purposes.
      <br/>
      The preparation of all these solutions under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.

      The activity of certain therapeutic agents as substance P receptor antagonists may be determined by their ability to inhibit the binding of substance P at its receptor sites in bovine caudate tissue, employing radioactive ligands to visualize the tachykinin receptors by means of autoradiography.
      <br/>
      The substance P antagonizing activity of the herein described compounds may be evaluated by using the standard assay procedure described by M. A. Cascieri et al., as reported in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 258, p. 5158 (1983).
      <br/>
      This method essentially involves determining the concentration of the individual compound required to reduce by 50% the amount of radiolabelled substance P ligands at their receptor sites in said isolated cow tissues, thereby affording characteristic IC50 values for each compound tested.
    </p>
    <p num="180">
      In this procedure, bovine caudate tissue is removed from a -70 (degree)  C. freezer and homogenized in 50 volumes (w./v.) of an ice-cold 50 mM Tris (i.e., trimethamine which is 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol) hydrochloride buffer having a pH of 7.7. The homogenate is centrifuged at 30,000 * G for a period of 20 minutes.
      <br/>
      The pellet is resuspended in 50 volumes of Tris buffer, rehomogenized and then recentrifuged at 30,000 * G for another twenty-minute period.
      <br/>
      The pellet is then resuspended in 40 volumes of ice-cold 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.7) containing 2 mM of calcium chloride, 2 mM of magnesium chloride, 4  MU g/ml of bacitracin, 4  MU g/ml of leupeptin, 2  MU g of chymostatin and 200  MU g/ml of bovine serum albumin.
      <br/>
      This step completes the production of the tissue preparation.
    </p>
    <p num="181">
      The radioligand binding procedure is then carried out in the following manner, viz., by initiating the reaction via the addition of 100  MU l of the test compound made up to a concentration of 1  MU M, followed by the addition of 100  MU l of radioactive ligand made up to a final concentration 0.5 mM and then finally by the addition of 800  MU l of the tissue preparation produced as described above.
      <br/>
      The final volume is thus 1.0 ml, and the reaction mixture is next vortexed and incubated at room temperature (ca. 20 (degree)  C.) for a period of 20 minutes.
      <br/>
      The tubes are then filtered using a cell harvester, and the glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/B) are washed four times with 50 mM of Tris buffer (pH 7.7), with the filters having previously been presoaked for a period of two hours prior to the filtering procedure.
      <br/>
      Radioactivity is then determined in a Beta counter at 53% counting efficiency, and the IC50 values are calculated by using standard statistical methods.

    <p num="182">The ability of the NK-1 receptor antagonists used in the methods of this invention to inhibit the proliferation of small cell lung carcinoma cells can be determined using the in vivo and in vitro cell proliferation assays described by Orosz et al., International Journal of Cancer, 1995, 60, 82-87, and by Bunn et al., Cancer Research, 1994, 54, 3602-3610.</p>
