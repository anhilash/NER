      There is described a method of stably manufacturing a fine resist pattern narrower than the wavelength of exposing light from a stepper.
      <br/>
      Under the method, a resist pattern is formed on a semiconductor substrate through use of an acid catalyst chemically-amplified photoresist, and an organic film which includes an acid or which produces an acid on exposure to light is formed on the surface of the semiconductor substrate including the resist pattern.
      <br/>
      The organic film is then subjected to a heat treatment to thereby diffuse an acid.
      <br/>
      The surface layer of the resist pattern is made soluble in an alkaline developer, and the surface layer of the resist pattern is removed through use of the alkaline developer.
      <br/>
      As a result, a fine resist pattern is formed.

      FIG. 14 shows resist patterns which are formed on an underlying layer 21 according to a conventional method by exposing the layer to light through a mask held at an optimum focal point by a stepper.

      In FIG. 14, reference numeral 22 designates a resist pattern having a line width broader than the wavelength of exposing light from the light source of the stepper, and 23 designates a fine resist pattern having a line width narrower than the wavelength of exposing light from the light source of the stepper.
      <br/>
      As mentioned above, in a case where the underlying layer is exposed to light through the mask held at an optimum focal point, even the existing method enables a resist pattern to be formed substantially faithfully.

      FIG. 15 shows resist patterns which are formed on the underlying layer 21 according to the existing method by exposing the layer to light through a mask held out of focus.

      In FIG. 15, reference numeral 22' designates a resist pattern having a line width broader than the wavelength of exposing light from the light source of the stepper, and reference numeral 23' designates a fine resist pattern having a line width narrower than the wavelength of exposing light from the light source of the stepper.
      <br/>
      In a case where the underlying layer is exposed to light through the mask held out of focus, no problems are encountered in the formation of the resist pattern 22' having a line width broader than the wavelength of exposing light from the light source of the stepper.
      <br/>
      In contrast, in a case where the fine resist pattern 23' having a line width narrower than the wavelength of exposing light from the light source is formed, there arises a problem that the line width of a resultant pattern becomes narrower.

      As designated by line 22a shown in FIG. 16, in a case where a resist pattern of great size is formed, no dimensional variations arise even if the mask of the stepper is slightly defocused.
      <br/>
      In contrast, as designated by curved line 23a shown in FIG. 16, in a case where a fine resist pattern smaller than the wavelength of exposing light from the light source of the stepper is formed, and if the mask of the stepper is defocused, significant dimensional variations arise, resulting in a resist pattern of undesirable size.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="17">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="18">First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="19">FIGS. 1(a) and 1(b) are schematic representations for explaining a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to a first embodiment of the present invention, more particularly a method of forming a fine resist pattern in comparison with an existing method.</p>
    <p num="20">FIG. 1(a) comprises fragmentary cross-sectional views showing a series of steps for formation of a resist pattern according to the first embodiment, and FIG. 1(b) comprises fragmentary cross-sectional views showing a series of steps for formation of a resist pattern by conventional photolithography.</p>
    <p num="21">
      First, as shown in step 1, a semiconductor substrate 2 having a step 3 formed thereon is used as a wafer 1.
      <br/>
      A chemically-amplified positive resist 4 for use with an Excimer laser beam is applied onto the semiconductor substrate 2 including the step 3 to a thickness of 3,000 to 20,000  Angstrom .
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Before the positive resist 4 is applied to the wafer 1, the surface of the wafer 1 may be treated with hexamethyldisilazane or the like, thus strengthening adhesion between the resist 4 and the wafer 1.
      <br/>
      Further, an upper layer material may be applied on the resist 4.
      <br/>
      Still further, the thus-coated resist 4 may be subjected to heat treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="23">In step 2, according to the first embodiment shown in FIG. 1(a) the positive resist 4 is selectively exposed to light through a mask 5a adjusted so as to produce a line width of 0.25  MU m (or a line width of 1.25  MU m in a case where a pattern is imaged on the resist on a scale of 1:5).</p>
    <p num="24">In contrast, according to the conventional method shown in FIG. 1(b), the positive resist 4 is selectively exposed to light through a mask 5b adjusted so as to produce a line width of 0.15  MU m (or a line width of 0.75  MU m in a case where a pattern is imaged on the resist on a scale of 1:5).</p>
    <p num="25">
      In step 3, the thus-exposed resist patterns are developed.
      <br/>
      Suppose the positive resist is exposed to light in step 2 while the stepper is focused on a lower portion of the step 3 of the semiconductor substrate 1.
      <br/>
      According to the first embodiment shown in FIG. 1(a), since the mask pattern has a significant size, resist patterns having a size of 0.25  MU m are formed on the step 3 and on the semiconductor substrate 2 below the step 3, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In contrast, under the conventional method shown in FIG. 1(b), a resist pattern having a size of 0.15  MU m is formed below the step 3 or on the semiconductor substrate 2, and a resist pattern having a size of 0.10  MU m is formed on the step 3.
      <br/>
      Thus, variations arise in the line width of the resist patterns.
    </p>
    <p num="27">In step 4, according to the first embodiment, resin made of a polyacrylic acid is applied onto the wafer 1 as an organic film 7 which contains an acidic component.</p>
    <p num="28">
      In step 5, the organic film 7 formed over the wafer 1 is subjected to a heat treatment at 120 (degree)  C. for 60 seconds while the wafer 1 is loaded on a hot plate (not shown).
      <br/>
      This is intended to diffuse the acid over the surface layer of the resist pattern 6 by heating the organic film 7, thus rendering the surface layer of the resist pattern 6 soluble in an alkaline developer.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a layer 11 that has been made soluble (hereinafter simply referred to as a solubilized layer) is formed along the surface of the resist pattern 6.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      As shown in step 6, when the resist pattern is developed with the alkaline developer, the surface layer of the resist pattern 6 is dissolved, and the resist pattern shrinks 0.10  MU m in line width.
      <br/>
      As a result, a resist pattern 8 having a line width of 0.15  MU m is produced.
    </p>
    <p num="30">In step 5, if the temperature of the heat treatment is increased, or the time required for heat treatment is increased, then the amount of resist pattern dissolved by development in step 6 will increase, resulting in an increase in the amount of shrinkage of the line width.</p>
    <p num="31">
      According to the first embodiment, an acidic polymer can be used as the organic film 7 which contains an acidic component.
      <br/>
      More specifically, a base polymer which is acidic in itself is used as the organic film 7.
    </p>
    <p num="32">Preferably, for example, an polyacrylic acid or a polyvinyl sulfuric acid can be used as the acidic polymer.</p>
    <p num="33">
      Further, a polymer having an acidic component added thereto can be used as the organic film containing an acidic component.
      <br/>
      More specifically, a base polymer which has neutrality and has an acidic component added thereto is used as the organic film.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Preferably, for example, the polymer can be selected from the group consisting of polyvinyl alcohol, a polyacrylic acid, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl amine, and polyvinyl acetal.</p>
    <p num="35">Further preferably, an acidic component added to such a polymer can be selected from the group consisting of an alkyl carboxylic acid, an alkyl sulfuric acid, and a salicylic acid.</p>
    <p num="36">Preferably, a solution used for forming the organic film 7 may be pure water or a mixed solution which is composed of pure water and an organic solvent to such an extent as not to dissolve the resist pattern.</p>
    <p num="37">The film forming characteristics of the organic film 7 can be improved, or the diffusion length of an acid in the organic film 7 can be retarded, by addition of an organic base component, such as tetramethylammoniumhydroxide, ethanol amine, or ammonium, to the organic film 7.</p>
    <p num="38">Preferably, the organic base component can be selected from the group consisting of tetramethylammoniumhydroxide, ethanol amine, and ammonium.</p>
    <p num="39">The coating characteristics of the organic film 7 can be improved by addition of a surfactant to the organic film 7.</p>
    <p num="40">Preferably, an alkaline solution containing 1 to 5 wt. % of tetramethylammoniumhydroxide or this alkaline solution having 10 wt. % or less of alcohol added thereto is used as the alkaline developer.</p>
    <p num="41">Next, the mechanism of rendering the surface layer of the resist pattern 6 soluble in the alkaline developer by thermally treating the organic film 7 will be described hereunder.</p>
    <p num="42">
      As diagrammatically shown in FIG. 2A, in a chemically-amplified positive resist for use with an Excimer laser beam, a base resin 4a is linked to a protecting group 4b, thus rendering the resist undissolvable in an alkaline solution.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2(b), when the acid produced by thermally treating the organic film acts on the resist, the linkage between the base resin 4a and the protecting group 4b is separated, thus rendering the resist dissolvable in an alkaline solution.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, only the surface layer of the acidly-processed resist pattern becomes dissolvable in an alkaline solution.
      <br/>
      The surface layer of the resist pattern is dissolved by treating the resist pattern with an alkaline developer, enabling the resist patterns (i.e., residual resist portions) to be shrunk.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      As mentioned previously, according to the first embodiment, a resist pattern is formed on a semiconductor substrate by processing an acid catalyst chemically-amplified positive resist through ordinary photolithography.
      <br/>
      Next, an organic film containing an acidic component is applied to the pattern, and a resultantly-produced acid is diffused into the resist pattern.
      <br/>
      The surface layer of the resist pattern (i.e., the residual resist portion) is made soluble in an alkaline developer by means of catalytic action of the acid.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the organic film and the solubilized layer are removed by the alkaline developer, thus shrinking the originally-formed resist patterns (i.e., the residual resist portions).
      <br/>
      As a result, narrow resist patterns can be formed.
    </p>
    <p num="44">More specifically, a fine pattern narrower than the wavelength of exposing light can be stably formed.</p>
    <p num="45">
      Although the foregoing explanation has described a case where the resist pattern is formed on the semiconductor substrate 2, a resist pattern used during manufacture of a semiconductor device is formed not only on a semiconductor substrate but also on a dielectric film, such as a silicon oxide film, or various types of conductive films, such as a polysilicon film or a metallic film.
      <br/>
      The first embodiment can be applied to formation of a resist film on all types of underlying films such as those mentioned previously.
      <br/>
      The expression "on a semiconductor substrate" used herein implies a resist film provided on all of these types of films or substrates.
    </p>
    <p num="46">Second Embodiment</p>
    <p num="47">
      FIG. 3 shows a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to a second embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      More specifically, FIG. 3 comprises fragmentary cross-sectional views for explaining steps of a method of forming a fine resist pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="48">In step 1 shown in FIG. 3, a resist pattern 6 is formed on the semiconductor substrate 2 to a line width of 0.25  MU m from an acid catalyst chemically-amplified positive resist for use with a KrF laser beam through ordinary photolithography.</p>
    <p num="49">
      In step 2, an organic film 9 which produces an acid upon exposure to light is formed on the semiconductor substrate 2.
      <br/>
      In other words, a polymer containing an photosensitive acid generator is formed on the semiconductor substrate 2 in the form of a film.
      <br/>
      For example, the organic film 9 is formed by spin-coating an aqueous solution containing about 1% of naphtoquinonediadido-4-sulfonate-ester-derivatives and polyvinyl pyrrolidone which serves as a base polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="50">In step 3, the organic film 9 is exposed to i-lines of a Hg lamp at a dose of 200 to 1000 mJ/cm2 through use of a photo mask 10 which has a desired pattern and apertures 10a so as to correspond to solely the resist patterns 6 to be shrunk among the resist patterns 6 having a line width of 0.25  MU m. As a result of exposure, only the exposed portions of the organic film 9 selectively produce an acidic component.</p>
    <p num="51">
      In step 4, the wafer 1 is subjected to a heat treatment at 60-140 (degree)  C. for about 1 through 3 minutes by means of a hot plate.
      <br/>
      As a result, the thus-produced acidic component is diffused into the acid catalyst chemically-amplified positive resist patterns 6 for use with a KrF laser beam (i.e., residual resist patterns), and the surface layer of the resist patterns 6 is made soluble in an alkaline developer by means of action of an acid catalyst, thus forming the solubilized layer 11.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      In step 5, the organic film 9 and the solubilized layer 11 are removed by an alkaline developer.
      <br/>
      More specifically, they are removed from the wafer through use of 2.38 wt. % of tetramethylammoniumhydroxide.
      <br/>
      In order to eliminate moisture from the resist patterns after removal of the organic film and the solubilized layer, the wafer is subjected to a heat treatment at 100 to 130 (degree)  C. for about one through three minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="53">As a result, only the resist patterns 6 in contact with the exposed portions of the organic film 9 are shrunk by 0.1  MU m. In this way, a resist line pattern 8 of 0.15  MU mL/0.35  MU mS, which cannot be formed through use of a KrF excimer laser beam by photolithography, can be selectively formed.</p>
    <p num="54">In the second embodiment, the polymer of the organic film 9 can be principally formed from a polymer soluble in pure water or in a mixed solution which does not substantially dissolve the resist pattern and consists of pure water and an organic solvent.</p>
    <p num="55">
      More specifically, a polymer which has an acidic component added thereto and is used in the first embodiment or a polymer analogous thereto can be used as the polymer of the organic film 9.
      <br/>
      In short, the base polymer itself has neutrality.
      <br/>
      Preferably, for example, the polymer can be selected from the group consisting of polyvinyl alcohol, a polyacrylic acid, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl amine, and polyvinyl acetal.
    </p>

    <p num="65">Next, the mechanism of solubilizing the surface layer of the resist pattern 6 with the alkaline developer by thermally treating the organic film 9 is the same as that explained in the first embodiment, and hence its repeated explanation will be omitted here.</p>
    <p num="66">
      As mentioned previously, according to the second embodiment, a resist pattern is formed on a semiconductor substrate by processing an acid catalyst chemically-amplified positive resist through ordinary photolithography.
      <br/>
      Next, an organic film which produces an acid on exposure to light, i.e., an organic film containing a photosensitive acid generator, is applied to the pattern, and an acid is produced by exposing the organic film to light.
      <br/>
      The acid produced by exposure is diffused into the resist pattern.
      <br/>
      The wafer is subjected to a heat treatment in such a way that the surface layer of the resist pattern (i.e., a residual resist portion) is made soluble in an alkaline developer by means of acid catalytic action of the thus-produced acid.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the organic film and the solubilized layer are removed by the alkaline developer, thus shrinking the originally-formed resist patterns (i.e., the residual resist portions).

    <p num="70">With reference to FIG. 4, the steps 1 and 2 are the same as those described for the second embodiment, so that their repeated explanations will be omitted.</p>
    <p num="71">In step 3, the organic film 9 is exposed to i-lines of the Hg lamp at a dose of 200 to 1000 mJ/cm2 through use of a photo mask 10 which has a desired pattern and apertures 10a so as to correspond to solely the resist patterns 6 to be shrunk among the resist patterns 6 having a line width of 0.25  MU m.</p>
    <p num="72">
      In the third embodiment, strip-shaped portions 10a horizontally formed in the center of the photo mask 10 are exposed to light in step 3, and the other strip-shaped portions of the photo mask 10 shield light.
      <br/>
      As a result of exposure, an acidic component is selectively produced only in the exposed portions of the organic film 9.
    </p>
    <p num="73">In step 4, the wafer is subjected to a heat treatment in the same manner as in the second embodiment, thus forming the solubilized layer 11 along the surface of the resist patterns 6.</p>

      As a result, line width of the resist pattern 6 (left over portion) is reduced by 0.1  MU m at the position contacting the exposed portion of the organic film 9.

    <p num="76">
      In the foregoing second embodiment and third embodiment, the process is common although the mask patterns for light exposure and the resultant resist patterns are different.

    <p num="78">
      FIG. 5(a) and FIG. 5(b) show a first example of the steps of manufacturing a semiconductor device.

      As shown in FIG. 7(b), conductive lead patterns 14a, each having a partially-shrunk portion, can be formed by etching the conductive film 14 by way of the resist patterns 12a.

      Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 7(c), an interlayer dielectric film 15 is formed, and a conductive plug 16a is vertically formed between two narrow conductive lead patterns 14a and connected to an conductive lead 16b formed on the interlayer dielectric film 15.
      <br/>
      If this example is applied to semiconductor memory, the conductive lead 14a will work as a word line, and the conductive lead 16b will work as a bit line.

      The present embodiment describes a method of producing a minute resist pattern by processing resist through use of an organic film containing an acidic component, as well as application of the method to preparation of a hole pattern.

      As shown in FIG. 8, through use of a halftone mask, an array pattern--in which are formed holes 17 having a diameter of 0.30  MU m at small pitches, e.g., hole pitches of 0.18  MU m,--is prepared by use of a conventional technique.
      <br/>
      At this time, a dimple 18 is formed by a sub-peak of the half tone mask, so that an unwanted hole is formed in the resist pattern after etching.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      In the present embodiment, as indicated in step 1 shown in FIG. 9 and FIG. 10, a resist film 4 is applied on a conductive layer 3, for example, formed on the semiconductor substrate 2.

      Smaller holes 17a having, for example, a diameter of 0.24  MU m, are formed in the resist film 4, thereby forming a hole pattern 6d.

    <p num="91">As indicated in step 2 in FIG. 9 and FIG. 10, an organic film 7 containing an acidic component, such as a resin containing polyacrylic acid for example, is applied through spin coating over the wafer 1.</p>
    <p num="92">
      In step 3, acid is diffused over the surface of the hole resist pattern 6d by heating the organic film 7, whereby the surface layer of the hole pattern 6d is solubilized in an alkaline developer.

      Thus, a solubilized layer 11a is formed on the surface of the hole pattern 6d.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Next, as indicated in step 4, the wafer 1 is developed with the alkaline developer, so that the surface layer of the hole pattern 6d is dissolved and the diameter of the holes 17a is enlarged by 0.06  MU m. As a result, there is prepared a resist pattern 8d having holes 17b of 0.30  MU m diameter.

    <p num="98">
      FIG. 11 shows cross-sectional views for describing a semiconductor device manufacturing method according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention; and more specifically, shows individual steps of the resist pattern forming method adapted in a method of forming a minute resist pattern.
      <br/>
      The present embodiment describes a method of forming a minute resist pattern through processing of resist by use of an acidic organic film containing a photosesitive acid generator.
    </p>
    <p num="99">As in step 1 according to the first embodiment, in step 1 of the process shown in FIG. 11, a resist pattern 6 having a width of 0.25  MU m L/S (line and space) is formed through ordinary photolithography on a semiconductor substrate 2 from an acid catalyst chemically-amplified positive photoresist.</p>
    <p num="100">In step 2, in place of the organic film containing the photosesitive acid generator used in the second embodiment, an acidic organic film 9a containing a photosesitive acid generator is formed on the semiconductor substrate 2 including the resist pattern 6.</p>
    <p num="101">More specifically, the organic film 9a is formed through spin coating of aqueous solution of about 5 wt. % of naphtoquinonediadizo-4-sulfonate-ester-derivatives, about 10 wt. % of perufluoro-alkyl-carboxylic-acid-derivatives, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone serving as a base polymer,.</p>
    <p num="102">In steps 3 through 5, processing similar to that relating to steps 3 to 5 in the second embodiment is performed.</p>
    <p num="103">
      Specifically, as in the second embodiment, the organic film 9a that is laid on the resist pattern 6 having a width of 0.25  MU m L/S is exposed to i-lines of an Hg lamp at a dose of 200 to 1000 mJ/cm2 through use of a photo mask 10 of a desired pattern having openings 10a corresponding to solely the portions of the resist pattern 6 to be narrowed.
      <br/>
      A hydrochloric acid component is selectively produced in only the thus-exposed portions of the organic film 9a.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      In step 4, the wafer 1 undergoes a heat treatment at 60 to 140 (degree)  C. for about one to three minutes.
      <br/>
      As a result, the acidic component generated by the light exposure and the acidic component originally contained in the organic film 9a are diffused across the resist pattern 6 (a residual pattern) of acid catalyst chemically-amplified positive photoresist.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the surface layer of the resist pattern 6 (a resist residue) is made soluble in an alkaline developer through acid-catalyst action of the acidic components, thereby forming a alkaline soluble layer.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      At this time, in the unexposed portions of the organic film 9a, only the acidic component originally contained in the organic film 9a is diffused, thereby a thin soluble layer 11a is formed over the surface of the resist pattern 6.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in the exposed portions of the organic film 9a, a large amount of acidic component is contained so that a thick soluble layer 11b is created over the surface of the resist pattern 6.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      In step 5, the organic film 9a and the soluble layers 11a and 11b are removed by use of an alkaline developer; for example, by a developer containing 2.38 wt. % of tetramethyl-ammonium-hydroxide.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the wafer is subjected to a heat treatment at 100 to 130 (degree)  C. for about one to three minutes in order to eliminate moisture contained in the resist pattern that has undergone exfoliation.
    </p>
    <p num="107">As a result, the resist pattern 6 that is in contact with the exposed portions of the organic film 9a is shrunk by 0.15  MU m to a line width of 0.10  MU m. In contrast, the resist pattern 6 that is in contact with un-exposed portions of the organic film 9a is shrunk by 0.05  MU m to a line width of 0.20  MU m. Thus, the amount of shrinkage in line width differs from one line to another, thereby enabling formation of a resist pattern 8a comprising different minute line widths; specifically, 0.10 and 0.20  MU m.</p>
    <p num="108">
      Polymer constituting the organic film 9a, a solution constituting the organic film, the photosesitive acid generator, and the alkaline solution, all of which are described in the first and second embodiments, can also be applied to the fifth embodiment.
      <br/>
      Hence, repetition of their explanations is omitted here for brevity.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      As described above, in the fifth embodiment, a resist pattern is first formed on a semiconductor substrate through ordinary photolithography by use of an acid catalyst chemically-amplified positive photoresist.

      Next, an acidic organic film containing a component capable of generating acid upon exposure; i.e., an acidic organic film containing a photosesitive acid generator, is applied to the resist pattern.
      <br/>
      The resist pattern is exposed so as to generate acid.
      <br/>
      The acid originally contained in the organic film and newly-generated acid are diffused across the resist pattern through a heat treatment.
      <br/>
      Further, the wafer undergoes a heat treatment such that the surface layer of the resist pattern (i.e., resist residue) is solubilized in an alkaline developer by means of acid-catalyst action of the acid.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the organic film and the solubilized layer are exfoliated by means of an alkaline developer, thereby selectively narrowing the originally-generated resist pattern (resist residue).
