      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="4">The present invention relates to an array of antifuses and, more particularly, to an array of sidewall-contacted antifuses having diffused bit lines.</p>
    <p num="5">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="6">Unlike a fuse which, when programmed, changes from a low-resistance to a high-resistance device to block a current from flowing through the device, an antifuse is a device which, when programmed, changes from a high-resistance to a low-resistance device to allow a current to flow through the device.</p>
    <p num="7">
      FIG. 1 shows a plan drawing that illustrates a portion of a conventional antifuse array 100.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 shows a cross-sectional drawing taken along line 2--2 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, array 100 includes a series of polysilicon (poly) bit lines BL1-BLm which are formed on a first layer of oxide 110.
      <br/>
      As further shown, each bit line BL has a series of projections P1-Pn which, in turn, each have an end sidewall 112.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In addition, array 100 further includes a second layer of oxide 114 which is formed over bit lines BL1-BLm and oxide layer 110, but which is not formed on the end sidewalls 112 and the regions of oxide layer 110 that lie between opposing end sidewalls 112.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Array 100 also includes a series of word lines WL1-WLn which are formed on oxide layers 110 and 114 and the end sidewalls 112 such that a word line WL is connected to all of the end sidewalls 112 in a row of end sidewalls.
      <br/>
      Each word line WL, in turn, includes a dielectric layer DL and an overlying poly layer PL.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The resulting structure forms a plurality of sidewall-contacted antifuses 116 in that an antifuse 116 is formed each time a word line WL contacts the end sidewall 112 of a bit line BL.</p>
    <p num="11">
      In operation, each antifuse 116 is used to store one of two logic values depending on whether or not the dielectric associated with the antifuse is intact.
      <br/>
      For example, antifuse A represents a first logic state when the dielectric of word line WL1 formed over end sidewall 112 of bit line BL1 is intact in that no current can flow from word line WL1 to bit line BL1 (or in the opposite direction).
      <br/>
      Thus, when normal operating voltages are applied to word line WL1, only a fraction of the voltage is coupled to bit line BL1.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      On the other hand, antifuse A represents a second logic state when the dielectric of word line WL1 formed over end sidewall 112 of bit line BL1 has been broken down and thus, is no longer intact, in that current can now flow from word line WL1 to bit line BL1 (or in the opposite direction).
      <br/>
      Thus, when normal operating voltages are applied to word line WL1, substantially all of the voltage is present on bit line BL1.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The dielectric region of a word line that forms an antifuse is typically broken down by establishing a strong electric field across the dielectric region.
      <br/>
      This programming of the antifuse changes the logic state of the antifuse from the first logic state to the second logic state.
    </p>
    <p num="14">For example, with antifuse A, the dielectric of word line WL1 formed over end sidewall 112 of bit line BL1 breaks down when a 10.6V pulse is applied to word line WL1 while bit line BL1 is grounded.</p>
    <p num="15">
      One of the problems with antifuse array 100 is that antifuses 116 are sensitive to masking alignment errors that occur during fabrication.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 3A-3F show a series of plan views that illustrate the fabrication of antifuse array 100. (See also Chen et al., A Sublithographic Antifuse Structure for Field Programmable Gate Array Applications, IEEE Electron Device Letters, Vol. 13, No. 1, January 1992.)
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      As shown in FIG. 3A, antifuse array 100 is fabricated by depositing a layer of first polysilicon (poly-1) 310 over a layer of oxide 312.
      <br/>
      After this, poly-1 layer 310 is masked and etched to form a poly structure 314 which includes a first strip 316, a second strip 318, and a plurality of connecting strips 320 that connect the first and second strips 316 and 318 together.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Following this, poly-1 layer 310 is again masked and etched to reduce the widths W of connecting strips 320 to a dimension which is less than the minimum dimension that can be photolithographically obtained by the fabrication process.</p>
    <p num="18">
      Following this, as shown in FIG. 3B, a thick layer of oxide 322 is formed over strips 316, 318, and 320, and the exposed portions of oxide layer 312.
      <br/>
      Next, a mask 324 is formed and patterned on oxide layer 322 to expose the regions of oxide layer 322 that are formed over the center portions of connecting strips 320.
      <br/>
      After this, the unmasked areas of oxide layer 322 and the underlying portions of strips 320 are etched to form bit lines BL1-BLm.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      However, as shown in FIG. 3C, if mask 324 is vertically misaligned, then the etch will fail to form bit lines BL1-BLm.
      <br/>
      Instead, the etch will leave connecting strips 320 partially or fully intact, depending on the extent of the misalignment.
    </p>
    <p num="20">As shown in FIG. 3D, if mask 324 is properly aligned, the next step following the last etch is to form a layer of dielectric material 326 on the top and sidewall surfaces of oxide layer 322, the end sidewalls of bit lines BL1-BLm, and a top surface of oxide layer 312.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Next, a layer of second polysilicon (poly-2) 328 is formed over dielectric layer 326.
      <br/>
      Following this, a mask 330 is formed and patterned over poly-2 layer 328.
      <br/>
      The unmasked areas of poly-2 layer 328 and the underlying areas of dielectric layer 326 are then etched to form word lines WL1-WLn as shown in FIG. 3E.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      However, as shown in FIG. 3F, if mask 330 is vertically misaligned, then the etch will fail to form word lines WL1-WLn over connecting strips 320.
      <br/>
      Thus, alignment errors during the placement of masks 324 and 330 can result in the formation of nonfunctioning antifuses.
    </p>
    <p num="23">As a result, there is a need for an antifuse array which is less sensitive to masking alignment errors.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="24">
      Conventionally, the method for forming an array of sidewall-contacted antifuses is sensitive to masking alignment errors that occur during the fabrication of the array.

      <br/>
      FIGS. 7A-7F show a series of cross-sectional views taken along lines 7A--7A through 7F--7F of FIGS. 4A-4F.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      As shown in FIGS. 4A, 5A, 6A, and 7A, the method of the present invention begins by forming a layer of oxide 412 approximately 800A thick on a semiconductor material 410, such as a substrate or a well, and then forming a bit line mask 414 on oxide layer 412.
      <br/>
      The unmasked regions of oxide layer 412 are then etched to form a series of oxide strips OA1-OAm on the surface of material 410.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Following the etch, the surface of material 410 between adjacent oxide strips OA is implanted with an n-type dopant, such as arsenic or phosphorous, to form a series of n+ bit lines BL1-BLn in material 410.
      <br/>
      After this, bit line mask 414 is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Next, as shown in FIGS. 4B, 5B, 6B, and 7B, a series of oxide strips OB1-OBn approximately 500  Angstrom  thick are formed over bit lines BL1-BLn by thermally oxidizing the surface of material 410.
      <br/>
      This step also increases the thickness of oxide strips OA1-OAm, activates the implanted dopant, and anneals lattice damage caused by the implant.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      After this, a contact mask 416 is formed on oxide strips OA1-OAm and OB1-OBn to define rows and columns of bit line contact openings 420 over the bit lines BL1-BLn.
      <br/>
      One of the advantages of the present invention is that mask 416 can be reliably aligned so that openings 420 in mask 416 are over bit lines BL1BLn.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      With respect to horizontal alignment, since oxide strips OA1-OAm are thicker than oxide strips OB1-OBn, openings 420 in mask 416 need only be positioned between adjacent oxide strips OA to be over the bit lines BL.
      <br/>
      With respect to vertical alignment, since bit lines BL1-BLn run vertically, openings 420 in mask 416 will continue be over the bit lines BL even if mask 416 is vertically misaligned.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Once contact mask 416 has been formed, the unmasked regions of oxide strips OB1-OBn are etched to expose the underlying surfaces of bit lines BL1-BLn.
      <br/>
      Following this, mask 416 is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Next, as shown in FIGS. 4C, 5C, 6C, and 7C, a layer of first polysilicon (poly-1) 420 is formed on oxide strips OA1-OAm and OB1-OBn and the exposed surfaces of bit lines BL1-BLn.
      <br/>
      After poly-1 layer 420 has been formed, a poly-1 mask (not shown) is formed on poly-1 layer 420.
      <br/>
      The poly-1 mask may also be reliably positioned for the same reasons that mask 416 can be reliably positioned.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Once the poly-1 mask has been formed, the unmasked regions of poly-1 layer 420 are etched to form a plurality of first contacts 422.
      <br/>
      Following this, the poly-1 mask is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Next, as shown in FIGS. 4D, 5D, 6D, and 7D, a layer of oxide 424 approximately 1000  Angstrom  thick is formed over first contacts 422 and the exposed regions of oxide strips OA1-OAm and OB1-OBn.
      <br/>
      After this, an antifuse window mask 426 is formed on oxide layer 424 over a middle region of each of the first contacts 422 in a row of first contacts.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Mask 426 may also be reliably positioned.
      <br/>
      As shown, the length L of the middle region may be set to whatever length is needed to accommodate the vertical misalignment tolerance of the fabrication process that is used.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Once mask 426 has been formed, the unmasked regions of oxide layer 424 and the underlying poly-1 layer of the first contacts 422 are etched to form a plurality of second contacts 428 from the first contacts 422.
      <br/>
      Following this, mask 426 is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      As shown in FIGS. 4E, 5E, 6E, and 7E, after mask 426 has been removed, a layer of nitride 430 is formed on the exposed regions of oxide strips OA1-OAm and OB1-OBn, oxide layer 424, and the exposed sidewalls of the second contacts 428.
      <br/>
      Once nitride layer 430 has been formed, a second layer of polysilicon (poly-2) 432 is formed over nitride layer 430.
      <br/>
      Next, a poly-2 mask 434 is formed over poly-2 layer 432.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      As shown in FIGS. 4F, 5F, 6F, and 7F, once mask 434 has been formed, the unmasked regions of poly-2 layer 432 and the underlying layer of nitride 430 are etched to form a series of word lines WL1-WLr.
      <br/>
      Following the formation of the word lines WL1-WLr, mask 434 is removed.
      <br/>
      The word lines WL1-WLr are then doped to have an n-type conductivity.
      <br/>
      After this, the process continues with conventional steps.
    </p>
    <p num="51">Thus, as shown in FIGS. 4F, 5F, 6F, and 7F, and as further shown in FIG. 8, which shows a schematic view, antifuse array 400 includes a plurality of spaced-apart bit lines BL1-BLn which are formed in a semiconductor material 410, such as a substrate or a well, and a layer of insulation material 440 which is formed on bit lines BL1-BLn.</p>
    <p num="52">
      As shown, insulation layer 440 has a plurality of contact openings 442 which expose portions of the underlying bit lines BL1-BLn.
      <br/>
      The contact openings 442 are formed in rows and columns so that each bit line BL has a contact opening 442 for each row.
      <br/>
      Insulation layer 440 may include oxide lines OA1-OAm and OB1-OBn as shown in FIGS. 4F-7F, or other insulation materials alone or in combination.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Further, array 400 also includes a plurality of contact plates 444 which are formed on the exposed portions of the bit lines BL1-BLn such that a contact plate 440 is formed over every contact opening.
      <br/>
      In addition, each contact plate 444 has an exposed sidewall.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Array 400 further includes a layer of isolation material 446 which is formed on the layer of insulation material 440 and the contact plates 444.
      <br/>
      Isolation layer 446 may include oxide layer 424 as shown in FIGS. 4F-7F, or other isolation materials alone or in combination.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Array 400 additionally includes a plurality of spaced-apart word lines WL1-WLr which are formed so that each word line WL contacts all of the exposed sidewalls of the contact plates 444 in a row of contact plates.
      <br/>
      Each word line includes a layer of dielectric material and an overlying layer of conductive material such as doped polysilicon.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      An antifuse 450 is formed at each location where a word line WL contacts a bit line BL.
      <br/>
      In a row of antifuses 450, each bit line BL functions as the lower plate of an antifuse, while the word line WL formed over the bit line functions as the upper plate.
    </p>
    <p num="57">In operation, a row of antifuses is programmed by applying a first voltage to the word line WL that is connected to the row of antifuses to be programmed, and a second voltage to each bit line BL that is connected to each antifuse 450 in the row of antifuses to be programmed such that first and second voltages are sufficient to establish the necessary electric field.</p>
    <p num="58">
      For example, if a positive programming voltage is used as the first voltage, then ground can be used as the second voltage.
      <br/>
      If ground is used as the first voltage, then the positive programming voltage can be used as the second voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      In addition, if a positive voltage is used as the first voltage, then the necessary electric field can be established by using a negative voltage as the second voltage.
      <br/>
      Similarly, if the first voltage is negative, then a positive voltage can be used as the second voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, array 400 can be segmented to increase the speed of the array.
      <br/>
      FIG. 9 shows a schematic diagram that illustrates a segmented antifuse array 900 in accordance with the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      As shown in FIG. 9, array 900 includes a plurality of sub-arrays SA1-SAt.
      <br/>
      Each sub-array SA is similar to array 400 and, as a result, utilizes the same reference numerals to designate the structures which are in common.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Each sub-array SA differs from array 400 in that each sub-array SA has fewer antifuses 450 in each column of antifuses and, thus, fewer word lines WL.
      <br/>
      By reducing the number of antifuses 450 in a column of antifuses, the bit line capacitance is reduced which, in turn, increases the speed of the array.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      As further shown in FIG. 9, each sub-array SA also includes a plurality of access transistors 910 which are formed in rows and columns so that an access transistor 910 is formed at each end of each bit line BL in each sub-array SA.
      <br/>
      While the drains of the access transistors 910 are connected to the bit lines BL, the sources of the transistors 910 are connected to current sense circuits (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="64">In addition to the above, each sub-array SA further includes a pair of access lines AL1 and AL2 which are formed so that an access line AL is connected to the gate of each access transistor 910 in a row of access transistors 910.</p>
    <p num="65">
      In operation, when a selected row of antifuses is to be read, an access voltage is applied to the access lines AL that are connected to the bit lines BL that are connected to the row of antifuses.
      <br/>
      This turns on the access transistors 910 positioned at each end of the bit lines BL.
    </p>
    <p num="66">When a read voltage is then applied to the word line WL that corresponds with the selected row of antifuses, a read current flows from the word line WL, through the antifuse, and out through the sources of the access transistors 910. (No current flows if the dielectric associated with the antifuse is intact.) For example, if the first row of antifuses is to be read, an access voltage is applied to access lines AL1 and AL2, while a read voltage is applied to word line WL1.</p>

      Array 900 is formed by modifying the steps used to form array 400.
      <br/>
      The first modification is to the step that forms mask 414, which is modified so that mask 414 defines a plurality of sub-arrays that each have a series of unmasked strips on the surface of oxide layer 412.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Following this, the unmasked strips of oxide layer 412 are etched to expose strips on the surface of material 410, which are then implanted to form the structure shown in FIGS. 10A, 11A, 12A, and 13A.
      <br/>
      Following the implant, mask 414 is removed, and the process continues as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      The next modification adds several additional steps following the step that forms nitride layer 430, and precedes the step that forms poly-2 layer 432.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 10B, following the formation of nitride layer 430, an access transistor mask 1020 is formed an patterned over nitride layer 430.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The unmasked regions of nitride layer 430 and the underlying layers of oxide 424 and regions of oxide strips OB1-OBn are then etched to form a series of transistor openings 1022 that each expose an end of a bit line BL on the surface of material 410.
      <br/>
      Mask 1020 is then removed.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Following this, as shown in FIGS. 10C, 11C, 12C, and 13C, a layer of gate oxide 1024 is formed on the surface of material 410.
      <br/>
      The process then reverts to the above-described flow where poly-2 layer 432 is formed over nitride layer 430 and, now also, gate oxide layer 1024.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      Next, as shown in FIGS. 10D, 11D, 12D, and 13D, poly-2 mask 434 is modified to also form a series of access lines AL1-ALs along with the series of word lines WL1-WLr.
      <br/>
      Following the etch that forms word lines WL1-WLr, mask 434 is removed.
      <br/>
      The word lines WL1-WLr, the access lines AL1-ALs, and the source and drain regions of the access transistors 910 are then doped to have an n+ dopant concentration. (Alternately, an additional mask may be used to limit the dopant concentration of the word and access lines WL1-WLr and AL1-ALs.) After this, the process continues with conventional steps.
