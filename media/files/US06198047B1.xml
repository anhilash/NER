      A hollow-spine cable tray has cable arms wherein the hollow channel of the body spine is adapted for running and holding electrical wiring.
      <br/>
      This is achieved by enlarging the spine, and thus its hollow channel, and by molding one side face of the spine so as to open outwardly except when covered by one or more snap-on cover plates.
      <br/>
      The cover plates may include mounts suitable for holding standard 110 or 220 volt electrical outlets, modular telephone jacks, or the like.
      <br/>
      Preferably, however, separate outlet plates bearing or adapted to bear the outlets are configured to snap on over the open face of the spine between adjacent cover plates.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">This invention relates to cable trays--more particularly, to a cable tray having a spine with at least one open side face, through which open face may be passed electrical wiring, or data networking or telephone cabling, for ducting through the hollow interior of the spine.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Cable trays comprise beamed or spined members having regularly spaced transverse arms for cradling cables, wiring, tubes and the like, such as for computer networks, telecommunications and the like.
      <br/>
      Cable trays normally are suspended from ceilings on rods.
      <br/>
      In computer network installations, cable trays are used for routing network cables along the ceiling of a dedicated room to upright components known as racks.
      <br/>
      Occasionally, the cable trays might be laid out on top of the racks.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It is also necessary, however, to run electrical power into and around the room to the racks and to other related equipment.
      <br/>
      For purposes of isolating the electrical power wiring from interference with communication signals in the network cables, and for reasons of safety, electrical power wiring typically is carried within the hollows of separately mounted ducts called raceways.
      <br/>
      Prior art cable trays, which are limited to carrying externally exposed cabling, therefore are not suitable for electrical wiring.
      <br/>
      To run electrical wiring along the cable arms thereof would not be in compliance with building code requirements.
      <br/>
      In order to meet building code requirements and the IEEE specifications, a metallic barrier must separate electrical wiring and low voltage cabling.

    <p num="11">
      It is common to find cable trays and electrical raceways mounted side-by-side in a single installation, resulting in a great deal of duplication of effort, materials and the like--not to mention the amount of space wasted in rooms which often are no larger than closets.
      <br/>
      There has been no suggestion in the art that such unnecessary duplication could be eliminated were a single device to be designed to perform both functions safely.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Accordingly, there continues to be a need for a new and improved cable tray which addresses the problems of construction, effectiveness and ease of use that are attendant in the prior art.
      <br/>
      In this respect, the present invention substantially fulfills this need.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">In view of the disadvantages inherent in the known art, the general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to teach a new and improved cable tray with power channel which has all of the important advantages of the prior art and few, if any, of the disadvantages.</p>
    <p num="14">
      The present invention is a hollow-spine cable tray having cable arms wherein the hollow channel of the body spine (presently unused in the art) is adapted for running and holding electrical wiring.
      <br/>
      This is achieved by enlarging the spine, and thus its hollow channel, and by molding one side face of the spine so as to open outwardly except when covered by one or more snap-on cover plates.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The cover plates may include mounts suitable for holding standard 110 volt, 220 volt or NEMA outlets.
      <br/>
      Preferably, however, separate fixtures (herein "outlet plates") bearing or adapted to bear the outlets are configured to snap on over the open face of the spine between adjacent cover plates.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="37">
      Referring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated therein a first preferred cable tray with power channel 10 of this invention.
      <br/>
      Cable tray 10 principally comprises a hollow, longitudinally-extended, beam-like spine 12, which spine is pierced by a regularly spaced plurality of U-shaped cable arms 21 arranged transversely with respect to the spine 12 (perpendicular to its longitudinal axis).
      <br/>
      Preferably, the spine is extruded aluminum, but it can be fabricated by standard means from plastic or any of a number of equivalent materials.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the cable arms 21 also are aluminum.
      <br/>
      The cable tray 10 preferably is suspended from the ceiling of a room from a series of ceiling rods 34, or it may be laid on top of equipment or other horizontal surfaces.
      <br/>
      The ceiling rods 34 travel though rod apertures 22 in both the bottom 15 and the top 16 of the spine 12.
      <br/>
      Except for the apertures 22, the top and bottom walls are generally closed.
      <br/>
      Turning briefly to FIG. 4, it can be seen that bundles of cables 56 may be laid loosely along the tops of both sides of the cable arms 21 so as to run parallel to the longitudinal axis of the spine 12.
      <br/>
      This much is standard in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Novel to this invention is an open face 18 on at least one side of the spine 12 (the right side in FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      Preferably, the opposite side will have a closed face 20.
      <br/>
      The top 16 and bottom 15 also are continuous panels, giving the spine 12 an overall "C" shape.
      <br/>
      The open face 18 has an opening 17, formed between an upper stub wall 32 and a lower stub wall 33, which opening extends along the entire length of the spine 12.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      At least one, and preferably a plurality, of cover plates 26 snap onto the stub walls by means of opposed pairs of male flanges 28 on the backs of the cover plates 26, which male flanges 28 compress and mate with opposed pairs of female flanges 30 (or simple edges) found on the bottom of the upper stub wall 32 and the top of the lower stub wall 33, respectively.
      <br/>
      Preferably, such snap-on cover plates are "closed," i.e., they are continuous (without apertures) so as to be able to fully cover whatever portion of the opening 17 onto which they are snapped.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Additionally, electrical outlets are provided, or at least means for mounting at least one electrical outlet (preferably a variety of types of such outlets), such as outlet mounting plates therefor.
      <br/>
      A 110 V outlet plate 36 forms a pair of apertures 38 adapted to mount and hold a standard 110 V outlet 40.
      <br/>
      Plate 36 has an opposed pair of male flanges 28 for snapping the 110 V outlet plate 36 onto the female flanges or edges of the upper stub wall 32 and lower stub wall 33.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      A 220 V outlet plate 42 forms an aperture 44 adapted to hold a standard 220 V outlet 46 and has an opposed pair of male flanges 28 for snapping the 220 V outlet plate 42 onto the female flanges 30 of the stub walls.
      <br/>
      Other types of outlet plates can be provided for standard outlets, such as the NEMA type (not illustrated).
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      As seen in FIG. 2, a suitable assortment of cover plates 26, 110 V outlet plates 36, and 220 V outlet plates 42 may be assembled together to allow the entire opening 17 of the open face 18 to be closed.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, individual cover plates 26 may be cut to size where necessary, so as to allow particular outlet plates 36, 42 to be precisely positioned wherever desired along any length of spine.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The novel provision of an open face 18 allows the hollow interior channel of the spine 12 to be used as a power channel 14, i.e., suitable bundles of electrical wiring 58 may be stuffed through the opening 17 into the power channel 14, where they may run unimpeded throughout the longitudinal extent of the cable tray with power channel 10 (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Therein, the electrical wiring 58 is sufficiently isolated as to prevent interference with the telecommunication cables 56 carried externally on the cable arms 21.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, once the opening 17 is fully closed by a full length of cover plates 26, 110 V outlet plates 36, and 220 V outlet plates 42, the electrical wiring 58 is covered from view and touch.
      <br/>
      Provided proper insulation and grounding is provided to the spine 12 when required, storage of electrical wiring 58 in the power channel 14 should meet all applicable code requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      FIG. 4 illustrates one means for electrically insulating the spine 12 of a cable tray with power channel 10 from the ceiling rods 34, which rods connect the device 10 to the external environment.
      <br/>
      As noted above, each ceiling rod 34 passes through rod apertures 22 in the top 16 and the bottom 15 of the spine 12.
      <br/>
      A nut 54 threaded on the end of each ceiling rod 34 bears the weight of the apparatus 10, perhaps aided by a washer 52 or the like.
      <br/>
      Where electrical insulation between the spine 12 and the ceiling rods 34 is desired, rubber or similar insulating rings 48 in the rod apertures 22 shield each ceiling rod 34 from electrical contact with the spine 12.
      <br/>
      A tubular insulating spacer 50 may be provided between the top and bottom of the spine.
      <br/>
      Spacers 50 could perform the dual function of insulating the ceiling rods 34 from electrical contact with the electrical wiring 58 while providing structural support between the top 16 and the bottom 15 walls of the spine 12.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      FIGS. 3 and 6 illustrate the manner in which abutting adjacent lengths of spine 12 and 12a may be interconnected by means of a C-shaped connector 24 to form a unitary cable tray with power channel 10 of any desired length.
      <br/>
      If desired, the two ceiling rods 34 and 34a nearest the interconnected ends of spine may be tied together by a simple tie 60 (FIG. 6) or similar means, where desired to prevent longitudinal movement during earthquake, storm or the like.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 also illustrates the fact that the insulating rings 48 of FIG. 4 possibly may be eliminated--for example, for use of the device in applications wherein electrical insulation is not needed.
      <br/>
      For example, the channel 14 might be used to carry telephone cables rather than power wires.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Screw holes 41 are positioned in the outlet plates as required to hold in the outlets 40, 46.
      <br/>
      Holes may be provided, if desired, for screwing the outlet plates onto the stub walls, for added security.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      FIG. 7 illustrates an alternate form of tabbed cover plate 27 for use on the device 10 of FIG. 1, namely, one which is designed to be used without separate outlet plates (such as outlet plates 36 and 42).
      <br/>
      In tabbed cover plate 27 a regularly spaced plurality of means for mounting at least one type of electrical outlet (preferably a variety thereof), is provided, namely, a large plurality of opposed pairs of knockout (punch-out) tabs 39 adapted to form apertures within which to engage 110 V outlets 40 and a large number of knockout tabs 43 adapted to form apertures within which to engage 220 V outlets 46.
      <br/>
      As before, the back side of the tabbed cover plate 27 contains opposed pairs of male flanges 28 for snapping the tabbed cover plate 27 onto the open face 18 of a cable tray with power channel 10.
      <br/>
      A single tabbed cover plate 27 of standard length (matching the length of a standard spine 12) can be used to cover the open face 18.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the tabbed cover plate 27 and spine 12 can be cut to length at the job site.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Referring to FIG. 5, there is illustrated therein a second preferred cable tray with power channel 110 of this invention.
      <br/>
      Cable tray 110 principally comprises a hollow, longitudinally-extended, beam-like spine 112, which spine is pierced by a regularly spaced plurality of cable arms 121.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the cable tray is extruded aluminum, but it can be fabricated by standard means from plastic or any of an number of equivalent materials.
      <br/>
      The cable tray 110 preferably is suspended from the ceiling of a room from a series of ceiling rods 134.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a horizontal reinforcement wall 123 has been added just below, and parallel to, the top wall 116 of the C-shaped spine 112.
      <br/>
      The ceiling rods 134 travel though rod apertures in both the top 116 and the reinforcement 123 walls.
      <br/>
      This feature creates a larger power channel 114 than the previous embodiment, but requires more material to construct.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      At least one, and preferably a plurality, of cover plates 126 snap onto the open face 118.
      <br/>
      A variety of electrical outlets, or at least mounting plates therefor, are provided--for example, outlet plate 136.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      FIG. 5 illustrates a second means for electrically insulating the spine 112 of a cable tray with power channel 110 from the ceiling rods 134, which rods connect the device 110 to the external environment.
      <br/>
      Where electrical insulation between the spine 112 and the ceiling rods 134 is desired, a one-piece insulating ring 148 travels from the top wall 116 to the reinforcement wall 123 to shield each ceiling rod 134 from electrical contact with the spine 112.
      <br/>
      Essentially, the insulator 148 incorporates the tubular insulating spacer 50 of the previous embodiment shown in FIG. 1, by means of having an elongated central shaft 149.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Referring to FIG. 8, there is illustrated therein a third preferred cable tray with power channel 210 of this invention.
      <br/>
      Cable tray 210 principally comprises a hollow, longitudinally-extended, beam-like spine 212, which spine is pierced by a regularly spaced plurality of cable arms 221 arranged transversely with respect to the spine 212 at right angles to its longitudinal axis.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the spine and cable arms 221 are extruded aluminum.
      <br/>
      The cable tray 210 is suspended from the ceiling of a room from a series of ceiling rods 234, or it may be laid on top of equipment or other horizontal surfaces.
      <br/>
      The ceiling rods 234 travel though rod apertures 222 in both the bottom 215 and the top 216 of the spine 212.
      <br/>
      Bundles of cables 256 may be laid loosely along the tops of either or both sides of the cable arms 221 so as to run parallel to the longitudinal axis of the spine 212.
      <br/>
      This much of FIG. 8 is, again, standard in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Novel to this invention is an open face 218 on a first vertical side of the spine 212 (the right side in FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the opposite second vertical side also has a novel open face 220.
      <br/>
      At least one vertical code separation wall 223 travels the length of the hollow interior of the spine 212, dividing the hollow interior into two channels: on the right, a telephone channel 213 and, on the left, a power channel 214.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, there could be two such vertical separation walls, one on either side of the ceiling rods 234, in order to assure that the weight of the device is supported evenly.
      <br/>
      However, this result also can be accomplished with one interior wall 223 if the rod apertures are drilled slightly off to the opposite side of the central longitudinal axis.
      <br/>
      This latter alternative (shown in FIG. 8) conserves material.
      <br/>
      The top 216 and bottom 215 also are continuous panels, giving the spine 212 an overall reclining "H" shape.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      As before, the open face 218 has an opening formed between an opposed pair of stub walls.
      <br/>
      At least one, and preferably a plurality, of cover plates 226 snap or screw onto the stub walls by means of opposed pairs of male flanges on the backs of the cover plates 226, which male flanges compress and mate with opposed pairs of female flanges found on the stub walls.
      <br/>
      A variety of telephone outlets or telephone outlet holders, such as outlet plate 236 for a modular phone jack, are provided for snapping or screwing onto the open face 218.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The second open face 220 has an opening formed between an opposed pair of stub walls.
      <br/>
      At least one, and preferably a plurality, of cover plates 226a snap onto the stub walls by means of opposed pairs of male flanges on the backs of the cover plates 226.
      <br/>
      A plurality of means for mounting at least one electrical outlet, preferably a variety thereof, such as outlet plate 236a, are provided for snapping onto the open face 220.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The novel provision of the open face 220 allows the left side of the hollow interior channel of the spine 212 to be used as a power channel 214, i.e., suitable bundles of electrical wiring 258 may be stuffed therein.
      <br/>
      On the right, the telephone channel 213 carries separate bundles (or a single cable) of telephone cabling 259.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      If insulation and grounding is required by applicable code requirements for storage of electrical wiring 258 in the power channel 214, such may be provided to the spine 212.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 8, however, no special insulation is shown (being the configuration the invention will assume where no insulation is required).
      <br/>
      However, suitable insulating members, such as ring 48 of the embodiment of FIG. 1 or the insulator 148 of the embodiment of FIG. 5 may be provided.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the ceiling rod 234 itself may be made (or covered) with electrically insulating material.
    </p>
    <p num="57">As to the manner of usage and operation of the instant invention, the same should be apparent from the above disclosure, and accordingly no further discussion relative to the manner of usage and operation of the instant invention need be provided.</p>
    <p num="58">
      The above disclosure is sufficient to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to practice the invention, and provides the best mode of practicing the invention presently contemplated by the inventor.
      <br/>
      While there is provided herein a full and complete disclosure of the preferred embodiments of this invention, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction, dimensional relationships, and operation shown and described.
      <br/>
      Various modifications, alternative constructions, changes and equivalents will readily occur to those skilled in the art and may be employed, as suitable, without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      Such changes might involve alternative materials, components, structural arrangements, sizes, shapes, forms, functions, operational features or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      For example, the cover plates and/or outlet plates may be affixed to the open faces by alternate means--the snap-on flanges might be eliminated and replaced by a hinging arrangement or, where a more permanent arrangement is desired, perhaps simply by screws or rivets.
      <br/>
      The female flanges could be eliminated from the stub walls, whereby the male flanges of the cover plates and outlet plates would simply snap onto the edges of the stub walls.
      <br/>
      These types of releasable plates are equivalent to the snap-on plates described above.
    </p>
    <p num="60">Therefore, the above description and illustrations should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention, which is defined by the appended claims.</p>
