      Field of the Invention (Technical Field)
    </p>
    <p num="4">The present invention relates to fiber optic switches, particularly the use of electro- or magneto-active materials to cause optical fibers to undulate.</p>
    <p num="5">2. Background Art</p>
    <p num="6">
      Present day optical fiber technologies are revolutionizing the telecommunications industry.
      <br/>
      Tremendous advances have been made in the field of telecommunications over the past decade.
      <br/>
      It has been estimated that this technology is capable of carrying tens of millions of conversations simultaneously on a single optical fiber.
      <br/>
      Optical fiber communication systems offer many advantages over systems that use copper wire or radio frequency links as a transmission medium.
      <br/>
      They include lower transmission losses, higher bandwidths, higher transmission rates, lower implementation costs, greater reliability and greater electrical isolation characteristics.
      <br/>
      It is clear that optical fiber communication will dominate the telecommunications industry in the very near future because of advantages such as these.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Fiber optic switching is an important component in any telecommunication system.
      <br/>
      These systems use switches to establish communication channels among two or more of their interfaces.
      <br/>
      An optical fiber switch is capable of optically connecting, or aligning, any one of a first group of optical fibers with any one of a second group of optical fibers, or vice versa, enabling an optical signal to propagate through the optical interface junction from one fiber to the other.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      When two optical fibers are aligned end-to-end, light entering one fiber (the input or sending fiber) will continue into and through the second fiber (the output or receiving fiber) while the two adjacent ends, or faces, are aligned and close together.
      <br/>
      Fiber optic switches misalign or disjoin the adjacent ends of the fibers by moving one or both of the two ends.
      <br/>
      By moving, for example, the first fiber's end to a new location, the signal, in this case light, can be redirected into another, third fiber, by aligning the first fiber's end with an end of the third fiber.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Lateral separation of the two adjacent ends will result in loss of light between the two fibers so that a light absorber is provided beside the fiber which either moves into place as the receiving fiber moves away or stays in place as the sending fiber moves away.
      <br/>
      Space is provided for this motion.
      <br/>
      This effectively switches the signal off.
      <br/>
      The discontinuity between the fiber ends may be either perpendicular to the fiber axis or at some angle to the axis but the gap is minimal when the fibers are aligned.
      <br/>
      Fibers may be collected into a bundle, a fiber optic cable, with a structure set up at the active location to permit the required motion of a fiber end.
      <br/>
      A fiber bundle can be separated from a circular bundle cross-section to a linear arrangement where the fibers are in a straight line at the switch but reformed into a bundle again at the device exit.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Optical fiber switches generally utilize fiber positioning means, alignment signal emitter means and computer control means.
      <br/>
      Normally, a fiber positioning means is provided near the end of one fiber to selectively point the end of that fiber in one fiber group toward the end of another fiber in the other fiber group to perform a switched optical transmission.
      <br/>
      Patents proposing to perform such switching actions in fiber optic telecommunication systems include: U.S. Pat. No. 5,024,497, to Jebens, entitled "Shape Memory Alloy Optical Fiber Switch," which discusses switching activated by a shape memory alloy wire in a transverse direction. U.S. Pat.

    <p num="12">
      The Ohashi, Ramsey, Ninnis, Stanley, Jebens, Glass, and Laor patents disclose various methods and apparatuses that use piezoelectrics, magneto-strictive materials, and shape memory alloys, for bending the fiber; however, these patents are either complicated in their configurations or require additional mechanical means beyond these materials.
      <br/>
      The present invention overcomes deficiencies in the prior art by directly adhering an electro- or magneto-active material to the optical fiber, or fiber optic cable, itself, longitudinally to cause the fiber to undulate to the desired "21/2-D" position, without additional means of support or other mechanical means.
      <br/>
      The designation 21/2-D signifies that the displacement of the fiber may produce both a lateral and a longitudinal change.
      <br/>
      The present invention is, therefore, a novel configuration for undulating an optical fiber or fiber optic cable.
    </p>
    <p num="13">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION (DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION)</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <heading>BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="26">
      The present invention is a novel method and apparatus for optical fiber switching which is based on adhering as part of the body of the fiber itself, electro- or magneto-active means in the form of wires and/or strips adhered longitudinally to the fiber itself to quickly undulate the end of a given optical fiber, from one group of fibers, to align with another optical fiber, from another group of optical fibers, in a telecommunication system.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that the word undulating, including other tenses and forms of that word, are herein used to mean displacement and undulation of the fiber or fibers.
      <br/>
      The present invention can either displace a fiber to a new position or cause the fiber to undulate back and forth between two or more positions as required in the application of the invention.
      <br/>
      The present invention accomplishes undulation in "21/2-D." In other words, the end of the optical fiber to be moved is moved in both the x-axis and y-axis directions, as well as somewhat in the z-axis direction necessarily due to the bending of the fiber.
      <br/>
      The electro- or magneto-active means include smart materials such as shape-memory alloys or polymer strips or wires, piezoelectric (piezoceramics, piezopolymers, etc.,) strips, magneto-strictive strips, and electro- or magneto-active polymers such as ionic polymeric conductive composites (artificial muscles).
      <br/>
      The electro- or magneto-active means are referred to herein as "activation strips."
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The fundamental principle is to extend an activation strip longitudinally along and adhered to an optical channel, be it an optical fiber, a group of fibers, or a fiber optic cable.
      <br/>
      The activation strip can be attached by cement, epoxy or glue between the activation strip and the fiber.
      <br/>
      Other bonding materials may also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The present invention either switches an optical signal on or off, or directs an optical signal into a variety of output optical fiber channels.
      <br/>
      This is done by moving the end of an input fiber, or group of fibers in a fiber cable, toward or away from the end of an output fiber, several output fibers, a group of fibers or several groups of fibers.
      <br/>
      Of course, output fibers can additionally or alternatively be moved in the same manner as described for the input fiber or fibers to provide other switching functions.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that while the fibers to be moved and having the activation strips are referred to as "input" fibers and those receiving the signal therefrom are "output" fibers, the signal can of course travel in the opposite direction so that the output fiber or fibers become the input fiber or fibers and vice versa.
      <br/>
      The labels input and output are merely used for simplicity of explanation.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The switch provides on-off action by displacing the input and output fibers by at least a complete fiber diameter.
      <br/>
      A partial light intensity change may be accomplished by a controlled displacement distance.
      <br/>
      A diagonal slice arrangement between the ends of the input and output fibers will permit an intensity variation dependent upon separation of the two faces of the input and output fibers.
      <br/>
      Redirecting the optical signal is accomplished by undulating the end of the input fiber until it is aligned with the appropriate output: fiber or vice versa.
      <br/>
      Then, by having the faces of the ends of the input and output fiber to be joined, cut at diagonals to "fit" each other like two pieces in a puzzle, it allows the input fiber to "snap" into place against the receiving end of the output fiber and be more easily held there.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The displacement of a fiber is accomplished by the activation strips adhered longitudinally to each fiber near the active end where displacement or alignment is needed.
      <br/>
      Attention is now turned to the figures.
      <br/>
      These figures are only to present examples of what can be accomplished in accordance with the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      FIG. 1 shows fiber optic switch 10 having input fiber 14 and output fibers 16 and 16'. Channel guide 12 provides space in which input fiber 14 can undulate.
      <br/>
      Input fiber 14 undulates in the area generally referred to as 20 and aligns with either output fiber 16 or 16', therefore transmitting the signal out of end 24 of switch 10 in the appropriate channel.
      <br/>
      In this figure, two activation strips 18 and 18' are shown adhered to input fiber 14.
      <br/>
      The operation of the activation strips is further described below.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 2 shows input fiber 14 having four activation strips 18, 18', 18", and 18'", adhered along the length of input fiber 14 at 0 (degree) , 90 (degree) , 180 (degree)  and 270 (degree)  for a fine degree of control.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows three activation strips 18, 18' and 18" adhered along input fiber 14 at 0 (degree) , 120 (degree)  and 240 (degree) . Of course, any number of activation strips, preferably two or more, can be adhered to input fiber 14 longitudinally at any circumferential location in order to achieve the desired amount of control and fiber movement.
      <br/>
      While activation strips are shown adhered to an end of the input fiber, the invention is not limited to movement of the input fiber a one, but could of course include moving the output fiber or fibers as well by the same method.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIGS. 4 and 5 show fiber optic switch 10 with a single input fiber 14 and a plurality of output fibers to which input fiber 14 can be aligned and transmit signal to.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 shows an embodiment wherein a spherical segment. of output fibers is within the reach of input fibers.
      <br/>
      Input fibers, such as 14 and 14', are inserted into the hollow sphere 40 and undulate to the appropriate output fiber.
      <br/>
      Activation strips along the input fibers cause these fibers to move to the desired output fiber location in order to transmit the signal in the appropriate direction.
      <br/>
      Sphere 40 may be a sphere segment, such as a hemisphere, or any other defined port on of a sphere, provided that the output fibers are arranged spherically about the axis of the input fiber or fibers.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, as described above regarding the designations "input" and "output," in FIG. 6 fibers 14 and 14' can constitute output fibers while the fibers shown at 24 constitute input fibers.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      FIG. 7 is a blown-up view showing a portion of the fiber to be controlled, whether it be input fiber 14 or any other fiber.
      <br/>
      Three activation strips are shown adhered along input fiber 14.
      <br/>
      While voltage source 30 is shown connecting to activation strip 18", it is to be understood that each activation strip requires its own voltage supply for activation.
      <br/>
      Each activation strip is coated by electrodes to which activation voltages are applied.
      <br/>
      Electrodes can be either thin metallic or conductive films such as carbon or graphite, or a thin wire connection.
      <br/>
      These are easily attached by automated manufacturing processes known in the art.
      <br/>
      Piezoelectric materials require a high voltage and low current because they are more or less non-conductors while shape-memory alloys require moderate voltage and current to heat them, and require up to a few tens of volts and up to 1 or 2 amps of current.
      <br/>
      One target design voltage for activation is approximately 5 volts with a maximum current of approximately 400 mA.
      <br/>
      This is a typical voltage and current compatible with computer voltages for computer and data acquisition system integration.
      <br/>
      However, the voltages required may be lower depending on the dimension of the fibers to be moved.
      <br/>
      In general, the smaller the fiber diameters the smaller the voltage required to activate and move the activation strip.
      <br/>
      Typically, for a 1 mm diameter fiber to be moved at most 2 mm one would need a voltage of about 2 volts.
      <br/>
      Each activation strip 18 is comprised of an electro- or magneto-active material as will now be described.
      <br/>
      While only two activation strips are discussed with reference to each embodiment, this is, done for simplicity and it is to be understood that the invention requires at least two activation strips and most preferably requires at least three activation strips, such as shown in FIG. 7, for the desired 21/2-D control.
      <br/>
      Either the polarity of the voltage or magnetic field source, or the polarity of the electro- or magneto-strictive material itself can be altered to effect expansion and contraction of the material as will be described next.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In a first embodiment, a plurality of magneto-strictive strips, such as Terfenol-D, approximately a few centimeters long, for example two cm, and of a width of a few microns are adhered in a symmetrical fashion longitudinally to each fiber near the end to be undulated.
      <br/>
      These activation strips are powered by an imposed magnetic field and either expand or contract according to the polarity of the magnetic field.
      <br/>
      The magnetic field is normally produced around a magneto-strictive material by a coil arrangement.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment the coil is attached to or embedded in the activation strip and the coil is powered by a voltage supply connected to each activation strip in the same way as described below for other embodiments.
      <br/>
      By controlling the magnetic field applied to each individual activation strip, the end of the optical fiber undulates dynamically and quickly to perform the switching function.
      <br/>
      For example, if two magneto-strictive strips are placed 180 degrees opposite each other longitudinally along the cylindrical mantle of a fiber, then the fiber can be made to move to either the left or the right by concurrently expanding one magneto-strictive strip while contracting the other magneto-strictive strip.
      <br/>
      The degree of movement to the left or to the right can be controlled by the amount of contraction or expansion of each of the magneto-strictive strips which is directly related to the strength of the magnetic field applied to each strip.
      <br/>
      Of course, additional magneto-strictive strips are adhered along the length of the fiber for a finer degree of control of movement in 21/2-D.
      <br/>
      Indeed, an entire sleeve or jacket of the material can envelop the fiber and is controlled by a plurality of electrodes upon the jacket.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 10a and 10b show a side view and a cross-sectional view, respectively, of this embodiment.
      <br/>
      Jacket 50, which is comprised of a magneto-strictive material envelopes optical fiber 14.
      <br/>
      Electrodes 34 and 36 are powered by voltage supply 30 which is controlled by switch 32.
      <br/>
      Upon closing switch 32 and applying voltage to electrodes 34 and 36, a magnetic field is produced around jacket 50 by one or more coils embedded in jacket 50.
      <br/>
      While only two electrodes are shown for simplicity in these figures, more electrodes and associated coils are used for a finer degree of control of movement.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In a second embodiment, a plurality of piezoelectric, piezoceramic, or piezo-polymeric strips, such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT) or polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF), approximately a few centimeters long, such as two cm, and of a width of a few microns are adhered in a symmetrical fashion longitudinally to each fiber near the end to be undulated.
      <br/>
      Piezoelectric materials are electrostrictive in the sense that if electrodes are attached to a strip having width, length and thickness, across the thickness and a voltage is applied, normally a high voltage of few 1000 volts, then they either contract or expand lengthwise.
      <br/>
      Piezoelectric materials expand or contract according to the polarity of their properties and of the voltage applied to them.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 8a and 8b show a side view and a cross-sectional view, respectively, of the second embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, activation strips 18 and 18' are adhered longitudinally along optical fiber 14to be undulated.
      <br/>
      Voltage supplies 30 and 30' controlled by switches 32 and 32' supply voltage to strips 18 and 18' via positive electrodes 36 and 36' and negative electrodes 34 and 34' attached to each strip.
      <br/>
      Due to the way that the voltage supplies are connected, strip 18 is polarized opposite strip 18'. By closing switches 32 and 32', the voltage is applied to strips 18 and 18'. Accordingly, strip 18 contracts while strip 18' expands, causing fiber 14 to bend in an upward direction as shown in FIG. 8a.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In a third embodiment, a plurality of shape-memory alloy wires or strips, such as Nitinol, approximately a feN centimeters long, such as two cm, and of a width of a few microns are adhered in a symmetrical fashion longitudinally to each fiber near the end to be undulated.
      <br/>
      Shape-memory alloys either contract or Expand due to a temperature transition from a solid phase of Martensite (crystalline structure is face-centered) to a solid phase of Austenite (crystalline structure is body-centered) due to direct electric Joule heating of the material.
      <br/>
      Shape-memory alloys either contract or expand according to the polarity of a voltage applied to them.
      <br/>
      By controlling the amount of voltage applied to each strip, the end of the optical fiber undulates dynamically and quickly to perform the switching function.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 9a and 9b show a side view and a cross-sectional view, respectively, of the third embodiment in its simplest form.
      <br/>
      Two activate on strips 18 and 18' are shown adhered 180 degrees opposite one another along the cylindrical length of optical fiber 14.
      <br/>
      Each activation strip 18 and 18' is controlled by voltage supplies 30 and 30', respectively.
      <br/>
      Switches 32 and 32' control the voltage supplied to the respective shape-memory wires.
      <br/>
      Positive electrodes 36 and 36' are attached to activation strips 18 and 18', respectively, but at opposite ends.
      <br/>
      Negative electrodes 34 and 34' are attached at opposite ends from positive electrodes 36 and 36' to activation strips 18 and 18'. As demonstrated in FIG. 9a, by closing switches 32 and 32', voltage is applied to activation strips 18 and 18' causing strip 18 to contract and strip 18' to expand.
      <br/>
      This is due to the fact that the voltage polarities across the two shape-memory strips are opposite.
      <br/>
      Because activation strip 18 contracts and activation strip 18' expands, and they are both directly adhered to optical fiber 14, optical fiber 14 bends in an upward direction.
      <br/>
      Reversing the polarities of the voltages applied to strips 18 and 18' will cause the fiber to bend downward instead.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Of course, any optical channel, be it an optical fiber, a group of fibers, or a fiber optic cable, can be moved in the same manners as described above.
      <br/>
      Also, it is to be understood that the fiber can be moved using combinations of the various activation strip materials described above.
      <br/>
      The activation strips are to be affixed to the input or output optical channels in accordance with the application for the switch.
      <br/>
      While only one direction of motion is shown in FIGS. 8-10, and a particular arrangement of electrodes and polarities is shown, it is to be understood that any direction of movement can be accomplished by varying locations of the activation strip or strips, polarities, and number of strips.
      <br/>
      In all of the embodiments presented, the voltage need not be a constant voltage, but can of course be a variable voltage waveform that varies in either frequency, amplitude, or polarity, or any combination of those three so as to control undulation frequency of the fiber, fibers, or cable.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The present invention may be used in telecommunications for signal on-off control; signal routing from one destination to another; signal attenuation; signal combination by having two or more outgoing bundles from two or more sources to be formed into a single bundle; and signal splitting as to send a signal to more than one destination.
      <br/>
      The invention may be located at either the transmitting or receiving terminals of a communication channel or any intermediate location.
      <br/>
      As with any electromechanical device, the functioning bandwidth of the undulation frequency of the switch spans a fraction of Hz to an upper limit of a few kilo Hz.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Although the invention has been described in detail with particular reference to these preferred embodiments, other embodiments can achieve the same results.
      <br/>
      Variations and modifications of the present invention will be obvious to those skilled in the art and it is intended to cover in the appended claims all such modifications and equivalents.
