    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an improved synchronization acquisition apparatus and an implementation a method thereof applicable for wireless communications systems, and more particularly, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) wireless telephones or receivers.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Background of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A Double Dwell, Maximum Likelihood, Serial Sliding Acquisition (DDMLSSA) may be implemented by discrete circuit elements, or a software routine performed by a digital data processor such as a high-speed signal processor, or a combination of the circuit device and the software routine.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows the DDMLSSA of the related art.
      <br/>
      The DDMLSSA is a part of a remote communication apparatus receiver such as a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) wireless phone in accordance with the mobile telephone station-base station compatibility standard of the TIA/EIA/IS-95(July, 1993), which is the dual mode wide band diffusion spectrum cellular system.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      When a wireless telephone is energized, one or more guide channel (i.e., pilot channels) are received from one or more neighboring base stations.
      <br/>
      Each guide channel transmits a psuedorandom noise (PN) code sequence which differs in phase (e.g., offset of the GPS time) from the PN code sequences of other base stations of the system.
      <br/>
      The DDMLSSA synchronizes the local PN generator of the receiver to the PN sequence of the guide channel with a signal intensity that exceeds the noise level.
      <br/>
      While the DDMLSSA need not synchronize to the guide channel of the base station nearest to the receiver at the initial stage, it should synchronize to the guide channel having a sufficiently intense signal strength to initiate communication between the base station and the receiver.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A high frequency receiver 1 and a frequency demodulator 2 receive a PN code signal from the guide channel of more than one transmission base station BS.
      <br/>
      The DDMLSSA is also coupled to a controller such as a data processor 3, which may input an integration time and a predetermined threshold value.
      <br/>

    <p num="7">The related art DDMLSSA also contains a multiplier 11, first and second integrators 13, 14, a local PN code generator 12, a first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh comparison block 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 25, 26, 27, a noise sample count index initialization and incrementing blocks 31, 33, local phase incrementing block 32, and first and second threshold value initialization block 34, 35.</p>
    <p num="8">
      In the related art DDMLSSA, the received PN code signal (including noise) is applied to the multiplier 11.
      <br/>
      The received PN code signal is then multiplied by the PN code outputted from the local PN generator 12 of the wireless phone.
      <br/>
      The multiplier 11 output is applied to the first integrator 13 and the second integrator 14.
      <br/>
      The first integrator 13 is a trial integrator having an integration period of TD1, seconds, and an output Zi1 of that integrator 13 is transmitted to the first comparator 21.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The first comparator 21 performs an operation to compare the first integrator 13 output Zi1 with a first threshold value (1-y) Z1 at time t. That first threshold value is a function of the maximum first integrator 13 output from past history until time (t-1), and provides a confidence interval greater than 50% for the relatively short correlation length.
      <br/>
      Initially, the first threshold value Z1 is set to `0`, and y is between 1/16 and 1/8 for the present comparison.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      When the first integrator 13 output Zi1 is greater than or equal to the first threshold value (1-y) Z1, the fifth comparator 25 performs a test and updates the first threshold value Z1, as discussed in greater detail below.
      <br/>
      When the first integrator 13 output Zi1 is less than the first threshold value, the second comparator 22 performs an operation to compare the first integrator 13 output Zi1 with a threshold likelihood value Z1/2, which is less than the historical value of the output of the first integrator 13.
      <br/>
      The predetermined threshold value is 6 dB less than the maximum signal energy or the maximum likelihood threshold value Z1/2, plus or minus (x), where (x) varies between about 0 and 3 dB.

      If the first integrator 13 output Zi1 is greater than or equal to the first threshold likelihood value Z1/2 +- X based on the test performed by the second comparator 22, the system resets the value of the noise sample count index m to 0 at the index initialization block 31.
      <br/>
      Next, the third comparator 23 compares the phase i of the locally generated code signal with q, where q is the total number PN phases to be searched in the PN space.
      <br/>
      Here, q represents the total number of PN chips in the code region and has a value of 215, or 32,768 chips.

    <p num="12">
      The third comparator 23 determines whether the signal is at the end portion of the PN code region.

      If the phase i has a different value from the total number of PN chips q, the phase i is incremented by the local phase incrementing block 32 and the PN code generator 12 is updated, and the interrelationship is checked again.
      <br/>
      If the locally generated phase i equals the total number of PN chips q in a third comparator 23, the acquisition process is terminated, as an exhaustive search of the PN code region has been conducted, and the correct PN code phase has been determined.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      If the first integrator 13 output Zi is less than the first threshold likelihood value Z1/2 +- X based on the test performed by the second comparator 22, the noise sample count index m is incremented by a value of 1 by the index incrementing block 33.
      <br/>
      The resulting value of the noise sample index m is then compared with a threshold value M in the fourth comparator 24.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      If the noise sample index m is greater than the threshold value M, the checking process of the acquisition process is terminated, as a correct PN code phase determination has been completed, the acquisition apparatus has obtained a proper signal, and a predetermined number of the noise samples has been evaluated.
      <br/>
      For example, a suitable threshold value M between about 70 and about 150 provides a detection probability that exceeds 90%.

      If the noise sample index m is less than or equal to the threshold value M, the phase of the locally generated PN code signal is incremented by the local incrementing block 32, and the interrelationship is checked again.

      The entire acquisition operation is performed until the first integrator 13 output (1-y)Zi1 exceeds the first threshold value Z1 in the first comparator 21, for the relatively short correlation interval.
      <br/>
      The output Zi1 of the first integrator 13 is then compared with Z1 by a fifth comparator 25.
      <br/>
      If the value of the first integrator 13 output Zi1 exceeds the threshold value Z1, the first threshold value is updated to equal the current output value Zi1 of the first integrator 13 in the first threshold value initialization block 34.

      Since the initial value Z1 is set at `0`, the initial comparison result of the first comparison block 21 is followed by the operation of the fifth comparator 25, and the value of the first threshold value Z1 is initialized to the first integrator 13 output Zi1 by the first threshold value initialization block 34.

    <p num="17">
      Next, the integration (i.e., dwell) time is increased to TD2 seconds without changing the locally generated PN code phase.
      <br/>
      The second dwell time provides a higher detection probability and a lower false alarm probability.
      <br/>
      The integration time of the second integrator 14 is equivalent to about 128 to 2,048 chips, preferably 128 chips (104 msec).

      The integration time of the second integrator 14 is selected to exceed the integration time of the first integrator 13.

      The sixth comparator 26 determines whether the second integrator 14 output Zi2 exceeds the second threshold value Z2.

      If the second integrator 14 output Zi2 exceeds the second threshold value Z2, then the second threshold value initialization block 35 updates the second threshold value Z2 to equal the current output value Zi2 of the second integrator 14.
      <br/>
      Since the second threshold value initially equals `0`, the result of the sixth comparison block leads to the operation of the second threshold value initialization block, where the second threshold value Z2 is set to the second integrator 14 output Zi2.
      <br/>
      Next, the index initialization block 31 sets the noise sample count index m to an initial value of `0`. The phase of the internally generated code signal is varied by the decimal unit of the chip at the local phase incrementing block 32, and the interrelationship is rechecked until the condition in the third comparison block 23 has been satisfied.

    <p num="19">
      If the output Zi2 of the second integrator 14 is less than the second threshold value Z2 as determined by the test performed in the sixth comparison block, the seventh comparison block 27 compares the output value Zi2 of the second integrator 14 with the second threshold likelihood value Z2/2, which is smaller by about 6 dB than the energy level of the maximum signal.
      <br/>
      If the output value Zi2 of the second integrator 14 is greater than or equal to the second threshold likelihood value Z2/2, the index initialization block 31 resets the noise sample counter index m to equal `0`, and the phase of the PN code signal is varied by the decimal unit of the chip in the local phase incrementing block 32, and the interrelationship is checked again.

    <p num="20">
      If the output Zi2 of the second integrator 14 is less than the second threshold prediction value Z2/2, the index incrementing block 33 increments noise sample counter index m by a value of 1, and the fourth comparator 24 compares the index m with the threshold value M. If the noise sample index m is greater than the threshold value M, the acquisition apparatus terminates the acquisition process as discussed above.
      <br/>
      If the noise sample counter index m is less than or equal the threshold value M, the entire acquisition process is continuously performed, as described above.

      When the acquisition process of the related art is performed in a noisy communication environment, the output of the first integrator 13 fluctuates rapidly.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the second integrator 14 is frequently used.
      <br/>
      However, because the first integrator 13 increasingly discards the false PN phases, the second integrator 13 is used less frequently.
      <br/>
      Since the second integrator 14 has a longer dwell time, the acquisition time is decreased when the second integrator 14 is used less frequently.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In the index initialization block 31, the noise sample counter index m is set to equal `0`, and the next locally generated PN code phase is set in the local phase incrementing block 32.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="34">
      FIG. 2 illustrates a preferred embodiment of a synchronization acquisition apparatus according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The preferred embodiment of a synchronization acquisition apparatus includes a pair of integrators 132, 133 with identical integration intervals, and a variable integrator 131 that varies the integration interval to produce a synchronization acquisition time three times faster than the related art.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      A PN input code signal (including noises) received by the synchronization acquisition apparatus is applied to first, second, and third multipliers 121, 122, 123.
      <br/>
      A first PN code signal from a PN code generator 100 is multiplied by a first delay PN code signal PNCSD1 and a second delay PN code signal PNCSD2 as first and second delay units 111, 112 sequentially delay the PN code signal.
      <br/>
      Since the PN code offset (K) of the PN code generator 100 equals 1 at an initial stage, the PN code generator 100 generates a PN code signal.
      <br/>
      The first and second delay units 111, 112 sequentially delay the locally generated PN code signal when the PN code offset (K) equals 1, such that first and second delay PN code signals are generated for PN code offset values (K) equal to 2 and 3, respectively
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The outputs of the second and third multipliers 122, 123 are applied to the second and third integrators 132, 133 having identical integration intervals.
      <br/>
      The outputs of the multipliers 121, 122, 123 are selectively applied to the variable integrator 131 by first, second and third switches SW1, SW2, SW3 for varying the integration interval.
      <br/>
      Initially, the first switch SW1 is transited to the "ON" position, so that the output of the first multiplier 121 is applied to the variable integrator 131.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the first `delta` value of the variable integrator 131 is initially equals the integration value t1 of the second and third integrators 132, 133.
      <br/>
      As a result, the variable first integrator 131 and the non-variable second and third integrators 132, 133 integrate the outputs of the first through third multipliers 121, 122, 123 over an identical integration interval.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The output of the variable integrator 131 is selectively outputted to the detector 110 or the sixth comparator 146 based on the position of fourth and fifth switches SW4, SW5.
      <br/>
      Initially, the fourth switch SW4 is transited to the `ON` position, and the output of the variable integrator 131 is applied to the detector 110.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The detector 110 selects a maximum value MAXt1 from the outputs of the integrators 131, 132, 133, which is outputted to a first comparator 141.
      <br/>
      The first comparator 141 then performs an operation to compare the output MAXt1 of the detector 110 with the first threshold value X*Z1.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, Z1 represents a first maximum value, which is the largest historical integration value, and X represents a value of about 0.85.about 0 (slashed zero) 94.
      <br/>
      If the output MAXt1 of the detector 110 is greater than or equal to the first threshold value X*Z1, the first maximum value Z1 is compared with the output MAXt1 of the detector 110 by a second comparator 142.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      If the second comparator 142 determines that the maximum output MAXt1 of the detector 110 is greater than or equal to the first maximum value Z1, the first maximum value Z1 among the first integration values is updated to equal the output value MAXt1 of the detector 110 by the first threshold value initialization block 210.
      <br/>
      The second delta value t2 of the variable integrator 131 is updated for the second integration to a value greater than a first delta value.
      <br/>
      If the detector 110 maximum output value MAXt1 equals the output of the variable integrator 131, the first switch SW1 is transited to the `ON` position.
      <br/>
      Correspondingly, the maximum output value MAXt1 equals the output of the second integrator 132, the second switch SW2 is transited to the `ON` position, and if the maximum output value MAXt1 equals the output of the third integrator 133, the third switch SW3 is transited to the `ON` position.
      <br/>
      If either the second switch SW2 or the third switch SW3 is in the `ON` position, the fourth switch SW4 is transited to the `OFF` position, and the fifth switch SW5 is transited to the `ON` position.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      If the output MAXt1 of the detector 110 is less than the first maximum value Z1 among the former first integration values, the first maximum value Z1 among the former first integration values is not updated to equal the maximum output MAXt1 value of the detector.

      If the maximum value MAXt1 is less than the first threshold value X*Z1 based on the operation performed by the first comparator 141, a third comparator 143 compares the maximum output value MAXt1 with a first likelihood value Z1/2, which is less than the first maximum threshold value Z1.
      <br/>
      If the maximum output value MAXt1 is greater or equal to the first likelihood value Z1/2, the count CNT is set to 0 by a counter initialization block 220, and the PN code offset K and the PN code period F are compared by a fourth comparator 144.
      <br/>
      If the PN code offset K is less than the PN code period F, the PN code offset K is incremented by 3 by a local phase incrementing block 240, so the PN code generator 100 generates a PN code signal by the offset K.

      <br/>
      The post detection search (PDT) is the time required to evaluate the noise sample or non-related signals, based on the number determined by the synchronization apparatus after a reliable signal is obtained.

      A detection probability of about 99% is obtained based on the PDT.

      When the variable integrator 131 integrates with respect to integration intervals determined by the second delta value based on the condition for the second integration, the fifth switch SW5 is transited to the `ON` position and a second integration value MAXt2 of the variable integrator 131 is compared with a second maximum value Z2 by a sixth comparator 146.
