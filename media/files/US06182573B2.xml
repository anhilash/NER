      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates generally to the field of attachment systems.
      <br/>
      More particularly, it concerns systems for attaching one or more explosive device(s) to a flexible linear support, related methods and devices, and methods of using the charge assemblies thus produced.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      An Anti-Personnel Obstacle Breaching System (APOBS) has been under development for the United States Marine Corps by the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC).
      <br/>
      The system contains one Rocket Motor, a Line Charge Assembly (LCA) which contains detonating cord and 108 evenly spaced grenades, a single or multiple fuze assemblies, a parachute assembly, two backpack sets, and a shipping container.
      <br/>
      The APOBS system is designed to clear a safe lane (approximately 0.6-2.0 meters wide by 45 meters long) through wire obstacles containing anti-personnel landmines.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The current LCA design supports the evenly spaced grenades using two parallel 0.25 inch nylon ropes.
      <br/>
      The grenades are secured to the ropes via twin metal band clamp assemblies.
      <br/>
      The ropes are designed to be structural members that carry all of the grenade launch and deceleration loads.
      <br/>
      In addition, the detonating cord running through the center of each grenade is routed with adequate slack to minimize launch induced tensile loads on the cord, i.e., the rope carries the weight of the grenades, grenade attachments, and detonating cord.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Current system grenade attachment specifications prescribe labor-intensive processes that require highly specified and non-standardized components, numerous calibrations and quality checks, and expensive, one-of-a-kind clamping machines.
      <br/>
      Structural inadequacies, grenade separation and attachment degradations reducing storage life and performance reliability were noticeable problems during the development phase of the APOBS program.
      <br/>
      The structural support, spacing, and orientation control for the grenades during deployment and impact has also been an area of ongoing concern.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Though the band clamp attachment approach has been demonstrated to adequately support the grenades during deployments, the overall attachment performance and manufacturing processes have proven to be less than satisfactory.
      <br/>
      A key design feature of the structural attachment mechanism of the band clamp approach was that the clamps allow the ropes to predictability slip under the bands during deployment (shock) loading (2.0 inch slippage maximum).
      <br/>
      This predictable energy-absorbing rope slippage provided a shock absorption feature that reduced overall loads throughout the line charge assembly.
      <br/>
      However, the metal clamp edges tended to cut and fray the rope.
      <br/>
      In addition, the clamping action tended to pinch the outer layer of the dual braided nylon rope allowing only the inner braid to slip under the band--resulting in all the loads being carried by the damaged outer braid--resulting in premature rope failure.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The grenades are stowed in their backpack containers 90 (degree)  to the direction of deployment, i.e., the ropes are first pulled perpendicular to the grenade axis.
      <br/>
      After the initial snatch, the grenades align with the deployment direction because the center of gravity of the grenade is behind the forward clamping band.
      <br/>
      The highest loads are experienced during the initial snatch, and this loading tends to pull the ropes circumferentially under the bands towards the rope pull side of the grenade.
      <br/>
      This circumferential slippage misaligns the axis of the grenade with the direction of deployment and reduces the maximum load carrying capability of the attachment.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Therefore, an attachment system that prevents rope fraying and misalignment would, among other factors, increase the performance and load carrying capabilities, and would thus represent a significant advance in the art.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="38">
      The attachment systems of the present invention overcome the design and performance limitations present in the explosive device attachments utilizing one or more metal band clamp(s) alone.
      <br/>
      Although the metal band clamp attachment approach has been demonstrated to adequately support an explosive device such as a grenade during deployment, the overall attachment performance and manufacturing processes have proven to be less than satisfactory.
      <br/>
      Some key issues involving the current attachment approach are presented below.
    </p>
    <p num="39">Among the problems presented by the metal band clamp attachments are: the metal band clamp assemblies are relatively heavy, expensive and require labor-intensive processes, numerous calibrations and quality checks and expensive, one-of-a-kind clamping machines; metal band clamp compression of nylon ropes creates long term storage and structural attachment concerns; the metal band tension decreases due to nylon rope creep weakening the structural attachment; metal bands cut and fray ropes during deployment loading; the metal band clamp mass has been shown to slow fragmentation velocity; and metal band clips and buckles require specific orientation during pack-out and have caused entanglement with parachute deployment.</p>
    <p num="40">
      In order to overcome these and other problems inherent in attachment systems utilizing only one or more metal band clamps, analysis of the metal band clamp manufacturing process and of the functional design was conducted.
      <br/>
      The manufacturing process analyses provided a baseline for the evaluation of alternative concept processes and provided a baseline model for cost analysis comparisons.
      <br/>
      The analyses of the functional design included fragmentation modeling to determine the impact of attachment hardware on the fragmentation performance of the explosive device.
      <br/>
      CTH hydrocode fragmentation analysis (explosive modeling) showed that the extra mass associated with the flanges and clamps caused slower fragmentation.
      <br/>
      The line charge rocket motor deployment was also analyzed to determine static and dynamic loading, structural attachment requirements, and required margins.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      As a result of an extensive analysis, several innovative attachment concepts/processes; were identified.
      <br/>
      These concepts were further developed and tested to optimize an attachment solution and traded-off against the current metal band only approach (Table 1, below).
      <br/>
      The concepts were evaluated against the following criteria: form, fit, and function--the size of the attachment should be compatible with the existing backpack volumes; performance--provide a reliable structural attachment, minimize the overall weight to ensure there is no impact to standoff, and ensure the fragmentation performance is not been impacted; automation--the concept should have the potential to be automated to minimize operator presence (safety) and increase producibility; reduction in components--develop approaches or processes that require fewer components; process insensitive--develop reliable, repeatable approaches or processes that require fewer quality checks, calibrations, and validations; and long term storage--the attachment approach should ensure a reliable structural attachment, after exposure to all environments, at any time during the storage or service life of the system.

    <p num="43">Certain of the preferred embodiments of the present invention are discussed in greater detail below.</p>
    <p num="44">A. Whipping Attachment</p>
    <p num="45">
      In a preferred embodiment, the current invention provides a lightweight attachment system using a fibrous material, such as a yarn or a high strength thread, in a whipping process that lashes the flexible linear support, such as a rope or ropes, to one or both sides of the explosive device, such as one or more grenades.
      <br/>
      The lightweight attachment system replaces the function of the heavier, more costly, more process sensitive steel band clamps, and provides a more reliable structural attachment with numerous benefits.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The whipping process can be automated providing a low cost, repeatable attachment process.
      <br/>
      Tests of a preferred embodiment of the present invention have shown consistent results, thus eliminating the need for extensive calibrating and validating tests required when using the metal band clamps alone.
      <br/>
      The fibrous material presents a benign interface to the linear support (for example nylon ropes), eliminating cutting and fraying experienced with the metal bands alone.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Fibrous materials that exhibit a combination of high elasticity and low creep are particularly preferred for use in the present invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, although nylon thread is a preferred fibrous material, a number of different fibrous materials are also contemplated for use in particular embodiments of the invention.
      <br/>
      For example, in one preferred embodiment of the invention, approximately 40-60 wraps of a 1500 denier yarn are used for each whip operation (band), and two whip operations (bands) are used per each grenade attachment (replacing the two steel band clamps).
      <br/>
      A high tenacity Vectran.RTM. yarn has also been tested, and other materials, including, but not limited to, polyester, polypropylene, Nomex.RTM., Teflon.RTM., Tenara.RTM. expanded PFTE, and Kevlar.RTM. (for example MIL-T-87128 size E) threads, and blends thereof, are also contemplated for use in certain aspects of the invention.
      <br/>
      Pre-stressed thread is also contemplated for use.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The fibrous material and the ends of the fibrous material, in this embodiment the yarn and yarn ends, are secured in place with an adhesive process (for example pre-preg yarn, adhesive applied during whipping, or applied after whipping).
      <br/>
      Some of the adhesive processes require slight heating (for example about 3 hours at about 200 (degree)  F.) for curing.
      <br/>
      The whipping attachment addresses many of the deficiencies and shortcomings in the art, as described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="49">B. Combined BRGIC--Whipping Attachment</p>
    <p num="50">
      In another aspect of the invention, a specially designed band-rope-grenade interface connector (BRGIC) is utilized with one or more of the fibrous bands described above to provide a benign and predictable interface to the nylon ropes to eliminate rope damage and to provide repeatable energy absorbing slippage during deployment.
      <br/>
      This configuration allows the connectors to be adhesively bonded to the whipping to eliminate 90 (degree)  circumferential slipping.
      <br/>
      The connector allows bonding to the whipping without the adhesive being wicked into the rope, which could weaken the rope.
      <br/>
      In addition, adhering the connectors to the whipping fixes the connectors in their proper 180 (degree)  locations maximizing the load carrying ability of the system.
      <br/>
      Thus, this combined approach has the potential to provide the maximum load carrying capability in applications where this is required.
    </p>
    <p num="51">C. Band-Rope-Grenade Interface Connector (BRGIC)</p>
    <p num="52">
      In another embodiment of the present invention, the band-rope-grenade interface connector (BRGIC) described above is utilized with the metal bands to overcome the shortcomings of using the metal bands alone.
      <br/>
      The BRGIC approach provides a benign and very predictable rope compression that does not damage the rope during installation or long term storage and yields a repeatable and predictable energy absorbing rope slippage during deployment.
      <br/>
      The band-to-rope-to-grenade interface connector secures the rope to the grenades via the steel band clamps.
      <br/>
      The rope interface surfaces of the connector are fluted to provide a very smooth interface to the rope to preclude fraying or pinching.
      <br/>
      During loading the ropes slip smoothly under the connectors in a very predictable energy absorbing manner.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      During 90 (degree)  testing, the connectors experienced circumferential slippage, reducing their load carrying capability.
      <br/>
      The circumferential slippage was addressed by adhesively bonding the connectors to the bands clamps, thus fixing the connectors in their respective 180 (degree)  orientation on either side of the grenade.
      <br/>
      This approach yielded a configuration capable of carrying very high shock loading while maintaining the desired symmetric rope attachment for optimized deployment load sharing.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The metal band clamp attachment was suspected of causing damage to the ropes during long term storage, and during pull testing it was noted that the ropes were damaged as they slipped under the bands.
      <br/>
      During testing of the whipping attachment it was noted that the ropes slipped under the yarn whipping in a very repeatable manner without damage to the ropes, however, the whipping did not prevent circumferential slippage during 90 (degree)  static pull tests.
      <br/>
      The BRGIC concept provides both a benign interface to the ropes (long term storage concerns) and allows a repeatable energy absorbing slippage of the ropes during loading without causing damage to the ropes.
      <br/>
      The circumferential displacement of the connector during 90 (degree)  pull testing was eliminated by bonding the bands to the connectors.
      <br/>
      This configuration was demonstrated to provide the best overall load carrying capability.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The following examples are included to demonstrate preferred embodiments of the invention.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples which follow represent techniques discovered by the inventors to function well in the practice of the invention, and thus can be considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice.
      <br/>
      However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

    <p num="56">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="57">Whipping Attachment for Use in the APOBS</p>
    <p num="58">
      In the whipping attachment system for use in the Anti-Personnel Obstacle Breaching System (APOBS), the grenades are attached to the ropes using a whipping or winding process.
      <br/>
      The whipping attachment process lashes the ropes to the grenades using a fibrous yam or high strength thread eliminating the steel band clamps.
      <br/>
      An attachment is composed of two separate windings, one on either side of the grenade central clamping ring feature as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Thread tension, number of winds, and winding width are easily controlled.
      <br/>
      The thread windings are held in place using a quick drying adhesive.
      <br/>
      The whipping process can be automated providing a low cost, repeatable attachment process.
      <br/>
      Numerous tests of the concept have shown consistent results eliminating the need for extensive calibrating and validating tests required when using the band clamps.
      <br/>
      The fibers present a benign interface to the nylon ropes eliminating cutting and fraying experienced with the steel bands.
      <br/>
      During loading, uncompressed portions of the ropes are pulled smoothly under the windings in a predictable energy-absorbing manner.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The APOBS Technical Data Package (TDP; incorporated herein by reference) is well known to those of skill in the art.
      <br/>
      As described above, APOBS is a two-man, backpacked system which can breach footpaths through anti-personnel land mines and wire obstacles.
      <br/>
      The APOBS uses a rocket to pull a line charge over the obstacle.
      <br/>
      The line charge consists of 108 fragmentation grenades which defeat the obstacle when detonated.
      <br/>
      Copies of the TDP are available for review via request in writing directed to Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Code CTQIPS, Quantico, Va. 22134-5010.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      A presently preferred embodiment uses 60 wraps of a nylon thread (V-T-295 T/2 C/A Size FF) applied with 6-8 pounds tension, secured with a quick drying Cyanacrolate adhesive.
      <br/>
      The width is controlled to 0.350-inch .+- 0 (slashed zero) 050-inch.
      <br/>
      The whipping attachment is used to secure the ropes to all 108 grenades and four connectors in the line charge assembly.
      <br/>
      A single spool of nylon thread weighing 0.80 pounds and costing approximately $15.00 replaces the 224 steel bands, 224 buckles, and 108 clips costing approximately $400.00. The total weight of a whipped attachment is less than four grams per grenade, compared to 21 grams per twin metal band clamp assembly, providing a total line charge weight savings of 4.33 pounds.
    </p>
    <p num="61">The whipping attachment provides the following features and benefits: high strength fiber replaces steel bands reducing the line charge weight by 4.33 pounds which allows increased rocket motor standoff performance; the whipping attachment addresses long term storage issues concerning steel band compression of ropes and steel band cutting and fraying of ropes during deployment; nylon thread windings provide a benign interface to rope structure allowing energy-absorbing slippage without rope damage; fragmentation velocity under whipped area is increased due to low mass of fibers vs. high mass steel bands; smooth, low profile whipping attachment eliminates band clamp buckle and clip snagging problems; low observable nylon thread eliminates special finish and surface treatment on steel bands to minimize system visual signature; fully automated whipping process eliminates 224 steel bands and clips, reducing production costs, and provides repeatable and reliable structural attachment eliminating numerous calibration and validation tests, thus lowering production costs; automation of attachment process increases operator safety by removing operator from assembly area; and eliminates orientation of band buckles and clips during pack-out and observed snags of buckles with parachute.</p>
    <p num="62">
      The whipping attachment has been subjected to numerous development tests including thermal cycling, accelerated aging, hot and cold temperature soak, static pull tests (hot, cold, and ambient), and dynamic cold gas cannon tests.
      <br/>
      The TDP (metal band clamp) zero-degree static pull tests require that the grenade attach sample support a minimum of 250 pounds force before the rope has slipped two inches under the band.
      <br/>
      The load-extension curve presented in FIG. 4A, FIG. 4B and FIG. 4C shows the typical load carrying capability of the band clamp (FIG. 4A) and the BRGIC (FIG. 4B), and the superior load carrying ability of the whipping attachment (FIG. 4C).
      <br/>
      It should be noted that all samples tested had been subjected to temperature cycling (70 (degree) -160 (degree)  F.) with high temperature exposure of over 440 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      A summary of the whipping static pull tests, demonstrating the superior load carrying after environmental testing, is presented below in Table 2.
      <br/>
      It is interesting to note that the whipping attachment demonstrated an average peak load capability of 600 pounds at high temperature (+125 (degree)  F.) testing, 702 pounds at ambient (+70 (degree)  F.) and 1,057 pounds at cold temperature (-25 (degree)  F.).
      <br/>
      In addition, numerous cold gas cannon tests of line charge segments have been performed.
      <br/>
      Tests have been performed at 110 fps, 120 fps, and 160 fps to demonstrate the structural capability of the whipping attachment.
      <br/>
      In all of the testing performed on the whipping samples, there has never been any sign of wear or fraying of the rope, and not one grenade has separated nor has a winding ever failed.

    <p num="65">
      The structural attachment capability of the TDP (metal) band clamp is dependent upon the frictional forces generated between the band, rope, and grenade surfaces.
      <br/>
      The normal (or compressive) forces that determine these frictional retention forces are a direct result of the tension in the band (FIG. 5B).
      <br/>
      Government testing has shown that the band clamps can provide the needed clamping forces in the short term; however, testing after long term exposure to elevated temperatures has uncovered serious structural reliability issues due primarily to creep in the nylon ropes (i.e., cold flow of the compressed nylon reduces the rope cross-section under the banded area).
      <br/>
      The steel band clamp, due to its minimal elongation properties, is incapable of absorbing even small amounts of rope creep and cannot maintain the required clamping force.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the instant whipping attachment provides a reliable structural attachment even after the effects of long term aging because the nylon thread material's elastic elongation properties are large compared to the creep in the system.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The nylon thread is wound around the grenade and ropes under a nominal tension of 7.0 pounds; the thread has a breaking strength of 17 pounds at 25% elongation (FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      Utilizing 50 wraps, the total wound tension securing the ropes to the grenade is 350 pounds (or 7 * 50=350), similar to the TDP band clamp installation tension of 250 +- 100 pounds (350 pounds tension used for comparison).
      <br/>
      During the initial winding of the thread, the nylon rope is compressed from its 0.250 inch circular diameter to a more flattened configuration as shown in FIG. 8B. A similar initial compressed state is achieved during the TDP band clamp installation (FIG. SA).
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      At 7.0 pounds tension the thread sees an initial elongation of only 10% (or 41% or ultimate, i.e., 7 / 17 * 100=41%; FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      Given that the nominal wrap length (after initial rope compression) is approximately 6.552 inches (FIG. 8B), a thread length of 5.956 with an elongation of 10% would yield a wrapped length of 6.552 (5.956 * 1.1=6.552).
      <br/>
      This elongation represents a delta length of 0.596 inches (or 6.552-5.956=0.596).
      <br/>
      Conversely, the elongation of the steel band installed at 350 pounds tension is a mere 0.015 inches (FIG. 7A), representing an elongation of only 0.23% (FIG. 7B).
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The problem with the TDP band clamp arises during long term aging with a gradual reduction (creep) in the nylon rope cross-section, especially at elevated temperatures (160 (degree)  F. storage temperature).
      <br/>
      Experience has shown that, for the design of equipment subjected to sustained loading at elevated temperatures, little reliance can be placed on the usual short-time tensile properties of materials.
      <br/>
      Under the application of a constant load it has been found that many materials show a gradual flow or creep even for stresses below the proportional limit at elevated temperatures.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      However, the compressive loading of the ropes under the whipping or clamps is not constant; as the ropes creep--reducing their cross-section--the tension in the whipping or bands is reduced.
      <br/>
      The reduced tension reduces the compressive force on the ropes and slows the creep cold flow process.
      <br/>
      Eventually, a balance is reached.
      <br/>
      For the steel band clamps, only a small amount of creep results in a relatively large band tension reduction.
      <br/>
      This is due to the limited elongation capabilities of the steel band with respect to banding length reduction resulting from creep of the rope.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      An estimate of rope creep (cross-section reduction over the service life of the system) and the corresponding wrap length reduction has been made (FIG. 8A, FIG. 8B, FIG. 8C, FIG. 8D and FIG. 8E).
      <br/>
      Four conditions are presented to fully bound the problem as follows: (1) assumes incompressible ropes (i.e., they retain their circular diameter; FIG. 8A); (2) represents an estimate (measured) of the initial compressed state of the rope after the wraps (or bands) are installed (47% compression or flattening of rope; FIG. 8B); (3) an estimate of the maximum cross-section reduction (creep, cold flow) expected during the service life of the system (represents an additional 5% cross-section reduction; FIG. 8C); and (4) assumes 100% reduction, i e., ropes removed (lower bound; FIG. 8D).
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      The impact of long term aging on the whipping and TDP band clamps can be described as follows.
      <br/>
      The cross-section reduction in the ropes (from initial installation to the end of service life) reduces the wrap length from 6.552 inches to 6.528 inches or 0.024 inches.
      <br/>
      This represents an 0.37% reduction in elongation (or thread wrap length, i.e., 0.024+6.552 * 100=0.37%) reducing the thread percent elongation from 10% to 9.63% and correspondingly reducing the thread tension from 7.0 pounds to 6.74 pounds per wrap (FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      The overall wrap tension is reduced to 337 pounds (6.74 * 50=337).
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the elimination of the ropes altogether (100% cross-section reduction) would only reduce the overall tension in the wraps to 194 pounds (3.88 * 50=194).
      <br/>
      This condition could not exist; however, it shows the robustness of the whipping attachment to deal with rope cross-section changes due to creep.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      For this example, the identical 0.024-inch reduction in the steel band length (0.37% reduction in elongation) would reduce the tension in the bands to zero (FIG. 7A and FIG. 7B).
      <br/>
      This, of course, is due to the limited elongation capability of the steel bands, i.e., the bands were originally installed with only 0.23% elongation (0.015-inch elongation).
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      In actuality, the tension force in the steel bands does not go to zero; a small cross-section reduction in the rope creates a comparatively large initial reduction in the band tension (and compression on the rope).
      <br/>
      This slows the cold flow process and continued cross-section reduction in the rope; however, the structural integrity of the attachment is not reliable due to the rapid decrease of the compressive attachment forces.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      This phenomenon, is the Achilles' heel of the TDP band clamp attachment and it cannot be overcome in the current system.
      <br/>
      Increases in band tension to compensate for tension loss due to creep only exacerbates the problem.
      <br/>
      The whipping attachment, on the other hand, is able to address the creep and compensate with its comparatively large elastic elongation properties.
      <br/>
      The whipped nylon thread has a 40:1 percent elongation advantage over the steel band.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      To determine the full impact of creep on the whipping approach, one should also consider the effect of creep in the nylon thread itself Based on the thread properties and tensile loading (5-7 pounds), an additional elongation of the thread of 2.5% over the service life of the system has been assumed.
      <br/>
      This further reduces the tension in the thread from 6.74 to 5.00 pounds yielding a total wrap tension of 250 pounds (5.0 * 50=250) which is well within the limits of the TDP tension requirements.
      <br/>
      Tests of the whipping attachment wound at 5.0 pounds tension have resulted in 0-degree static pull-test peak-load capability in excess of 400 pounds.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The whipping attachment provides a reliable structural attachment even after the effects of long term aging because the nylon thread material's elastic elongation properties are large compared to the creep in the system.
      <br/>
      The thread, applied at only 41% of its elastic limit, has sufficient elongation to mitigate the effects of long term rope creep, maintaining the clamping force of the attachment.
      <br/>
      Conversely, the steel band clamp, due to its minimal elongation, is incapable of absorbing even small amounts of rope creep and cannot maintain the required clamping force.
      <br/>
      Increases in band tension to compensate for tension loss due to creep only exacerbates the detrimental effects (cold flow, cutting and fraying) of the steel bands on the ropes.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      In addition, the thread presents a benign interface to ropes, whereas steel bands tend to cut and fray ropes.
      <br/>
      Tension control is superior with the whipping approach: low, controllable thread winding tension (7 +- 1 pound), and the number of wraps (50) can be accurately controlled; whereas band clamp tension is difficult to control, i.e., reference the large TDP tolerance of 250 +- 100 pounds.
      <br/>
      The superior structural capability of the whipping attachment was also verified through cold gas cannon tests.

    <p num="85">
      An automated winding machine was developed to facilitate the manufacture of the instant line charges.
      <br/>
      The machine is configured to allow a continuous flow of grenades and rope to be fed in from one side, lashed together, and pulled out the other side.
      <br/>
      The grenades and ropes are not rotated during the winding operation.
      <br/>
      The machine is able to attach at least about 60 to about 108 grenades without reloading thread bobbins or adhesive.
      <br/>
      It also controls thread tension, number of winds, and width of each winding.
      <br/>
      Adhesive is applied to secure the thread once the winds are complete.
      <br/>
      Curing of the adhesive and thread trimming are also controlled.

    <p num="86">
      A semi-automatic winding capability via the development of a prototype winding machine has been demonstrated.
      <br/>
      The automated grenade attachment winding machine provides continuous grenade attachment with minimal operator presence.
      <br/>
      Numerous grenade attachments and line charge segments and assemblies have been fabricated and tested demonstrating the reliability of the unique whipping attachment.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      As the winding machine should be capable of safely working with high explosive grenades, operator involvement was minimized.
      <br/>
      The machine, or machine and a single operator, has the following capabilities: loading of the grenades on insertion tool; insertion of grenade into winding machine; storing, routing and tensioning of the ropes, positioning of the ropes with respect to the grenades; control of rope twist; starting of thread winding (initial securing of the thread); lashing the ropes to the grenade via a controlled number of winds; controlling the width and lay-down pattern of the windings; application of adhesive to the thread windings; adhesive curing; cutting the end of the thread; advancing the attached grenade; and insertion of the subsequent grenade (to be attached) at the proper spacing.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      The grenades may be supported through their center during handling and attachment (detonating cord not present during attachment).
      <br/>
      The preferred grenade to grenade spacing is between about 16 and about 16.5 inches along the ropes.
      <br/>
      The ropes should be located at about 180 (degree)  +- 10 (degree)  on either side of the grenade longitudinal axis.
      <br/>
      Minimal twist in either rope is preferred.
      <br/>
      The ropes are manufactured with a continuous red stripe down one side and are secured to the grenades in such a manner that this stripe is radially out on both sides of the grenade with minimal twist between subsequent grenade attachments.
      <br/>
      Approximately 5 pounds tension in the rope should be maintained during attachment.
      <br/>
      The width of each individual attachment winding is approximately 0.3-0.4 inches.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The automated whipping machine allows continuous attachments at a rate of one every five minutes.
      <br/>
      The whipping head rotates at 3 rps allowing the whipping operation to be completed in approximately 35 seconds, however, the hand insertion and clamping of the grenades, rope positioning and tensioning, thread starting, adhesive application, and thread trimming are all done manually.
      <br/>
      The unclamping and advancement of the whipped grenade to the forward (spacing) position is also a hand operation limiting the throughput of the prototype machine to five minutes per grenade.
      <br/>
      This is a significant improvement over the 15 minutes required with a hand-operated machine.

      The consistency of the attachments from the prototype automated winding machine can be seen in the first article (FA) samples (Table 3).

      The data clearly shows that the load capacity of the attachment is repeatable and can be easily adjusted by changing the number of wraps.

      A preferred setup utilizes two automated whipping machines with the capability of one attachment every minute.
      <br/>
      Achieving one grenade per minute can be accomplished by increasing the winding head speed to 5 rps, thus reducing whipping time to 20 seconds.

      That allows 40 seconds for automated grenade loading, advancing, thread handling and adhesive application.
