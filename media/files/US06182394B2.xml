      <br/>
      A plant watering device is disclosed which includes a planter tray having an upper surface for supporting potted plants.
      <br/>
      The planter tray has a plurality of legs depending downwardly from the upper surface with the upper surface located above a bottom wall of a water container.
      <br/>
      The water container has an open top, closed side walls and a closed bottom wall which define a reservoir to receive water or water mixed with plant food.
      <br/>
      The water container includes deep recessed pockets in the bottom wall of the water container positioned to receive and support the legs of the planter tray when the planter tray is in a lower watering position.
      <br/>
      The water container also includes shallow recessed pockets in the bottom wall of said water container positioned to receive and support the legs of the planter tray when the planter tray is in an upper drainage position.
      <br/>
      When the planter tray is manually moved to the lower watering position, potted plants supported on the planter tray are partially submersed to allow watering thereof.
      <br/>
      When the planter tray is manually moved to the upper drainage position, potted plants supported on the planter tray are located completely above the liquid.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="25">
      Referring specifically to FIGS. 1 through 3, the present invention includes a planter tray 10 having an upper surface 12 which is adapted to support potted plants.
      <br/>
      A plurality of legs 14, 16 depend downwardly from the upper surface.
      <br/>
      The planter tray is sized and configured to be received and supported by the legs in a manner whereby the upper surface 12 is located above the bottom wall 56 of a water container 50 (See FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      The planter tray 10 has a plurality of holes 20 provided in the upper surface 12 thereof.
      <br/>
      Said holes 20 are sized to provide access to human fingers to allow positioning and moving of the planter tray 10.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the planter tray 10 has a generally square configuration with legs 14 depending downwardly at each corner.
      <br/>
      At least one center leg 16 located near the center of the planter tray is also provided to provide additional support for the potted plants placed on the upper surface 12 of the planter tray 10.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      As best shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, the plurality of channels 30, 32, 40 are formed into the upper surface 12 to provide additional structural strength to said upper surface.
      <br/>
      These channels also serve as drainage channels.
      <br/>
      As shown, a plurality of drainage channels 30, 40 extend radially outward from the center of the upper surface 12.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, a drain opening 44 is provided at the center of the upper surface 12 in a drainage channel 40.
      <br/>
      The center leg 16 provides support for the upper surface yet allows liquid to pass therethrough by the provision of slots 48 in the bottom of the leg 16.
      <br/>
      These slots 48 create four extending projections 46 which contact the bottom wall 56 of the water container 50.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In addition to the drainage channels 30, 40 which extend radially outward from the center of the upper surface, a plurality of additional drainage channels 32 are provided at locations parallel to the outside perimeter edges of the upper surface 12 of the planter tray.
      <br/>
      As best shown in FIG. 3, drainage channels 30 and 32 are small or shallow drainage channels whereas drainage channels 40 are large and deeper.
      <br/>
      The small drainage channels 30, 32 empty into the large drainage channels 40.
      <br/>
      Water collected in large drainage channels 40 empties from the upper surface through opening 44 into the water container 50.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, the water container 50 is shown.
      <br/>
      Water container 50 includes an open top 52, closed side walls 54 and a closed bottom wall 56 which define a reservoir to receive liquid.
      <br/>
      The water container 50 is sized to receive the planter tray 10 in one of two positions, either an upper drainage position or in a lower watering position.
      <br/>
      Preferably, handles 55 are formed in at least two opposite side walls 54, as shown.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The planter tray shown in FIGS. 1 through 3 includes five legs.
      <br/>
      Correspondingly, the water container 50 includes five lower supporting means 70 and five upper supporting means 80 adapted to receive the legs of 14, 16 of the planter tray 10.
      <br/>
      As best shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the lower supporting means 70 are located in the bottom wall 56 of the water container 50 and are located at a first lower elevational position.
      <br/>
      The lower supporting means 70 are adapted to receive and support the legs 14, 16 of the planter tray 10 such that such planter tray is positioned in a lower watering position.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The upper supporting means 80 are also located in the bottom wall 56 of the water container 50 but are located at a second upper elevational position.
      <br/>
      The upper supporting means 80 are adapted to receive and support the legs 14, 16 of the planter tray 10 such that the planter tray is positioned in an upper position.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The relative depth of the lower supporting means 70 and the upper supporting means 80 are designed such that when the planter tray 50 is manually moved to the lower position, potted plants supported on the planter tray 10 will be partially submersed in liquid allowing watering thereof.
      <br/>
      When the planter tray is manually moved to the upper drainage position, the potted plants supported on the planter tray 10 will be located completely above the liquid.
      <br/>
      The water container 50 is preferably filled with a liquid consisting of either water or water mixed with plant food to the fill line 60 (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Both the lower supporting means 70 and the upper supporting means 80 are integrally formed in the water container 50.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 6 shows the planter tray 10 as aligned above the water container 50.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 7, 8 and 9, in use, it will be obvious that while a potted plant P is positioned in the center of the planter tray 10, a user may simply insert his or her fingers into the openings 20 to manually move the upper planter tray 10 from an upper drainage position (wherein the legs 14, 16 are supported by upper supporting means 80 as shown in FIG. 8) to a lower watering position (wherein said legs 14, 16 are supported in said lower supporting means 70 as shown in FIG. 9).
      <br/>
      Once the potted plant has been allowed to receive a sufficient amount of water W or plant food by means of water entering the potted plant through one or more holes provided in the base thereof, the planter tray 10 is then manually moved back to the upper drainage position as shown in FIG. 8.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that rather than have the lower supporting means provided at a location beneath the bottom wall of the water container, that such lower supporting means could be provided at the same elevational position as the bottom of the container.
      <br/>
      With such an arrangement the lower supporting means could be provided at an elevational position essentially coplaner with the bottom wall of the water container and the upper supporting means would be provided at an elevational location above the bottom wall of the water container.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, it is possible for the bottom wall of the water container to be positioned at a lower elevational position allowing for a greater volume of water with the same height of wall members as exist with the preferred embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      FIG. 10 shows an alternative form of the present invention which has a generally circular form.
      <br/>
      All numbered components have the same numbers as in the preceding Figures but are designated prime numbers.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      FIG. 11 and 12 show an alternative form of the present invention which has a generally hexagonal form.
      <br/>
      All numbered components have the same numbers as in the preceding Figures but are designated double prime numbers.
      <br/>
      Various other shapes and forms of the present invention will be obvious to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      From the foregoing, a simple, inexpensive yet effective plant watering device has been shown and described.
      <br/>
      The device preferably consists of only two component parts which can be easily formed by injection molding techniques, preferably from a recycled plastic material.
      <br/>
      The plant watering device of the present invention is particularly useful for plants which rest upon desks or tables.
      <br/>
      Because the plant watering device is designed to have a low elevational profile, the device does not detract from the beauty of the potted plant which it is adapted to support.
