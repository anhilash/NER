    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a bag for a bag-in-box ("BIB") type package, and more particularly relates to a spout with evacuation channels formed therein for use in a BIB package.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      BIB packages are well known for containing and dispensing liquids such as syrup for post-mix soft drink dispensers.
      <br/>
      Such known packages include an outer protective and supporting box and an inner collapsible bag containing the syrup.
      <br/>
      The box is generally made of corrugated cardboard and the bag is generally made of a flexible plastic.
      <br/>
      The plastic bag has a spout for feeding the syrup to the post-mix beverage dispenser via a hose and a pump.
      <br/>
      A plastic dip strip or dip tube is often included within the bag to assist in withdrawing the syrup.
      <br/>
      The dip strip prevents the bag from collapsing upon itself while the syrup is being withdrawn and provides a fluid passageway to the spout from the far reaches of the bag.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      An example of a bag-in-box bag with a ribbed dip strip therein is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,749,493 to Boone, et al., owned by The Coca-Cola Company, the assignee of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This reference describes, among other things, a ribbed dip strip sealed between the upper and lower bag walls at the top and bottom ends.
      <br/>
      The ribbed dip strip largely prevents the bag from collapsing upon itself and also provides the fluid passageway to the spout.
      <br/>
      The positioning of the dip strip apart from the spout also permits high speed filling. U.S. Pat. No. 5,749,493 is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the pending applications referenced above also describe, among other things, various types of bags for bag-in-box type packages using a ribbed dip strip and various methods for their use and manufacture.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In addition to the use of a dip strip to provide a fluid passageway to the spout, other known references use a raised spout to ensure access to and through the spout.
      <br/>
      For example, commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 4,998,990 to Richter, et al., shows a spout with a series of fins or vertical ribs positioned within the aperture that are used with one or more open channels to provide a fluid passageway.
      <br/>
      These fins or ribs are used to provide a certain amount of clearance between the spout and either the dip strip or the lower bag wall.
      <br/>
      This clearance allows the bag to be evacuated even as the upper and lower bag walls are collapsing upon themselves as the bag is being emptied.
      <br/>
      The raised spout design, however, adds extra bulk and materials to the bag as a whole. U.S. Pat. No. 4,998,990 is incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      What is needed, therefore, is a spout design that provides an adequate fluid passageway without the use of the extra material and the extra height associated with the raised spout or similar designs.
      <br/>
      The passageway should be operable while the bag is collapsing and otherwise and should communicate with the dip strip.
      <br/>
      Further, there is a need for a spout design that provides a plurality of fluid passageways to the aperture of the spout regardless of the orientation or position of the bag.
      <br/>
      Such a spout must provide the plurality of fluid passageways with a minimum of material and cost.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      Referring now in more detail to the drawings, in which like numerals refer to like parts throughout the several views, FIGS. 1 and 2 show a spout 100 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The spout 100 includes an extended flange 110 surrounding the lower portion of a vertically extending tube 120.
      <br/>
      The tube 120 is substantially hollow and creates an aperture 130.
      <br/>
      The spout 110 further includes one or more mounting flanges 140 surrounding the tube 120.
      <br/>
      The mounting flanges 140 are used to convey the spout 100 to the proper fill position in the filling process (not shown).
      <br/>
      The spout 100 may further include an upper lip 150.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The flange 110 includes a top side 160 and a bottom side 170.
      <br/>
      The top side 160 is generally flat and smooth.
      <br/>
      The bottom side 170 includes a plurality of evacuation channels 180 formed therein.
      <br/>
      The evacuation channels 180 may be of any functional thickness.
      <br/>
      By way of example, the evacuation channels 180 may be approximately 0.030 inches deep in a flange 110 of approximately 0.060 inches thick.
      <br/>
      Although FIG. 1 shows the evacuation channels 180 formed within the flange 110, the evacuation channels 180 also could be formed by a series of raised ribs or by other conventional means that provide a fluid passageway to the aperture 130.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Each of the evacuation channels 180 extends radially from the outer edge or the outer diameter of the flange 110 towards the aperture 130 or the inner diameter.
      <br/>
      The evacuation channels 180 generally surround the aperture 130.
      <br/>
      Any number of evacuation channels 180 may be used.
      <br/>
      For example, approximately thirty (30) equally spaced evacuation channels 180 may be used in a flange 110 of approximately two and one-half inches (21/2") in diameter.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The spout 100 is generally manufactured from a thermoplastic material, including PET (polyethylene terephthalate), low density polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene, polypropylene, or other types of substantially rigid plastics.
      <br/>
      The spout 100 is preferably injection molded, but also can be manufactured by stamping or other conventional types of plastic manufacturing known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Although the spout 100 is preferably a unitary piece, the flange 110, the tube 120, the mating flanges 140, and the lip 150 could be manufactured separately and physically attached by conventional means fastening means.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      FIGS. 3 and 4 show a drainage valve 200 that is generally used with the spout 100.
      <br/>
      The drainage valve 200 is positioned within the aperture 130 of the spout 100.
      <br/>
      The drainage valve 200 generally includes a hollow tube 210, with a series of anchoring ribs 220 positioned about the tube 210.
      <br/>
      The anchoring ribs 220 anchor the drainage valve 200 within the aperture 130 of the spout 100.
      <br/>
      Drainage valve 200 also may include a handling flange 230.
      <br/>
      The handling flange 230 is used to assist in coupling the spout 100 to the hose of a post-mix dispenser (not shown) and to install or remove the drainage valve 200 from the spout 100.
      <br/>
      The handling flange 230 may be somewhat scalloped to permit easy grasping and use.
      <br/>
      The tube 210 also may include cap threads 240 so as to mate with a cap 250.
      <br/>
      Within the tube 210 is an internal valve 260 with a series of apertures 270 so as to control the flow of liquid through the spout 100.
      <br/>
      The drainage valve 200 is generally made from the same types of plastic material and in a similar manner as with the spout 100.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      FIGS. 5 and 6 show the use of the spout 100 in a bag 300 for use in a bag-in-box package.
      <br/>
      The bag 300 includes a ribbed dip strip 310.
      <br/>
      The dip strip 310 includes plurality of ribs 315 that form a plurality of fluid passageways 320.
      <br/>
      The bag 300 further includes a pair of bag walls 330 joined together at a plurality of seams 340.
      <br/>
      One or more ends 350 of the dip strip 310 are preferably sealed within the seams 340.
      <br/>
      The dip strip 310 also may be connected to one of the bag walls 330 at one or more contact points 360.
      <br/>
      The preferred construction of the bag 300 is described in detail in commonly-owned Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/089,151, incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      The spout 100 itself is joined to one of the bag walls 330 along the top side 160 of the flange 110.
      <br/>
      The spout 100 is joined to one of the bag walls 330 by heat sealing or by other conventional methods to form a substantially liquid tight seal.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In use, the evacuation channels 180 of the spout 100 insure that fluid can pass from the interior of the bag 300 through the flange 110 and out of aperture 130.
      <br/>
      The evacuation channels 180 of the spout 100 may be in communication with the fluid passageways 320 of the dip strip 310 so as to permit fluid to travel along the dip strip 310 and out of the spout 100 even as the bag 300 is collapsing.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Further, because the evacuation channels 180 encircle the spout 100, the evacuation channels 180 provide a plurality of fluid passageways through the spout 100 in any direction regardless of the orientation or position of the bag 300.
      <br/>
      Even as the bag 300 begins to collapse, the evacuation channels 180 permit fluid to pass through the flange 110 and out of the aperture 130.
      <br/>
      The evacuation channels 180 thus provide a fluid passageway to and through the spout 100 without the use of extended ribs or other structures that require additional materials and costs.
