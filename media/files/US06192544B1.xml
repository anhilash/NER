      Toothbrush having a peripheral cushioning bumper for preventing impact injury to the teeth and gums of a person using it.
      <br/>
      The bumper consists of a body of resilient material mounted in a peripheral groove in the side edge of the head of the brush.
      <br/>
      In some disclosed embodiments, the resilient body is a ring that passes through a tunnel at the base of the head, which prevents the ring from being dislodged and lost or swallowed.
      <br/>
      In one such embodiment, the head of the brush is formed in two sections, and the bumper is an O-ring which is placed in the groove before the two sections are joined together.
      <br/>
      In another, the ring is molded in place on the brush.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      As illustrated in FIGS. 1-5, the toothbrush has an elongated handle 16 and a head 17 which extends from one end of the handle.
      <br/>
      The handle and head are fabricated of a relatively rigid material such as a hard plastic.
      <br/>
      A plurality of bristles 18 extend from the front face of the head, and a resilient O-ring 19 projects laterally from the side edge 21 of the head to protect the teeth and gums of a person using the brush from injury due to impact with the relatively hard head.
      <br/>
      The O-ring is fabricated of a material such a synthetic rubber (e.g., Viton.RTM.) with a durometer rating, or hardness, on the order of 50.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The O-ring is mounted in a peripheral groove 22 which extends along the side edge of the head, with the ends of the groove 23, 24 adjacent to the sides of the handle 26, 27 at the base of the head.
      <br/>
      The O-ring also passes through a tunnel 28 of circular cross-section which extends through the base of the head between the ends of the groove and forms a continuous path with the groove.
      <br/>
      As best seen in FIG. 3, the head has a generally rectangular shape, with a semicircular outer end, and the tunnel extends in an arcuate direction at the base end of the head, with the O-ring extending along a semicircular path at that end as well.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Head 17 is formed in two parts--a front section 31 which is formed integrally with handle 16 and a retaining plate 32 which is mounted on the back side of the front section.
      <br/>
      Section 31 is of lesser thickness than the handle, and the two parts together have an overall thickness equal to that of the handle.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Front section 31 has a front face 33 from which the bristles extend and a boss 34 which extends rearwardly behind the face.
      <br/>
      The boss has a rounded rectangular body 36 with straight sides and semicircular ends 37, 38. O-ring groove 22 extends peripherally about the boss, and has a generally semicircular cross-section.
      <br/>
      A rearwardly facing, generally planar step 41 is formed between the outer end of the handle and the boss, with the surface of the step being coplanar with the centerline of groove 22.
      <br/>
      The upper edge of the step has a curvature corresponding to the curved end of the boss, and a quarter round groove 42 extends along the upper edge and connects with groove 22 to form a three-quarters round section of groove at the lower end of the boss.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment illustrated, the thickness of the step is approximately one-half the thickness of the handle.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Retaining plate 32 has a relatively thin main section 43 positioned to the rear of boss 34 and a thicker section 44 behind step 41.
      <br/>
      The upper edge 45 of section 44 is curved to match the semicircular curvature of the lower end 38 of the boss, and has a quarter round groove 46 formed in it.
      <br/>
      That groove aligns with the three-quarters round section of groove at the lower edge of the boss to form tunnel 28.
      <br/>
      The rear surface 47 of the plate is generally planar and is aligned with the rear surface 48 of the handle to form a smooth continuous body.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The outer edges 49, 50 of front face 33 and rear plate 32 are rounded to give the side edge of the head a generally semicircular curvature, which blends well with the O-ring projecting from it.
      <br/>
      The O-ring typically has a cross-sectional diameter on the order of 3/32 inch, and when installed in the semicircular groove projects a distance on the order of at least 3/64 inch beyond the side edge of the head.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The toothbrush is assembled by placing O-ring in the groove on the boss.
      <br/>
      The rear plate is then permanently affixed to the front section of the head by cementing or otherwise bonding it in place.
      <br/>
      As noted above, the plate extends across the portion of the groove in the lower end of the boss, completing the tunnel and preventing the O-ring from becoming dislodged from the head.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In use, the resilient O-ring projects laterally from the side edge of the head and protects the teeth and gums from injury due to impact with the relatively hard head of the brush.
      <br/>
      The O-ring can be removed from the groove for cleaning without danger of being lost since it is permanently linked to the head by the tunnel.
      <br/>
      With the ring anchored in this manner, there is no danger that it will become dislodged or swallowed when the brush is in use.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 6-11, the toothbrush has an elongated handle 51 with a head 52 extending from the outer end of the handle.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the handle and the head are formed a unitary structure of a relatively rigid material such as a hard plastic.
      <br/>
      A plurality of bristles 53 extend from the front face 54 of the head, and a ring of resilient material 56 projects laterally from the side edge 57 of the head to protect the teeth and gums from injury due to impact with the relatively hard head.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The ring is mounted in a peripheral groove 58 which extends along the side edge of the head, with the ends of the groove 59, 61 adjacent to the sides of the handle 62, 63 at the base of the head.
      <br/>
      The ring also passes through a tunnel 64 of semicircular cross-section which extends in an arcuate direction through the base of the head between the ends of the groove.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Ring 56 is formed of an elastomeric material such as Viton.RTM. which is molded in place on the head of the brush, filling groove 58 and tunnel 64 and projecting from the side edge 57 in the form of a semicircular bead 65.
      <br/>
      Groove 58 has a dovetail shape, with a flat bottom wall 66 and inwardly and outwardly inclined side walls 67 which lock the ring in place on the head.
      <br/>
      The groove preferably has a depth on the order of at least 3/64 inch, and the semicircular bead has a diameter on the order of at least 3/32 inch, giving the ring an overall thickness of at least 3/32 inch from the bottom of the groove to the outer edge of the bead.
      <br/>
      With a durometer rating, or hardness, on the order of 50, this amount of cushioning has been found to provide good protection against injury to the teeth and gums due to impact with the head of the brush.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      As in the embodiment of FIGS. 1-5, the side edge 57 of the head of the toothbrush has a generally semicircular curvature which blends well with the ring projecting from it.
      <br/>
      With the dovetail groove and the tunnel, there is no danger that the ring will become dislodged or swallowed.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 12-17, the toothbrush has an elongated handle 71 with a head 72 extending from the outer end of the handle.
      <br/>
      As in the embodiment of FIGS. 6-11, the handle and the head are formed a unitary structure of a relatively rigid material such as a hard plastic.
      <br/>
      A plurality of bristles 73 extend from the front face 74 of the head, and a resilient bumper 76 projects laterally from the side edge 77 of the head to protect the teeth and gums from injury due to impact with the relatively hard head.
    </p>
    <p num="27">The bumper is mounted in a peripheral groove 78 which extends along the side edge of the head, with the ends of the groove 79, 81 being conically tapered near the sides of the handle 82, 83 at the base of the head.</p>
    <p num="28">
      Bumper 76 is formed of an elastomeric material such as Viton.RTM. which is molded in place on the head of the brush, filling groove 78 and projecting from the side edge 77 in the form of a semicircular bead 85.
      <br/>
      Groove 78 is semicircular in cross-section, and preferably has a diameter or depth on the order of at least 3/64 inch.
      <br/>
      The bumper is circular in cross-section and preferably has a diameter of at least 3/32 inch so that it projects from the edge of the head by a distance of at least 3/64 inch.
      <br/>
      With a durometer rating, or hardness, on the order of 50, a bumper having these dimensions has been found to provide good protection against injury to the teeth and gums due to impact with the head of the brush.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In one presently preferred embodiment, handle 71 and head 72 are fabricated of a relatively hard thermoplastic material, and bumper 76 is fabricated of a thermoplastic elastomer such as an Engage polyolefin elastomer manufactured by DuPont Dow Elastomers as an 8180 grade material having a Shore A hardness, or durometer reading, of 66.
      <br/>
      The elastomer is injected into a mold in hot liquid form under pressure to fill groove 78 and the surrounding cavity to form the bumper.
      <br/>
      When the hot elastomer is injected, some melting of the thermoplastic material which forms the head occurs along the groove, and the two thermoplastic materials flow together, forming a strong, permanent bond between the bumper and the head, whereby the bumper is fused to the head.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Many toothbrushes are currently being manufactured with handles covered with an injection molded elastomer, such as an Engage polyolefin, and a protective bumper according to the invention can be added to the heads of these brushes during the molding process with no increase in the processing time and only minor alteration of the molds or tooling.</p>
    <p num="31">
      As in the embodiments of FIGS. 1-5 and 6-11, the side edge 77 of the head of the toothbrush has a generally semicircular curvature which blends well with the ring projecting from it.
      <br/>
      With the bumper bonded integrally to the head, there is no danger that it will become dislodged or swallowed.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In each of the disclosed embodiments, the manner in which the brush is constructed and the protective ring is installed represents a significant improvement over prior art devices with relatively thin cushions or O-rings which can become dislodged and lost or swallowed.
      <br/>
      This structure also enables the brush to be manufactured economically and easily.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      It is apparent from the foregoing that a new and improved toothbrush and method of manufacture have been provided.
      <br/>
      While only certain presently preferred embodiments have been described in detail, as will be apparent to those familiar with the art, certain changes and modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the following claims.
