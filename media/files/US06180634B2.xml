    <p num="1">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/065,421, filed Nov. 13, 1997 and U.S. provisional Application No. 60/090,940, filed Jun. 26, 1998.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention provides combination therapy for the treatment of HIV infection and AIDS.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the combination comprises an HIV protease inhibitor, Compound A, with one or more nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or protease inhibitors.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      A retrovirus designated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiological agent of the complex disease that includes progressive destruction of the immune system (acquired immune deficiency syndrome; AIDS) and degeneration of the central and peripheral nervous system.
      <br/>
      This virus was previously known as LAV, HTLV-III, or ARV.
      <br/>
      A common feature of retrovirus replication is the extensive post-translational processing of precursor polyproteins by a virally encoded protease to generate mature viral proteins required for virus assembly and function.
      <br/>
      Inhibition of this processing prevents the production of normally infectious virus.
      <br/>
      For example, Kohl, N. E. et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad.
      <br/>
      Sci., 85, 4686 (1988), demonstrated that genetic inactivation of the HIV encoded protease resulted in the production of immature, non-infectious virus particles.
      <br/>
      These results indicate that inhibition of the HIV protease represents a viable method for the treatment of AIDS and the prevention or treatment of infection by HIV.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Nucleotide sequencing of HIV shows the presence of a pol gene in one open reading frame �Ratner, L. et al., Nature, 313, 277 (1985)�. Amino acid sequence homology provides evidence that the pol sequence encodes reverse transcriptase, an endonuclease and an HIV protease �Toh, H. et al., EMBO J., 4, 1267 (1985); Power, M. D. et al., Science, 231, 1567 (1986); Pearl, L. H. et al., Nature, 329, 351 (1987)�.</p>
    <p num="5">The compound N-(2(R)-hydroxy-1(S)-indanyl)-2(R)-phenylmethyl-4-(S)-hydroxy-5-(1-(4-(2-benzo�b�furanylmethyl)-2(S)-N'-(t-butylcarboxamido)-piperazinyl))-pentaneamide disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,646,148, issued Jul. 8, 1997, and referred to herein as "Compound A," is a potent inhibitor of HIV protease and is useful in the prevention of infection by HIV, the treatment of infection by HIV and the treatment of AIDS or ARC (AIDS related complex), without significant side effects or toxicity.  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="6">
      One substantial and persistent problem in the treatment of AIDS has been the ability of the HIV virus to develop resistance to the individual therapeutic agents employed to treat the disease.
      <br/>
      Thus, a need remains for an efficacious and long lasting therapy for AIDS which lowers HIV viral levels of patients to undetectable levels and raises CD4 cell counts for prolonged periods of time without the development of resistance.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide a combination therapy which lowers HIV viral levels below the limit of detection.
      <br/>
      It is another object of the invention to increase the count of CD4 cells for prolonged periods of time.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is an object of the invention to achieve both of these favorable results for extended periods of time without the development of resistance to the therapies.

    <p num="7">
      Applicants have discovered that the combinations of this invention are effective inhibitors of HIV protease.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">The instant invention involves a composition comprising Compound A of the formula  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="9">and one or more antiretroviral agents selected from Zidovudine, Lamivudine, Stavudine, DMP-266, Ritonavir, Nelfinavir, Abacavir, Indinavir, 141-W94, Delavirdine, or Saquinavir; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters thereof.</p>
    <p num="10">In one embodiment of the instant invention is the composition comprising Compound A and one, two, or three antiretroviral agents selected from Zidovudine, Lamivudine, Stavudine, DMP-266, Ritonavir, Nelfinavir, Abacavir, Indinavir, 141-W94, or Delavirdine; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters thereof.</p>
    <p num="11">In a class of the instant invention is the composition comprising Compound A and one or two of the above mentioned antiretroviral agents; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters thereof.</p>
    <p num="12">In a subclass of the instant invention is the composition comprising Compound A and one of the above mentioned antiretroviral agents.</p>
    <p num="13">Preferred embodiments of the instant invention include the compositions comprising: (1) Compound A, Zidovudine and Lamivudine; (2) Compound A, Stavudine and Lamivudine; (3) Compound A and DMP-266; (4) Compound A and Ritonavir; (5) Compound A and Nelfinavir; (6) Compound A and Abacavir; (7) Compound A and Indinavir; (8) Compound A and 141-W94; (9) Compound A and Delavirdine.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Another preferred embodiment of the invention is a composition comprising (a) Compound A or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof and (b) a compound selected from the group consisting of Indinavir, Ritonavir, Nelfinavir, Delavirdine, 141-W94, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof.
      <br/>
      Compound (b) is preferably selected from the group consisting of Indinavir, Ritonavir, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and is most preferably Indinavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred is the composition in which (a) is the sulfate salt of Compound A and (b) is the sulfate salt of Indinavir.
      <br/>
      It has been discovered that the foregoing compounds of (b), when employed in combination with Compound A, can increase the plasma concentration of Compound A to a level having substantial antiviral activity.
      <br/>
      Compound A is a potent protease inhibitor, exhibiting approximately two-fold greater potency than Indinavir against wild type HIV-1 and a similar potency with respect to other HIV-1 variants in in vitro assays (e.g., CIC95 of Compound A=25 nM against wild-type HIV-1 versus 50 nM of Indinavir, as determined by the Cell Spread Assay described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,646,148).
      <br/>
      It was unexpectedly found, however, that the administration of Compound A to humans resulted in very low plasma concentrations of Compound A relative to concentrations achieved from administration of comparable doses of Indinavir.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, pharmacokinetic studies in human subjects have resulted in significant inter-individual variation in the plasma levels of Compound A, a variation much greater than that observed for Indinavir.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The problems of low plasma concentration and of high inter-individual plasma level variation encountered with the administration of Compound A have been solved by the co-administration of Compound A with Indinavir.
      <br/>
      This solution was arrived at as a result of the following findings:
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      (i) Compound A has a low affinity for CYPIIIA4, the enzyme which metabolizes it; i.e., the IC50 of Compound A for in vitro inhibition of CYPIIIA4=30 micromolar.
      <br/>
      In contrast, Indinavir has a comparatively very high affinity for CYPIIIA4 (IC50=0.2 micromolar).
    </p>
    <p num="17">(ii) In addition to the unexpectedly very low plasma concentrations noted above for Compound A relative to those achieved with comparable doses of Indinavir, it was also unexpectedly found that the administration of successively higher doses of Compound A to humans resulted in greater than proportional increases in plasma concentrations.</p>
    <p num="18">
      These findings led to the theory that the very low plasma concentrations and high intersubject variability of Compound A achieved following administration to humans was due to extensive metabolism by CYPIIIA4 prior to entry of drug into the systemic circulation.
      <br/>
      This in turn led to the hypothesis that the concomitant administration of another compound with higher affinity for CYPIIIA4 such as Indinavir could inhibit the metabolism of Compound A to the degree that plasma concentrations of Compound A would be increased, thereby providing plasma concentrations of Compound A having substantial antiviral activity.
      <br/>
      While not wishing to be bound by the foregoing theory and hypothesis, it has in fact been discovered that use of Indinavir in combination with Compound A does substantially increase the plasma concentrations of Compound A and also markedly reduces inter-individual variation thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Ritonavir, Nelfinavir, Delavirdine, and 141-W94 can also act as inhibitors of CYPIIIA, and thus can inhibit the metabolism of Compound A, thereby resulting in increased plasma levels and reduced inter-individual variation for Compound A.</p>
    <p num="20">
      A further particularly preferred embodiment of the invention is a composition comprising (a) Compound A or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof and (b) Indinavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, wherein the composition has a weight ratio of Compound A to Indinavir ranging from about 15:1 to about 1:15.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the weight ratio of Compound A to Indinavir is from about 1:10 to about 10:1, or from about 8:1 to about 1:8, or from about 6:1 to about 1:6, or from about 4:1 to about 1:4, or from about 2:1 to about 1:2, or from about 1.5:1 to about 1:1.5.

      Since the instant invention refers to compositions comprising two or more agents, the "therapeutically effective amount" is that amount of the combination of the agents taken together so that the combined effect elicits the desired biological or medicinal response.
      <br/>
      For example, the therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising Compound A and DMP-266 would be the amount of Compound A and the amount of DMP-266 that when taken together have a combined effect that is therapeutically effective.
    </p>
    <p num="79">As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.</p>
    <p num="80">
      The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention (in the form of water- or oil-soluble or dispersible products) include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts which are formed, e.g., from inorganic or organic acids or bases.
      <br/>
      Examples of such acid addition salts include acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate, and undecanoate.

      Base salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine salts, N-methyl-D-glucamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and so forth.
      <br/>
      Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chloride, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl; and diamyl sulfates, long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides, aralkyl halides like benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others.
      <br/>
      Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the sulfate salt ethanolate and sulfate salts.

    <p num="81">
      The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the instant invention include the combination wherein one of the individual components is in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, the combination wherein all of the individual components are in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, the combination wherein one or more of the individual components is in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt while other of the components are used as the free base, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the combined components (i.e., a salt of the combination).
      <br/>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the sulfate salt of the combination is utilized.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      The pharmaceutically acceptable esters in the present invention refer to non-toxic esters, preferably the alkyl esters such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, or pentyl esters, of which the methyl ester is preferred.
      <br/>
      However, other esters such as phenyl-C1-5 alkyl may be employed if desired.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Esterification of alcohols, such as Compound A of the present invention, is performed by a variety of conventional procedures, including reacting the alcohol group with the appropriate anhydride, carboxylic acid or acid chloride.
      <br/>
      These reactions, as well as other methods of esterification of alcohols, are readily apparent to the skilled artisan.
    </p>
    <p num="84">Reaction of the alcohol with the appropriate anhydride is carried out in the presence of an acylation catalyst, such as 4-DMAP (4-dimethylaminopyridine, also known as N,N-dimethylaminopyridine), pyridine, or 1,8-bis�dimethylamino�napthalene.</p>
    <p num="85">
      Reaction of the alcohol with the appropriate carboxylic acid is carried out in the presence of a dehydrating agent and, optionally, an acylation catalyst.
      <br/>
      The dehydrating agent, which serves to drive the reaction by the removal of water is selected from dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1-�3-dimethylaminopropyl�-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) or other water soluble dehydrating agents.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      Alternatively, reaction of the alcohol with appropriate carboxylic acid can also result in esterification, if performed instead in the presence of trifluoroacetic anhydride, and, optionally, pyridine.
      <br/>
      A further variant is reacting the alcohol with appropriate carboxylic acid in the presence of N,N-carbonyldiimidazole with pyridine.
    </p>
    <p num="87">Reaction of the alcohol with the acid chloride is carried out with an acylation catalyst, such as 4-DMAP or pyridine.</p>
    <p num="88">
      Selective esterification of Compound A is performed by a variety of methods known to the skilled artisan.
      <br/>
      In one method, the alcohol is first esterified with a trichloroethyl derivative (e.g., mono-trichloroethyl succinate).
      <br/>
      After chromatographic isolation of the preferred ester, reductive elimination of the tricholoroethyl group is carried out by reaction with zinc dust in acetic acid.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, another method of selective esterification is the hydrolysis of the bis-ester.
    </p>
    <p num="89">It is understood that, unless expressly stated to the contrary or otherwise clear from the context, a reference to a compound per se employed in the combination of the present invention implicitly refers to the free compound, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable ester thereof.</p>
    <p num="90">
      The combination of compounds of the present invention is useful in the inhibition of HIV protease, the inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase, the prevention or treatment of infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the prevention or treatment of consequent pathological conditions such as AIDS.
      <br/>
      Treating AIDS or preventing or treating infection by HIV is defined as including, but not limited to, treating a wide range of states of HIV infection: AIDS, ARC, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, and actual or potential exposure to HIV.
      <br/>
      For example, the compounds of this invention are useful in treating infection by HIV after suspected past exposure to HIV by e.g., blood transfusion, exchange of body fluids, bites, accidental needle stick, or exposure to patient blood during surgery.
    </p>
    <p num="91">For these purposes, the combinations of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally (including subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques), by inhalation spray, or rectally, in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles.</p>
    <p num="92">
      Thus, in accordance with the present invention there is further provided a method of treating and a pharmaceutical composition for treating HIV infection and AIDS.
      <br/>
      The treatment involves administering to a patient in need of such treatment a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutical carrier and a therapeutically effective amount of each compound in the combination of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="93">These pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of orally-administrable suspensions, capsules or tablets; nasal sprays; sterile injectable preparations, for example, as sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions or suppositories.</p>
    <p num="94">
      In accordance with the method of the present invention, the individual components of the combination can be administered separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently in divided or single combination forms.
      <br/>
      For example, in a two-component combination which is the HIV protease inhibitor, Compound A, and the non-nucleoside HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor, DMP-266, treatment with DMP-266 can commence prior to, subsequent to or concurrent with commencement of treatment with Compound A. The instant invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term "administering" is to be interpreted accordingly.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      In the method of the present invention, the combination of Compound A and Indinavir, and optionally with one or more of the other antiviral compounds (e.g., Saquinavir), are preferably administered concurrently in divided or single combination forms.
      <br/>
      In another preferred embodiment of the method of the invention is administration, preferably concurrent administration, of the combination of Compound A and Indinavir with food (e.g., a high-fat meal).
      <br/>
      The term "with food" means the consumption of a meal either during or no more than about one hour before or after administration of the combination of Compound A with one or more of the other antiviral compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      When administered orally as a suspension, these compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may contain microcrystalline cellulose for imparting bulk, alginic acid or sodium alginate as a suspending agent, methylcellulose as a viscosity enhancer, and sweeteners/flavoring agents known in the art.
      <br/>
      As immediate release tablets, these compositions may contain microcrystalline cellulose, dicalcium phosphate, starch, magnesium stearate and lactose and/or other excipients, binders, extenders, disintegrants, diluents and lubricants known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="97">When administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation, these compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art.</p>
    <p num="98">The injectable solutions or suspensions may be formulated according to known art, using suitable non-toxic, parenterally-acceptable diluents or solvents, such as mannitol, 1,3-butanediol, water, Ringer's solution or isotonic sodium chloride solution, or suitable dispersing or wetting and suspending agents, such as sterile, bland, fixed oils, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides, and fatty acids, including oleic acid.</p>
    <p num="99">When rectally administered in the form of suppositories, these compositions may be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient, such as cocoa butter, synthetic glyceride esters or polyethylene glycols, which are solid at ordinary temperatures, but liquidify and/or dissolve in the rectal cavity to release the drug.</p>
    <p num="100">
      The oral administration of a composition comprising Compound A and Indinavir, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester of either or both, is suitably accomplished by uniformly and intimately blending together a suitable amount of each compound in the form of a powder, optionally also including a finely divided solid carrier, and encapsulating the blend in, for example, a hard gelatin capsule.
      <br/>
      The solid carrier can include one or more substances which act as binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, coloring agents, and the like.
      <br/>
      Suitable solid carriers include, for example, calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine, low melting waxes and ion exchange resins.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      Oral administration of a composition comprising a combination of Compound A and Indinavir in suitable proportions can also be accomplished by preparing capsules or tablets containing the desired amount of Compound A only, optionally blended with a solid carrier as described above, and capsules containing the desired amount of Indinavir only (e.g., CRIXIVAN.RTM. capsules).
      <br/>
      Compressed tablets containing Compound A can be prepared by uniformly and intimately mixing the active ingredient with a solid carrier such as described above to provide a mixture having the necessary compression properties, and then compacting the mixture in a suitable machine to the shape and size desired.
      <br/>
      Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine, a mixture of powdered Compound A moistened with an inert liquid diluent.
      <br/>

      A double-blind, single-rising dose, alternating two-panel, four-period, placebo-controlled study was conducted for Compound A alone and in combination with Indinavir in healthy adult males in the fasted state.
      <br/>
      In Panel A, each subject received an oral dose of 1600 mg of Compound A, or placebo, in the first period; followed in the next period by a 200-mg single oral dose of Compound A, or placebo, co-administered with a single 800-mg oral dose of Indinavir; followed by 400 mg of Compound A, or placebo, plus 800 mg of Indinavir in the third period; and then by 200 mg of Compound A, or placebo, plus 1200 mg of Indinavir in the fourth period.
      <br/>
      In Panel B, each subject received an oral dose of 2000 mg of Compound A, or placebo, in the first period; followed in the next period by a 600-mg single oral dose of Compound A, or placebo; followed by 600 mg of Compound A, or placebo, plus 800 mg of Indinavir in the third period; and then by 600 mg of Compound A, or placebo, in the fourth period.
      <br/>
      All of the doses of Compound A were administered as the sulfate salt form of Compound A. All of the Compound A doses were oral suspensions of the sulfate salt form in sterile water, except that the 600-mg doses administered to Panel B in the fourth period were tablets.
      <br/>
      Indinavir was administered in the form of CRIXIVAN.RTM. capsules.

      A comparison of the results in Table 2 and Table 3 shows that the co-administration of Indinavir with Compound A substantially increased the Compound A plasma levels.
      <br/>
      The AUC of Compound A was about 30 *  higher for the co-administration of 200 mg of Compound A with 800 mg of Indinavir relative to the administration of 200 mg of Compound A alone.
      <br/>
      Cmax and C8 hrs were also substantially higher; i.e., about 19 *  and 46 *  higher respectively.
      <br/>
      In the panel receiving 600 mg of Compound A in combination with 800 mg of Indinavir, the AUC was about 18-fold higher than for administration of Compound A alone.
      <br/>
      In addition to increasing the Compound A plasma levels, co-administration with Indinavir also reduced variability in the Compound A levels.
      <br/>
      The coefficients of variation for the AUCs in Table 2 range from 54 to 124%, whereas they range from 8 to 30% in the combination arms in Table 3.
