    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Technical Field
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates to an improved method for purifying neurotrophins, particularly those in the NGF-family, more particularly nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) from variants, impurities, and contaminants associated therewith, particularly when produced by bacterial or mammalian cell fermentation.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Background</p>
    <p num="5">
      The production of large quantities of relatively pure, biologically active polypeptides and proteins is important economically for the manufacture of human and animal pharmaceutical formulations, enzymes, and other specialty chemicals.
      <br/>
      For production of many proteins, recombinant DNA techniques have become the method of choice because large quantities of exogenous proteins can be expressed in mammalian host cells and, bacteria, and other host cells.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The primary structure of a mammalian NGF (mouse NGF) was first elucidated by Angeletti and Bradshaw, Proc.
      <br/>
      Natil. Acad. Aci. USA 68:2417 (1971).
      <br/>
      The primary structure of its precursor, pre-pro-NGF, has been deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the mouse NGF cDNA (Scott et al.
      <br/>
      Nature 302:538 (1983); Ullrich et al.
      <br/>
      Nature 303:821 (1983)).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The homologous human NGF (hNGF) gene has also been identified (Ullrich, Symp. on Quan. Biol.,Cold Spring Harbor 48:435 (1983); U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,622, issued Feb. 22, 1994, which is incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      Its homology to the mouse NGF is about 90% and 87%, on the amino acid and nucleotide sequence levels, respectively.
      <br/>
      Due to the scarcity of naturally-occurring human NGF, it has not been prepared from natural sources in quantities sufficient to biochemically characterize in fine detail.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Additional neurotrophic factors related to NGF have since been identified.
      <br/>
      These include brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Leibrock, et al., Nature, 341:149-152 (1989)), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) (Kaisho, et al., FEBS Lett., 266:187 (1990); Maisonpierre, et al., Science, 247:1446 (1990); Rosenthal, et al., Neuron, 4:767 (1990)), and neurotrophin 4/5 (NT-4/5) (Berkmeier, et al., Neuron, 7:857-866 (1991)).
      <br/>
      GDNF, a distant member of the TGF- BETA  super family, and neurturin ("NTN") are two, recently identified, structurally related, potent survival factors for sympathetic sensory and central nervous system neurons (Lin et al. Science 260:1130-1132 (1993); Henderson el al.
      <br/>
      Science 266:1062-1064 (1994); Buj-Bello et al., Neuron 15:821-828 (1995); Kotzbauer et al.
      <br/>
      Nature 384:467-470 (1996)).
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Producing recombinant protein involves transfecting host cells with DNA encoding the protein and growing the cells under conditions favoring expression of the recombinant protein.
      <br/>
      The prokaryote E. coli is has been a favored host because it can be made to produce recombinant proteins in high yields at low cost.
      <br/>
      Numerous U.S. patents on general bacterial expression of DNA encoding proteins exist, including U.S. Pat. No. 4,565,785 on a recombinant DNA molecule comprising a bacterial gene for an extracellular or periplasmic carrier protein and non-bacterial gene; U.S. Pat. No. 4,673,641 on co-production of a foreign polypeptide with an aggregate-forming polypeptide; U.S. Pat. No. 4,738,921 on an expression vector with a trp promoter/operator and trp LE fusion with a polypeptide such as IGF-I; U.S. Pat. No. 4,795,706 on expression control sequences to include with a foreign protein; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,710,473 on specific circular DNA plasmids such as those encoding IGF-I.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Genetically engineered bio-pharmaceuticals are typically purified from a supernatant containing a variety of diverse host cell contaminants.
      <br/>
      NGF, in particular, has been reportedly purified to varying extent with varying degrees of effort and success using a number of different methods.
      <br/>

      These efforts have been primarily at laboratory scale.
    </p>
    <p num="11">However, preparative isolation of recombinant human NGF resulting in pharmaceutical purity and high yield, essentially free of variants, has eluded the art.</p>
    <p num="12">
      Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an efficient protocol for selectively separating neurotrophins, particularly NGF and NGF-family of neurotrophins, from their variants and other molecules, and from other polypeptides with high pI.
      <br/>
      The process of purifying neurotrophins at large scale should be applicable to starting material from varying sources, including fermentation broth, lysed bacterial or mammalian cells, to supply clinical needs.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, as the present inventors have discovered previously unknown, difficult-to-separate neurotrophin variants, for example NGF variants, the methods presented herein are particularly useful to provide commercially useful amounts of recombinant neurotrophins, including human NGF (rhNGF), rhNT-3, and rhNT-4/5 and desirable genetically engineered mutants thereof, that are substantially free of undesirable variants.
      <br/>
      These and other objects of the invention will now be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.

    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="13">
      In one embodiment of the invention a process for purifying a neurotrophin, particularly one in the NGF-family, including NGF, NT-3, NT-4/5, and BDNF which share recognition by a highly homologous family of receptors (trks), preferably rhNGF, rNT-3, rhNT-4/5, rhBDNF or desirable genetically engineered forms thereof, by the use of hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) is provided.
      <br/>
      In view of the discovery by the present inventors of certain undesirable neurotrophin variants arising from recombinant production of a neurotrophin, as reported herein, the use of HIC can separate chemically different or even misfolded forms of a neurotrophin from the desired correctly folded, intact neurotrophin.
      <br/>
      Variants that can be removed are those that differ from the mature, correctly folded neurotrophin in hydrophobicity, including partially processed precursor sequences, glycosylated mature and precursor-containing forms (when present from eukaryotic cell culture), and misfolded and partially folded variants (generally from bacterial cell culture when in vitro folding steps are used).
      <br/>
      For example, HIC is particularly useful to remove partially processed precursor sequences of NGF, glycosylated species of NGF and precursor (when present from eukaryotic cell culture), and misfolded and partially folded variants (generally from bacterial cell culture and in vitro folding steps) from mixtures of mature NGF.
      <br/>
      NGF has one N-linked glycosylation site at Asn45.
      <br/>
      In the case of bacteria-expressed, refolded rhNT-4/5, HIC separates correctly folded NT-4/5 from incorrectly folded forms.
      <br/>
      As a result of the process described herein the neurotrophin is essentially free of these variants.
      <br/>
      For neurotrophin purification, preferably the HIC resin functional group is a phenyl group, while octyl and butyl groups can be useful.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred embodiments include HIC resins Phenyl Toyopearl, Phenyl Sepharose Fast Flow Low Substitution, TSK-Phenyl 5PW, or the like.

    </p>
    <p num="15">In yet another embodiment of the invention both HIC and cation-exchange chromatography are used to prepare a composition of a desired neurotrophin, for example recombinant mature NGF, preferably human NGF, that is substantially homogenous, i.e., substantially free of both process and charge variants, e.g. misfolded and chemical variants, and is also substantially pure with regard to protein content.</p>

      <br/>
      More preferably the NGF is the 120/120 or 118/118 homodimer form.
      <br/>
      As a result of the process described herein the neurotrophin is most preferably essentially free of variants.
    </p>
    <p num="17">In another embodiment a process for purifying neurotrophins, particularly those of the NGF-family, from related variants using elution conditions involving physiological pH is provided.</p>

      <br/>
      The neurotrophin is most preferably rhNGF.
    </p>
    <p num="25">In one embodiment of the invention is provided a silica gel chromatography step that efficiently removes host cell proteins from the neurotrophin fraction, which is preferably an NGF fraction.</p>

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="28">
      FIG. 1 depicts an SP-Sepharose HP chromatogram. An NGF-containing mixture from a 12 kL fermentation, after HIC chromatography, was loaded onto a SP-Sepharose High Performance resin (column dimension 1.0 * 35 cm; a 27.5 ml bed volume) of 25 omnifit SPSHP resin. Buffer A was 0.2 M NaCl, 20 mM succinate, pH 6.0 (23 ms). Buffer B was 0.7M NaCl, 20 mM Succinate, pH 6.0 (63 ms). The column was first equilibrated in Buffer A. The HIC pool of 345 ml at 0.24 mg/ml was adjusted to 25 mM succinate, pH 6.0 (17 ms) of which 362 ml was loaded giving a 3 mg/ml resin load; 82.5 mg NGF was loaded. Load rate was 40 cm per hour. NGF was eluted using a 22 column volume gradient from 30% to 80% Buffer B (0.35 to 0.60 M NaCl; 37 to 57 ms). Elution rate was 60 cm per hour. Absorbance units (280 nm) and mS/cm were plotted versus fraction numbers and elution volume in ml. Fractions containing NGF were determined and pooled. In this case fractions 43 to 60 were pooled to obtain 99 ml sample at 0.38 mg/ml NGF, giving about a 46% recovery.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 depicts an SP-NPR HPLC cation-exchange (HPIEX) analysis of the Phenyl Sepharose Fast Flow pool and the SP-Sepharose HP pool. Chromatogram for each are marked.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 depicts an C4 RP-HPLC analysis of selected fractions (main pool, leading edge and trailing edge of main peak pool) from the SP-Sepharose HP chromatography step. The three signals are overlayed and are as marked. As can be seen, the main peak (containing mature NGF) is separated from several lesser peaks that contain variant NGFs.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 depicts the sequence of human prepro-NGF (SEQ ID NO: 1) . Indicated on the figure is the first amino acid of mature NGF (position 1) and the last amino acid of the 120 NGF form (position 120). A preferred NGF amino acid sequence is that of the mature 118 form (from position 1 to position 118). Also shown are variant forms: mature 120 (position 1 to position 120); mature 117 (position 1 to 117); R120 (position -1 to 120); and sites for other misprocessing that occurs at the N- and C-terminal ends, including mature 114 (amino acids 1 to 114), 115 (amino acids 1 to 115) and 117 (amino acids 1 to 117) variants. A major misprocessed variant, proteolytically misprocessed, has N-terminal cleavage between amino acids R(-39) and S(-38) in the pro sequence of NGF. The likely initiation Met are underlined. Other N-terminal variants include truncated forms of NGF, with the most common having cleavage occurring between amino acids H8 and R9 and between R9 and G10.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 depicts the amino acid sequences of neurotrophins human NGF (SEQ ID NO: 2), mouse NGF (SEQ ID NO: 3), BDNF (SEQ ID NO: 4), NT-3 (SEQ ID NO: 5) and NT-4/5 (SEQ ID NO: 6). The 15 boxed regions indicate the homologous cysteine-containing regions involved in the cysteine knot motif (De Young et al., Protein Sci. 5 (8): 1554-66 (1996)).
      <br/>

"NT-4/5 Std." indicates the elution pattern of a correctly folded, intact NT-4/5 used as a standard. The pattern marked "SSFF (0.5 m)" depicts the analysis of NT-4/5 eluted with 0.5M NaCl from the S-Sepharose Fast Flow column prior to refolding. As NT-4/5 refolds, the elution pattern approaches that of the standard.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 depicts a chromatogram showing separation of intact, correctly folded NT-4/5 from misfolded variants on a hydrophobic interaction chromatography column, Phenyl Toyopearl 650M column. Misfolded variants that are less hydrophobic than correctly folded NT-4/5 elute in the flow-through, while misfolded variants (Peak B) that are more hydrophobic elute at an organic solvent concentration higher than that needed to elute correctly folded NT-4/5 (Peak A).
      <br/>
      FIG. 11 depicts the elution pattern of NT-4/5 and variants from a cation exchange resin, SP-Sepharose. Absorbance at 280 nm was monitored.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="29">Definitions</p>
    <p num="30">
      As used herein, "neurotrophin" refers to a neurotrophin, preferably an NGF-family neurotrophin, including NGF, NT-3, NT-4/5, and BDNF, from any species, including murine, bovine, ovine, porcine, equine, avian, and preferably human, in native sequence or in a genetically engineered form, and from any source, whether natural, synthetic, or recombinantly produced.
      <br/>
      For example, "NGF" refers to nerve growth factor from any species, including murine, bovine, ovine, porcine, equine, avian, and preferably human, in native sequence or in genetically engineered variant form, and from any source, whether natural, synthetic, or recombinantly produced.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the neurotrophin is recombinantly produced.
      <br/>
      In a preferred method, the neurotrophin is cloned and its DNA expressed, e.g., in mammalian cells, in bacterial cells.
      <br/>
      The processes and methods taught herein can also be applied to the neurotrophins GDNF and neurturin.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Preferred for human use is human native-sequence, mature NGF, more preferably a 120 amino acid sequence, and even more preferably a 118 amino acid sequence.
      <br/>
      More preferably, this native-sequence NGF is recombinantly produced.
      <br/>
      The preferred amino acid sequence for human pre-pro-NGF and human mature NGF are provided by U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,622, which is specifically incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      The 120 amino acid form, without additional post-translational modifications, is a preferred form in the homodimer form (i.e., 120/120).
      <br/>
      Even more preferred is the 118 form, without additional post-translational modifications, particularly as a homodimer (i.e., 118/118).
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      By "substantially pure" is meant a degree of purity of total neurotrophin, e.g., NGF, to total protein where there is at least 70% neurotrophin, more preferably at least 80%, and even more preferably increasing to at least 90%, 95% or 99%.
      <br/>
      A particularly preferred purity is at least 95%.
      <br/>
      By "essentially pure" is meant that the composition is at least 90% or more pure for the desired neurotrophin.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      By "substantially free of neurotrophin variant" is meant a composition in which the percent of desired neurotrophin species to total neurotrophin (including less desirable neurotrophin species) is at least 70% desired neurotrophin species, more preferably at least 80%, and even more preferably increasing to at least 90%, 93%, 95% or 99%.
      <br/>
      By "essentially free" is meant that the composition contains at least 90% or more desired neurotrophin.
      <br/>
      A particularly preferred level is at least 95% desired neurotrophin, e.g., correctly folded, intact 118/118 rhNGF, species.
      <br/>
      The other undesirable species or forms may be misprocessed forms or chemical variants, e.g. altered charge variants, resulting from the fermentation or purification process, or preferably all of the foregoing, as disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      For example, when NGF is folded in vitro after synthesis in bacteria, "species" or "variants" can include misfolded or partially folded forms.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      By "misfolded" variant is meant a variant of the neurotrophin which differs from the neurotrophin by the pairing of its cysteine residues or by the particular cysteine residues which are free or blocked.
      <br/>
      Misfolded variants can also have the same cysteine pairing as the neurotrophin but have a different three dimensional conformation resulting from misfolding.
    </p>
    <p num="35">By "chemical" variant is meant a variant that differs chemically from the neurotrophin, for example by having an altered charge, by carbamylation, deamidation, oxidation, glycosylation, or proteolytic cleavage.</p>
    <p num="36">

    <p num="40">Modes for Carrying out the Invention</p>
    <p num="41">
      Neurotrophins belong to a family of small, basic proteins which play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system.
      <br/>
      The first identified and probably best understood member of this family is nerve growth factor (NGF).
      <br/>
      See U.S. Patent No. 5,169,762, issued Dec. 8, 1992. Recently, sequentially related but distinct polypeptides with similar functions to NGF have been identified.
      <br/>
      For example, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), also referred to as neurotrophin-2 (NT2), was cloned and sequenced by Leibrock et al.(Nature, 341: 49-152 �1989�).
      <br/>
      Several groups identified a neurotrophic factor originally called neuronal factor (NF), and now referred to as neurotrophin-3 (NT3). (Ernfors et al., Proc. NatL. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:5454-5458 �1990�; Hohn et al., Nature, 344:339 �1990�; Maisonpierre et al., Science, 247:1446 �1990�; Rosenthal et al., Neuron, 4:767 �1990�; Jones and Reichardt, Proc.
      <br/>
      Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:8060-8064 �1990�; Kaisho et al., FEBS Lett., 266:187 �1990�).
      <br/>
      Neurotrophin-4/5 (referred to as either NT4 or NT5) has been identified (Hallbook et al., Neuron, 6:845-858 �1991�; Berkmeier et al., Neuron, 7:857-866 �1991�; Ip et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA, 89: 3060-3064 �1992�). U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,769, issued Nov. 15, 1994, discloses human NT-4/5 and processes for its recombinant expression and is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Also reported are chimeric and pantropic neurotrophins, such as that reported in U.S. Pat. No. 5,488,099, issued Jan. 30, 1996, in Urfer et al., EMBO J 13(24):5896-909 (1994), and in WO 95/33829, published Dec. 1 1995 (incorporated herein by reference) in which the neurotrophin has been modified to bind to more than one receptor or contains a receptor binding activity not normally present to a significant degree in the native neurotrophin.
      <br/>
      Of particular interest are neurotrophins designated MNTS-1 and D15A NT3.
      <br/>
      Also of particular interest are neurotrophins having an NGF amino acid backbone but modified to bind receptors other than trkA, such as trkB or trkC.
      <br/>
      Preferred are those in which amino acid substitutions have been made in NGF with an amino acid from a corresponding position in NT-3 that is responsible for binding the trk receptor for NT-3.
      <br/>
      Such NGF mutants have NT-3-like receptor binding activity while retaining NGF pharmacokinetics and purification behavior (Urfer, et al, Biochemistry 36(16):4775-4781 (1997)).
      <br/>
      These NGF mutants can also lack trkA binding activity (Shih et al, J Biol.
      <br/>
      Chem. 269 (44):27679-86 (1994).
      <br/>
      Such NGF mutants are particularly preferred neurotrophins for use in the invention described herein.
    </p>

      The isolation of a recombinant human neurotrophin, e.g., rhNGF, involves separation of the protein from a variety of diverse host cell contaminants.
      <br/>
      Fach step involves special buffers that enable sufficient separation to take place.
      <br/>
      The final or penultimate processing step for a neurotrophin is complicated by the presence of several neurotrophin variants that co-purify using conventional chromatographic media.
      <br/>
      When a refolding step is included in the recovery and purification process, the variants include misfolded forms of the neurotrophin.
      <br/>
      Variants can also include those that differ chemically from the neurotrophin, such as carbamylated, deamidated, deamidated or proteolytically cleaved forms.
      <br/>
      In the case of NGF, these species consist primarily of dimeric forms--homodimers, e.g., 120/120 or 117/117 when 118/118 is desired, or heterodimers, e.g., 120/118, 117/118--, chemically modified variants--isoaspartate, mono-oxidized, glycosylation variants, N-terminal and C-terminal truncated forms, and dimers thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="43">The invention makes possible the large scale production of neurotrophins, particularly rhNGF, in quantities sufficient for therapeutic uses, such as, for example, treatment of Al7heimer's disease, peripheral neuropathies, including diabetic and AIDS-related neuropathies, and the like.</p>
    <p num="44">
      In view of the similarity in sequence and conformation between NGF and other neurotrophins, preferably those in the NGF-family, the methods of the present invention can be applied to prepare these neurotrophins substantially free of misprocessed, misfolded or partially folded, glycosylation, and/or charge variants.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, column resins and conditions are identified that are favorable for selectively separating neurotrophins from these and other closely related variants.
      <br/>
      Neurotrophins include NT-3, NT-4/5, NT-6, BDNF, and engineered forms, including heterodimeric, chimeric or pantropic forms thereof.
      <br/>
      Preferably the neurotrophins are human or highly homologous to the human amino acid sequence, preferably greater than 80%, more preferably greater than 90%, and most preferably greater than 95% homologous to the human sequences.
      <br/>
      An engineered neurotrophin will retain at least 50% of the trk receptor binding function of the native neurotrophin it mimics, preferably at least 75%, and more preferably at least 80%.
      <br/>
      These engineered forms are those that retain sufficient high-pI or hydrophobic character of the native neurotrophin to retain a similar performance in the processes described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      As described below, the processes described herein have been successfully applied to rhNGF, rhNT-3 and rhNT-4/5.
      <br/>
      For example, rhNT-4/5, which was made in E. coli, was isolated in inclusion bodies and reduced and solubilized from the inclusion bodies.
      <br/>
      The reduced NT-4/5 was partially purified by DE.
      <br/>
      Sepharose Fast Flow and by S-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography.
      <br/>
      The S-Sepharose Fast Flow pool was refolded in a guanidine containing buffer for 24 hours.
      <br/>
      Misfolded forms of NT-4/5 were removed by chromatography as disclosed herein at large scale.
      <br/>
      The carbamylated and clipped (misprocessed forms) of NT-4/5 were removed by high performance cation-exchange chromatography by a PolyCat A HPLC resin or SP-Sepharose HP resin, in column format, at large scale.
      <br/>
      The purified rhNT-4/5 was ultrafiltered and diafiltered into an acidic buffer for formulation.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      One embodiment of the invention involves purifying a neurotrophin from its related variants, usually after the neurotrophin has already been purified from most other impurities, typically at the final or near final step before desalting or diafiltration prior to formulation.
      <br/>
      The related variants in the mixture can include not only variants residual from a fermentation, but also variants produced if the neurotrophin is degraded on storage or during processing.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The neurotrophins suitable for use with embodiments of the invention can be prepared by any means, but are preferably prepared recombinantly.
      <br/>
      A nucleic acid molecule coding for the neurotrophins discussed herein are available from several sources, for example, through chemical synthesis using the known DNA sequence or by the use of standard cloning techniques known to those skilled in the art. cDNA clones carrying the neurotrophin, e.g., hNGF coding sequence, can be identified by use of oligonucleotide hybridization probes specifically designed based on the known sequence of the neurotrophin.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Upon obtaining a molecule having the neurotrophin coding sequence, the molecule is inserted into a cloning vector appropriate for expression in the chosen host cell.
      <br/>
      The cloning vector is constructed so as to provide the appropriate regulatory functions required for the efficient transcription, translation and processing of the coding sequence.

      If the neurotrophin is prepared recombinantly, suitable host cells for expressing the DNA encoding the neurotrophin are prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryotic cells.

      Suitable prokaryotes for this purpose include bacteria such as archaebacteria and eubacteria.
      <br/>
      Preferred bacteria are eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, for example, Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia, e.g., E. coli, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella, e.g., Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia, e.g., Serratia marcescans, and Shigella; Bacilli such as B. subtilis and B. licheniformis (e.g., B. licheniformis 41P disclosed in DD 266,710 published Apr. 12, 1989); Pseudomonas such as P. aeruginosa; Streptomyces; Azotobacter; Rhizobia; Vitreoscilla; and Paracoccus.

      In one embodiment where the neurotrophin is directly secreted into the medium, the medium is separated from the cellular debris by centrifugation, and the clarified fermentation broth or medium is then used for purification on silica gel.

      For the silica chromatography, typically the broth is passed through underivatized silica particles such that the neurotrophin polypeptide adheres to the silica particles; the silica particles are washed to remove contaminants; and the polypeptide is eluted from the silica particles with a buffer comprising an alcoholic or polar aprotic solvent and an alkaline earth, an alkali metal, or an inorganic ammonium salt.

      In a preferred embodiment of the invention, Macroprep High S Cation-Exchange Chromatography is employed to separate neurotrophin from its variants, as well as for decreasing bulk contaminants.
      <br/>
      This resin can be used as an early step in the purification of a neurotrophin from mammalian cell culture, preferably for fractionation of the harvested cell culture medium.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment Macroprep High S Cation-Exchange Chromatography is most preferably used immediately after a protein refolding step.
      <br/>
      The very high flow property of this cation exchange column allows the large volume of dilute refolded protein or harvested cell culture medium neurotrophin to be readily concentrated before subsequent chromatography steps, such as HIC or SP-Sepharose, by adjusting conditions so that the neurotrophins bind the column.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the cation exchange nature of the resin allows removal of non-bound bulk proteins and some misprocessed variants and chemically-modified variants (e.g., altered charge, MET37-oxidized variant).
      <br/>
      Most importantly, when misfolded variants or chemically modified variants (e.g. misprocessed variants, glycosylation variant (as from mammalian cell culture production)) that differ in hydrophobicity from native neurotrophin are present, the Macroprep resin allows at least a partial removal of these hydrophobic variants, substantially enriching for the native neurotrophin, as determined herein.
      <br/>
      While not meant to be limiting, it is believed that the backbone of the resin support contains hydrophobic content that promotes non-specific interactions between neurotrophins and the resin, which has been taken advantage of as taught herein.
      <br/>
      Typically, for an elution buffer of pH from about pH 5 to 8, more preferably 6 to 8, a 0 to 3 M TMAC concentration is useful.

      <br/>
      The neurotrophin thereafter is solubilized and then subsequently refolded using an appropriate buffer.
      <br/>
      The details for this method of isolation from the periplasm to produce refolded protein are described below.

    <p num="69">
      Insoluble, non-native neurotrophin is isolated from the prokaryotic host cells in a suitable isolation buffer by any appropriate technique, e.g., one involving exposing the cells to a buffer of suitable ionic strength to solubilize most host proteins, but in which aggregated neurotrophin is substantially insoluble, and disrupting the cells so as to release the inclusion bodies and make them available for recovery by, for example, centrifugation.
      <br/>
      This technique is well known, and is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,511,503.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Briefly, the cells are suspended in the buffer (typically at pH 5 to 9, preferably about 6 to 8, using an ionic strength of about 0.01 to 2M, preferably 0.1 to 0.2M).
      <br/>
      Any suitable salt, including sodium chloride, is useful to maintain a sufficient ionic strength value.
      <br/>
      The cells, while suspended in this buffer, are then disrupted by lysis using techniques commonly employed such as, for example, mechanical methods, e.g., a Manton-Gaulin press microfluidizer, a French press, or a sonic oscillator, or by chemical or enzymatic methods.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Examples of chemical or enzymatic methods of cell disruption include spheroplasting, which entails the use of lysozyme to lyse the bacterial wall (Neu el al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 17:215 (1964)), and osmotic shock, which involves treatment of viable cells with a solution of high tonicity and with a cold-water wash of low tonicity to release the polypeptides (Neu el al., J. Biol. Chem., 240: 3685-3692 (1965)).
      <br/>
      A third method, described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,680,262, involves contacting the transformed bacterial cells with an effective amount of a lower alkanol having 2 to 4 carbon atoms for a time and at a temperature sufficient to kill and lyse the cells.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      After the cells are disrupted, the suspension is typically centrifuged to pellet the inclusion bodies.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, this step is carried out at about 500 to 15,000 *  g, preferably about 12,000 *  g, in a standard centrifuge for a sufficient time that depends on volume and centrifuge design, usually about 10 minutes to 0.5 hours.
      <br/>
      The resulting pellet contains substantially all of the insoluble polypeptide fraction, but if the cell disruption process is not complete, it may also contain intact cells or broken cell fragments.
      <br/>
      Completeness of cell disruption can be assayed by resuspending the pellet in a small amount of the same buffer solution and examining the suspension with a phase-contrast microscope.
      <br/>
      The presence of broken cell fragments or whole cells indicates that additional disruption is necessary to remove the fragments or cells and the associated non-refractile polypeptides.
      <br/>
      After such further disruption, if required, the suspension is again centrifuged and the pellet recovered, resuspended, and analyzed.
      <br/>
      The process is repeated until visual examination reveals the absence of broken cell fragments in the pelleted material or until further treatment fails to reduce the size of the resulting pellet.

      In an alternative embodiment, the neurotrophin is isolated from the periplasmic space by solubilization in a suitable buffer.
      <br/>
      This procedure can be in-situ solubilization involving direct addition of reagents to the fermentation vessel after the neurotrophin has been produced recombinantly, thereby avoiding extra steps of harvesting, homogenization, and centrifugation to obtain the neurotrophin.

      This incubation takes place under conditions of neurotrophin concentration, incubation time, and incubation temperature that will allow solubilization of the neurotrophin to occur in the alkaline buffer.
    </p>
    <p num="77">Measurement of the degree of solubilization of the neurotrophin in the buffer is suitably carried out by turbidity determination, by analyzing neurotrophin fractionation between the supernatant and pellet after centrifugation on reduced SDS gels, by protein assay (e.g., the Bio-Rad protein assay kit), or by HPLC.</p>
    <p num="78">
      The pH range of the alkaline buffer for solubilization typically is at least about 7.5, with the preferred range being about 8-11.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable buffers that will provide a pH within this latter range include glycine, CAPSO (3-�Cyclohexylamino�-2-hydroxy- 1-propanesulfonic acid), AMP (2-Amino-2-methyl-1-propanol), CAPS (3-�Cyclohexylamino�-1-propanesulfonic acid), CHES (2-�N-Cyclohexylamino�ethanesulfonic acid), and TRIS HCl (Tris�hydroxymethyl�aminomethane hydrochloride.
      <br/>
      The preferred buffer herein is glycine or CAPSO, preferably at a concentration of about 20 mM, at a pH of about 8.5 to 11, preferably about 10-11.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The concentration of neurotrophin in the buffered solution for solubilization must be such that the neurotrophin will be substantially solubilized and partially or fully reduced and denatured.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the neurotrophin may be initially insoluble.
      <br/>
      The exact amount to employ will depend, e.g., on the concentrations and types of other ingredients in the buffered solution, particularly the type and amount of reducing agent, the type and amount of chaotropic agent, and the pH of the buffer.
      <br/>
      For example, the concentration of neurotrophin may be increased at least three-fold if the concentration of reducing agent, e.g., DTT, is concurrently increased, to maintain a ratio of DTT:neurotrophin of from about 3:1 to 10:1.
      <br/>
      It is desirable to produce a more concentrated solubilized protein solution prior to dilution refolding.
      <br/>
      Thus, the preferred concentration of neurotrophin is at least about 30 mg/mL, with a more preferred range of 30-50 mg per mL.
      <br/>
      For example, neurotrophin may be solubilized to a concentration of about 30-50 mg/mL in 5M to 7M urea, 10 mM DTT and diluted, for example, to about 1 mg/mL for folding.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      After the neurotrophin is solubilized, it is placed or diluted into a refolding buffer containing 5-40% (v/v) alcoholic or aprotic solvent, a chaotropic agent, and an alkali metal, alkaline earth, or ammonium salt.

      The buffer can be any buffer for the first buffered solution, with CAPSO, glycine, and CAPS being preferred at pH 8.5-11, particularly at a concentration of about 20 mM, and most preferably CAPSO and glycine.

      The neurotrophin may be diluted with the refolding buffer, preferably at least five fold, more preferably at least about ten fold.

      Alternatively, the neurotrophin may be dialyzed against the refolding buffer.
      <br/>
      The refolding can be carried out at about 2 (degree) -45 (degree)  C., most preferably about 2 (degree) -8 (degree)  C. at least about one hour.

      The reducing agent is suitably selected from those described above for the solubilizing step in the concentration range given.

      Its concentration will depend especially on the concentrations of alkaline earth, alkali metal, or ammonium salt, neurotrophin, and solvent.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the concentration of reducing agent is about 0.5 to 8 mM, more preferably about 0.5-5 mM, even more preferably about 0.5-2 mM. The preferred reducing agents are DTT and cysteine.

      The preferred concentration of neurotrophin (resulting in the maximum yield of correctly folded conformer) is in the range of about 0.1 to 15 mg/mL, more preferably about 0.1 to 6 mg/mL, and most preferably about 0.2 to 5 mg/mL.

      The incubation is carried out to maximize the yield of correctly folded neurotrophin conformer and the ratio of correctly folded neurotrophin conformer to misfolded neurotrophin conformer recovered, as determined by RIA or HPLC, and to minimize the yield of multimeric, associated neurotrophin as determined by mass balance.

    <p num="87">
      Whether a refolding step is part of the process or not, a preferred step for separation of a neurotrophin from its variants is separation on hydrophobic interaction chromatography resin.
      <br/>
      During fermentation, purification or in vitro protein refolding, some protein can be chemically modified, misprocessed, or may not refold to its native three-dimensional structure but rather to other structures which differ with respect to their stability, solubility, immunogenicity, or bioactivity.
      <br/>
      These variants must be removed during recovery to avoid undesirable side-effects such as antigenicity or loss of potency.
      <br/>
      If the variant is insoluble it can be easily removed by solid/liquid separation techniques such as centrifugation and filtration.
      <br/>
      However, if the variant is soluble, higher resolution adsorption techniques such as chromatography will be required to remove them.
      <br/>
      When produced in prokaryotic cells or when refolded in vitro, neurotrophins form a soluble stable misfolded variant.
      <br/>
      Misfolded neurotrophin has an altered disulfide pairing pattern and three-dimensional structure relative to native neurotrophin and lacks native pharmacological activity.
      <br/>
      When produced in eucaryotic cell culture, e.g. mammalian cell culture, the variant forms are typically misprocessed forms.
      <br/>
      These also typically lack native pharmacological activity and should be removed.
      <br/>
      HIC has been found herein as suitable for separating these variants from native neurotrophin.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      HIC involves sequential adsorption and desorption of protein from solid matrices mediated through non-covalent hydrophobic bonding.
      <br/>
      Generally, sample molecules in a high salt buffer are loaded on the HIC column.
      <br/>
      The salt in the buffer interacts with water molecules to reduce the salvation of the molecules in solution, thereby exposing hydrophobic regions in the sample molecules which are consequently adsorbed by the HIC column.
      <br/>
      The more hydrophobic the molecule, the less salt needed to promote binding.
      <br/>
      Usually, a decreasing salt gradient is used to elute samples from the column.
      <br/>
      As the ionic strength decreases, the exposure of the hydrophilic regions of the molecules increases and molecules elute from the column in order of increasing hydrophobicity.
      <br/>
      Sample elution has also be achieved by the addition of mild organic modifiers or detergents to the elution buffer.
      <br/>
      HIC is reviewed in Protein Purification, 2d Ed., Springer-Verlag, New York, pgs 176-179 (1988).
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The strength of the association between a protein and a matrix depends on several factors, including the size and hydrophobic character of the immobilized functional group, the polarity and surface tension of the surrounding solvent, and the hydrophobicity of the protein.
      <br/>
      The binding capacity of HIC matrices tends to be low due to the need for the immobilized hydrophobic ligand to be widely spaced.
      <br/>
      Further, the capacity of a medium for a given protein varies inversely with the level of hydrophobic impurities in the sample preparation.
      <br/>
      In order to resolve a desired protein from variants and other impurities while simultaneously maximizing capacity, it is necessary to identify a suitable HIC solid-phase medium as well as suitable mobile phases for load, wash, and elution.

    <p num="90">
      As determined herein, the most suitable media for separating correctly folded and misfolded neurotrophins or misprocessed forms from intact, correctly processed forms, were those having immobilized phenyl functional groups.
      <br/>
      Phenyl-based HIC media from different vendors exhibited different efficiency for resolving these neurotrophin forms.
      <br/>
      Best results were achieved with Phenyl Toyopearl media by TosoHaas and Phenyl Sepharose Fast Flow Low Sub (low substitution).
      <br/>
      TSK Phenyl 5PW was also suitable.
      <br/>
      Other HIC-immobilized functional groups can function to separate these forms.
      <br/>
      Examples were octyl groups, such as those on Octyl Sepharose CL4B media from Pharmacia, and propyl groups, such as those on High Propyl media from Baker.
      <br/>
      Less preferred are the alkoxy, butyl, and isoamyl functional group resins.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      HIC was useful for separation of neurotrophins from their variants in mammalian cell culture.
      <br/>
      For example, as was determined herein, rhNGF-expressing-CHO cell culture contained incorrectly proteolytically processed variants, such as those in which a partial precursor sequence is present, e.g., precursor NGF, hybrid precursor NGF, and clipped precursor NGF sequences.
      <br/>
      Also found in the mammalian cell culture medium were glycosylated NGF and glycosylated forms of the incorrectly proteolytically processed variants.
      <br/>
      Undesirable glycosylated forms, which in the case of NGF can be seen as a higher molecular weight species (+2000 kD), could generate an unwanted antigenic response in a patient and contribute to poor product quality or activity.
      <br/>
      HIC effectively separated hydrophobic variants, primarily N-terminal-proteolytically-misprocessed variants, including glycosylated forms, from rhNGF.
      <br/>
      As shown in the examples, the precursor-sequence-containing and clipped precursor sequence NGF and the glycosylated forms of both NGF and the precursor-sequence-containing NGF eluted in the leading edge of the NGF peak during phenyl-HIC.
      <br/>
      Thus, a rhNGF composition could be obtained that was substantially free of these species, and that was particularly suited for a subsequent step such as high performance cation-exchange chromatography.
      <br/>
      HIC is applicable to other neurotrophins, as well as NGF, regardless of source.
      <br/>
      For example, HIC is useful to separate NGF monomers from dimers, either homo- or hetero-dimers depending on the monomer forms present, as well as distinguish dimer forms which also differ in hydrophobicity, that are obtained after in vitro refolding or when produced and secreted from mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      A preferred source of neurotrophin mixtures for use with HIC is mammalian cell culture, more preferably CHO cell culture.
      <br/>
      The culture is preferably subjected to at least one prior purification step as discussed herein.
      <br/>
      HIC is particularly effective in separating misprocessed glycosylated variant(s) from the native recombinant neurotrophin.
      <br/>
      In the case of rhNGF, the glycosylated and preproNGF forms are less hydrophobic than native NGF, thereby eluting before native NGF.
      <br/>
      Misfolded forms of neurotrophins (when bacterially produced) are also more hydrophobic, eluting earlier than the native neurotrophin.

      The most preferred HIC resin for separating neurotrophin forms were those having immobilized phenyl functional groups.

      <br/>
      Of the phenyl-HIC resins, Phenyl Toyopearl media by TosoHaas is most preferred and Phenyl Sepharose Fast Flow Low Sub (low substitution) and TSK Phenyl 5PW are preferred.

      Using HIC, a variety of mobile phase conditions can be used to wash and differentially elute neurotrophin forms.
      <br/>
      These mobile phases can contain several different chemical species that influence the association between a neurotrophin and the stationary phase in different ways.
      <br/>
      Correctly folded and misfolded neurotrophin, e.g. NT-4/5, can be resolved on a HIC column by decreasing salt gradients or step-wise decrease, for example of mobile-phase salt, e.g., ammonium sulfate, NaCl concentration, acetate concentration.
      <br/>
      Salts can influence the binding of a neurotrophin to the resin by modulating the surface tension of the mobile phase.
      <br/>
      Other agents that affected surface tension were sodium citrate and tetramethyl ammonium chloride, as discussed in the Examples.
      <br/>
      Variants can also be resolved during column chromatography by eluting bound protein with increasing gradients or step-wise increase in concentration of relatively polar organic solvents.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable solvents include ethanol, acetonitrile, and propanol.
      <br/>
      The strength of the association between neurotrophin forms and HIC resin also depended on the mobile-phase pH, with neutral conditions preferred.
      <br/>
      The relative hydrophobicity of correctly folded and misfolded neurotrophin also depended on solution pH.
      <br/>
      Separation of variants from native neurotrophin could also be obtained by simultaneously varying several properties of the mobile phase during gradient or stepwise elution.
      <br/>
      For example, a mobile phase that simultaneously varied in salt concentration and apolar solvent concentration during elution provided resolution better than when only salt was varied.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      For HIC, salts discussed herein, including ammonium sulfate, citrate, acetate, and potassium chloride can be used.
      <br/>
      Depending on the salt used, the salt concentration is typically 0.5 M to 3 M, more preferably 0.5 to 2.5M, to achieve binding of neurotrophin to the resin.
      <br/>
      For example, a binding buffer of 0.8 to 1.5 M salt is preferred for NGF, with higher salt concentrations leading to precipitation of NGF onto the resin resulting in lower recovery.
      <br/>
      For NT-3 a binding buffer at pH 7 with a salt concentration of 1.0 to 2.5 is preferred, with 1.25 to 1.75 M NaCl being more preferred, and 1.5 M most preferred.
      <br/>
      For NT-4/5 a binding buffer at pH 7 with 1 to 3 M salt is preferred, with 2 to 2.75 M being more preferred, and 2.5 M NaCl being most preferred.
      <br/>
      In the case of NT-4/5, when 2.5 M NaCl was preferred for loading, 2M NaCl was preferred for elution with organic solvent present (e.g. 10% alcohol, pH 7).
      <br/>
      Preferably, a lowering of the salt concentration is used to elute and separate a neurotrophin and its variants.
      <br/>
      In order to achieve elution, the salt concentration in the elution buffer is typically lower than that in the loading buffer, but it can be the same concentration when compensated for with organic solvent.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      In addition, the use of organic solvent has another advantage, as has been found herein, that the addition of an organic solvent improves the elution pattern by resulting in narrower peak profiles.
      <br/>
      In addition to ethanol, other organic solvents discussed herein can be used, including propanol, isopropanol, and lower alkylene glycols, such as propylene glycol, ethylene glycol and hexylene glycol.
      <br/>
      The organic solvent at 5 to 25% (v/v), more preferably 5 to 20% (v/v), will typically elute a correctly folded neurotrophin.
      <br/>
      The elution with organic solvent can be either gradient or step-wise.
      <br/>
      The pH range is preferably near neutral to slightly acidic, from pH 5 to 8, more preferably pH 6 to 8, pH 6.5 to 7.5, and most preferably pH 7.

      In view of the discovery by the present inventors of certain undesirable neurotrophin variants arising from recombinant production of a neurotrophin, as reported herein, the use of high performance cation-exchange chromatography, preferably in preparative mode, allows separation of the charge-modified variants, such as carbamylated, oxidized, isoasp, deamidated, and certain clipped forms (e.g. C-terminal truncated forms of NGF) from native neurotrophin.
      <br/>
      For example, N-terminal clipped forms (e.g., 2 to 4 N-terminal amino acid deletions) that result in charge alteration, which may occur during bacterial fermentation as in the case of NT-4/5 and NT-3, can now be removed.
      <br/>
      In the case of neurotrophins produced in mammalian cell culture, C-terminal truncation may occur in the highly charged terminal region.
      <br/>
      For example, 118 form of NGF may be niisprocessed or cleaved at its C-terminus to 117, 114 and 115 forms.

      <br/>
      Based on the 12 month stability data, rhNGF is more stable with benzyl alcohol than phenol in these formulations.
      <br/>
      Benzyl alcohol preserved rhNGF formulation with the presence of surfactant is as stable as the formulation with no surfactant added, indicating that the addition of F68 to rhNGF multi-dose formulation is not required for stability purpose.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a formulation consisting of 0.1 mg/mL protein in 20 mM acetate, 136 mM NaCl, 0.9% benzyl alcohol, pH 5.5 is recommended for rhNGF used for multiple dosing in Phase III clinical trails.
      <br/>
      This rhNGF multi-dose formulation passed the USP and EP preservative efficacy test after 6 months at 5 (degree)  C., and is as stable as the current liquid formulation at 2 mg/mL.
      <br/>
      However, the formulation should avoid exposure to intensive light due to the presence of benzyl alcohol as preservative which is light sensitive.

      After culturing of the recombinant CHO cells, the cell culture medium was harvested.
      <br/>
      The Harvested Cell Culture Fluid (HCCF) contained NGF species 120, 118, and 117.
      <br/>
      About 40-70% of the NGF was typically a 118/118 homodimer with the remainder as heterodimers 120/118, 120/120, anda small amount as 118/117.
      <br/>
      As taught herein, these species can be separated by the SP-Sepharose HP column.
    </p>

      Harvested Cell Culture Fluid was concentrated approximately 20-fold using Millipore 10 Kd cutoff membranes (either cellulose, composite or polysulfone were used interchangeably).

      <br/>
      Such alcohols are solvents that, when added to aqueous solution, increase the hydrophobicity of the solution by decreasing solution polarity.
      <br/>
      Ethanol is most preferred.

      The lower limit of alcohol is whatever percentage that elutes and the upper limit is set by the need to avoid protein denaturation.

      <br/>
      The amount of TMAC used to elute NGF is a function of pH and alcohol concentration.

      The lower the pH the less amounts of alcohol and TMAC is required.
      <br/>
      The pH can be between about pH 4 to 8.

      Silica provides a mixed mode chromatography resin, having ionic, polarity, and hydrophobic interactions that play a part in protein binding characteristics.

      The column was equilibrated in 1M NaCl, 25 mM MOPSO, pH 7.

      The column was washed with 1M NaCl, 25 mM MOPSO, pH7 (preferably about pH 5.0 to 8.5, more preferably pH 6 to 8, and most preferably pH 7).
      <br/>
      Bound NGF was eluted with 25 mM succinate, pH 3.9, 50 mM TEAC (tetraethylammonium chloride).
      <br/>
      TEAC is a more powerful eluant than TMAC.
      <br/>
      The pH preferably ranges from about pH 3.5 to 8.
      <br/>
      However, a pH above 7.5 for extended periods of time should be avoided in order to prevent or reduce formation of the deamidated NGF species.
      <br/>
      Generally, the lower the pH of the buffer, the lower the concentration of the mixed-property salt, e.g., TMAC or TEAC, required to elute NGF from the Silica column.
      <br/>
      Buffers having a good buffering capacity near pH 4 to 5 are suitable for use.
      <br/>
      The presence of salt in the elution buffer is optional, such that the column can be washed with a MOPSO buffer without salt prior to application of the elution buffer.

      Each of the three major clipped forms of NGF, 120, 118, and 117, may have variants, but the variants, such as oxidized and isoasp forms, of the predominant clipped form during a purification (120 in this example) may mask analysis of the variants from the less predominant forms (118 and 117 in this example).

      The R120 form has an additional arginine residue at the N-terminus of NGF; usually the N-terminal amino acid sequence of rhNGF is SSSHP, but R120 has an N-terminal sequence of RSSSHP.
      <br/>
      Thus the R120 form is more basic than mature NGF and was separated by SP-SHP.
      <br/>
      It also has lower bioactivity, probably related to the fact that the NGF N-terminal is necessary for receptor (trkA) binding.
      <br/>
      The oxidized NGF form is a mono-oxidized form having the methionine at position 37 oxidized, yielding a more acidic form that elutes on the leading edge of the NGF peak.
      <br/>
      The isoasp form contains a modification of the aspartic acid at amino acid 93.

      The isoasp form is slightly more basic and thus binds slightly tighter to the SP-Sepharose HP resin.
      <br/>
      NGF species containing isoAsp93 eluted in the trailing edge of the elution peak.
      <br/>
      Deamidation occurs at asparagine residues, typically at asparagine at position 45.

      An immobilized trypsin column is used between the Macroprep High S column and the Silica column.

      The protease digestion converts the 120 form to the 118 form by cleavage of the C-terminal VRRA to VR.
      <br/>
      To achieve the limited and selective cleavage, a trypsin or trypsin-like protease is used, preferably trypsin, more preferably the readily available porcine trypsin, or alternatively bovine trypsin or a recombinant trypsin.

      One means to achieve higher purity is to avoid selecting fractions with significant amounts of variants, such as may be found in the leading or trailing edges of the main neurotrophin peak, e.g. 118/118 rhNGF peak.

      <br/>
      In the NT-4/5-expressing plasmid, the transcriptional sequences used for expression of the gene in E. coli were provided by the alkaline phosphatase promoter sequence.
