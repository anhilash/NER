      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a luggage article or a suitcase, and more particularly to a luggage article or a suitcase having a retractable and/or foldable handle device.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Typical foldable bags or suitcases or luggage articles comprise a middle portion that may be folded to a compact size for storing purposes, and a handle device provided for carrying the foldable luggage article.
      <br/>
      One of the typical foldable luggage articles is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,664,652 to Shamah and comprises a vertically expandable luggage article, and a vertically expandable handle device having at least three vertically stacked supports or tubular members secured to the luggage article.
      <br/>
      Only a rigid plate is secured to the upper portion of the top shell.
      <br/>
      When the intermediate and foldable shells of the luggage article are opened, only the right plate may be provided for supporting the top shell and the intermediate foldable shells are expanded to the working position, such that the luggage article may not be stably supported in place when the luggage article is expanded.
    </p>
    <p num="6">The present invention has arisen to mitigate and/or obviate the afore-described disadvantages of the conventional foldable bags or luggage articles.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a foldable suitcase having a retractable support for stably supporting the suitcase at the expanded position.</p>
    <p num="8">
      In accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is provided a suitcase comprising an expandable suitcase body expandable to a working position and foldable to a folded position, and a retractable support secured to the suitcase body for supporting the suitcase body at the working position and at the folded position.
      <br/>
      The support is pivotally secured to the base of the suitcase body for allowing the support to be folded toward the base of the suitcase body.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The suitcase body includes an upper shell having an upper portion and a lower portion, and includes a foldable middle portion provided between the base and the upper shell for forming a foldable structure to the suitcase body, the retractable support includes a pair of posts having a lower portion pivotally secured to the base of the suitcase body, a pair of tubes slidably received in the posts respectively and having an upper portion secured to the upper portion of the upper shell of the suitcase body.
      <br/>
      A bar is further secured to the lower portion of the upper shell of the suitcase body and includes a pair of orifices for slidably receiving the posts respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The lower portions of the posts are pivotally coupled to the base of the suitcase body at a pin each for allowing the posts to be rotated relative to the base between an upright position and a lay down position, and means for securing the posts to the base at the upright position.
      <br/>
      The posts each includes a frame secured to the lower portion thereof and pivotally secured to the base at the pin, the frames each includes an aperture formed therein, the base includes at least one spring-biased projection engaged with the aperture of a first of the frames for securing the posts to the base at the upright position.
      <br/>
