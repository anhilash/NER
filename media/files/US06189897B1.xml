    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention substantially relates to devices that are used to reduce accidental rollover of vehicles.
      <br/>
      But more particularly relates to a shock system adapter apparatus which is automatically actuated by the steering system and increases dampening compression on the outside shock and decreases dampening compression on the inside shock when the vehicle is turning.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In the past, many types of shock systems have been taught for use on vehicles.
      <br/>
      However, such shock systems typically function independently from the steering system and they do not specifically reduce accidental tipping of the vehicle while turning, as taught by the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,348,112 teaches a "MOTORCYCLE HEIGHT ADJUSTER" which is hydraulically actuated and includes a manually actuated height adjustment knob.
      <br/>
      This type of shock system allows the rider to adjust the height of the motorcycle according to their individual preference.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Another example of a prior art shock system is disclosed within U.S. Pat. No. 4,961,481 wherein taught is a "HYDRAULIC ACTUATION SYSTEM".
      <br/>
      This system is functional for its intended use which is to allow a vehicle occupant to manually control or "set" the stiffness of the vehicle shock absorbers, similar to the previous reference.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Other examples of prior art shock systems, or the like are taught within U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,546,959, 5,823,305, and 5,725,239.
      <br/>
      However, none of the references provide an adapter apparatus which is compatible with a pre-existing shock system, nor do they include unique metering valves, nor novel simple mechanical linkage, as taught by the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The applicants therefore contend that there is a need for a shock system adapter apparatus that is attachable and automatically activated by the existing vehicle steering system.
      <br/>
      And when the vehicle is turned, the dampening compression of the outside shock is increased while the dampening compression of the inside shock is decreased.
      <br/>
      Thus, altering the normal center of gravity of the vehicle, and reducing the chance of body roll while turning.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a steering actuated shock system apparatus for vehicles that may either be installed at the point of manufacture, or the system can easily be retrofitted onto the existing vehicle shock system after market.</p>
    <p num="8">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a steering actuated shock system for vehicles that is adjustable by the user, in a manner which allows the user to adjust the shock dampening compression according to their individual needs.</p>
    <p num="9">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a steering actuated shock system for vehicles that is attachable to the pre-existing steering arm mechanism on the vehicle, and is automatically actuated when the vehicle is turned.</p>
    <p num="10">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a steering actuated shock system for vehicles which is of very simple construction and economical to manufacture and install.</p>
    <p num="11">
      Also another object of the present invention is to provide a steering actuated shock system which may be manufactured and sold as an accessory item for vehicles.
      <br/>
      For example, such a system is especially useful as an accessory item for snowmobiles, quads, three-wheeled vehicles, race vehicles, four-wheel drive vehicles, pickup trucks, or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide a steering actuated shock system for vehicles that enhances the overall performance of the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="13">Still a further object of the present invention is to provide a steering actuated shock system for vehicles that may include instructions and the mechanical linkage may be color-coded for easy installation.</p>
    <p num="14">Other objects and advantages will be seen when taken into consideration with the following specification and drawings.</p>

    <p num="17">
      Within FIGS. 1-6 (arrow 10) substantially represents an overview of the present invention which is a hydraulic shock system adapter apparatus (arrow 10) which can either be installed onto a vehicle at the point of manufacture, or the apparatus (arrow 10) may be installed after market.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood the apparatus (arrow 10) is substantially universal and is operable with any vehicle of choice, such as snowmobiles, quads, three-wheeled vehicles, race vehicles, four wheel drive vehicles, or the like.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the following specification describes multiple embodiments for the present invention.
      <br/>
      Each of which achieve the desired end result, which is substantially to provide a steering actuated shock system for vehicles that automatically increases dampening compression on the outside shock and decreases dampening compression on the inside shock when the vehicle is turning.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood other embodiments may achieve the same end result although not shown.
      <br/>
      Therefore other embodiments are inherent within the invention and the invention is not to be limited to the embodiments as shown.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In FIGS. 1-3, we show a first embodiment for the present invention comprising of the following.
      <br/>
      A first fluid metering valve unit (12), a first needle valve (14) having a first end (14-A) and a second end (14-B).
      <br/>
      With the first end (14-A) of the first needle valve (14) being slidably engaged within the first fluid metering valve unit (12).
      <br/>
      A second fluid metering valve unit (16), a second needle valve (18) having a first end (18-A) and a second end (18-B).
      <br/>
      With the first end (18-A) of the second needle valve (18) being slidably engaged within the second fluid metering valve unit (16), and mechanical linkage (later described in detail) for interconnecting each fluid metering valve unit (12 &amp; 16) and each needle valve (14 &amp; 18) to a pre-existing prior art steering arm (20).
      <br/>
      The first fluid metering valve unit (12) being installed in line onto a pre-existing prior art first fluid line (22) at a location of engineering choice, somewhere between a pre-existing prior art first shock absorber (24) and a pre-existing prior art first pressurized fluid reservoir (26).
      <br/>
      The second fluid metering valve unit (16) being installed in line onto a second pre-existing prior art second fluid line (28) at a location of engineering choice, somewhere between a pre-existing prior art second shock absorber (30) and a pre-existing prior art second pressurized fluid reservoir (32).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Each needle valve (14 &amp; 18) having substantially a closed position, a central position, and an open position.
      <br/>
      With the closed position restricting fluid flow, while the open position does not restrict fluid flow.
      <br/>
      And the pre-existing prior art steering arm (20) having a neutral position, a right position, and a left position.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Whereby, it will now be seen when the pre-existing prior art steering arm (20) is in the neutral position, each needle valve (14 &amp; 18) automatically assumes the central position, as depicted in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="21">
      When the pre-existing prior art steering arm (20) is in the right position, the first needle valve (14) automatically assumes the closed position and the second needle valve (18) automatically assumes the open position simultaneously, as depicted in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Whereby, when the pre-existing prior art steering arm (20) is in the right position, the first pre-existing prior art shock absorber (24) has increased dampening compression, while the second pre-existing prior art shock absorber (30) has decreased dampening compression.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      When the pre-existing prior art steering arm (20) assumes the left position, the first needle valve (14) automatically assumes the open position and the second needle valve (18) automatically assumes the closed position simultaneously, as depicted in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Whereby, when the pre-existing prior art steering arm (20) assumes the left position, the second pre-existing prior art shock absorber (30) has increased dampening compression, while the first pre-existing prior art shock absorber (24) has decreased dampening compression.

      Also, T-shaped bracket (40) is fixedly yet pivotably attached by a pivot pin (54) onto an affixed existing structure (56) on the vehicle of user choice.
      <br/>
      This allows the T-shaped bracket (40) to be pivotably positionable between each of the noted operating positions.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, if so desired, each of the components of the mechanical linkage may be color coded for easy installation if the apparatus is to be installed after market.
      <br/>
      For example, the attachment rod (34) may be colored red, with T-shaped bracket (40) being colored white, with each of the attachment arms (36 &amp; 38) being colored blue, and each of the needle valves being colored yellow, or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Still further, it is to be understood each of the attachment arms (36 &amp; 38) may be in the form of a cable, or the like, depending on engineering choice.
      <br/>
      It is to be further understood that if the attachment rod (34) and the attachment arms (36 &amp; 38) are the preferred embodiment, this is very advantageous as each are threaded, and this allows the apparatus (arrow 10) to be variably adjustable in length for easy installation within different vehicle shock system compartments.
