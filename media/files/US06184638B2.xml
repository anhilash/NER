      FIG. 14 is a circuit diagram showing a conventional control system for an induction motor, which is described in "The institute of Electric Engineers of Japan Trans., D", Vol. 112, No.9, p901, 1993 (referred to an article 1).

      In the figure, reference numeral 1 is excitation-current command computing means; 2 is as induction motor; 3 is torque control means; 4 is current detecting means; and 5 is parameter estimating means.
    </p>
    <p num="5">In the conventional induction-motor control system shown in FIG. 14, the excitation-current command computing means 1 receives a secondary magnetic flux  PHI dr* to be output by the induction motor 2, performs the operation of the following equation (20) in which an AC signal is added (superposed) to a DC signal proportional to the secondary magnetic flux  PHI dr*, and outputs an excitation-current command ids* of the induction motor 2.</p>

      k2: amplitude of a second superposing signal
      <br/>
      f2: frequency of the second superposing signal
    </p>
    <p num="9">It is known that the excitation current must contain at least two frequency components in order to simultaneously estimate a rotation angular velocity and a secondary resistance of the induction motor.</p>
    <p num="10">
      The reason for this will be described.
      <br/>
      A circuit diagram shown in FIG. 15 is known as a T-type equivalent circuit where an excitation current is fixed in value.
      <br/>
      In the figure, cos is a slip angular velocity.
      <br/>
      To estimate a rotation angular velocity of the induction motor is equivalent to estimate a slip angular velocity in the figure since  OMEGA r= OMEGA - OMEGA s.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      To simultaneously estimate a rotation angular velocity and a secondary resistance of the induction motor from the primary current and the primary voltage of the induction motor, which is controlled at a fixed excitation current, is equivalent to estimate Rr/ OMEGA s in the figure.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the principle makes it impossible to separate those one from the other.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Where the excitation current is not kept constant,  OMEGA  and  OMEGA s are not fixed in value.
      <br/>
      The  OMEGA  contains a plurality of components.
      <br/>
      The T-type equivalent circuit holds at each of the different slip angular velocities  OMEGA s for each of the components of the  OMEGA .
      <br/>
      Thus, the induction motor into which the control not keeping the excitation current constant is incorporated can simultaneously estimate the rotation angular velocity and the secondary resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Accordingly, the superposing frequencies f1 and f2 sued are different in value, and in the conventional control system described in the article 1, those frequencies f1 and f2 are
      <br/>
      f1=1 (Hz)
      <br/>
      f2=3 (Hz)
    </p>
    <p num="14">In the article 1, the period of the first superposing signal is 1/f1, and the rating of the induction motor is 3.7 kw. In this sense, this signal is an AC signal having a period longer than a secondary time constant (=Lr/Rr) of the induction motor 2.</p>
    <p num="15">When a torque command  TAU m* to be output by the induction motor 2 and an excitation current command ids* from the excitation-current command computing means 1 are input to the torque control means 3, the torque control means 3 receives three-phase primary currents ius and ivs from the current detecting means 4, an estimated rotation angular velocity  OMEGA  r0 from the current detecting means 4, and an estimated secondary resistance Rr0 from the parameter estimating means 5, and processes those factors so as that an output torque  TAU m of the induction motor follows  TAU m*, and supplies three-phase primary voltages vus, vvs, and vws to the induction motor.</p>

      FIG. 17 is a diagram showing the detail of the torque control means 3.

      In the figure, reference numeral 11 is a torque-current command computing unit; 12 is a primary-angular-velocity computing unit; 13 is an integrator; 14 is a coordinate transformer for transforming a primary current on the static coordinates to that on the rotation coordinates; 15 and 16 are subtractors; 17 and 18 are current controllers; 19 is a coordinate transformer for transforming a primary voltage command on the rotational coordinates into that on the static coordinates; and 20 is a PWM inverter.

      In the thus constructed control system for the induction motor, even when the induction motor 2 is heated and its temperature varies, and the primary and secondary resistance values vary, the estimated primary and secondary resistance follow the primary and secondary variations.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the control system can control the induction motor without the rotation angular velocity sensor so that the output torque  TAU m of the induction motor 2 follows the torque command rm*.
    </p>
    <p num="43">However, the conventional induction-motor control system has the following problems: 1) Estimation of the primary resistance is impossible in the regenerative region. 2) An accuracy of an estimated secondary resistance depends largely on the primary frequency. 3) Torque ripples occur in the output torque  TAU m. 4) A number of operations are required in preparing a plurality of frequencies of AC components of the excitation current. 5) It is relatively difficult to separately estimate the secondary resistance and the rotation angular velocity.</p>

      The first problem 1) above will be described.
      <br/>
      A vector diagram describing a relationship among the state deviation E, the primary current is, and the estimated primary current is0 is shown in FIG. 16. Discussion will be given by use of the vector diagram.
    </p>
    <p num="45">The primary current is is not coincident in vector with the estimated primary current is0 when a deviation is present between the rotation angular velocity  OMEGA r and the estimated rotation angular velocity  OMEGA r0, a deviation is present between the secondary resistance Rr and the estimated secondary resistance Rr0, and a deviation is present between the primary current rs and the estimated primary current is.</p>
    <p num="46">Where a deviation is present between the estimated value and the true value, a relationship among the primary current is, the estimated primary current is0, and the state deviation is mathematically expressed as E=(is0-is) and those vectors are depicted as shown in FIG. 16.</p>

      The primary resistance estimating unit 10 estimates an estimated primary resistance by performing the operation of the equation (27).
      <br/>
      The integrated term (is0 * E) in the equation is the inner product of the estimated primary current is0 and the state deviation (primary current error) (E).
    </p>
    <p num="49">Where the amplitude .vertline.is0.vertline. of the estimated primary current is constant, the integrated term takes a value proportional to a component being in phase with the estimated primary current is0 of the state deviation E.</p>

    <p num="51">It is assumed that when a phase difference between is0 and E, E= XI  ALPHA , E is E ALPHA , and that when a phase difference  XI  between is0 and E is  XI  BETA , E=E BETA .</p>

Therefore, the operation of the equation (27) is sensitive to noise, and improvement of its estimating response is impossible.</p>
    <p num="53">
      When the phase difference is  XI  BETA , a sign of the integrated term (E * is0) is inverted.
      <br/>
      If the equation (27) is operated under this condition, the equation of the estimated primary resistance forms a positive feedback loop, and diverges.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      In summary, when .vertline.

      Therefore, the estimating operation of the estimated primary resistance is instable, for example, its response is poor or it diverges.

      The conventional induction-motor control system estimates a rotation angular velocity by use of the quadrature component of the estimated secondary magnetic flux of the state deviation E +(J.o slashed.r0)T E} (equation (25)).
      <br/>
      Further, it estimates a secondary resistance by use of the component (E * ir0) of the state deviation E being in phase with the estimated secondary current ir0 (equation (26)).
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Where the frequencies of the AC components of the excitation current ids are low or their amplitudes are small, the d-axis component idr of the secondary current is small.
      <br/>
      Where the d-axis component idr is small, the qu-axis component is dominant.
      <br/>
      In this case, the secondary current is substantially equal to the component (q-axis component) orthogonal to the estimated secondary magnetic flux.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the quadrature component +(J.o slashed. r0)T E} is substantially equal in value to the in-phase component (E * ir0).
      <br/>
      Thus, the function of the quadrature component of the estimated secondary magnetic flux is used for both the rotational speed estimation and the secondary resistance estimation.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is impossible to estimate the secondary resistance and the rotation angular velocity separately.
