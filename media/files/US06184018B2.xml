    <p num="3">The field of the present invention is the area of cellulolytic enzymes, nucleotide sequences encoding them and recombinant host cells and methods for producing them.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Cellulosic biomass, photosynthesized by solar energy with CO2 and H2 O, is one of the most important renewable energy resources on earth.
      <br/>
      Its effective utilization through biological processes is one approach to overcoming the shortage of foods, feeds and fuels, expected as a consequence of the explosive increase in human population ï¿½Ohmiya et al. (1997) Biotechnol.
      <br/>
      Gen. Engineer. Rev. 14:365-414ï¿½. Several types of enzymes are required for complete hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose, including endoglucanase, exoglucanase or cellobiohydrolase and  BETA -glucosidase ï¿½Filho (1996) Can. J. Microbiol. 42:1-5ï¿½.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      BETA -Glucosidase ( BETA -D-glucoside glucohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.21) is common among plants, fungi and bacteria.  BETA -Glucosidase has aroused considerable interest primarily because of its involvement in the biological conversion of cellulosic material.
      <br/>
      The enzymatic saccharification of cellulosic materials to D-glucose is known to require the synergistic action of three classes of enzymes: endo-1,4- BETA -D-glucanohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.74), 1,4- BETA -D-cellobiohydrolase (EC 3.22.1.91), and 1,4- BETA -D-glucosidase ( BETA -glucosidase; EC 3.2.1.21).
      <br/>
      Endo-1,4- BETA -D-glucanases act randomly on cellulose chains, whereas 1,4- BETA -D-cellobiohydrolases cleave cellobiosyl residues from the ends of cellulose chains, generating cellobiose as the main product.  BETA -Glucosidase acts to liberate D-glucose units from cellobiose, cello-oligosaccharides, and other glucosides ï¿½Freer (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268:9337-9342ï¿½.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      It is an object of the present invention to provide a  BETA -glucosidase and the nucleotide sequences encoding it from Orpinomyces PC-2.
      <br/>
      The coding sequence for the protein, including its signal peptide and the stop codon, is given in SEQ ID NO:1, nucleotides 39-2012.
      <br/>
      The mature  BETA -glucosidase is encoded at nucleotides 87-2009, exclusive of the stop codon.
      <br/>
      The deduced amino acid sequences of the signal peptide and of the mature protein is given in SEQ ID NO:2.
      <br/>
      Alternative  BETA -glucosidase sequences are SEQ ID NO:2, amino acids 24-641 or SEQ ID NO:2, amino acids 33-641.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Also within the scope of the present invention are nonnaturally occurring recombinant DNA molecules comprising all synonymous sequences encoding the  BETA -glucosidase of the present invention, recombinant host cells comprising the aforementioned DNA molecules, and methods for the synthesis of recombinant  BETA -glucosidase of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the coding sequence for the  BETA -glucosidase is operably linked to transcription and translation control sequences functional in the desired host cell.
      <br/>
      A desired recombinant host cell is a yeast, as specifically exemplified, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell genetically engineered to contain and express the  BETA -glucosidase coding sequences of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Other recombinant host cells of the present invention include, without limitation, fungi such as Aspergillus spp., Trichoderma spp., Pichia spp., Aureobasidium spp. and bacteria, including but not limited to Bacillus spp.

      One of the new sequences had an 800 bp insert (pBgl6), and its deduced amino acid sequence shared some homology with certain  BETA -glucosidases.
      <br/>
      Using the cDNA fragment in pBgl6 as a hybridization probe, plaques containing cDNAs (pBgl13) with a complete ORF encoding a putative  BETA -glucosidase (bglA) were isolated from the same cDNA library.

      <br/>
      The translation start codon (ATG) for bglA was assigned based on there being stop codons in all three frames preceding the ORF and there being no ATG codon upstream of the proposed ORF.

      In addition, the N-terminal region of BglA contains the properties of fungal signal peptides ï¿½von Heijne (1986) Nucleic Acids Res. 14:4683-4690ï¿½. Furthermore, close examination of the complete amino acid sequence of BglA revealed no NCRPD sequence, indicating that BglA is not a component of the HMWCs, and, surprisingly, that its cDNA was isolated due to non-specific cross-reaction between partial BglA and the NCRPD-specific antibodies.

      <br/>
      Close examination of the sequences revealed that Glu-250 and Glu-523 are conserved between all the enzymes and these two residues in the Bacillus polymyxa  BETA -glucosidase were found to be directly involved in catalysis ï¿½Sanz-Aparicio et al. (1998) J. Mol. Biol. 275:491-502ï¿½. Gln82, His 260, Tyr 433, Glu-523 and Tyr 607, which are also conserved, have been identified as determinant residues for the recognition of substrates ï¿½Sanz-Aparicio et al. (1998) J. Mol. Biol. 275:491-502ï¿½. According to Henrissat and Bairoch ï¿½(1993) Biochem. J. 293:781-788ï¿½, this group of enzymes was placed in Family 1 glycosyl hydrolases.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      No  BETA -glucosidase activity was found in the recombinant E. coli culture harboring the complete bglA cDNA.
      <br/>
      This is consistent with the failure to detect any positive plaques when using 4 -methylumbelliferyl- BETA -D-glucoside, a fluorescent substrate of  BETA -glucosidases, as a screening substrate.
      <br/>
      Lack of functional expression in E. coli might be related to differences between anaerobic fungi and E. coli in posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation and folding.
      <br/>
      We then attempted to express the gene in S. cerevisiae, because several other genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes have been expressed in various strains of the yeast.
      <br/>
      These include sequences encoding for two endoglucanases ï¿½Penttila et al. (1987) Yeast 3:175-185ï¿½, two cellobiohydrolases ï¿½Penttila et al. (1988) Gene 63: 103-112ï¿½ and one  BETA -glucosidase from Trichoderma reesei ï¿½Cummings and Fowler (1996) Curr. Genet. 29:227-233ï¿½, a xylanase from Aureobasidlium pullulans ï¿½Li and Ljungdahl (1996) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 62:209-213ï¿½, an  ALPHA -amylase from wheat ï¿½Rothstein et al. (1987) Gene 55:353-356ï¿½ etc.

      Recently, a cellulase gene cassette encoding the Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens endo- BETA -1,4-glucanase (END1), Phanerochaete chrysosporium cellobiohydrolase (CBH1), the Ruminococcus flavefaciens cellodextrinase (CEL1) and the Endomyces fibrilizer cellobiase (Bgl1) was successfully expressed in a laboratory strain of S. cerevisiae ï¿½Van Rensburg et al. (1998) Yeast 14:67-76ï¿½.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      After transformation, ten yeast transformants were grown in synthetic drop out supplement media without uracil, using raffinose as growth substrate and galactose as inducer (see Examples).  BETA -glucosidase activity was measured for the cells and in the culture medium.
      <br/>
      All activity was found to be associated with cells, and no activity was found in the culture medium for all the transformants.
      <br/>
      It has been reported that culture conditions can strongly affect the secretion of enzymes from S. cerevisiae.
      <br/>
      For example, the secretion of a wheat  ALPHA -amylase from S. cerevisiae into the medium was efficient only in a rich medium, but barely detectable in a minimal medium ï¿½Rothstein et al. (1987) Gene 55:353-356ï¿½. The secretion of the Orpinomyces BglA from S. cerevisiae is the same (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      A substantial percent (40%) of the total  BETA -glucosidase activity was found in the culture medium after 24 h of growth.
      <br/>
      The levels of activity in cell-associated and culture medium fractions stayed almost constant during the cultivation period (96 h).
      <br/>
      The growth rates for the transformants using plasmids with and without bglA inserted were the same, indicating that BglA and its gene did not affect the physiology of the yeast.
      <br/>
      A higher percentage of a T. reesei  BETA -glucosidase, when expressed in S. cerevisiae, was found in the culture medium ï¿½Cummings and Fowler (1996) Curr. Genet. 29:227-233ï¿½.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      A summary of the purification of the Orpinomyces BglA secreted by S. cerevisiae culture is given in Table 1.
      <br/>
      The enzyme was purified about 28-fold to homogeneity with a specific activity of 18.8 U/mg and a yield of about 1%.
      <br/>
      Multiple peaks of activity were observed during the purification steps, but only the major activity peak was used for further purification, indicating that BglA was secreted into the culture medium with multiple forms due to proteolysis or different levels of glycosylation.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Two cell-associated forms (Bgl1 and Bgl2) of BglA were also partially purified from cell-free extracts of recombinant yeast cells using phenyl Sepharose, Mono Q and Superdex 200.
      <br/>
      The sizes of Bgl1 (first band in lanes 4 and 7) and Bgl2 (first band in lanes 5 and 8) were estimated to be around 65 kDa by SDS-PAGE/zymogram analysis (FIGS. 3A-3B).
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The purified BglA, Bgl1 and Bgl2 were all subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing.
      <br/>
      The secreted BglA had an N-terminal sequence of KKCIVKSDAA (SEQ ID NO:3), which matched amino acid residues 17-26 (Table 12), demonstrating that amino acid residues 1-16 were cleaved during secretion.
      <br/>
      Thus, the first 16 amino acid residues apparently serve as a signal peptide in both Orpinomyces and S. cerevisiae.
      <br/>
      Removal of 16 amino acid residues at the N-terminus resulted in 641 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 73,608 Da for the mature BglA.
      <br/>
      The signal peptide had a basic amino acid (Lys) as the second N-terminal residue, followed by a hydrophobic amino acid region containing in some points non-hydrophobic residues.
      <br/>
      This is in agreement with the work of Ngsee et al. ï¿½Ngsee et al. (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9:3400-3410ï¿½, where using site-directed mutagenesis of the signal sequence of yeast invertase gene, suc 2, it was showed that the essential feature of a signal peptide for yeast is a hydrophobic core of 6-15 amino acids.
      <br/>
      The core region can be interrupted to a certain extent by non-hydrophobic residues.
      <br/>
      The purified recombinant BglA gave a broad band with a average size of about 110 kDa on SDS-PAGE (FIG. 3A), which was larger than that calculated for the deduced mature enzyme.
      <br/>
      Only one N-glycosylation site Asn-X-Ser/Thr ï¿½Orlean et al. (1991) Methods Enzymol. 194:682-696ï¿½ corresponding to amino acid residues 280-282 (Table 12) was found in the entire BglA sequence.
      <br/>
      However, the size of the purified enzyme after treated with N-glycosidase F, an enzyme specifically removing N-glycosylation, shifted to two sharp bands with very similar sizes (87 and 92kDa) on SDS-PAGE (FIG. 4). N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that these two bands had amino acid sequences at their N-termini identical to that of the secreted BglA.
      <br/>
      These results indicate that about 20% (wt/wt) of N-glycosylation was added to BglA during secretion from S. cerevisiae and that the size difference between the two similar bands after the N-glycosidase F treatment is probably due to O-glycosylation.
      <br/>
      The  BETA -glucosidase purified from the culture supernatant of the same fungus had a mass of 85 kDa including 8.5% (wt/wt) carbohydrate ï¿½Chen et al. (1994) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60:64-70ï¿½. If the native  BETA -glucosidase ï¿½Chen et al. (1994) supraï¿½ and the secreted BglA reported here are products of the same gene, bglA of Orpinomyces PC-2, much heavier glycosylation (hyperglycosylation) was put by S. cerevisiae than by Orpinomyces.
      <br/>
      Hyperglycosylation was also found on the T. reesei endoglucanases ï¿½Penttila et al. (1987) Yeast 3:175-185ï¿½, cellobiohydrolases ï¿½Penttila et al. (1988) Gene 63:103-112ï¿½ and  BETA -glucosidase ï¿½Cummings and Fowler (1996) Curr. Genet. 29:227-233ï¿½ expressed in and secreted from S. cerevisiae.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The N-terminal sequence for Bgl1 was APEDSGVES (SEQ ID NO:4) that matched amino acid residues 40-48, while that of Bgl2, GEDDELLDLS (SEQ ID NO:5) corresponding to amino acid residues 49-58 (Table 12).
      <br/>
      Thus the cleavages resulted in two truncated forms (Bgl1 and Bgl2) of BglA (FIGS. 3A-3B).
      <br/>
      These results indicate that Bgl1 and Bgl2 were cleaved at wrong (or alternate) sites and subsequently trapped during transport in the secretory pathway.
      <br/>
      The fact that these two truncated forms retained catalytic function indicates that the sequence of the BglA protein up to amino acid residue 48 is not critical for catalysis.
      <br/>
      Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that this is why this region is absent in the homologous bacterial  BETA -glucosidases (FIG. 1).

      The catalytic properties of the Orpinomyces PC-2  BETA -glucosidase were determined.
      <br/>
      Activity of the purified secreted BglA against  RHO NPG and cellobiose was determined from pH 3.8 to 8.6 at 40 (degree)  C. The optimum pH with both substrates was found to be between 5.5-7.5 (FIG. 5; Table 2).
      <br/>
      The enzyme was stable for at least 24 h between pH 3.4 to 10.2 at 4 (degree)  C. Hydrolysis of  RHO NPG and cellobiose by BglA, determined in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, was most active at 55 (degree)  C. (FIG. 5; Table 2).
      <br/>
      Enzyme activity decreased rapidly above 60 (degree)  C. and lost its activity at 65 (degree)  C. The enzyme maintained 100% of its activity for 8 h at 40 and 50 (degree)  C. (FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      Inactivation of BglA occurred slowly at 55 (degree)  C., with 50% of the enzyme activity remaining after 8 h of incubation (FIG. 6).

      At 60 (degree)  C. the enzyme was quickly inactivated.

      In recent years, with the realization of  BETA -glucosidase's critical role in cellulolytic enzyme systems, much research effort has been directed toward finding a suitable  BETA -glucosidase for application in the enzymatic conversion of cellulose to glucose ï¿½Saha et al. (1995) In Enzymatic Degradation of Insoluble Carbohydrates, Eds.
      <br/>
      Saddler and Penner, M. H. ACS Symposium Serious 618, pp.197-207ï¿½. Many attempts have been made to increase glucose production by the supplementation of exogenous  BETA -glucosidase in cellulose hydrolysis processes using cellulase enzymes ï¿½Saha et al. (1995) In Enzymatic Degradation of Insoluble Carbohydrates, Eds.

Several are outlined here: Varying concentrations of Aspergillus niger  BETA -glucosidase were mixed with T. reesei cellulase, leading to a 20% increase in conversion of cellulose to ethanol in 24 h on simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) ï¿½Pemberton et al. (1980) Can. J. Chem. Eng. 58:723-734ï¿½. The  BETA -glucosidase from Aureobasidium pullulans showed a synergistic interaction with cellulase to increase glucose production by 13.5% ï¿½Saha et al. (1995) In Enzymatic Degradation of Insoluble Carbohydrates, Eds.

      <br/>
      Technol. 14:407-412ï¿½. However, the increase in glucose production was not very significant, and therefore better  BETA -glucosidases with high specific activity and low product inhibition are urgently needed.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Inhibition by glucose, a common characteristic of  BETA -glucosidases, is an obvious constraint to be overcome for this enzyme to have industrial applications.
      <br/>
      Most  BETA -glucosidases studied were competitively inhibited by glucose.
      <br/>
      Some glucose inhibition constants for  BETA -glucosidases from various sources are shown in Table 8.  BETA -Glucosidase from T. reesei is more sensitive to glucose inhibition (Ki, 0.62 mM), while the Orpinomyces  BETA -glucosidase is much less sensitive (Ki, 8.75 mM).
      <br/>
      This could be why the increase of glucose production is so substantial when the Orpinomyces  BETA -glucosidase is added to the T. reesei cellulase preparation during cellulose hydrolysis.
      <br/>
      The Orpinomyces  BETA -glucosidase converted the accumulated cellobiose and other cello-oligosaccharides to glucose, which could not be achieved by the Trichoderma  BETA -glucosidase due to inhibition by relatively low concentrations of glucose.
      <br/>
      The total amount of glucose in the presence of Orpinomyces  BETA -glucosidase is 7 fold higher, which is more than the total moles of glucose and cellobiose together without supplementation, indicating that conversion of cellobiose to glucose greatly eliminates the cellobiose inhibition on Trichoderma endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases.
      <br/>
      This was also true when corn fiber was the substrate, where cellobiose accumulated with T. reesei cellulase alone and Orpinomyces  BETA -glucosidase converted the cellobiose completely to glucose.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In comparison to  BETA -glucosidase from A. niger,  BETA -glucosidase from Orpinomyces PC-2 was significantly more efficient in increasing glucose production when added to cellulose hydrolysis using T. reesei cellulases.
      <br/>
      Based on the data obtained using Avicel as substrate,  BETA -glucosidase from Orpinomyces was four times more effective in catalyzing glucose production than the Aspergillus  BETA -glucosidase.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Our results demonstrate that  BETA -glucosidase from the anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces PC-2 is superior to other glucosidases from fungi and bacteria.
      <br/>
      The high specific activity, low Km, and high Ki by glucose, and activity toward cello-oligosaccharides up to pento-oligosaccharide ï¿½Chen et al. (1994) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60:64-70ï¿½ should make the enzyme a suitable candidate for application in the hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose.

      It is well-known in the biological arts that certain amino acid substitutions may be made in protein sequences without affecting the function of the protein.
      <br/>
      Generally, conservative amino acid substitutions or substitutions of similar amino acids are tolerated without affecting protein function.
      <br/>
      Similar amino acids can be those that are similar in size and/or charge properties, for example, aspartate and glutamate, and isoleucine and valine, are both pairs of similar amino acids.
      <br/>
      Similarity between amino acid pairs has been assessed in the art in a number of ways.
      <br/>
      For example, Dayhoff et al. (1978) in Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, Volume 5, Supplement 3, Chapter 22, pp. 345-352, which is incorporated by reference herein provides frequency tables for amino acid substitutions which can be employed as a measure of amino acid similarity.
      <br/>
      Dayhoff et al.'s frequency tables are based on comparisons of amino acid sequences for proteins having the same function from a variety of evolutionarily different sources.

      Percentage of sequence identity for polynucleotides and polypeptides is determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences.
      <br/>
      The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.
      <br/>
      Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by computerized implementations of known algorithms (e.g., GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis., or BlastN and BlastX available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information), or by inspection.
      <br/>
      Sequences are typically compared using either BlastN or BlastX with default parameters.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Substantial identity of polynucleotide sequences means that a polynucleotide comprises a sequence that has at least 75% sequence identity, preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90% and most preferably at least 95%.
      <br/>
      Typically, two polypeptides are considered to be substantially identical if at least 40%, preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95% are identical or conservative substitutions.
      <br/>
      Sequences are preferably compared to a reference sequence using GAP using default parameters.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Polypeptides which are "substantially similar" share sequences as noted above except that residue positions which are not identical may differ by conservative amino acid changes.
      <br/>
      Conservative amino acid substitutions refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains.
      <br/>
      For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains is serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is lysine, arginine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur-containing side chains is cysteine and methionine.
      <br/>
      Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, and asparagine-glutamine.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Another indication that polynucleotide sequences are substantially identical is if two molecules selectively hybridize to each other under stringent conditions.
      <br/>
      Stringent conditions are sequence dependent and will be different in different circumstances.
      <br/>
      Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5 (degree)  C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH.
      <br/>
      The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of the target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe.
      <br/>
      Typically stringent conditions for a Southern blot protocol involve washing at 65 (degree)  C. with 0.2 * SSC.
