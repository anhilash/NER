    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to devices which discourage and detect tampering.
      <br/>
      More specifically, it relates to an innovative combination in which a security tag and a tag-receiving receptacle are used to maintain a container closure mechanism in a closed configuration until a flag portion of the security tag is separated from the tag stem portion.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Security devices for containers are well known.
      <br/>
      These security devices include various locks and seals.
      <br/>
      It is frequently desirable for containers to be secured in a closed configuration to discourage or at least detect tampering.
      <br/>
      While locks for containers are well known, users often find them inconvenient.
      <br/>
      Seals are well known for use with cargo containers.
      <br/>
      However, seals usually require specialized tools for installation and removal.
      <br/>
      Thus, it would be desirable to provide a device which would both discourage and detect tampering of a container, that could be easily used without tools.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The problems outlined above are in large measure solved by the tamper-proof security tag device in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The tamper-proof device hereof is easily installed on containers, such as luggage, which are closed by zippers, hasps and like devices.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Thus, there is provided a security tag assembly adapted for securing a container.
      <br/>
      The container may include a first member and a second member.
      <br/>
      The container may further include structure defining an aperture.
      <br/>
      The second member may be shiftable between an open orientation and a closed orientation relative to the first member.
      <br/>
      The security tag assembly may include a tag.
      <br/>
      The tag may include a stem removably receivable through the container second member aperture.
      <br/>
      The tag may further include a preventer operably coupled to the stem, the preventer not being receivable through the aperture.
      <br/>
      The security tag assembly may further include a tag receiving assembly.
      <br/>
      The tag receiving assembly may include a securing element adapted for fixedly, operably attaching the tag receiving assembly to the container first member.
      <br/>
      The tag receiving assembly may further include a tag receiving fastener for operably, irreversibly receiving the stem therein.
      <br/>
      The security tag assembly may be configured whereby the stem can be received through the second member aperture and be lockingly received within the tag receiving fastener when the first and second container members are in the closed orientation, such that shifting the first and second container members to the open configuration must be preceded by the severance of the tag.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      There is also provided a security tag assembly.
      <br/>
      The security tag assembly may include a tag and a tag receiving structure.
      <br/>
      The tag may include a stem with a cross sectional dimension and a preventer with a cross sectional dimension.
      <br/>
      A longitudinal axis of the stem may be generally transverse to the cross sectional dimensions of the stem and the preventer.
      <br/>
      The cross sectional dimension of the stem may be less than the cross sectional dimension of the preventer.
      <br/>
      The tag receiving structure may unidirectionally receive the stem therein.
      <br/>
      The tag receiving structure may unidirectionally receive a cross sectional dimension less than the cross sectional dimension of the preventer.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      There is also provided a method of installing a tamper-proof seal assembly on a container with a closure assembly.
      <br/>
      The closure assembly may define an opening therein.
      <br/>
      The method may include the step of mounting a first outer button on a first surface of the container, proximate the closure assembly.
      <br/>
      The method may further include the steps of providing a tag with a stem and a preventer, and inserting the stem through the opening in the closure assembly, the opening accommodating a passage of a portion of the stem therethrough, the opening not accommodating passage of the keeper.
      <br/>
      The method may further include the step of mounting a second outer button on a second surface of the container proximate the closure assembly and opposite the first outer button.
      <br/>
      The step of mounting the first outer button may include mating a first inner button to the first outer button.
      <br/>
      The method may further comprise the steps of providing a tag with a stem and a preventer, the first and second outer button accommodating an irreversible insertion of the stem, the first and second outer button further not accommodating an insertion of the preventer; irreversibly inserting the stem through the first outer button; and irreversibly inserting the stem into the second outer button.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="8">
      Comprehension of the present invention can be gained through reference to the drawings in conjunction with a thorough review of the following explanation.
      <br/>
      In order to facilitate a full appreciation of the invention, an overview of the preferred embodiment is initially provided.
      <br/>
      The overview is followed by more detailed explanation.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A container, specifically a piece of luggage, employing a tamper-proof seal assembly in accordance with the present invention is depicted in the figures.
      <br/>
      The tamper-proof seal assembly operates in cooperation with closure devices such as the zipper of FIG. 1, or the hinged opening assembly depicted in FIGS. 6, 8.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Referring to the figures, container 10 may be a suitcase, a valise, a briefcase, or the like.
      <br/>
      Tamper-proof seal assembly 38 is installed on container 10.
      <br/>
      Container 10 includes closable luggage members 14, 18.
      <br/>
      Of course, one or more luggage members may be included in the closable containers of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Each closable luggage member 14, 18 includes a plurality of panels 22, at least one peripheral member 26, opening 30 and, closure assembly 34.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, panels 22 are made of flexible materials with a desired degree of stiffness.
      <br/>
      Also in this embodiment, peripheral member 26 is bonded to each of two panels 22 about their peripheries.
      <br/>
      Bonding of peripheral member 26 to panels 22 may be accomplished by sewing, stitching, or other means known to the art.
      <br/>
      Opening 30 is present within one of panels 22.
      <br/>
      However, opening 30 could also be present within peripheral member 26.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Exemplary closure assembly 34 extends across opening 30.
      <br/>
      Closure assembly 34 is a zipper in this embodiment.
      <br/>
      Closure assembly 34, in turn, includes chain 42 and closure mechanism 46.
      <br/>
      Chain 42 includes upper face 50 and lower face 54.
      <br/>
      Upper face 50 and lower face 54 each include a tape member 58 and a number of teeth 62.
      <br/>
      Teeth 62 are bonded to tape member 58 by means known to the art.
      <br/>
      Closure mechanism 46 includes slide 66, shackle 70, and pull tab 74.
      <br/>
      Slide 66 displays upper surface 75.
      <br/>
      Shackle 70 extends above upper surface 75.
      <br/>
      Shackle 70, in turn, defines opening 76 therewithin.
      <br/>
      Pull tab 74 is a generally planar member in this embodiment and defines openings 78, 82.
      <br/>
      Slide 66 functions to close and open closure assembly 34 by interlocking and separating opposing teeth 62.
      <br/>
      Opening 78 allows pull tab 74 to be affixed to shackle 70.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIG. 5, dimension 84 is the maximum span of opening 82.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Returning to FIGS. 2-5, tamper-proof seal assembly 12 includes security tag 88 and button assembly 90.
      <br/>
      Security tag 88, in turn, includes stem 94 and flag (or preventer) 96.
      <br/>
      Stem 94 may be envisioned as including longitudinal axis 98, cross sectional dimension 100 and length 101.
      <br/>
      Cross sectional dimension 100 may be generally transverse to longitudinal axis 98.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, stem 94 displays first side 102 and second side 104 and terminates distally from flag 96 in tip 105.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, tip 105 is generally rounded.
      <br/>
      Ribs 106 may be defined on first side 102 and extend generally transversely to longitudinal axis 98.
      <br/>
      Ribs 106 are generally serrate in cross section.
      <br/>
      Apices of ribs 106 may be angled generally toward flag 96.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Exemplary planar flag 96 is rectangular in geometry.
      <br/>
      However, various geometries for flag 96 such as circular, diamond, and square are within the scope of this invention.
      <br/>
      Dimensionally flag 96 may be envisioned as including cross sectional dimension 108 and length 110.
      <br/>
      Lengths 101 and 110 combine to form a total length 111 for security tag 88 in this embodiment.
      <br/>
      Cross section 108 may be generally transverse to longitudinal axis 98.
      <br/>
      Cross section 108 represents the longest dimension of flag 96 which is generally transverse to longitudinal axis 98.
      <br/>
      However, if flag 96 is attached to a site on stem 94 other than an end, cross section 108 would also include any maximum dimension of flag 96 which is generally transverse to longitudinal axis 98.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment flag 96 extends from an end of stem 94.
      <br/>
      However, flag 96 may be attached to stem 94 at a point other than an end thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Optionally present on flag 96 is an indicia display means such as space 112.
      <br/>
      Space 112 or other indicia display means may be used advantageously for labeling stem 94 with identification, destination, or other desired information.
      <br/>
      Space 112 may also include other means for displaying indicia such as a liquid crystal display (LCD).
      <br/>
      If present, the LCD may be in communication with an electromagnetic receiver.
      <br/>
      Alternately, space 112 may be used to affix various labels preprinted with information.
      <br/>
      Security tag 88 may include a range of colors.
      <br/>
      These colors may be considered to be included in the indicia display means.
      <br/>
      In this invention the term color includes the optical properties described as clear, translucent, opaque and black.
      <br/>
      Moreover, flag 96 may assume a plurality of geometric shapes as discussed below.
      <br/>
      These shapes are included in indicia display means as well.

      Stem 94 is an elongate member and is integral with flag 96 in this embodiment.
      <br/>
      Stem 94 may have a generally constant width.
      <br/>
      Exemplary fatigue score 114 represents a constricted, generally linear portion extending between stem 94 and flag 96.
      <br/>
      However, fatigue score 114 also includes other embodiments such as perforations.

      Button assembly 90 includes outer button 120 and inner button 122.
      <br/>
      Outer button 120 includes base portion 124, shank 126, and covering member 128.
      <br/>
      Outer button 120 is frusto-spherically shaped in this embodiment.

      <br/>
      Insert 138 is disposed in a central portion of tunnel 136.
      <br/>
      Although insert 138 is a separate piece in this embodiment, insert 138 may be integrally formed with base portion 124 as well.
      <br/>
      Ratchet 140 extends from an interior surface of insert 138.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, ratchet 140 extends from a bottom portion of insert 138 at an angle between about 20 (degree)  and 45 (degree)  therefrom.
      <br/>
      Shank 126 extends generally from a central portion of lower surface 132.
      <br/>
      Shank 126 terminates in tip 142.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a plurality of annular ribs 144 are defined on shank 126.
      <br/>
      Annular ribs 144 are generally serrate in cross section.
      <br/>
      Other attachment alternatives to shank 126 include screws, adhesives, and rivets.

      <br/>
      In this embodiment, constriction 156 is present at the base of bore 154, proximate inner surface 148.
      <br/>
      As in the case of outer button 120, exemplary inner button 122 is frusto-conical in shape as well.

      In the present embodiment, base portion 124 is approximately 22 mm in diameter, has a maximum thickness of about 7 mm and a minimum thickness of approximately 3 mm at its periphery.
      <br/>
      Shank 126 is approximately 7 mm in length and 5 mm in diameter.
      <br/>
      Ribs 144 are approximately 2 mm in length.
      <br/>
      Shank 126 may be formed separately from outer button 120.

      To install tamper-proof seal assembly 12, a circular opening is made in panel 22.
      <br/>
      This circular opening should be situated such that button assembly 90 is proximate opening 82 of pull tab 74 when closure assembly 34 is in a closed configuration.
      <br/>
      Shank 126 is then pushed through the circular opening in panel 22.
      <br/>
      If shank 126 is made of a sufficiently rigid material, shank 126 may be used directly to pierce panel 22.
      <br/>
      Outer button 120 is then rotated until ratchet 140 points away from pull tab 74.
      <br/>
      Inner button 122 is then installed on the opposite side of panel 22.
      <br/>
      To install inner button 122, bore 154 is aligned with shank 126.
      <br/>
      Outer button 120 and inner button 122 are then pressed together, thereby forcing shank 126 into bore 154 and annular ribs 144 through constriction 156.
      <br/>
      Shank 126 is thus securely held within bore 154 by the cooperation of ribs 144 and constriction 156.
      <br/>
      An adhesive may also be applied to respective surfaces 132, 148, of outer button 120 and inner button 122 further securing them in place.

      In use, the tamper-proof seal assembly is installed as described above.
      <br/>
      Security tag 88 is installed by inserting stem 94 through opening 82.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, stem 94 may be inserted through opening 76.
      <br/>
      Stem 94 is further inserted through tunnel 136.
      <br/>
      During insertion, ribs 106 repeatedly engage and displace the tip of ratchet 140.
      <br/>
      Stem 94 is thus inserted until stem 94 is snugly against pull tab 74.
      <br/>
      In this position, stem 94 may not be withdrawn from tunnel 136 due to the orientation of ratchet 140 against a rib 106.
      <br/>
      Thus, ratchet 140 accommodates an irreversible insertion of stem 94.
      <br/>
      The present tamper-proof seal assembly is now installed.
      <br/>
      To remove the tamper-proof seal assembly, flag 96 is grasped and bent away from, then toward pull tab 74 repeatedly.
      <br/>
      After a series of bendings, flag 96 will separate from stem 94 along fatigue score 114 in the direction of arrow 158.
      <br/>
      Stem 94 may now be withdrawn from tunnel 136 by pulling separated stem 94 away from pull tab 74 in the direction of arrow 160.
