    <p num="5">
      Heat barriers are assemblies of one or more materials intended to limit the heat transfer towards or from parts and components of fittings in many household or industrial devices.
      <br/>
      It is possible, for example, to mention the use of heat barriers in heating or cooking devices, smoothing irons where the hot part is attached to the body and near heat insulation; in automobiles, at a number of points such as the turbocompressor, the exhaust system, insulation of the cabin, and the like; and in aeronautics, for example on the rear part of compressors and jet engines.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Heat barriers are sometimes employed in isolation in the form of screening, but very frequently they are used directly in combination with the source of heat or the part to be protected for reasons of mechanical behavior.
      <br/>
      Thus, use is made of sheets of mica, of ceramic plates and the like in electrical household appliances by fitting them by screwing or adhesive bonding, or else of sheets of agglomerated glass wool which are supported by a sheet of metal.
      <br/>
      A particularly advantageous process for attaching a heat barrier to a part, in particular to a metal part, consists in depositing onto a substrate the material forming the barrier in the form of a layer of thickness determined by a thermal-spraying technique such as, for example, plasma spraying.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      It is very frequently recommended to use the heat barrier, which may furthermore comprise a number of layers, in combination with other materials which are also deposited as a layer by thermal spraying.
      <br/>
      These other materials may be intended to provide the barrier with protection against external actions such as, for example, mechanical impacts, a corrosive environment and the like, or else to make it easier to bond to the underlying substrate.
      <br/>
      This point is particularly important in the case of heat barriers operating in heat cycling conditions or at high temperature.
      <br/>
      The mechanical stresses which then exist at the interface with the substrate and result from the differences in the thermal expansion coefficients of the substrate and of the deposit quickly lead to damage of the barrier by shearing, when they do not prohibit its use.
      <br/>
      To overcome this disadvantage, use is frequently made of an intermediate deposit, called bond coat, which becomes plastic in the working temperature region of the barrier, and this eliminates the stresses at the barrier interface.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The material most frequently employed in aeronautics to form heat barriers is yttriated zirconia, which withstands very high temperatures.
      <br/>
      The deposition of the zirconia is carried out by plasma spraying using a conventional technique starting with the powdered material.
      <br/>
      Zirconia has a low thermal diffusivity ( ALPHA =10-6 m2 /s).
      <br/>
      However, it has a relatively high specific mass  RHO , and this constitutes a disadvantage in certain applications; moreover, some of its mechanical properties, such as hardness and resistance to wear and to abrasion, are low.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Other materials are employed as heat barrier.
      <br/>
      Mention may be made of alumina, which has a specific mass lower than that of zirconia, and a diffusivity and specific heat which are higher than that of zirconia, but whose mechanical properties are not satisfactory.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to mention stainless steels and some refractory steels which offer heat insulation properties but which have a high specific mass.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">The objective of the present invention is to provide heat protection elements in the form of heat barrier or in the form of bond coat for heat barriers, exhibiting good thermal insulation properties, good mechanical properties, a low specific mass, good resistance to corrosion, especially to oxidation, and great ease of processing.</p>
    <p num="11">
      An element for heat protection of a substrate of the present invention is characterized in that it consists of a material which is deposited on the substrate by thermal spraying and which consists essentially of a quasicrystalline aluminum alloy exhibiting a thermal diffusivity, measured at ambient temperature, which is lower than 2.5 * 10-6 m2 /s, and a thermal diffusivity measured in the temperature range 650-750 (degree)  C. which does not exceed the thermal diffusivity measured at ambient temperature by more than a factor of 3.
      <br/>
      The diffusivity at ambient temperature is preferably lower than 1.6 * 10-6 m2 /s.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="13">
      In the present text "quasicrystalline alloy" is intended to mean an alloy consisting of one or a number of quasicrystalline phases which are either quasicrystalline phases in the strict sense, or approximating phases.
      <br/>
      Quasicrystalline phases in the strict sense are phases which have symmetries of rotation that are normally incompatible with the symmetry of translation, that is to say symmetries with an axis of rotation of order 5, 8, 10 and 12, these symmetries being disclosed by radiation diffraction.
      <br/>
      By way of example there may be mentioned the icosahedral phase of point group m35 (cf. D. Shechtman, I. Blech, D. Gratias, J. W. Cahn, Metallic Phase with Long-Range Orientational Order and No Translational Symmetry, Physical Review Letters, Vol. 53, No. 20, 1984, pages 1951-1953) and the decagonal phase of point group 10/mmm (cf. L. Bendersky, Quasicrystal with One Dimensional Translational Symmetry and a Tenfold Rotation Axis, Physical Review Letters, Vol. 55, No. 14, 1985, pages 1461-1463).
      <br/>
      The x-ray diffraction pattern of a true decagonal phase has been published in "Diffraction approach to the structure of decagonal quasicrystals, J. M. Dubois, C. Janot, J. Pannetier, A. Pianelli, Physics Letters A 117-8 (1986) 421-427".
    </p>
    <p num="14">The approximating phases or approximating compounds are true crystals insofar as their crystallographic structure remains compatible with the symmetry of translation, but which, in the electron diffraction pattern, exhibit diffraction figures whose symmetry is close to the axes of rotation 5, 8, 10 or 12.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Among these phases it is possible to cite as an example the orthorhombic phase O1, characteristic of an alloy which has the atomic composition Al65 Cu20 Fe10 Cr5, the lattice constants of which are: ao(1) =2.366, bo(1) =1.267, co(1) =3.252, in nanometers.
      <br/>
      This orthorhombic phase O1 is said to be approximating the decagonal phase.
      <br/>
      It is furthermore so close to it that its x-ray diffraction pattern cannot be distinguished from that of the decagonal phase.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      It is also possible to cite the rhombohedral phase with constants aR =3.208 nm,  ALPHA =36 (degree) , present in the alloys of composition close to Al64 Cu24 Fe12 in number of atoms (M.
      <br/>
      Audier and P. Guyot, Microcrystalline AlFeCu Phase of Pseudo Icosahedral Symmetry, in Quasicrystals, eds. M. V. Jaric and S. Lundqvist, World Scientific, Singapore, 1989).
      <br/>

      The materials employed for the production of heat protection elements according to the present invention have thermal diffusivity values  ALPHA  close to 10-6 m2 /s which are very comparable to thermal diffusivity of zirconia.
      <br/>
      Bearing in mind the lower specific mass  RHO  of these materials, the thermal conductivity  LAMBDA = ALPHA  RHO Cp in the vicinity of the ambient temperature does not exhibit any significant difference in relation to that of zirconia.
      <br/>
      The quasicrystalline alloys are therefore suitable substitutes for replacing many heat barrier materials, and in particular zirconia, in comparison with which they offer advantages of low specific mass and of excellent mechanical properties insofar as hardness and improved resistance to wear, to abrasion, to scratching and to corrosion are concerned.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The diffusivity of the materials constituting the heat protection elements of the present invention is reduced when the porosity of the materials increases.
      <br/>
      The porosity of a quasicrystalline alloy can be increased by an appropriate heat treatment.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, the alloy Al63.5 Cu24 Fe12.5, produced in the crude state, has a porosity of the order of 3%, measured on a metallographic section by conventional image analysis.
      <br/>
      After a heat treatment for three hours at 850 (degree)  C. the porosity is of the order of 8%.
      <br/>
      It is particularly advantageous to employ quasicrystalline alloys which have a porosity higher than 10%.

    <p num="27">
      The materials constituting the heat protection elements of the present invention may contain a small proportion of heat-conductive particles, for example crystals of metallic aluminum.
      <br/>
      The heat conduction of the material will be dominated by the conduction properties of the matrix as long as the particles do not coalesce, that is to say that their proportion by volume remains below the percolation threshold.
      <br/>
      In the case of approximately spherical particles which have a narrowly distributed radius this threshold lies in the region of 20%.
      <br/>
      This condition implies that the material constituting the heat protection element should contain at least 80% by volume of quasicrystalline phases as defined above.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      At temperatures which are lower than approximately 700 (degree)  C. the heat protection elements can be employed as heat barriers.
      <br/>
      Such temperature conditions correspond to most of the household applications or those in the automobile field.
      <br/>
      In addition, they are highly capable of withstanding the stresses due to the expansion of the support, and their expansion coefficient is intermediate between that of metal alloys and that of insulating oxides.
      <br/>
      In the case of temperatures which are higher than approximately 600 (degree)  C. the quasicrystalline alloys constituting heat barriers may preferably contain stabilizing elements chosen from W, Zr, Ti, Rh, Nb, Hf and Ta.
      <br/>
      The content of stabilizing element is lower than or equal to 2% in number of atoms.

      The heat barriers of the present invention may be multilayer barriers which have an alternation of layers of materials which are good heat conductors and of layers of materials which are poor conductors (quasicrystalline alloys).
      <br/>
      Such structures form, for example, abradable heat barriers.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      For applications in which the temperatures reach values higher than approximately 600 (degree)  C., the heat protection elements of the present invention can be employed as bonding underlayer for a layer which is used as heat barrier and consists of a material of the prior art such as zirconia.
      <br/>
      In these temperature ranges the materials constituting the heat protection elements of the present invention become superplastic.
      <br/>
      They therefore correspond well to the conditions of use which are required for the production of a bonding underlayer, while being capable themselves of taking part in the insulation of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Thus, the heat protection elements of the present invention can be employed to within a few tens of degrees of the melting point of the material of which they consist.
      <br/>
      This limit lies in the region from 950 (degree)  C. to 1200 (degree)  C., depending on the composition.

      <br/>
      The flow rate of the combustion gases was carefully controlled and kept constant throughout the experiment.
      <br/>
      Two series of experiments were conducted: one with the test pieces initially at 20 (degree)  C. and the other with the test pieces initially at 650 (degree)  C.

    <p num="62">
      Sample C0 makes it possible to define three parameters which summarize the results of the experiment, namely the maximum difference P in temperature between the two thermocouples,  DELTA T/ DELTA t the rate of temperature rise of the side thermocouple 4 during the pulse and the temperature increment  DELTA T produced in the center of the test piece (thermocouple 3).
      <br/>
      These data appear in Table 2.
      <br/>
      These results show that the protection elements of the present invention, employed as a heat barrier, have a performance which is at least equivalent to that of zirconia.

    <p num="63">
      In samples C6 and A2 the heat protection elements of the present invention constitute an underlayer.
      <br/>
      It was found that the zirconia layer of sample C3 did not stand up to more than three heat pulses and was fissured from the first pulse onwards.
      <br/>
      In the case of sample C6, also subjected to a series of heat pulses, the surface temperature of the zirconia deposit, measured by a third thermocouple placed in contact with the deposit at the end of the tests, became stabilized at 1200 (degree)  C. The experiment involved 50 pulses and sample C6 resisted without apparent damage, although the coefficient of expansion of copper is close to twice that of the quasicrystalline alloy, which would imply high shear stresses at the substrate/deposit interface, if the underlayer material did not become plastic.
      <br/>
      The heat protection elements of the present invention are therefore well suited for the production of bond coats, in particular for heat barriers.

    <p num="67">
      Samples A0 and A1 were employed to evaluate the suitability of the alloys of the invention for heat-insulating a device.
      <br/>
      A comparison was made in relation to the properties of a zirconia barrier provided with a bonding layer (sample A2).
      <br/>
      Each of the samples was equipped with 3 thermocouples T1, T2 and T3 as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      A stream of hot air at a constant flow rate was passed through the stainless steel tube forming the substrate of each sample.
      <br/>
      The temperature of the air at the entry, measured with the aid of the thermocouple T1, was 300 +- 2 (degree)  C. The surface temperature, measured with the aid of the thermocouple T3, was recorded as a function of time starting with the switching-on of the hot air generator.
      <br/>
      Thermocouple T2 made it possible to verify that the transient conditions for establishing the hot air flow were identical in the case of all the measurements.

    <p num="68">
      FIG. 6 shows the change in the surface temperature of each of the samples A0, A1 and A2 as a function of me.
      <br/>
      The surface temperature of sample A0 (without coating) exceeds that of the zirconia sample by approximately 35 (degree)  C. at equilibrium.
      <br/>
      The heat protection elements of the present invention give results close to that for the zirconia layer, since a temperature difference of only 10 (degree)  C. is measured between sample A1 (quasicrystalline coating) and sample A2 (zirconia coating used as reference).
