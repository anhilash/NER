    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a semiconductor apparatus having an array of memory cells each comprising complex oxides for forming an insulation film of an information storing capacitor thereof and a manufacturing method therefor, and more particularly to structures of a wiring portion for connecting a cell transistor and a cell capacitor, a contact portion of a bit line and a memory cell in a ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM) having a ferroelectric insulation film for a capacitor and a method of forming the same, and to a structure of a memory cell of a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) having an array of dynamic memory cells having a capacitor insulation film made of dielectric material and a method of forming the same.</p>
    <p num="2">In recent years, a non-volatile ferroelectric memory cell (a FRAM cell) and a FRAM having the foregoing memory cell array comprising, as an interelectrode insulation film of a capacitor for storing information, a ferroelectric thin film made of a material having a perovskite structure or a layered perovskite structure have attracted attention.</p>
    <p num="3">The ferroelectric film has a characteristic such that electric polarization generated once when an electric field has been applied is retained even if the electric field is removed and the direction of the polarization is inverted when an electric field having intensity exceeding a certain level is applied into a direction opposite to the direction of the foregoing electric field.</p>
    <p num="4">Taking notice of the characteristic of the dielectric material for inverting the direction of polarization, a technique has been developed to realize a FRAM cell by employing a ferroelectric material to form an insulation film of an information storing capacitor of a memory cell.</p>
    <p num="5">
      The FRAM cell has a structure in which a ferroelectric capacitor is substituted for a capacitor of a DRAM cell.
      <br/>
      The FRAM employs a method (a data destructive reading method) in which a charge in a polarization switched or non-switched state is fetched from a ferroelectric capacitor through a switching MOS transistor.
      <br/>
      Thus, the FRAM has a characteristic that data written and stored on a memory cell is not lost even if the operating power source is turned off.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The FRAM, which is the non-volatile memory, has a characteristic such that the FRAM does not require a refreshing operation to store data and no electric power is-required in a standby mode, as compared with the DRAM which is a representative large-capacity memory.
      <br/>
      When the FRAM is compared with a flash memory, which is another non-volatile memory, the FRAM has a characteristic that a great number of data rewriting times is permitted and data can significantly quickly be rewritten.
      <br/>
      When the FRAM is compared with a SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) which is used in a memory card or the like and which is needed to be backed up by a battery, the FRAM has characteristics that the electric power consumption can be reduced and the area of the cell can significantly be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The FRAM having the above-mentioned characteristics are significantly expected to be substituted for the conventional DRAM, the flash memory and the SRAM and applied to a logic circuit consolidation device and the like.
      <br/>
      Since the FRAM is able to operate at high speed without any battery, development to a non-contact ID card (RF-ID: Radio Frequency-Identification Data) has been commenced.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The structure of the memory cell in the FRAM is classified into two main types.
      <br/>
      One of the structures is arranged such that a ferroelectric film is, in place of a para-electric film, used to form a storage capacity which is as well as employed in the DRAM and which is arranged to store a charge capacity serving as information.
      <br/>
      Another structure is arranged such that a ferroelectric film is, in place of a silicon oxide film, employed to form a gate insulation film of the MOSFET.
      <br/>
      The latter structure, having no appropriate ferroelectric film which can directly be formed on a silicon layer, cannot practically be used.
      <br/>
      Since the latter structure has simply been suggested until today, the FRAM is usually the former structure.
    </p>
    <p num="9">The FRAM cell includes a 1-transistor/1-capacitor (abbreviated to 1T/1C) structure composed of one transistor Q and one ferroelectric capacitor C as shown in FIG. 1 and a 2-transistor/2-capacitor (abbreviated to 2T/2C) structure composed of two transistors Q1 and Q2 and two ferroelectric capacitors C1 and C2, for example, as shown in FIG. 3A.</p>
    <p num="10">
      Although the 1T/1C structure has an advantage in that a dense integration similarly to the DRAM is permitted, variation of the ferroelectric characteristics of the memory cells and variation of deterioration must be prevented in order to realize memory cells capable of preventing variation of their characteristics.
      <br/>
      Thus, the foregoing structure has a problem in that the manufacturing yield and the reliability as the device cannot easily be improved.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Although the 2T/2C structure has a problem in that an area which is two times the area required for the 1T/1C is required, a great characteristic margin is permitted and thus the manufacturing yield and the reliability as the device can be improved.</p>
    <p num="12">Both of the foregoing structures are formed such that a stacked structure of an electrode/ferroelectric member/electrode is formed on the base insulation film, Al or Cu wiring is performed through a contact hole formed in the oxide film on the stacked structure, and a passivation film is formed to serve as a protective film.</p>
    <p num="13">
      Since the FRAM cell is able to operate at high speed with small electric power consumption and a highly integrated structure is expected as described above, the reduction of the area for the memory cells and a manufacturing process which does not considerably deteriorate the ferroelectric member must be realized.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a multilayer wiring technique has not been established which is required when the conventional FRAM is consolidated with another device or when a highly integrated structure is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The reason why the semiconductor integrated circuit having the FRAM device mounted thereon cannot easily be formed into a multilayered wiring structure is that the ferroelectric material has a low tolerance to a reducing atmosphere (in particular, a hydrogen atmosphere).
      <br/>
      Since the conventional LSI processes almost include a process in which hydrogen is mixed, a critical problem arises when the FRAM is manufactured.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      As an example of the process in which hydrogen is mixed, a process for plugging a via hole in a multilayered wiring structure is exemplified.
      <br/>
      As a method of embedding a via hole having a large aspect ratio, a process for embedding tungsten by a CVD method is usually employed.
      <br/>
      Since the process for embedding tungsten encounters generation of a multiplicity of hydrogen groups, the ferroelectric is damaged critically.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The foregoing problem will specifically be described.</p>
    <p num="17">Hitherto, the ferroelectric memory cell has been formed by (1) a structure in which a bit line is formed later such that a ferroelectric capacitor is formed below the bit line; and (2) a structure in which the bit line is formed previously such that the bit line is formed below the ferroelectric capacitor.</p>
    <p num="18">
      When the ferroelectric memory cell is manufactured which has the structure in which the bit line is formed later, the ferroelectric capacitor is formed on a switching MOS transistor.
      <br/>
      Then, a lower electrode of the ferroelectric capacitor and the MOS transistor are connected to each other by a polysilicon plug, and then the bit line is formed on the ferroelectric capacitor.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      When the ferroelectric capacitor is formed, the lower electrode of the ferroelectric capacitor is formed by, usually, using Pt (platinum) on the polysilicon plug, followed by forming the ferroelectric thin film.
      <br/>
      When the ferroelectric thin film is crystallized, oxidation annealing at high temperatures must be performed.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      When PZT (lead-zirconate-titanate) is employed as the ferroelectric material, a defect caused from diffusion of Pb in the PZT occurring due to insufficient oxidation results in deterioration of the characteristics of the capacitor.
      <br/>
      To prevent this, sufficient oxidation must be performed in which oxidation annealing must be performed usually at 600 (degree)  C. to 700 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="21">When a bismuth layered compound, such as SBT (strontium-bismuth-tantalate), is employed as the ferroelectric material, the oxidation annealing must be performed at high temperatures of about 800 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="22">However, the foregoing high temperature oxidation annealing encounters a problem in that the lower electrode including Pt reacts with the polysilicon plug and thus formed into silicide or the polysilicon plug is unintentionally oxidized.</p>
    <p num="23">
      When the ferroelectric memory cell having the structure in which the bit line is formed previously is manufactured, the bit line is formed on the switching transistor.
      <br/>
      Then, the ferroelectric capacitor is formed on the bit line.
      <br/>
      When the lower electrode (including, for example, Pt) of the ferroelectric capacitor and the switching transistor are, in this case, connected to each other by a polysilicon plug, there arises a problem similar to that experienced with the structure in which the bit line is formed later.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Accordingly, an upper electrode connection structure has been suggested in which an upper electrode of the ferroelectric capacitor and the switching transistor are directly connected to each other by a local electric line in the form of an embedded electric line.
      <br/>
      The foregoing structure has an advantage that the pattern layout of the ferroelectric capacitor can relatively freely be determined.
      <br/>
      When the ferroelectric capacitor is disposed on both the switching transistor region and the device isolation region, a precise structure can be realized.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The above-mentioned structure in which the bit line is formed previously and the upper electrode is connected is formed by the steps of forming the portion from the lower electrode (a plate electrode) of the ferroelectric capacitor to the upper electrode, and depositing a film for protecting the capacitor.
      <br/>
      Then, the local wiring for directly connecting the upper electrode and the switching transistor to each other is formed by opening, in the film for protecting the capacitor, a contact portion with the upper electrode and a contact portion with an active layer of the transistor.
      <br/>
      Then, the wiring film is deposited in the opening portions, followed by performing a patterning operation.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In the structure in which the bit line is formed previously and the upper electrode is connected, the operation for connecting the lower electrode (including, for example, Pt) of the ferroelectric capacitor and the switching transistor to each other by the polysilicon plug does not raise the above-mentioned problem in that the lower electrode reacts with the polysilicon plug and the same is formed into silicide.
      <br/>
      However, the aspect ratio and step coverage which are required to form a precise structure result in that the local wiring for directly connecting the upper electrode and the transistor to each other cannot easily be formed.

    <p num="27">
      When the PZT or BST (barium-strontium-titanate) is employed as the ferroelectric material, the reducing atmosphere included in the CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) process for forming the wiring after the ferroelectric thin film has been formed raises a problem.
      <br/>
      In this case, there arises a problem in that the characteristics of the ferroelectric material deteriorate owning to the reduction reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="28">That is, when the local wiring for connecting the upper electrode and the switching transistor to each other is formed such that tungsten plug is embedded by forming a tungsten film in an intense reducing atmosphere (hydrogen type gas) in a metal CVD apparatus which has been employed to manufacture the DRAM, the characteristics (electric characteristics, such as remanant polarization) of the ferroelectric capacitor deteriorate.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Also in a case where the local wiring for connecting the upper electrode and the switching transistor to each other is formed such that a MO (Metallo-Organic) CVD is employed to form an aluminum wiring film, the characteristics of the ferroelectric capacitor deteriorate.
      <br/>
      The reason for this is that the hydrogen group components including the source materials cannot completely be removed and thus the reducing atmosphere retains.
    </p>
    <p num="30">When PZT or BST is employed as the ferroelectric material, noble metal, such as Pt, Ir, an Ir oxide (IrO2), Ru, a Ru oxide (RuO2), a LSCO (lanthanum-strontium-cobalt or copper-oxide) or SRO (strontium-ruthenium-oxide) or other conductive oxides can be employed.</p>
    <p num="31">
      However, the foregoing materials cannot easily precisely be processed to sub-micron level of about 0.5  MU m by RIE (reactive ion etching), ion milling or ECR etching (electron cyclotron resonance etching).
      <br/>
      In particular, Pt cannot easily precisely be processed to be used to form a precise ferroelectric capacitor.
      <br/>
      However, the ferroelectric memory cell must precisely be formed to design a highly integrated ferroelectric Memory.
      <br/>
      To form a precise memory cell, it is an important fact to precisely form the upper electrode of the ferroelectric capacitor.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      On the other hand, the degree of integration of the semiconductor memory has been raised year after year.
      <br/>
      Although the size has been reduced, the electric capacity of the dielectric capacitor for storing charges must be not smaller than about 30 fF.
      <br/>
      To achieve this, the effective area of the capacitor must be enlarged, the thickness of the dielectric film must be reduced or the dielectric constant of dielectric material must be raised.
      <br/>
      The conventional technique for DRAM has been attempted to stereoscopically form the capacitor and reduce the thickness of the same by mainly improving the two former factors.
      <br/>
      However, the stereoscopically forming the capacitor by the conventional SiO2 type dielectric film and reducing the thickness of the film have limitations.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a technique for depositing a thin film of a dielectric material having a high dielectric constant has been required.
    </p>
    <p num="33">When a capacitor having the stacked structure of the electrode/the ferroelectric material/the electrode which is employed in the FRAM or the that having the stacked structure of the electrode/the dielectric material having a higher dielectric constant/the electrode which is employed in the DRAM is manufactured, the noble metal, such as Pt, Ir, Ru, IrO2, RuO2, LSCO or SRO or the conductive oxides are, as described above, employed as the material of the electrode.</p>
    <p num="34">
      As the ferroelectric material for the FRAM cell capacitor, an oxide including perovskite structure, such as PZT (Pb (Zr, Ti) O3), SBT (SrBi2 (Ta, Nb)2) or BIT (Bi4 Ti3 O12) or an oxide in the form in which a substitutional element is substituted for a portion of each of the foregoing oxides is employed.
      <br/>
      As the dielectric material of the DRAM cell capacitor, BST ((Ba, Sr) TiO3) or the like is employed.
    </p>
    <p num="35">As a method of forming the ferroelectric film or the dielectric film, a spin coating method, such as sputtering, laser ablation, CVD, MOD (Metallo-Organic Decomposition) or sol-gel method or a LSMCD (Liquid Source Misted Chemical Deposition) method in which a mist MOD material is guided to an upper surface of a wafer by a carrier gas to deposit the material while using ultraviolet rays for assistance are known.</p>
    <p num="36">
      The sputtering method is a film forming method with which mass production can satisfactorily be performed.
      <br/>
      Since two electrodes (made of metal or a conductive oxide) on both sides of the dielectric material can be formed by the same sputtering method, the throughput can easily be improved.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Since the sputtering method and the laser ablation method are methods each having the step of forming the film in an atmospheric gas of N2, Ar, Ar/O2 or the like, unintentional introduction of the components of the gas into the film cannot be prevented during the film forming process.
      <br/>
      Thus, voids are, due to the retained gas, formed in a complex oxide film (an oxide film containing at least two or more types of metal elements).
      <br/>
      As a result, there arises a problem in that a dense oxide film cannot be formed.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In actual, a sputter gas of Ar or the like is detected from the film immediate after the deposition process.
      <br/>
      The above-mentioned methods have the step of guiding gas molecules near the target with large energy of plasma so as to be made incident upon the film.
      <br/>
      Since the foregoing mechanism is different from diffusion or the like, large energy is retained and residual gas can easily be implanted into the film as the sputtering pressure is low.
      <br/>
      Since the film immediate after the deposition is an amorphous film or a crystal film having a low density, the residual gas can be dispersed and thus the gas is inconspicuous.
      <br/>
      However, if the film is subjected to a heat treatment for crystallization, the residual gas is left in the grain boundary and/or the interface of the crystal and thus apparent voids are formed.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      If the heat treatment is performed in a short time, large voids are formed in the grains as well as in the grain boundary and the interface.
      <br/>
      Since also the film forming process, such as the CVD or the LSMCD, uses a carrier gas for introducing the raw material into the chamber, the carrier gas is introduced into the film.
      <br/>
      Thus, voids are formed in the comp lex oxide film attributable to the residual gas, similarly to the sputtering process.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The size of the void is determined when the annealing process is performed after the film forming process to crystallize the film or to raise the density.
      <br/>
      If the annealing operation is a rapid thermal processing in which the rate at which the temperature is raised is high, apparent voids are formed.
      <br/>
      That is, the crystallizing annealing operation of the complex oxide film, required to perform the rapid thermal processing in order to minimize diffusion and evaporation, encounters a problem in that a dense film cannot be formed because of the above-mentioned problems.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      However, a ferroelectric film having a low film density suffers from reduction of the polarization quantity and thus a satisfactory operating margin cannot be realized.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it cannot be operated with low voltages.
      <br/>
      What is worse, short circuit easily occurs when a thin film is formed.
      <br/>
      There arises another problem in that the characteristics are excessively changed attributable to the atmosphere in the post process.
      <br/>
      If voids are formed in also the electrode film because of the same reasons and thus the density of the film is lowered, the resistance of the film is raised and thus a problem arises in that the operation speed is lowered.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="82">Prior to describing embodiments of the present invention, a FRAM which is an example of a semiconductor apparatus to which the present invention is applied will briefly be described.</p>

      FIG. 1 shows a circuit equivalent to a usual ferroelectric memory cell of a 1-transistor/1-capacitor type.

      The unit cells MC are disposed in rows and columns so that a memory cell array 90 is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="86">WLi (i=1, 2, 3, . . . ) represents a plurality of word lines commonly connected to the gates of transistors Q in the unit cells on the same row in the cell array 90.</p>
    <p num="87">PLi (i=1, 2, 3, . . . ) represents a plurality of plate lines commonly connected to plate electrodes of the capacitors C in the unit cells on the same row in the cell array 90.</p>
    <p num="88">BLi (i=1, 2, 3, 4, . . . ) represents a bit line commonly connected to either the source or the drain (for example, the drain) of the transistors in the unit cells on the same row in the cell array 90.</p>
    <p num="89">A word line selector 81 selects a portion of the plural word lines WLi in accordance with an address signal to apply a word line voltage.</p>
    <p num="90">A capacitor plate line selector 82 selects a portion of the plural plate lines PLi in accordance with the address signal to control the voltage of the selected plate line PLi.</p>
    <p num="91">On the other hand, the ferroelectric memory cell of the 2-transistor/2-capacitor type comprising the two memory cells each shown in FIG. 1 is, for example, as shown in FIG. 3A, composed of first and second transistors Q1 and Q2 and first and second capacitors C1 and C2, in series, connected to correspond to the first and second transistors Q1 and Q2.</p>
    <p num="92">
      First and second bit lines BL1 and /BL1 are connected to correspond to the respective drains of the first and second transistors Q1 and Q2.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a word line WL is commonly connected the respective gates.
      <br/>
      In addition, a plate line PL is connected commonly to the plates of the first and second capacitors C1 and C2.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      The word line WL and the plate line PL are disposed in parallel to each other so that a word line signal is supplied to a word line WL selected by a row decoder (not shown) for the word line.
      <br/>
      Moreover, plate line voltage VPL is applied to a plate line PL selected by a row decoder (not shown) for the plate line.
    </p>
    <p num="94">A sense amplifier (not shown) for amplifying the potential of the bit line, a writing circuit (not shown) and a precharge circuit (not shown) are connected to the two bit lines BL1 and /BL1.</p>
    <p num="95">The principles of the operation for writing data on the ferroelectric memory cell having the 2-transistor/2-capacitor structure and the operation for reading data from the same will now be described with reference to FIGS. 3A-3C, FIGS. 4A-4C and FIG. 5.</p>
    <p num="96">When data is written on the ferroelectric memory cell or data is read from the same, the potential of the plate line PL of the selected memory cell is sequentially changed as, for example, 0V, 5V and 0V, the direction of the polarization can be controlled.</p>
    <p num="97">(A) Writing of Data</p>
    <p num="98">In an initial state of the data writing operation, the plate line PL is set to be ground potential Vss (0V), while the two bit lines BL1 and /BL1 are precharged to 0V.</p>
    <p num="99">
      Initially, either bit line BL1 or the bit line /BL1 (for example, the second bit line /BL1) is set to be, for example, 5V, as shown in FIG. 3A, while 5V is applied to the word line WL.
      <br/>
      As a result, the two transistors Q1 and Q2 are turned on so that the potentials at the two electrodes of the second capacitor C2 are made to be different from each other.
      <br/>
      Thus, polarization indicated by a downward arrow is generated.
      <br/>
      However, no polarization is generated in the first capacitor C1.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      Then, the plate line PL is set to be 5V as shown in FIG. 3B so that the potentials at the two electrodes of the first capacitor C1 are made to be different from each other.
      <br/>
      Thus, polarization indicated by an upward arrow is generated.
      <br/>
      However, the polarization of the second capacitor C2 is not inverted.
      <br/>
      As a result, a state is realized in which opposite polarizations are generated in the two capacitors C1 and C2 as illustrated, the realized state corresponding to a state of writing data "1" or "0".
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      Then, the plate line PL is set to be 0V, as shown in FIG. 3C, while the word line WL is set to be 0V.
      <br/>
      Thus, the transistors Q1 and Q2 are turned off.
      <br/>
      As a result, the above-mentioned writing state is retained.
    </p>
    <p num="102">(B) Reading of Data</p>
    <p num="103">
      In the initial state of the data reading operation, the plate line PL is set to be 0V, and the two bit lines BL1 and /BL1 are precharged to 0V.
      <br/>
      An assumption is performed that data in a state where opposite polarizations have been generated in the two capacitors C1 and C2 as shown in FIG. 4A has been written.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      Initially, the plate line PL is set to be 5V as shown in FIG. 4B, while, for example, 5V is applied to the word line WL so that the two transistors Q1 and Q2 are turned on.
      <br/>
      Thus, the potentials at the two electrodes of the second capacitor C2 are made to be different from each other so that the direction of the polarization of the second capacitor C2 is inverted.
      <br/>
      However, the direction of the polarization of the first capacitor C1 is not inverted.
      <br/>
      The reading potentials from the two capacitors C1 and C2 are sense-amplified by a sense amplifier connected to the bit line.
      <br/>
      The output from the sense amplifier causes the two bit lines BL1 and /BL1 to be set to be 0V and 5V.
      <br/>
      That is, in accordance with the output from the sense amplifier, whether read data is "1" or "0" is determined.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      Then, the plate line PL is set to be 0V, as shown in FIG. 4C so that the potentials at the two electrodes of the second capacitor C2 are made to be different from each other.
      <br/>
      Thus, the direction of the polarization of the second capacitor C2 is inverted.
      <br/>
      However, the direction of the first capacitor C1 is not inverted.
      <br/>
      Thus, the direction of the polarization is returned to the initial state.

    <p num="106">An embodiment in which the manufacturing method according to the present invention is applied to the above-mentioned FRAM will now be described.</p>

      FIG. 12 is the cross sectional view showing a manufactured cell array which is different from the above-mentioned conventional structure, in which the bit line is formed previously and the upper electrode is connected, in that the structure for connecting the switching transistor and an upper electrode 19 of the ferroelectric capacitor, and the structure of the upper electrode 19.

    <p num="111">
      In this embodiment, a FRAM will now be described which has 1-transistor/1-capacitor ferroelectric memory cells such that a memory cell array is formed by disposing, into rows and columns, unit cells in each of which one charge transferring MOS transistor (a switching transistor) and one information storage ferroelectric capacitor are connected in series.
      <br/>
      In order to simplify the description, each word line is indicated by WL, each bit line is indicated by BL and each plate line is indicated by PL.

    <p num="112">
      Referring to FIG. 12, reference numeral 1 represents a first conductive type (for example, p-type) semiconductor substrate (for example, a silicon substrate), as shown in FIG. 6, having a surface layer portion in which a plurality of device regions (active regions) SDG are substantially straight formed in a direction (a direction in parallel to a direction in which the bit line BL is formed) perpendicular to a direction in which the word line WL is formed, the device regions SDG being formed into rows and columns in a plan view point.
      <br/>
      An oxide film 2 to serve as an isolation region is formed between the device regions SDG.
    </p>
    <p num="113">In this embodiment, the device regions SDG on the columns are shifted respectively by a distance corresponding to the length (one pitch) of one device region SDG so that the device regions SDG are formed into a checked configuration (zigzag configuration with respect to a regular grid).</p>
    <p num="114">
      Each device region SDG has, in a portion from the central portion thereof to an end thereof, a first source S/channel (G)/drain D region into a straight shape to form the first MOS transistor.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a second drain D/channel (G)/source S region for forming a second MOS transistor is formed straight in a portion from the foregoing central portion to another end of the device region SDG.
      <br/>
      The above-mentioned central portion is formed into a drain region D common to the first and second MOS transistors.

    </p>
    <p num="116">In this case, each word line WL (the gate electrode G) is formed into a double layer structure composed of, for example, a P dope polysilicon 4 and WSi (tungsten silicide) and protected by a surface insulation film 6 and a side wall insulation film 7.</p>
    <p num="117">
      Moreover, the surface insulation film 6, the side wall insulation film 7, an interlayer insulation film 9 and an interlayer insulation film 10, which is formed to flatten the surface, are formed.

      Moreover, an interlayer insulation film 13 for flattening the surface and a capping insulation film 16 are formed on the group of the bit lines BL.
      <br/>
      A stacked structure ferroelectric capacitor (a lower electrode 17, a ferroelectric film 18 and an upper electrode 19) is formed on the capping insulation film 16.
      <br/>
      Moreover, an insulation film 20 for protecting the capacitor and a passivation film 23 are formed.

    <p num="122">
      The upper electrode 19 of the ferroelectric capacitor in each unit cell is, through the ferroelectric film 18, formed into a rectangular shape on the region of the corresponding lower electrode 17.

      The upper electrode 19 of the ferroelectric capacitor is, through a local interconnection wire 22, connected to the second conductive type (which is n type in this embodiment) impurity diffusion region (the source region) S at an end of the corresponding MOS transistor.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      In this case, a contact hole is formed in each of the surface flattening interlayer insulation film 13, the surface flattening interlayer insulation film 10 and the interlayer insulation film 9 to correspond to the upper surface of the source regions S at the two ends of the device region SDG.
      <br/>
      A conductive plug (a capacitor contact plug) 15 is embedded in the contact hole.
      <br/>
      The capping insulation film 16 has a contact hole formed therein to correspond to the upper surface of the capacitor contact plug 15.
      <br/>
      A local interconnection wire 22 made of, for example, an aluminum material, is formed in the contact hole, on the insulation film 20 for protecting the capacitor and on the upper electrode 19.

    <p num="124">
      In this embodiment, also the capacitor contact plug 15 and the interconnection wire 22 have barrier metal films 14 and 21 at the interfaces with the underlying layer.
      <br/>
      Note that the capacitor contact plug 15 and the wire 22 are made of different materials.
      <br/>
      Specifically, it is preferable that the material of the capacitor contact plug 15 be a refractory metal and the material of the wire 22 be an aluminum-based material, a copper-based material or a conductive polysilicon-based material.

      A region in which the wire 22 is in contact with the capacitor contact plug 15 has an area larger than the upper surface of the capacitor contact plug 15, the contact region being in contact with the top surface of the capacitor contact plug 15 and the interlayer insulation film 13 formed around the top surface.
      <br/>
      As a result, the contact resistance between the wire 22 and the capacitor contact plug 15 can be reduced and a margin for aligning a mask for use when the contact hole is formed in the capping insulation film 16 on the capacitor contact plug 15 can be provided.

      Referring to FIGS. 6 and 9, reference numeral 2 represents an oxide film to serve as a region for isolating the device, the oxide film 2 being selectively formed on the surface layer of the substrate.

      Moreover, the barrier metal film 11 and the conductive film 12 are sequentially formed in the contact hole and on the interlayer insulation film 10.
      <br/>
      The conductive film 12 and the barrier metal film 11 are patterned so that the bit lines BL are formed.
    </p>
    <p num="130">Then, the flattening interlayer insulation film (for example, a BPSG film) 13 is deposited on the substrate including the bit lines BL, and then chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is performed by about 200 nm so as to be flattened.</p>
    <p num="131">
      Then, as shown in FIG. 10, a lithography process and etching process are performed so that a contact hole having size of 0.8  MU m * 0.8  MU m is selectively formed in a portion above the source region S of each of the interlayer insulation film 13 and the interlayer insulation film 10, the contact hole being used for the capacitor plug.
      <br/>
      The overall thickness of the interlayer insulation film 13 and the interlayer, insulation film 10 is 1500 nm and the aspect ratio of the contact hole is 1.9.
    </p>
    <p num="132">Then, the barrier metal film (for example, a TiN film) 14 is deposited on the inner surface of the contact hole to have a thickness of 20 nm, and then tungsten is deposited by, for example, a metal CVD apparatus to have a thickness of 1700 nm, which is larger than the total thickness of the interlayer insulation film 13, and the interlayer insulation film 10 so as to be fully embedded in the contact hole.</p>
    <p num="133">Then, the tungsten film and the barrier metal film on the flattening interlayer insulation film 13 are removed by etching back so that the capacitor contact plug 15 is obtained, as shown in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="134">Since the barrier metal film 14 has been formed on the inner surface of the contact hole when the capacitor contact plug 15 is embedded, diffusion from the capacitor contact plug 15 to the impurity diffusion layer for the source region can be prevented.</p>
    <p num="135">Then, the surface of the interlayer insulation film 13 is sufficiently flattened by CMP, as shown in FIG. 10. Then, the capping insulation film 16 is deposited to have a thickness of 150 nm.</p>

      Then, as shown in FIGS. 7 and 11, a conductive film for the lower electrode 17 (the capacitor plate line PL) of the capacitor, the ferroelectric film 18 for the capacitor insulation film and the upper electrode 19 for the capacitor are sequentially formed on the capping insulation film 16, and then patterning is performed so that the ferroelectric capacitor is formed.
      <br/>
      Then, the insulation film 20 for protecting the capacitor is formed.

    <p num="137">
      At this time, the ferroelectric film 18 may be made of the PZT (PbZrx Ti1-x O3), PLZT ((Pb, La)(Zr, Ti) O3) or SBT (SrBi2 Ta2 O9).

      The lower electrode 17 and the upper electrode 19 for the capacitor may be made of Pt or the like (Pt, Ir, IrOx, IrO2, RuO2 or their combination).

      Moreover, a portion above the upper electrode 19 of the insulation film 20 for protecting the capacitor is opened.
      <br/>
      In this case, an opening portion (16a shown in FIG. 7) larger than the area of the upper end of the capacitor contact plug 15 and an opening portion (19a shown in FIG. 7) smaller than the area of the upper electrode 19 for the capacitor are formed.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      Then, as shown in FIGS. 8 and 12, a TiN film 21 for the barrier metal film and a conductive film 22, such as an Al wire containing Si and Cu are, as materials of wires for connecting the capacitor contact plug 15 and the upper electrode 19 for the capacitor, sequentially deposited to cover the insulation film 20 for protecting the capacitor by an RF sputtering method, a metal CVD method or an MOCVD method.
      <br/>
      The materials for the wires are patterned so that wires 21 and 22 are formed, and then a passivation film 23 is deposited on the entire surface including the wires 21 and 22.
    </p>
    <p num="140">When the ferroelectric film 18 is formed, rapid thermal annealing is, for about 10 seconds, performed in an oxygen atmosphere and a high temperature usually at about 750 (degree)  C. after the ferroelectric material has been deposited in order to crystallize the ferroelectric material and improve the ferroelectric characteristic thereof.</p>
    <p num="141">In order to recover deterioration in the ferroelectric characteristic occurring when patterning of the capacitor is performed after the ferroelectric material has been deposited, annealing is performed for about 30 minutes at a high temperature of 600 (degree)  C. in an oxygen atmosphere.</p>
    <p num="142">
      Since the contact hole for the wiring is not yet opened in the process performed at high temperatures and in the oxygen atmosphere, the capping insulation film 16 prevents oxidation of the material of the capacitor contact plug.
      <br/>
      Even if the capacitor contact plug 15 is covered with the capping insulation film 16, slight and partial oxidation of the surface of the material of the capacitor contact plug cannot be prevented because of the annealing process which is performed in the high temperature and oxygen atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      When the material for the wiring is deposited on the capacitor contact plug 15, it is preferable that a process for etching the surface oxide film of the capacitor contact plug 15 be added before the foregoing deposition process.
      <br/>
      As a result, the capacitor contact plug 15 and the wiring material can stably be connected to each other.

      The etching operation can be performed by a reverse sputtering method in which the electrode of the metal sputter is switched.

      In general, the contact resistance between the active layer of the MOSFET and the contact plug is lowered by performing a sintering operation at 450 (degree)  C. by using a mixed gas of hydrogen and nitrogen.
      <br/>
      However, the sintering operation cannot be performed when the ferroelectric material is employed because the characteristics of the ferroelectric capacitor deteriorates.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      On the other hand, the manufacturing method according to this embodiment having the step of forming the capacitor contact plug 15 before the ferroelectric capacitor is formed enables the sintering process to be employed, which is the same as that employed to manufacturing the usual MOS type LSI.
      <br/>
      Specifically, sintering can be performed by using hydrogen, nitrogen or their mixture gas at about 400 (degree)  C. to 500 (degree)  C. As a result, an advantage can be realized in that variations of various device parameters of the gate threshold Vth and the potential of the substrate of the MOSFET can be prevented.

    <p num="146">
      It is preferable that the capacitor contact plug 15 be made of a material different from the material for the wire and having oxidation resistance, heat resistance and a low contact resistance characteristic.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it is preferable that the material can be embedded in the contact hole and is a refractory metal exemplified by tungsten, molybdenum, titanium or palladium.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      The reason for this will now be described.
      <br/>
      The capacitor contact plug 15 is subjected to a high temperature heat treatment in an oxygen atmosphere when the ferroelectric capacitor is formed after the capacitor contact plug 15 has been formed by embedding.
      <br/>
      If a material, such as a polysilicon material or an aluminum-based material which can easily be oxidized is employed to form the capacitor contact plug 15, the capacitor contact plug 15 is oxidized and parasitic resistance thereof is raised.

    <p num="148">
      Although this embodiment has the structure such that TiN is employed to serve as an interlayer between the AlSiCu wiring material and the tungsten contact plug, a laminate Ti/TiN may be employed.
      <br/>
      The material of the wire is not limited to the AlSiCu material.
      <br/>
      For example, an aluminum-based material, a copper-based material or a conductive polysilicon wiring material may be employed.
    </p>
    <p num="149">In this embodiment, the contact resistance between the contact plug for the capacitor and the material of the wire is lowered by employing a connection structure arranged such that the area of wiring is, in their contact surface, larger than the area of the upper surface of the contact plug for the capacitor.</p>
    <p num="150">That is, the electric wires on the contact plug (AlSiCu/TiN) for the capacitor are arranged to be in contact with both of the-upper surface of the contact plug (W) and the interlayer insulation film 13 around the contact plug (W).</p>
    <p num="151">
      A method which is modification of the first embodiment will now be described with reference to FIGS. 13A-13F in which Pt or a material (Ir, an Ir oxide, a Ru oxide or the like) for forming an electrode is employed to form the upper electrode of the ferroelectric capacitor made of PZT or SBT.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the material for forming the upper electrode is precisely processed to a 0.1 micron level.
      <br/>
      Note that the above-mentioned method may be applied to form an element except for the electrode for the ferroelectric capacitor.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      Initially, a lower electrode film 17a for the ferroelectric capacitor and a ferroelectric thin film 18a are sequentially formed on the capping insulation film 16, as shown in FIG. 13A. In this case, Pt is deposited to form the lower electrode film 17a and to have a thickness of 175 nm.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a PZT film is formed by deposition to serve as the ferroelectric thin film 18a and to have a thickness of 300 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="153">Then, a TEOS (tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate) oxide film 20a is, as shown in FIG. 13B, deposited on the ferroelectric thin film 18a to have a thickness of 300 nm.</p>
    <p num="154">Then, as shown in FIG. 13C, PEP (photo engraving process) is performed to-selectively form opening portions in the TEOS oxide film 20a at positions corresponding to the upper electrodes.</p>
    <p num="155">Then, as shown in FIG. 13D, the Pt film 19a for forming the upper electrode is deposited to have a thickness larger than that of the TEOS oxide film 20a.</p>
    <p num="156">
      Then, as shown in FIG. 13E, etching back or CMP is performed so that the Pt film 19a on the TEOS oxide film 20a is removed.
      <br/>
      Then, a usual photolithography technique is employed so that an elongated resist pattern is formed.
      <br/>
      Anisotropic etching is performed by using the resist pattern as a mask so that the TEOS oxide film 20a/the ferroelectric thin film 18a/the lower electrode film 17a are sequentially patterned.
    </p>
    <p num="157">As a result, the desired and elongated thin ferroelectric film 18 and the lower electrode 17 are obtained.</p>
    <p num="158">At this time, the same mask pattern is used to sequentially etch the TEOS oxide film 20a, the ferroelectric thin film 18a and the lower electrode film 17a so that the TEOS oxide film 20a, the thin ferroelectric film 18 and the lower electrode 17 are formed into substantially the same planar shape in a self alignment manner.</p>
    <p num="159">
      Then, as shown in FIG. 13F, the insulation film 20 for protecting the capacitor is formed to cover the surfaces of the TEOS oxide film 20a, the upper electrode 19, the thin ferroelectric film 18 and the lower electrode 17.
      <br/>
      The insulation film 20 prevents the pattern edges of the thin ferroelectric film 18 and the lower electrode 17 from being damaged by the anisotropic etching process.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the insulation film 20 prevents deterioration in the electric with standing voltage of the thin ferroelectric film 18.
      <br/>
      The insulation film 20 for protecting the capacitor is a SiO2 film formed by decomposing TEOS by, for example, a plasma CVD method or a SiO2 film formed by a thermal oxidation method.
    </p>
    <p num="160">Then, an opening portion having an area smaller than that of the upper electrode 19 is formed in a portion corresponding to the upper surface of the upper electrode 19 of the insulation film 20 for protecting the capacitor, and then the electric wire 22 and the passivation film 23 are formed.</p>
    <p num="161">As described above, the method of forming the ferroelectric memory cell according to this embodiment enables the electric wire for connecting the upper electrode of the capacitor and the top end of the contact plug to each other to be formed by, for example, the sputtering method after the contact plug layer is embedded into a region of the source/drain region of the switching transistor and then the ferroelectric capacitor has been formed.</p>
    <p num="162">
      As a result, the wiring film deposition process to be performed after the ferroelectric memory cell has been formed, using a metal CVD apparatus or a MOCVD apparatus in the reducing atmosphere, can be omitted.
      <br/>
      Thus, deterioration in the electric characteristics, such as the remanant polarization of the capacitor, can be prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      Since the structure is formed such that the upper electrode 19 is embedded in the opening portion of the TEOS oxide film 20a, the area of the upper electrode 19 can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Thus, the area of the unit cell can be reduced and, therefore, a dense FRAM can be manufactured.
    </p>
    <p num="164">
      Although the foregoing embodiment is structured such that the capacitor contact plug is formed in one step, the capacitor contact plug may be formed in two steps.
      <br/>
      Cross sections of a manufacturing method according to this modification are shown in FIGS. 14 and 15. With the method according to this modification, the first capacitor contact plugs 11a and 12a are formed simultaneously with the process for forming the bit line BL (11 and 12).
      <br/>
      Then, second capacitor contact plugs 14 and 15 are formed on the interlayer insulation film 13 formed on the first capacitor contact plugs 11a and 12a such that the second capacitor contact plugs 14 and 15 are connected to the top surfaces of the first capacitor contact plugs 11a and 12a.
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      Since the above-mentioned structure is employed, the aspect ratio of each contact hole can be lowered.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the contact plug layer is embedded, embedding into the contact hole can easily be performed.
    </p>
    <p num="166">In the first embodiment, each of the contact plug portion of the bit line BL (11 and 12) and the capacitor contact plugs 14 and 15 (including a case where the capacitor contact plug is composed of the first capacitor contact plugs 11a and 12a and the second capacitor contact plugs 14 and 15) may be formed to have an inversely tapered side surface such that a size of the upper opening portion is larger than a size of the opening portion of the bottom surface, as shown in FIGS. 14 and 15.</p>
    <p num="167">
      As a result, even if the interval between the adjacent word lines is reduced because the size of the cell is reduced, a required distance can be maintained between the word line and the lower portion of the contact plug.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a required opening area (the contact area for the wire connection) of the contact hole can easily be maintained.
      <br/>
      Thus, the margin permitted to the manufacturing process can be enlarged.

      Referring to FIG. 18, reference numeral 41 represents a contact portion in which the bit line BL is connected to a bit line contact pattern (36 shown in FIG. 17), and 42 represents a contact portion in which a local connection electric wire (22 shown in FIG. 17) formed in an intermediate layer between the word line WL and the bit line BL is connected with respect to the upper electrode (19 shown in FIG. 17) of the capacitor having the stacked structure formed for each unit cell and the capacitor contact plug (34 shown in FIG. 17).

      That is, when the structure shown in FIGS. 16. and 17 in which the bit line BL is formed in the upper layer portion of the ferroelectric capacitor is employed, the cell array can be formed as shown in FIG. 18. The width of the bit line BL can be enlarged as compared with the above-mentioned FCOB structure and thus the resistance of the bit line can be lowered.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a significant advantage can be realized to operate the memory.

      Then, an influence of the difference in the process on the quantity of polarization of the ferroelectric film of the ferroelectric capacitor was examined.

    <p num="199">As a result, the quantity of polarization of the ferroelectric film of the ferroelectric capacitor obtained in the second embodiment was 30  MU C/cm2, while the quantity of the polarization in the comparative example was deteriorated to about 3  MU C/cm2.</p>

      The quantity of polarization of the ferroelectric material of the FRAM device is directly effective to obtain a satisfactory sensing margin.

    <p num="201">Third Embodiment</p>
    <p num="202">FIG. 19 is a cross sectional view schematically showing a portion (including a SDG region and a cell capacitor) of cross sectional structure of a FRAM cell according to a third embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="203">Although the structure of the FRAM cell shown in FIG. 19 is basically similar to the structure of the FRAM cell shown in FIG. 17, the third embodiment is different in that a ferroelectric capacitor is formed above the first interlayer insulation film 10 with a first SiO2 film 51 interposed therebetween and a second SiO2 film 52 is formed on the ferroelectric capacitor.</p>
    <p num="204">The process for manufacturing the FRAM shown in FIG. 19 is different from the foregoing process shown in FIGS. 16 and 17 in that (1) after the surface of the first interlayer insulation film 10 has been exposed by etching back, a process is added in which the first SiO2 film 51 is deposited on the overall surface by a sputtering method; (2) after the ferroelectric capacitor has been formed, a process is added in which the second SiO2 film 52 is deposited on the overall surface to have thickness of about 100 nm by a sputtering method; (3) the second interlayer insulation film 13 is deposited on the second SiO2 film 52, and holes are selectively formed in the interlayer insulation film 13 such that the holes are formed in the second SiO2 film 52 or both of the second SiO2 film 52 and the first SiO2 film 51.</p>
    <p num="205">
      The first SiO2 films 51 and 52 formed by the sputtering method as described above do not contain any hydrogen group and do not permit easy penetration of the hydrogen group.
      <br/>
      Even if the hydrogen group approaches the ferroelectric capacitor in the following process, it cannot be brought into directly contact with the ferroelectric capacitor.
      <br/>
      Therefore, deterioration in the characteristics of the ferroelectric member (the quantity of polarization) can be minimized.

      The manufacturing method according to this embodiment is characterized in that the contact plug formed from the first layer wiring in the double-layered wiring structure to the semiconductor substrate or the gate electrode of the transistor is formed in two steps.

      That is, the contact plug according to this embodiment is formed such that the lower portion is formed before the ferroelectric capacitor of the FRAM cell is formed, and then the residual upper layer portion is formed, after the ferroelectric capacitor is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="209">
      Since the contact plug is formed as described above, the ratio (the aspect ratio) of the depth of the contact hole with respect to the diameter of the opening portion of the contact hole can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Thus, the contact hole can easily be formed and embedding of the same can easily be performed.
      <br/>
      The foregoing fact is advantageous when consolidation with a logic product having a pattern layout in accordance with a very sever rule is performed.

      Moreover, the second wiring layer 38 and the BL are formed on the surface of the third interlayer insulation film 30, and a passivation film 39 is formed on the second wiring layer 38 and the BL.
    </p>
    <p num="214">
      The manufacturing method according to this embodiment will sequentially be described.
      <br/>
      As described above, the first half process is the same as that according to the second embodiment (see FIG. 16).
      <br/>
      Similarly to the process for manufacturing a conventional CMOS type DRAM, the memory cell transistor 31 and the MOS transistor 32 for another device are formed on the semiconductor substrate 1.
      <br/>
      That is, the gate and the diffusion layer region of the transistor are formed, and the first interlayer insulation film 10 and contact holes are formed.
      <br/>
      Then, the contact plugs are embedded in the contact holes.
      <br/>
      As described above, this embodiment has the structure such that the contact plug is formed from the first wiring layer to the surface of the substrate in two steps.
      <br/>
      When the step shown in FIG. 16 has been performed, the first step (the lower layer portion) of forming the contact hole is completed.
    </p>
    <p num="215">
      Then, as shown in FIG. 20, a LPCVD method is employed so that the thin silicon nitride film layer 121 is formed on the first interlayer insulation film 10.
      <br/>
      The silicon nitride film layer 121 prevents oxidation of the material of the contact plug (for example, W) during annealing which is performed in the oxygen atmosphere in the process of forming the ferroelectric capacitor and prevents change in the characteristics of the transistor occurring due to annealing.
      <br/>
      Then, the thin silicon oxide film layer 122 is formed on the silicon nitride film layer 121 by a LPCVD method, a plasma CVD method or a normal pressure CVD method.
    </p>
    <p num="216">
      Then, TiN, Ti and Pt to form a conductive film for the capacitor lower electrode 17 are sequentially sputtered on the silicon oxide film layer 122.
      <br/>
      Then, a PZT film is formed to form the ferroelectric film 18 for the capacitor.
      <br/>
      Then, Pt is sputtered on the PZT film to form the upper electrode 19 for the capacitor.
      <br/>
      Then, RIE is employed to sequentially pattern the upper electrode 19, the capacitor insulation film 18 and the lower electrode 17 so that the ferroelectric capacitor is formed.
      <br/>
      If the ferroelectric film 18 is damaged and thus its characteristics are changed from its original characteristics at this time, the characteristics can be restored by performing annealing at about 500 (degree)  C. in an oxygen atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p num="217">
      Then, plasma CVD is performed so that the second interlayer insulation film 13 is formed, and then the second interlayer insulation film 13 is flattened by CMP or the like.
      <br/>
      Then, contact holes for establishing the connection between the contact plugs 33, 34 and 35 and the second wiring layer to be formed later are formed.
      <br/>
      At this time, a contact hole (not shown) for establishing the connection between the capacitor lower electrode 17 and the first wiring layer is simultaneously formed.
    </p>
    <p num="218">
      Then, a sputtering method is employed to form a TiN film 111 on the overall surface to serve as a barrier layer, and then aluminum is deposited to plug the contact hole by a reflow method at about 400 (degree)  C. Then, CMP or etching back is performed so that the TiN film and aluminum are removed in the portion other than the inside portion of the contact hole.
      <br/>
      Thus, both of the lower layer portion and the upper layer portion of the contact plug are formed so that the structure of this embodiment is completed.
    </p>
    <p num="219">
      Then, a contact hole is formed on the capacitor upper electrode 19 by RIE.
      <br/>
      Although also this contact hole may be formed simultaneously with the step for forming the above-mentioned contact hole and it may be plugged with aluminum or the like, the contact holes are not formed simultaneously in this embodiment.
      <br/>
      That is, the other contact holes are previously formed, and then this contact hole is formed.
      <br/>
      The reason for this is that the contact hole connected to the upper electrode and having a low aspect ratio as compared with the aspect ratios of the other contact holes is not considerably required to be plugged.
      <br/>
      Moreover, contact holes having different aspect ratios are considered to be difficult to simultaneously be plugged because their plugging conditions are different from each other.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the ferroelectric capacitor is required to be protected from being damaged when the plugging operation is performed.
    </p>
    <p num="220">
      Then, Ti, TiN, AlCu and TiN are sequentially deposited on the overall surface by a sputtering method so that a first wiring layer is formed.

      <br/>
      The TiN in the uppermost layer of the first wiring layer serves a reflection preventive film for preventing reflection of light from Al when a resist pattern is formed for lithography.

    <p num="221">
      Then, the third interlayer insulation film 30 is formed, and its surface is flattened by CMP.

      Then, via holes for establishing the connection between the first wiring layer and a second wiring layer to be described later are formed.
      <br/>
      Then, an Al reflow method which has been used for the contact hole plugging of the second interlayer insulation film 13 is employed to plug the via hole with aluminum.
      <br/>
      Then, Ti, TiN and Al are sequentially sputtered so that the second wiring layer is formed.
      <br/>
      The second wiring layer is processed by RIE so that the second layer wiring 38, the bit line BL and the like are formed.

      An eighth embodiment of the method of manufacturing the semiconductor apparatus according to the present invention will now be described.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a method of manufacturing a ferroelectric film and an electrode film of a charge storing capacitor of a FRAM cell as shown in FIG. 24, or a manufacturing method capable of raising the density of a ferroelectric film and an electrode film for the charge storing capacitor for a DRAM cell as shown in FIG. 26 and improving the reliability of the same will now be described.
      <br/>
      This embodiment is sectioned into a plurality of sub-embodiments having different processes and conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="248">In these sub-embodiments, a capacitor is formed which comprises a dielectric film composed of a complex oxide film containing at least two or more types of metal elements between a pair of electrodes, and a semiconductor is manufactured in which an insulation oxide film and a wiring layer are laminated on the foregoing capacitor such that</p>
    <p num="249">
      (a) The step of forming the capacitor includes a step of forming a first electrode, a step of forming a dielectric film, a step of performing a RTA process under a condition that the pressure is lowered to 0.5 Torr (=0.5 * 133, 322 Pa) or higher and 500 Torr or lower, and a step of forming a second electrode.
      <br/>
      (b) The step of forming the capacitor includes a step of forming a first electrode, a step of forming a dielectric film, a step of performing a second electrode, and a step of performing a RTA process under a condition that the pressure is lowered to 0.5 Torr or higher and 500 Torr or lower.
      <br/>
      (c) The step of forming the capacitor includes a step of forming a first electrode, a step of performing a RTA process under a condition that the pressure is lowered to 0.5 Torr or higher and 500 Torr or lower, a step of forming a dielectric film, and a step of forming a second electrode.
      <br/>
      (d) In any one of the steps (a) to (c), a complex oxide film containing at least two or more types of metal elements is formed on the first electrode by a sputtering method, a CVD method or a LSMCD (Liquid Source Misted Chemical Deposition) method.
      <br/>
      (e) In any one of steps (a) to (c), the RTA process to be performed under the lowered pressure is performed under a divided pressure of oxygen of 0.5 Torr or higher and 500 Torr or lower.
      <br/>
      (f) In any one of steps (a) to (c), the RTA process to be performed under the lowered pressure is performed under a partial pressure of ozone of 0.5 Torr or higher and 500 Torr or lower.
      <br/>
      (g) In any one of steps (a) to (c), the RTA process is performed in an atmosphere in which the partial pressure ratio of ozone is 1% or higher.
    </p>
    <p num="250">
      The RTA process is heat treatment in which the temperature raising rate is 10 (degree)  C./second or higher.
      <br/>
      The heat raising ratio is able to considerably improve the crystalline characteristic of the film.
      <br/>
      In particular, a lead-based dielectric film made of, for example, PZT is enabled to prevent generation of pyrochlore phase having a low dielectric constant.
      <br/>
      Thus, an advantage is realized in crystallization.
      <br/>
      Since the heat treatment using RTA is arranged to quickly raise the temperature, it has a problem in which crystallization is performed in a state where volatilization of introduced gas is insufficient.
    </p>
    <p num="251">
      Since the method of forming a dielectric film according to the sub-embodiment is arranged such that the RTA process is performed under reduced pressure of 0.5 Torr or higher and 500 Torr or lower, crystallization is performed in a state where residual gas introduced into the deposition film is removed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a dielectric film having excellent crystallization characteristic at a high density can be obtained.
      <br/>
      When the dielectric film is crystallized, also the electrode film is crystallized.
      <br/>
      However, the gas introduced into the electrode film can be removed by the above-mentioned heat treatment so that the resistance of the electrode film is lowered.
    </p>
    <p num="252">
      Although the RTA process enhances the crystallization, there is a risk that the dielectric film is formed into a semiconductor structure if supply of oxygen is insufficient.
      <br/>
      In particular, a Pb-based dielectric film such as PZT, and barium titanate, can easily be formed into a semiconductor structure and the resistance of the film is considerably lowered.
    </p>
    <p num="253">
      It is preferable that the heat treatment be performed in this case such that annealing is, under lowered pressure, performed in a partial pressure of oxygen of 0.5 Torr or higher and 500 Torr or lower.
      <br/>
      If supply of oxygen is insufficient, the resistance of a conductive oxide film, such as IrO2, RuO2, ITO or SnO2, is changed excessively and thus the characteristic becomes instable.
      <br/>
      Therefore, annealing in the above-mentioned partial pressure of oxygen is effective.
    </p>
    <p num="254">
      If the annealing is performed under the partial pressure of ozone of 0.5 Torr or higher and 500 Torr or lower, leak currents from the film can be reduced.
      <br/>
      The foregoing fact is important when a capacitor of a memory, such as a DRAM, which must be refreshed is formed.
      <br/>
      The electric power consumption can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="255">
      The RTA process under low pressure is effective when a sputtering method, a CVD method or a LSMCD method is employed to form, on the first electrode, a dielectric film composed of a complex oxide film containing at least two types of metal elements.
      <br/>
      The reason for this is that the influence of the introduced gas cannot be prevented when the film is formed by the above-mentioned film forming method.
    </p>
    <p num="256">
      Although a sol/gel method or MOD method may be employed to form the dielectric film according to the sub-embodiment, a quantity of volatilization of organic groups is too large.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the heat treatment is started under the lowered pressure, the surface of the film will be roughened.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that heat treatment be performed at 350 (degree)  C. or higher under the atmospheric pressure and then the RTA process be performed under lowered pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="257">
      The ozone annealing method and its effect will now be described.
      <br/>
      The ozone annealing process is performed such that mixed gas of ozone and oxygen generated by an ozone generator is introduced into a heat processing portion heated to 100 (degree)  C. to 400 (degree)  C. For example, the mixed gas of ozone and oxygen is introduced in a state where the rear side of the wafer is heated to 300 (degree)  C. Then, the heat processing portion is irradiated with a low level mercury light with 100 mW/cm2 for 30 minutes to 200 minutes.
      <br/>
      The effective wavelength of mercury light is 320 nm or shorter.
    </p>
    <p num="258">
      When the heat treatment is performed in an atmosphere of the mixed gas in which the partial pressure ratio of ozone of 1% or higher, intrinsic oxygen voids when the film is formed can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Thus, the leak current can be reduced.
      <br/>
      When heat treatment is performed afterwards at 600 (degree)  C. higher in oxygen, dispersion in the wafer plane can be reduced more effectively.
      <br/>
      The sub-embodiments of the specific contents of the fifth embodiment will now be described.

      The transponder has a simple structure including a monlolithic RF-ID chip in which the FRAM and ASIC (application specified integrated circuit) are formed into one chip and an antenna also receiving electric power and transmitting/receiving data.
    </p>
    <p num="298">
      The host portion transmits commands and data on carrier waves when required.
      <br/>
      The transponder portion generates required electric power with the foregoing carrier waves to use it to write/read data and transmit data so as to return information to the host portion.
    </p>
    <p num="299">
      The non-contact tag does not need any battery and has a structure such that the contents stored in the FRAM are read in a non-contact manner by using electric waves and the contents are rewritten so as to be used to manage inlet and outlet of persons.
      <br/>
      For example, inlet and outlet are permitted in a state where the non-contact tag serving as a commutation ticket is held in a pocket of clothes, or the non-contact tag is attached to a vehicle to eliminate the necessity for the vehicle to step at a toll gate of a highway for payment.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the inlet/outlet to and from a parking is supervised/managed without a necessity of a human being.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it can be used to manage the movement of domestic animals or migratory fishes.
