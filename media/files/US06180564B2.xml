      The present invention provides for herbicidal composition comprising (i) 3-isopropyl-1H-2,1,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide, and (ii) ethyl 2-chloro-3-[2-chloro-5-(1,3-dioxo-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoindolin-2-yl)phenyl]acrylate as active ingredients.
      <br/>
      The present inventive composition can control a wide variety of weeds in corn fields, soybean fields, wheat fields, barley fields, oats fields, rye fields, rice fields, paddy fields or the like, with selectivity to crops.
      <br/>
      Methods for controlling weeds are also provided.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a herbicidal composition.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">Currently, various herbicides are being utilized, but since there are various weeds that are targets of control, and because the growth of weeds continues for a long time, a herbicide is desired that has a higher herbicidal activity, a faster appearance of herbicidal effect, a wider herbicidal spectrum and that is safe for crops.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The present inventor has intensely studied to seek out an excellent herbicide, and has found that by applying a herbicidal composition (hereinafter, referred to as the present inventive composition) which comprises, as active ingredients, (i) 3-isopropyl-1H-2,1,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide (common name: bentazone, hereinafter, referred to as bentazone), and (ii) ethyl 2-chloro-3-�2-chloro-5-(1,3-dioxo-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoindolin-2-yl)phenyl�acrylate (common name: cinidon-ethyl, hereinafter, referred to as cinidon-ethyl), various weeds that emerge or grow in crop-lands or non-crop-lands can be controlled effectively, thereby completing the present invention.
      <br/>
      That is, since the herbicidal effect of the present inventive composition is synergistically increased as compared with the cases where the active ingredients are independently used, the amount used thereof can be reduced.
      <br/>
      By using the present inventive composition, the time necessary for appearance of a herbicidal effect can be shortened, and a broadened weed control spectrum can be achieved synergistically, as compared with the cases where the active ingredients are independently used.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a wide variety of weeds can be controlled selectively, without producing problems of phytotoxicity against crops such as corn, soybean, wheat, barley, oats, rye and rice.
      <br/>
      In particular, when used in a corn field or soybean field, the present composition is excellent for selectivity.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the present invention has been obtained.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">The present invention provides a herbicidal composition that comprises, as active ingredients, (i) bentazone and (ii) cinidon-ethyl.</p>
    <p num="5">Bentazone is a compound described in Farm Chemicals Handbook, 1995 (established by Meister Publishing Co., 1995) page C48 and the like.</p>
    <p num="6">Cinidon-ethyl is a compound described in JP 62-185071 A.</p>
    <p num="7">The present inventive herbicidal compositions are excellent as herbicides because they have a herbicidal activity against a wide variety of weeds with good selectivity between weeds and crops, and they exhibit an excellent herbicidal activity in no-till cultivation and non-agricultural fields as well as in till cultivation.</p>
    <p num="8">The present inventive herbicidal compositions have a herbicidal activity against the following variations of weeds that cause problems for crops in fields of corn, soybean, wheat, barley, oats, rye or rice.</p>
