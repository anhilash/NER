      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a molding method and a molding apparatus for a laminated molded body such as insulator dashboards of cars.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Ordinarily, an insulator dashboard having sound insulation function is installed on a dashboard panel facing a car interior, with the dashboard panel placed in front of the driver seat and the passenger seat of a car.
      <br/>
      The dashboard panel is made of a laminated molded body of a sound insulation material such as a thermoplastic resin sheet and a sound absorption material such as felt and polyurethane foam.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Conventional molding method for the insulator dashboard will be explained on the basis of the drawings of FIG. 19 and FIG. 20.</p>
    <p num="7">First, sound absorbing material is heated to 165 to 175 (degree)  C. measured at its surface through a hot blast heating furnace, the hot material is shaped to its desired shape by cold pressing step and the sound absorption material shaped is cooled, and the material is molded to its precise shape of the dashboard.</p>
    <p num="8">
      Next, as shown in FIG. 19, the sound absorption material 1 of desired shape is set on a lower mold 3 for cold-pressing-molding, and a sound insulating material 2 heated to 130 through 135 (degree)  C. measured at its surface is placed on the sound absorbing material 1.
      <br/>
      A cold-pressing-molding upper mold 4 having substantially the same shape or profile as that of the cold-pressing-molding lower mold 3 is placed above the lower mold 3.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Next, as shown in FIG. 20, the cold pressing molding upper mold 4 is lowered, a pressing pressure of 15 to 30 kg/cm2 is applied between the lower mold 3 and the upper mold 4 for in order to mold the sound absorbing material 1 and the sound insulation material 2, a predetermined cooling period is elapsed, a second pressing (pressure: 100 to 150 kg/cm2) is done in order to trim or cut the circumference or the outer periphery of the product by means of trimming blade 8 provided around the circumference of the cold-pressing-molding upper mold 4.</p>
    <p num="10">Then, a water-jet cutting device or special purpose mold is used to carry out a trimming or piecing the process completing the molding of products.</p>
    <p num="11">According to the conventional molding method for insulator dashboards, after the sound absorbing material 1 is shaped in a desired shape by means of a press mold, a different press mold is used to press the sound insulation material 2 and the sound absorbing material 1, so that it is necessary to employ two steps of pressing and to prepare plural mold installations.</p>
    <p num="12">
      In addition, it has been difficult to control the pressure level in pressing of the sound insulation material 2 and the sound absorbing material 1.
      <br/>
      When the pressure level is too high, the sound absorbing material 1 may be crushed the resulting in failure of obtaining appropriate thickness of the product.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, if pressure level is too weak, one of the sound insulation material 2 and the sound absorbing material 1 may be peeled from other one.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Still, according to the prior art, the elasticity of the sound absorption material 1 prevents the pressing pressure from being appropriately transferred to the sound insulation material 2, making it difficult to precisely or sharply shape the of corners of the product.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Additionally, the sound absorbing material 1 is typically made of a thermal-molded felt having thermal insulation quality.
      <br/>
      Thus, it takes a long time to cool the molded sound absorbing material 1, requiring a longer molding cycle.
    </p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="32">The preferred embodiments of the molding method for a laminated molded body and molding apparatus for the body will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="33">
      As seen in FIG. 1 depicting a structure of the car insulator dashboard molded by the molding method according to the present invention, the insulator dashboard 10 consists of a sound insulating material 11 made of a relatively high density flexible material such as a rubber sheet or vinyl chloride containing an inorganic filler, and a sound absorption material 12 having a perforated basic material, such as polyurethane foam and felt having a desired sound absorption function.
      <br/>
      The sound absorption material 12 is integrally applied to a rear face of the sound insulation material 11, resulting in a laminated body that can be used as a insulator dashboard 10.
      <br/>
      The shape of the insulator dashboard 10 corresponds to that of a dashboard panel 18 facing the car interior because the laminated body of the dashboard 10 is applied and bonded to the dashboard panel 18.
    </p>
    <p num="34">In addition, it is noted that as will be described, the insulator dashboard 10 is cold-pressed, so that the thermoplastic resin sheet is used as that of the sound insulation material 11 and the thermal-molding felt is used as the sound absorbing material 12.</p>
    <p num="35">The molding apparatus 19 for molding the insulator dashboard 10 shown in FIG. 1 consists generally of cold pressing molding lower mold 13 and cold-pressing-molding upper mold 14 as shown in FIG. 2.</p>
    <p num="36">
      The cold-pressing-molding lower mold 13 has blowing pressure air holes 16 formed thereon and cooling pipes 13a contained therein.
      <br/>
      The cold-pressing-molding upper mold 14 placed above the lower mold 13 has vacuum suction holes 15 formed thereon and cooling pipes 14a arranged therein.
      <br/>
      A sealing cylinder 17 is placed around the circumference of the upper mold 14.
    </p>
    <p num="37">An embodiment of a molding method for an insulator dashboard 10 using the pressing molding apparatus 19 structured as mentioned above will be described.</p>
    <p num="38">First, as shown in FIG. 2, a thermoplastic resin sheet S and a thermal-molding felt F, respectively are heated in heating furnaces A and B, and the thermal-molding felt F and the thermoplastic resin sheet S are placed on the cold-pressing-molding lower mold 13 in the order of that above.</p>
    <p num="39">Then, the cold-pressing-molding upper mold 14 is lowered in order to press and mold the thermoplastic resin sheet S and the thermal-molding felt F by means of cold pressing molding the upper mold 14 and the lower mold 13.</p>
    <p num="40">
      Circulating the cooling medium through cooling pipes 13a and 14a arranged within the cold-pressing-molding upper mold 14 and lower mold 13, the upper mold and the lower mold are cooled and then the thermoplastic resin sheet S and thermal-molding felt F are cooled.
      <br/>
      By means of vacuum suction holes 15 formed on the upper mold 14, the thermoplastic resin sheet S comes intimately in contact with a mold face of the upper mold 14.
      <br/>
      By means of the pressure air holes 16 formed on the lower mold 13, cooling air is supplied into the thermal-molding felt F. Thus, the molding process of thermoplastic resin sheet S is assisted and cooling of the thermal-molding felt F is accelerated.
    </p>
    <p num="41">At this time, as shown in FIG. 4, circumference sealing cylinder 17 raises the sealing member 17a resulting in displacement of air from the pressure air holes 16.</p>
    <p num="42">Next, the second embodiment of the molding method according to the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings concerning the the second embodiment.</p>
    <p num="43">FIG. 6 depicts structure of molding apparatus related to the second embodiment the molding method according to the present invention, FIG. 6 through FIG. 11 depict the respective steps of the molding method, and FIG. 12 shows the structure of the second embodiment of molding apparatus according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="44">The molding apparatus 20 adapted to use and mold the insulator dashboard 10 shown in FIG. 1 consists in general cold-pressing-molding lower mold 30 and cold-pressing-molding upper mold 40 as shown in FIG. 5.</p>
    <p num="45">
      In more detail, the cold-pressing-molding lower mold 30 has blowing pipes 31 arranged so as to protrude their front ends 31a through mold face 30a of the lower mold 30.
      <br/>
      The blowing pipes 31 are connected to a pressure air pump 33 through a piping 32 provided with an opening valve 34.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Although the blowing pipe 31 can be manufactured from any material, it be preferable that it is made of stainless steel since stainless steel pipe can be mass-produced.
      <br/>
      As will be described later, the stainless blowing pipe 31 enters into the thermal-molding felt F. Thus, it is preferable that its front end 31a is be tapered.
    </p>
    <p num="47">Additionally, it is preferable to concentrate the blowing pipes 31 on a thick portion of the sound absorbing material 12 of the insulator dashboard 10 considering the cooling efficiency of thermal-molding felt F.</p>
    <p num="48">
      The cold-pressing-molding lower mold 30 has vacuum suction holes 35 formed thereon and connected to vacuum suction pumps 37 through vacuum suction pipes 36.
      <br/>
      The vacuum suction pipes 36 have an open-and-close valve 38 and the lower mold 30 has cooling pipes 39 for cooling the mold.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The cold pressing molding upper mold 40 placed above the lower mold 30 has vacuum suction holes 41 formed thereon and connected to a vacuum suction pump 43 through vacuum suction pipe 42.
      <br/>
      The vacuum suction pipe 42 has an open-and-close valve 44.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Sealing cylinder 45 is attached to outer peripheral portion of the upper mold 40.
      <br/>
      A sealing member 46 attached to the sealing cylinder 45 is connected to the outer peripheral portion of the upper mold 40 so as to move vertically.
    </p>
    <p num="51">The upper mold 40 has cooling pipes 47 for cooling the upper mold 40.</p>
    <p num="52">An embodiment of the molding method for insulator dashboard 10 shown in FIG. 1, which method using the pressing molding apparatus 20 structured as mentioned above, will be described.</p>
    <p num="53">
      First, a thermoplastic resin sheet S of material for the sound insulator material 11 as shown in FIG. 6, is heated to 130 to 135 (degree)  C. of its surface temperature by means of infrared heating furnace 50.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 7, the thermal-molding felt F is heated by a hot blast heating furnace 51 until its inner temperature reaches 165 to 175 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="54">Then, as shown in FIG. 8, the thermal-molding felt F and the thermoplastic resin sheet S, respectively heated and softened are set in order of the above on the mold face of cold-pressing-molding lower mold 30.</p>
    <p num="55">After respective materials are set, cold-pressing-molding upper mold 40 lowers as shown in FIG. 9, and both the thermoplastic resin sheet S and thermal-molding felt F are placed between and pressed by the cold-pressing-molding upper and lower molds 30 and 40, leaving a predetermined clearance.</p>
    <p num="56">While pressing of both the upper and lower molds, the blowing pipe 31 situated under the lower mold 30 intrudes into the thermal-molding felt F. Because the front end 31a of the blowing pipe 31 has shape of taper, the thermal-molding felt F doesn't deform and the blowing pipes 31 effectively enter into the thermal-molding felt F.</p>
    <p num="57">
      Then, as shown in FIG. 10, the opening valve or open-and-close valve 44 opens and the vacuum pump 43 drives, so that the thermoplastic resin sheet S is vacuum-molded in the interior of the upper mold 40.
      <br/>
      Simultaneously, the opening valve 34 opens in order to supply cooling air from the pressure air pump 33 into the thermal-molding felt F through blowing pipes 31.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Consequently, because the blowing pipes 31 intrude into the thermal-molding felt F at a mid level of its thickness, it is more rapid and easier to circulate cooling air through the interior of the thermal-molding felt F as compared with the first embodiment in which cooling air is supplied through the lower mold molding face.
      <br/>
      In addition, because pressure air is rapidly applied also to the thermoplastic resin sheet S, it is possible to shorten considerably the molding time necessary for the thermoplastic resin sheet S and cooling time necessary for the thermal-molding felt F.
