      A two phase environmentally friendly fermentation process for producing high yields of delta-decalactone and delta-dodecalactone from the corresponding unsaturated starting materials is carried out under oxidative growth conditions using a saccharomyces species.
      <br/>
      The resulting products impart, augment and/or enhance the aroma and/or taste of consumable materials including foodstuffs, chewing gums, toothpastes, beverages, fragrance compositions, colognes and perfumed articles such as solid or liquid, anionic, cationic, non-ionic or zwitterionic detergents, fabric softeners, and hair preparations.

      No. 09/064,742 filed on Apr. 23, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,117,835 issued on Sep. 12, 2000.

      The present invention relates to a two phase microbial process for the preparation of compositions containing certain saturated lactones.
      <br/>
      In a further aspect, the present invention relates to products produced by the microbial process.
    </p>
    <p num="3">In a still further aspect, the present invention relates to organoleptic uses of said products.</p>
    <p num="4">
      In today's market, it is frequently desirable to identify flavor components of food items as being "natural flavors".
      <br/>
      It is generally recognized in the industry that a flavor compound having been prepared by microbial processes can be designated as a natural product and therefore have an important place in the commercialization of products containing them.
      <br/>
      As a result, the industry has devoted considerable time and effort to develop methods for the production of flavoring components and, in particular, for the production of lactones which can be called "natural".
    </p>
    <p num="5">Thus, as an example of such prior developments a method for preparing certain optically active delta lactones and the corresponding hydroxy carboxylic acids by microbial reduction of ketocarboxylic acids is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,076,750.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Investigations reported in the Journal of Biochemistry, 54, pages 536-540 (1963) relate to metabolism of ricinoleic acid by some Candida strains and show that gamma hydroxydecanoic acid is an intermediate in the oxidative degradation of ricinoleic acid.
      <br/>
      In a number of such prior disclosed methods, the processes were not entirely satisfactory because of the toxicity of certain components to the microorganism.
    </p>
    <p num="7">A method of producing optically active gamma hydroxydecanoic acid by culturing or incubating a microorganism capable of hydrolyzing castor oil and effecting beta oxidation of the resulting hydrolysate in the presence of castor oil to produce gamma hydroxydecanoic acid is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,560,656.</p>
    <p num="8">
      This reference also discloses a method of producing optically active gamma hydroxydecanoic acid by enzymatically hydrolyzing castor oil using lipase to form an enzymatic hydrolyzate and culturing a microorganism capable of effective beta-oxidation of the enzymatic hydrolyzate in the presence of the hydrolyzate to produce gamma hydroxydecanoic acid.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a way of culturing or incubating the microorganism capable of hydrolyzing castor oil and a microorganism capable of affecting beta oxidation of the castor oil hydrolyzate in the presence of the castor oil to produce gamma hydroxydecanoic acid is also shown in that document.
    </p>
    <p num="9">European published patent application 258993 of Apr. 9, 1988 discloses a process for the production of optically active gamma hydroxydecanoic acid suitable for conversion to optically active gamma decalactone.</p>

    <p num="14">In the flavor and fragrance art the need has risen for the development of more efficient production of naturally occurring lactones which have heretofore been found to be useful and necessary in the creation of flavor formulation used in augmenting or enhancing the aroma or taste of such items as foodstuffs, chewing gums and toothpastes, and also useful in augmenting or enhancing the aroma of perfume compositions such as colognes, perfumed articles either in solid or liquid state as, for example, ionic, cationic, nonionic or zwitterionic detergents, perfumed polymers, fabric softener compositions, fabric softener articles, hair preparations and cosmetic powders.</p>
    <p num="15">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved method for preparing certain saturated naturally occurring lactones found to be suitable for a wide variety of purposes in a more efficient manner to produce a higher yield and greater conversion.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">The above and other objects and features of the invention are obtained in accordance in the present invention by carrying out a process using oxidative reaction techniques to produce and recover certain naturally occurring saturated lactones found to be useful for their organoleptic properties in augmenting or enhancing the aroma or taste of consumable materials such as foodstuffs, chewing gums, toothpaste, additional products, chewing tobaccos, smoking tobaccos, perfume compositions, colognes and perfumed articles such as solid or liquid detergents, perfumed polymers, fabric softener compositions, fabric softener articles, cosmetic powders, hair preparations and the like, which saturated lactones are defined according to the structure:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="17">
      wherein R is a member selected from the group consisting of methyl and n-propyl.
      <br/>
      These compounds are  DELTA -decalactone and  DELTA -dodecalactone, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The process to produce the lactone compositions of the invention are carried out under oxidative growth conditions by preparing (1) an aqueous nutrient medium including a source of sugar in a first aqueous liquid phase, and (2) a second non-aqueous, organic liquid phase (which is the "organic" phase) containing a significant concentration of the unsaturated 5-olide compound represented by the structural formula:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="19">
      wherein R is a member selected from a group consisting of methyl and n-propyl.
      <br/>
      The starting materials thus can be a natural 2-decen-1,5-olide or a natural 2-dodecen-1,5-olide compound.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The first aqueous liquid phase and the second organic liquid phase are mixed together with agitation to form a two-phase system while (i) maintaining sufficiently low dextrose levels and (ii) aerating with an oxygen-containing gas such as air or oxygen, whereby oxidative growth is achieved with surprisingly high conversion of the unsaturated 5-olide compound into the corresponding saturated 5-olide compound.
      <br/>
      The reaction is carried out in the presence of a selected yeast capable of producing the natural  DELTA -lactone.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="24">The reaction according to the present invention is shown thusly:  (Chemical Structure image '9' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="25">wherein R is methyl or n-propyl.</p>
    <p num="26">
      More specifically, the reaction involving oxidative growth concerns (i) maintenance of sufficiently low dextrose levels in the reaction medium and (ii) the use of an oxygen containing gas such as air or oxygen which is dissolved in a L relatively high amount into the reaction medium.
      <br/>
      In the process of the invention the yeast species that is preferably used is Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
      <br/>
      However, other yeast species of Saccharomyces can be used to obtain comparable results.
    </p>
    <p num="27">The process is carried out by first introducing an inoculum of the selected yeast species into a reaction vessel which contains a production medium, typically including glycine or other equivalent nutrient source, a buffering agent such as KH2 PO4, a yeast extract and other nutrient sources which may include trace minerals and growth factors.</p>
    <p num="28">Immediately subsequent to the introduction of the inoculum, a source of dextrose in a suitable nutrient medium is begun feeding into the reaction vessel (and throughout the entire fermentation procedure).</p>
    <p num="29">Up to about 30 hours after inoculation, a mixture of the unsaturated clide compound; namely 2-decen-1,5-olide or 2-dodecen-2,5-olide and a fatty acid ester (the organic phase) (or substitute therefor as set forth infra) is-pumped into the reaction vessel.</p>
    <p num="30">
      A particularly suitable fatty acid ester is NEOBEE.RTM. oil which is a triglyceride of C8 -C10 fatty acids.
      <br/>
      Other suitable fatty acid esters can be used for this purpose for example olive oil, castor oil, safflower oil, soybeam oil and the like.
      <br/>
      In place of the triglycerides, high molecular weight hydrocarbons such as hexadecane and tetradecane can be used.
      <br/>
      The mixture of the unsaturated olide compound and the fatty acid ester (or substitute therefor) constitutes the second liquid organic phase.
      <br/>
      The triglyceride (or substitute therefore) functions, inter alia, as the organic phase former and keeps the substrate separated from the yeast.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      It must be emphasized that the product and substrate are each toxic to the microorganism, Saccharomyces.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, our novel two phase process gives rise to a diminution of such toxicity thus resulting in a surprisingly substantial increase in product yield and conversion.
      <br/>
      Such diminution of toxicity is created by the low partition coefficient between the two phases: the organic phase containing relatively high concentrations of olide reactant and product and the aqueous phase containing the microorganism, the actual reaction taking place proximate the phase interface.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Furthermore, our novel two phase fermentation surprisingly reduces the cost of product recovery.
      <br/>
      The organic-phase-containing product is easily separable from the aqueous phase by a simple procedure, i.e. the use of a centrifuge or other simple phase separation techniques.
      <br/>
      The product is recovered from the organic phase by means of routine distillation, and the triglyceride (or substitute therefor) is recycled thus giving rise to an environmental advantage.
      <br/>
      Our approach eliminates the high cost of extraction using an environmentally unacceptable organic solvent and substantially eliminates all environmental safety issues, and health hazards that are associated with the use of such environmentally unacceptable organic solvents.
    </p>
    <p num="33">The nutrient feed which contains the dextrose and may also contain a solution of vitamins as desired and trace mineral solutions as desired as well as buffers, and the like is pumped into the reaction vessel.</p>
    <p num="34">It is to be understood that the production medium and the nutrient medium suitable for the present invention are well known and understood by persons skilled in the art.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The fermentation reaction is permitted to proceed being careful to maintain oxidative growth conditions in the reaction vessel by balancing dextrose feed and oxygen injection into the system.
      <br/>
      Thus, the concentration of the dextrose is maintained at least about 0.01 grams per liter to as much as 1.5 grams per liter, preferably 0.1 to 0.5 grams per liter, most preferably at about 0.03-0.07 grams per liter during the fermentation reaction.
      <br/>
      The preferred operable range of dextrose concentrations during the fermentation is a function of the specific Saccharomyces organism species or strain used.
      <br/>
      The actual dextrose concentration varies at any given time from a minimum to a maximum recognizing that too high a dextrose concentration will result in fermentative growth and production of ethyl alcohol resulting in lower biomass production (giving rise to much lower product yield and conversion).
      <br/>
      By automatic addition of the nutrient feed, the nutrient feed rate can range from about 5 to about 72 grams per liter per hour.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The desired temperature of the reaction is approximately 30 (degree)  C. although this can vary as will be understood by persons skilled in this art.
      <br/>
      The optimum temperature of the reaction can be readily determined by skilled operators using parameters well understood in the fermentation art.
      <br/>
      A typical range of temperature is 20 to 50 (degree)  C. It is a feature of the fermentation reaction of the present invention to avoid the formation of excessive amounts of alcohol which is typically produced in prior known methods.
      <br/>
      Under the reaction conditions discovered by applicants, unwanted alcohol production is avoided by a control of the dextrose addition and charging of the oxygen source to the system.
      <br/>
      Thus, the rate of dextrose addition and oxygen (or air) addition is such, -as to maintain oxidative growth in the reaction medium, avoiding the formation of excessive C2 H5 OH, and enabling the substrate; namely, the unsaturated olide compound to slowly diffuse out of the organic phase into the aqueous phase and thereby control the reaction to form the saturated olide compound product as discussed supra.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      As an example of oxygen in the system, the oxygen is introduced at a rate which is at least about 0.1 liters per liter of reaction mixture.
      <br/>
      The injection of air or other oxygen containing gas is controlled so as to measure at least 10% dissolved oxygen as measured by a standard oxygen probe at all times during the reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="38">The resulting products in the form of mixtures of saturated lactones or as separate lactones or groups of lactones are useful in augmenting or enhancing the aroma or taste of consumable materials as set forth herein.</p>
    <p num="39">
      The form in which the microorganism Saccharomyces yeast is used is not critical.
      <br/>
      It can be used as a culture in a suspension including the cells and the corresponding nutrient solution or in the form of cells suspended in a buffering solution.
      <br/>
      The cells or an enzyme extract thereof may be immobilized on a suitable solid support which may then be used to effect the transformation.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The culture suspension is prepared by inoculation of a suitable medium with the microorganism.
      <br/>
      A suitable medium is one which contains carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inorganic salts and growth factors.
      <br/>
      Among the suitable carbon sources are for example, glucose, galactose, L-sorbose, maltose, sucrose, cellobiose, trehalose, L-arabinose, L-rhamnose, ethanol, glycerol, L-erythritol, D-mannitol, lactose, melibiose, raffinose, melezitose, starch, D-xylose, D-sorbitol, alpha-methyl-D-glucoside, lactic acid, citric acid and succinic acid.
      <br/>
      Among the suitable nitrogen sources are, for example, nitrogen containing organic substances such as peptone, meat extract, yeast extract, corn steep liquor, casein, urea, amino acids, or nitrogen containing inorganic compounds such as nitrates, nitrites, and inorganic ammonium salts.
      <br/>
      Among the suitable inorganic salts are, for example, phosphates of magnesium, potassium, calcium, and sodium.
      <br/>
      The above mentioned nutrients in the culture medium may be supplemented with, for example, one or more vitamins of the B Group and/or one of more trace minerals such as Fe, Mo, Cu, Mn, B as desired.
      <br/>
      However, the process can be performed in a vitamin-free medium; for example, when a small amount of yeast extract is added to the medium there is no need for vitamins or trace minerals.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The cultivation of the microorganism can be carried out as a stationary culture or as a submerged culture (e.g. shaking culture, fermentors) preferably under aerobic conditions.
      <br/>
      One suitably may work in the pH range of from about 3.5 to about 8.0, and preferably in the range of from about 4.0 to about 7.5. The pH may be regulated by the addition of inorganic or organic bases, such as aqueous or gaseous ammonia, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, by ion-exchange resins, or by the addition of a buffer such as phosphate or phthalate.
      <br/>
      The incubation temperature is suitably maintained at between about 15 (degree)  C. and about 33 (degree)  C., with a range from about 20 (degree)  C. to about 30 (degree)  C. being preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The process in accordance with the invention is conveniently carried out by adding a source of sugar, such as dextrose to the culture medium at the onset of cultivation, as the carbon source.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the dextrose may be added in combination with another carbon source, as mentioned above, either during cultivation, or when the cultivation is complete.
      <br/>
      The amount level, or concentration of the substrate in the medium may vary.
      <br/>
      For example, in the case of sources of dextrose, levels of from about 0.3% to about 5% may make up the medium initially or be added during the course of the oxidative growth, although the specific level of dextrose source may be easily determined and can be varied.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The reaction time may vary depending on the composition of the culture medium and the substrate concentration.
      <br/>
      In general, shaking flask cultures require from between about 2 h. and about 240 h. depending upon the microorganism and the composition of the culture medium.
      <br/>
      However, when a fermenter vessel is used the oxidative reduction reaction time may be reduced to about 100 h. or less.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The reaction of this invention may be carried out using the cells of the yeast microorganism isolated from the culture solution, or with an enzyme extract isolated from the cells in a manner known per se.
      <br/>
      The yeast cells may be immobilized on a solid support and the desired transformation effected in the absence of the live yeast microorganism.
      <br/>
      The transformation of the substrate may be effected by mutants of the yeast microorganism.
      <br/>
      Such mutants can be obtained readily by methods well known in the art, for example, by exposing the yeast cells to UV or X-rays, or customary mutagenic substances such as, for example, acridine orange.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The substrate which is the unsaturated olide compound is generally added directly to the production medium.
      <br/>
      Sources for the 2-decen-1,5-olide or the 2-dodecen-1,5-olide can vary but it has been found that a particularly suitable source for the purposes of this invention is Massoi bark oil and more particularly a Massoi lactone C10 fraction for the source of 2-decen-1,5-olide.
      <br/>
      The Massoi lactone C.2 fraction is a preferred source for the 2-dodecen-1,5-olide.
      <br/>
      Particularly suitable materials are sold by Haldin International Inc. of Closter, N.J. One such product is natural 2-decenoic delta lactone (GRAS) FEMA No. 3744 which is a pale yellow liquid with a dry musty coconut, creamy flavor and aroma with a refractive index of 1.467-1.477 and a molecular weight of 168.
      <br/>
      It is insoluble in water and soluble in alcohol with a specific gravity of 0.982-0.992.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Also available from Haldin is a natural fractionated Massoi bark oil, Fema No. 3747, which is a mixture of 2-decenoic, 2-dodecenoic and 2-tetra decenoic delta lactones.
      <br/>
      The appearance is a pale yellow liquid with a fruity, oily coconut, creamy flavor and aroma.
      <br/>
      The mixture is also insoluble in water and soluble in alcohol.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The triglyceride (or substitutes therefor) is added to the production medium with the unsaturated olide to form the organic phase.
      <br/>
      The triglyceride controls the rate of diffusion of the unsaturated clide and saturated olide product into the aqueous phase in such a way that the toxicity of substrate and product to the microorganism is substantially eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="48">Triglycerides of C8 -C10 fatty acids as well as vegetable oils and substitutes therefore cited supra are well suitable for this purpose, including the specific NEOBEE.RTM. oil.</p>
    <p num="49">Conventional antifoam agents, such as silicone oils (e.g., UCON.RTM.), polyalkyleneglycol derivatives, maize oil, or soya oil can be used to control foaming as is known in the art.</p>
    <p num="50">
      The saturated lactone compounds obtained in accordance with the present invention and one or more auxiliary perfume ingredients, including for example, hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, nitrites, esters, ethers, synthetic essential oils, lactones other than those of our invention, and natural essential oils may be admixed so that the combined odors of the individual components produce a pleasant and desired fragrance, particularly and preferably in the fruity area (e.g., peach and apricot aromas).
      <br/>
      Such perfume compositions usually contain (a) the main note or the "bouquet" or foundation stone of the composition; (b) modifiers which round off and accompany the main note; (c) fixatives which include odorous substances which lead a particular note to the perfume throughout all stages of evaporation and substances which retard evaporation-and (d) topnotes which are usually low-boiling, fresh-smelling materials.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In perfume compositions, it is the individual compositions which contribute to their particular olfactory characteristics, however, the overall sensory effect of the perfume composition will be at least the sum total of the effects of each of the ingredients.
      <br/>
      Thus, one or more of the lactone derivative(s) of our invention can be used to alter, modify or enhance the aroma characteristics of a perfume composition, for example, by utilizing or moderating the olfactory reaction contributed by another ingredient in the composition.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The amount of lactone derivative(s) of our invention which will be effective in perfume compositions as well as in perfumed articles and colognes depends upon many factors including the other ingredients, their amounts and the effects which are desired.
      <br/>
      It has been found that perfume compositions containing as little as 0.005% of lactone derivative(s) or even less (e.g., 0.0025) can be used to impart sweet, fresh fruity, peach aromas with sweet, creamy, nut-like topnotes and heavy fruity peach undertones to soaps, cosmetics, detergents including anionic, cationic, nonionic and zwitterionic solid or liquid detergents, perfumed polymers and other products.
      <br/>
      The amount employed can range up to 70% of the fragrance components and will depend upon the consideration of cost, nature of the end product, the effect desired on the finished product and the particular fragrance sought.
    </p>
    <p num="53">The saturated lactone compounds of this invention are useful when either taken alone or take together with other perfumery ingredients in detergents, soaps, space odorants and deodorants, perfumes, colognes, toilette waters, bath preparations, hair preparations such as lacquers, brilliantines, pomades and shampoos; cosmetic preparations such as creams, deodorants, hand lotions and sun screens; powders such as talcs, dusting powders, face powders and the like.</p>
    <p num="54">
      As little as 0.25% of the saturated lactone compound can suffice to impart intense, substantive, sweet, fresh fruity, peach aroma with sweet, creamy, and nut like topnotes and heavy fruity and peach undertones to floral and patchouli perfume formulations.
      <br/>
      Generally no more than 5% of the saturated lactone compound based on the ultimate end product is required to be used in the perfume compositions.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Furthermore, as little as 0.255 of the lactone can suffice to impart such aromas to perfumed articles per se, whether in the presence of other perfume materials or whether used by themselves.
      <br/>
      Thus, the range of use of the saturated lactone compounds of this invention in perfumed articles, e.g., perfumed polymers and solid or liquid anionic, cationic, nonionic or zwitterionic solid or liquid detergents, may vary from 0.25% up to about 5% by weight based on the total weight of the perfumed article.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      In addition, the perfume composition or fragrance composition of our invention can contain a vehicle or carrier for the lactone compound.
      <br/>
      The vehicle can be a liquid such as a non-toxic alcohol, e.g., ethanol, a non-toxic glycol, e.g., propylene glycol, or the like.
      <br/>
      The carrier can also be an absorbent solid such as a gum (e.g, gum arabic or xanthan gum or guar gum) or components for encapsulating the composition by means of coacervation (such as by gelatin) or by means of formulation of a polymer around a liquid center.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished by using a urea formaldehyde prepolymer to form a polymeric capsule around a perfume composition center as is known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="57">It will be appreciated from the present disclosure that the saturated lactone compounds according to the present invention can be used to alter, vary, fortify, modify, enhance or otherwise improve the flavor of a wide variety of materials which are ingested, consumed or otherwise organoleptically sensed.</p>
    <p num="58">The terms "alter" and "modify" in their various forms will be understood herein to mean the supplying or imparting of a flavor character or note to an otherwise bland, relatively tasteless substance, or augmenting an existing flavor characteristic where the natural flavor is deficient in some regard or supplement the existing flavor impression to modify its organoleptic character.</p>
    <p num="59">The term "enhance" is intended herein to mean the intensification (by use of the saturated lactone compound of this invention) of a flavor or aroma note or nuance in a foodstuff or perfume composition or perfumed article without changing the quality of said note or nuance.</p>
    <p num="60">A "flavoring composition" as referred to herein means one which contributes a part of the overall flavor impression by supplementing or fortifying a natural or artificial flavor in a material or one which supplies substantially all the flavor and/or aroma character to a consumable article.</p>
    <p num="61">
      The term "foodstuff" as used herein included both solid and liquid ingestible material for man or animals which materials usually do, but need not, have nutritional value.
      <br/>
      Thus, foodstuffs include meats, gravies, soups, convenience foods, malt, alcoholic and other beverages, milk and diary products, seafood, including fish, crustaceans, mollusks and the like, candies, vegetables, cereals, soft drinks, snacks, dog and cat foods, other veterinary products, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="62">When the saturated lactone compounds of this invention are used in a flavoring composition, they can be combined with conventional flavoring materials or adjuvants.</p>
    <p num="63">
      Such co-ingredients or flavoring adjuvants are well known in the art for such and have been extensively described in the literature.
      <br/>
      Requirements of such adjuvant materials are : (1) that they be non-reactive with the lactone compound(s) of this invention; (2) that they be organoleptically compatible with the lactone compound(s) of this invention whereby the flavor of the ultimate consumable material to which the lactone compound(s) are added is not detrimentally affected by the use of the adjuvant; (3) that they be ingestible acceptable and thus non-toxic or otherwise non-deleterious.
      <br/>
      Apart from these requirements, conventional materials can be used and broadly include other flavor materials, vehicles, stabilizers, thickeners, surface active agents, conditioners, and flavor intensifiers.
