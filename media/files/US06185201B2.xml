    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">1) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a multiplex radio transmitter and multiplex radio transmission method, a multiplex radio receiver and multiplex radio receiving method, and a multiplex radio transceiver and multiplex transmission/receiving system suitable for use with a trunk multiplex radio communications system.</p>
    <p num="3">2) Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In recent years, when large volumes of information including such as video data are to be transmitted at high speed, a synchronous multiplex transfer mode (Synchronous Transfer Mode) based on a SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) has been widely used as a method of transmitting information data.
      <br/>
      Multiplex radio transceivers are usually located on high ground and relay multiplexed trunk signal data at microwave band through use of a synchronous multiplex transfer mode
    </p>
    <p num="5">With regard to frequency bands, the allocation of available channels in individual frequency bands is specified in detail in the form of ITU-R (International Telecommunications Union Radio Communications Sector) recommendations.</p>
    <p num="6">
      The trunk multiplex radio communications system occupies a frequency band called C-band (3.4 GHz to 8.5 GHz), and this C-band is further classified into sub-bands: that is, a 4G band, a 5G band, an L6G band, a U6G band, a 7G band, and an L8G band.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 10 through 15, the allocation of individual channels within each of the sub-bands is also specified.
      <br/>
      The 3.5 G band has been specified only in that the ends thereof have been determined as 3.4 GHz and 3.6 GHz, and details of allocation of channels within the frequency band are still under discussion and have not yet been publicly announced.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Although a modulation scheme used for a trunk multiplex radio communications system within a microwave band has not yet been specified by ITU-R recommendations, enterprises adopt a 64 or 128 quadrature amplitude modulation scheme.
      <br/>
      This is because a large volume of data must be transmitted within the foregoing frequency bands while fulfilling the specifications, such as channel allocations, a per-channel occupied bandwidth, and adjacent channel power, and therefore there is adopted a QAM scheme having a superior frequency efficiency (a transmission rate per 1 Hz).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      FIG. 23 shows the principal elements of a transmission section disposed in a transmitter of an existing trunk multiplex radio communications system.
      <br/>
      A multiplex radio transmitter 38 shown in FIG. 23 transmits a plurality of channel signals having different frequencies while converting them into a multiplexed signal and comprises a plurality of transmission sections 31 corresponding to the individual channels, an antenna 36, and an antenna diplexer 37.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In each transmission section 31, signal data (e.g., STM-1 transmitted over an SDH network) received from a synchronous multiplex repeater or a transmission-end apparatus are subjected to a baseband processing treatment in a baseband processing section (not shown).
      <br/>
      The thus-processed data are modulated and transmitted to a radio circuit.
      <br/>
      The transmission section 31 comprises a modulation section 32, a digital-to-analog converter 33, a frequency converter 34, and a band-pass filter 35.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The modulation section 32 modulates multiplexed trunk signal data and comprises a mixer 32a-1, a mixer 32a-2, a 90 (degree)  phase shifter 32b, a local oscillator 32c, and a hybrid section 32d.</p>
    <p num="11">
      More specifically, I-channel signal data are multiplied by an output signal of 70 MHz outputted from the local oscillator 32c.
      <br/>
      The mixer 32a-2 multiplies Q-channel signal data by an outputted from the mixer 32a-2 which is produced by phase-shifting the outputted from the local oscillator 32c through 90 (degree)  by means of the 90 (degree)  phase shifter 32b.
      <br/>
      As a result, the signal data items are modulated into a frequency band centered at 70 MHz and are combined into a single waveform by the hybrid section 32d.
      <br/>
      The value of 70 MHz represents an interval between the local frequency and the radio frequency (RF).
    </p>
    <p num="12">The digital-to-analog converter 33 converts a digital signal outputted from the modulation section 32 into an analog signal.</p>
    <p num="13">
      Further, the frequency converter 34 up-converts the thus-modulated signal having a 70 MHz band into C-band within the microwave band.
      <br/>
      The mixer 34a multiplies an output from the digital-to-analog converter 33 by a microwave carrier which ranges in frequency from about 3 GHz to 8 GHz and is outputted from the local oscillator 34b.
    </p>
    <p num="14">For each channel, the band-pass filter 35 limits a transmission band of a modulated signal in a microwave band outputted from the frequency converter 34 in such a way as to fulfill specifications defined for an air interface.</p>
    <p num="15">The antenna diplexer 37 combines together the band-limited signals outputted from the band-pass filter 35.</p>
    <p num="16">The antenna 36 transmits a radio signal outputted from the antenna diplexer 37.</p>
    <p num="17">
      Turning to a method for communications between a pair of multiplex radio repeaters, there has been employed an FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing) method of enabling simultaneous use of a plurality of channels by a transmit-receive channel of each radio receiver being allocated a different frequency.
      <br/>
      FIG. 24 shows an example in which each pair of multiplex radio repeaters is allocated a different channel within C-band.
      <br/>
      The frequency band shown in FIG. 24 corresponds to a U6G band within the C-band and represents a group of radio frequency (RF) channels and a group of local frequencies.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Channels 1 (6,460 MHz) to channel 8 (6,740 MHz) are allocated to a downlink, whereas channel 1' (6,800 MHz) to channel 8' (7,080 MHz) are allocated to a corresponding uplink, thus enabling selection of eight possible channels.</p>
    <p num="19">
      There is overlap between the group of radio frequency (RF) channels and the group of local frequency channels.
      <br/>
      To prevent spurious radiation, the transmitter must eliminate the local frequency signals so as to prevent these signals from being emitted over the group of radio frequency (RF) channels, through use of a filter having a narrow bandwidth.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In contrast, a receiver has a receiving device having the same frequency as that transmitted from an opposing repeater.
      <br/>
      As show in FIG. 25, the receiver must separate a channel being used from the eight possible channels through use of the band-pass filter having a narrow bandwidth.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Here, the term "opposing" signifies a repeater with which the current repeater is in communication through use of a downlink channel and an uplink channel corresponding thereto.
      <br/>
      The term "opposing" will be used herein in the same sense.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      To this end, the band-pass filter 35 provided in the transmission section 31 is required to have a narrow band as its band-pass characteristics.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, to select the channel being used the band-pass filter of the opposing receiver is also required to have a narrow band as its band-pass characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="23">However, according to the existing technique, a narrow-band filter having its center frequency in a microwave band such as that mentioned previously is very expensive and bulky.</p>
    <p num="24">Further, since the individual transmission and receiving sections disposed in the multiplex radio transceiver transmit data through use of a plurality of channels of different frequencies, there is a need for a band-pass filter having band-pass characteristics corresponding to each of the channels, thus impeding realization of a band-pass filter capable of being used in all the channels.</p>
    <p num="25">
      Moreover, data are transmitted between the repeaters through use of a plurality of channels having different frequencies.
      <br/>
      Even in such a case, there is a need for a band-pass filter having band-pass characteristics corresponding to each of the channels, thus impeding realization of a band-pass filter capable of being used in all the channels.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="26">The present invention has been conceived in view of the foregoing drawbacks of the related art, and the object of the present invention is to provide a multiplex radio transmitter and a multiplex radio transmission method, a multiplex radio receiver and a multiplex radio receiving method, and a multiplex transceiver and a multiplex transmission/receiving system, wherein a transmitter requires only one type of band-pass filter having broad band-pass characteristics; wherein a receiver requires only one type of band-pass filter which has the same band-pass characteristics as those of the transmitter and which corresponds to frequencies transmitted from the opposing transmitter; and wherein band-pass filters having different band-pass characteristics for respective channels are replaced with identical band-pass filters, thus enabling use of members having common characteristics for the transmission sections and receiving sections disposed within the multiplex radio transceiver or for repeaters, as well as enabling improvement in cost performance.</p>
    <p num="27">To this end, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a multiplex radio transmitter which multiplexes a plurality of channel signals having different frequencies into another signal and transmits the multiplexed signal, the transmitter comprising:</p>
    <p num="28">
      a plurality of transmission sections provided so as to correspond to respective channels, wherein
      <br/>
      the transmission section comprises
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      - a modulation section which modulates a data signal and outputs the modulated signal as a first intermediate frequency signal;
      <br/>
      - a first frequency conversion section which converts the frequency of the first intermediate frequency signal outputted from the modulation section, through use of a first local signal to thus output a second intermediate frequency signal which is higher in frequency than the first intermediate frequency signal by only the frequency of the first local signal;
      <br/>
      - a first filter which eliminates a frequency component of the first local signal from the second intermediate frequency signal outputted from the first frequency conversion section;
      <br/>
      - a second frequency conversion section which converts the frequency of a signal outputted from the first filter through use of a second local signal to thus output a radio frequency signal which is higher in frequency than the second intermediate frequency signal by only the frequency of the second local signal; and
      <br/>
      - a second filter which has at least a band-pass corresponding to radio frequency signals of a plurality of channels to be used; which filters out the radio frequency signal outputted from the second frequency conversion section; and which eliminates a frequency component of the second local signal.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In the multiplex radio transmitter according to the present invention, a baseband signal is temporarily converted into a second intermediate frequency, and this second intermediate frequency is selectively set to an optimum value.
      <br/>
      As a result, a group of transmission radio signals and local frequency signals are allocated at a microwave band without overlap.
      <br/>
      Consequently, there is required only one type of band-pass filter which is capable of permitting collective passage of a group of radio frequency (RF) signals and which has broad band-pass characteristics.
      <br/>
      The transmitter is prevented from producing spurious radiation.
      <br/>
      There is no need to use different channels for respective transmission sections disposed within the multiplex radio transmitter or for respective repeaters, nor is there need to individually prepare band-pass filters having different band-pass characteristics, which would otherwise be required by the existing multiplex radio transmitter.
      <br/>
      Further, there can be used, for example, a second intermediate frequency which is common to all the sub-bands within C-band (3.4 GHz to 8.5 GHz), thus yielding an advantage of allowing use of common members in the multiplex radio transmitter, as well as allowing inexpensive manufacture of a multiplex radio transmitter.
    </p>
    <p num="31">In a preferred mode, the modulation section can be configured so as to output the first intermediate frequency signal by digitally modulating a digital data signal and converting the digital data signal into an analog data signal.</p>
    <p num="32">As a result, there is yielded an advantage of allowing sending of a signal through use of a digital modulation scheme having a superior frequency conversion efficiency.</p>
    <p num="33">In a preferred mode, the modulation section can be configured so as to output the first intermediate frequency signal by converting a digital data signal into an analog data signal and modulating the analog data signal in an analog fashion.</p>
    <p num="34">As a result, there is yielded an advantage of allowing the first intermediate signal to be freely set.</p>
    <p num="35">In a preferred mode, the second intermediate frequency signal can be formed so as to have a frequency whose harmonic component is not superimposed on the radio frequency signal.</p>
    <p num="36">As a result, there is yielded an advantage of allowing practical prevention of a harmonic component of the image frequency signal group from colliding with a group of channels lying in sub-bands within C-band, thus enabling an improvement in a signal-to-noise ratio of the receiver in each channel.</p>
    <p num="37">In a preferred mode, the second intermediate frequency signal is formed so as to have at least a frequency whose harmonic component of sixth order or lower is not superimposed on the radio frequency signal.</p>
    <p num="38">Consequently, of the image frequency signal group, a channel group whose harmonic is of 6th order or lower can be actually prevented from colliding with a channel group lying in sub-bands within, e.g., C-band (3.4 GHz to 8.5 GHz), resulting in an advantage of improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the receiver in each channel.</p>
    <p num="39">In one preferred mode, the second frequency conversion section can be configured so as to output the radio frequency signal, by converting the frequency of the signal outputted from the first filter through use of the second local signal having any of a plurality of frequencies corresponding to a plurality of channels.</p>
    <p num="40">
      As a result, three bands, that is, a radio frequency (RF) signal band, a second local signal band, and an image frequency band, can be separated from one another without overlap.
      <br/>
      There is yielded an advantage of allowing use of only one type of band-pass filter without use of band-pass filters having different band-pass characteristics for transmission sections disposed within the multiplex radio transmitter or for repeaters.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a multiplex radio transmitter which multiplexes a plurality of channel signals having different frequencies into another signal and transmits the multiplexed signal, the transmitter comprising:
      <br/>
      a plurality of transmission sections provided so as to correspond to respective channels, wherein
      <br/>
      the transmission section comprises
      <br/>
      - a digital modulation section which digitally modulates a digital data signal and converts the digital data signal into an analog data signal, to thus output a first intermediate frequency signal;
      <br/>
      - a first frequency conversion section which converts the frequency of the first intermediate frequency signal outputted from the digital modulation section, through use of a first local signal, thus outputting a second intermediate frequency signal which is higher in frequency than the first intermediate frequency signal by only the frequency of the first local signal, wherein the second intermediate frequency signal has at least a frequency whose harmonic component of sixth order or lower is not superimposed on a radio frequency signal of at least 4 GHz band or higher to be used as a transmission signal;
      <br/>
      - a first filter which eliminates a frequency component of the first local signal from the second intermediate frequency signal outputted from the first frequency conversion section;
      <br/>
      - a second frequency conversion section which converts the frequency of a signal outputted from the first filter, through use of a second local signal having any of a plurality of frequencies corresponding to a plurality of channels, thus outputting the radio frequency signal which is higher in frequency than the second intermediate frequency signal by only the frequency of the second local signal; and
      <br/>
      - a second filter which has at least a band-pass corresponding to radio frequency signals of a plurality of channels to be used; which filters out the radio frequency signal outputted from the second frequency conversion section; and which eliminates a frequency component of the second local signal.
    </p>
    <p num="42">

      <br/>
      Consequently, of the image frequency signal group, a channel group whose harmonic is of 6th order or lower can be actually prevented from colliding with a channel group lying in sub-bands within C-band (3.4 GHz to 8.5 GHz), resulting in an advantage of improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the receiver in each channel.
    </p>
    <p num="43">In one preferred mode, the frequency of the second intermediate frequency signal may be set to a required frequency between 842.00 MHz and 845.02 MHz, to a frequency of 844 MHz, or to a frequency of 967.1 MHz.</p>
    <p num="44">
      The frequency can be freely set, and hence there is an advantage of freedom in radio circuit design.
      <br/>
      Further, the use of the foregoing frequency results in an advantage of preventing collision between image frequency signals of sixth order or lower among the image frequency signal group and channel groups provided in sub-bands within C-band (3.4 GHz to 8.5 GHz).
      <br/>
      Still further, there is yielded an advantage of improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the receiver in each channel, because in practice the influence of the other image frequency signal group is small.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a multiplex radio transmission method for use with a multiplex radio transmitter which multiplexes a plurality of channel signals having different frequencies into a signal and transmits the thus multiplexed signal, wherein each of a plurality of transmission sections provided so as to correspond to channels produces a first intermediate frequency signal by modulating a data signal and converts the frequency of the modulated data signal, thereby transmitting a radio frequency signal at a higher frequency, the method being characterized by the feature that
      <br/>
      when the intermediate frequency signal is converted into the radio frequency signal through frequency conversion, the transmission section converts the intermediate frequency signal into a second intermediate frequency signal having an intermediate frequency between the frequency of the intermediate frequency signal and that of the radio frequency signal and converts the second intermediate frequency signal into the radio frequency signal through frequency conversion.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      As a result, the multiplex radio transmission method according to the present invention enables mutual separation of three bands, that is, a radio frequency (RF) signal band, a second local signal band, and an image frequency band without overlap.

      Further, there can be used the third intermediate frequency which is common to all the sub-bands within, for example, C-band (3.4 GHz to 8.5 GHz), thus yielding an advantage of enabling use of common members in the receiving sections disposed within the multiplex radio receiver or in repeaters, as well as allowing inexpensive manufacture of a multiplex radio receiver.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="89">(A) Description of a First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="90">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described hereinbelow by reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="91">
      FIG. 1 is a circuit diagram showing the configuration of a trunk multiplex radio transmission/receiving system using a digital modulation scheme according to a first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      A trunk multiplex radio transmission/receiving system 22 using a digital modulation scheme and shown in FIG. 1 relays multiplexed trunk signal data (STM-1) between synchronous multiplex repeaters or between a synchronous multiplex repeater and a transmission-end apparatus.
      <br/>
      The trunk multiplex radio transmission/receiving system 22 comprises a multiplex radio transmitter (hereinafter often referred to simply as a "transmitter") 20a which transmits a plurality of channel signals having different frequencies while converting them into a multiplexed signal; a multiplex radio receiver (hereinafter often referred to simply as a "receiver") 20b which receives a plurality of multiplexed channel signals having different frequencies; and a radio propagation path 29.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      Here, the transmitter 20a digitally modulates multiplexed trunk signal data (STM-1) received from a synchronous multiplex repeater or a transmission-end apparatus and transmits the thus-modulated data to the radio propagation path 29.
      <br/>
      The transmitter 20a comprises a plurality of radio transmission sections 10a provided so as to correspond to respective channels; an antenna 8a; and an antenna diplexer 9a.
    </p>
    <p num="93">A frame format of the trunk multiplex signal data (STM-1) comprises an SOH (Section Over Head) which will serve as a header and multiplexed data.</p>
    <p num="94">The SOH consists of additional bits for establishing a layer 2 link between synchronous multiplex repeaters or between a synchronous multiplex repeater and a transmission-end apparatus, thus embodying features such as an error correction capability, a client service information capability, a resending control capability, or the like.</p>
    <p num="95">
      A transmission rate of STM-1 is 155.52 Mbps and corresponds to 2,016 channels of a telephone line, provided that the transmission rate per channel is 64kbps.
      <br/>
      A modulation rate corresponds to a value resulting from dividing a transmission rate of 155.52 Mbps by loge (a multivalued modulation number).
      <br/>
      More specifically, in a case where a 64 QAM scheme is used, there is obtained a modulation rate of 155.52 (Mbps)/6(bits)=about 26 Mbps.
      <br/>
      In a case where a 128 QAM scheme is used, there is obtained a modulation rate of 155.52 (Mbps)/7(bits)=about 22 Mbps.
    </p>
    <p num="96">As set forth, the modulation rate is univocally determined by means of a STM-1 transmission frame format and by a multivalued digital modulation number.</p>
    <p num="97">
      Each radio transmission section 10a subjects the multiplexed trunk STM-1 data to a required baseband processing treatment in a baseband processing section and digitally modulates the thus-processed data.
      <br/>
      The transmission section 10a comprises a digital modulation section 2a, a first frequency converter 3a, a first band-pass filter 4a, a second frequency converter 5a, a second band-pass filter 6a, and a high power amplifier 7a.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      The digital modulation section 2a digitally modulates the STM-1 data processed by the baseband processing section.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the digital modulation section 2a comprises a hybrid section 11a, a mapping section 12a, a roll-off filter 13a-1, a roll-off filter 13a-2, a quadrature modulation section 14a, and a digital-to-analog converter 18a.
    </p>
    <p num="99">The hybrid section 11a converts the STM-1 data into parallel data through serial-to-parallel conversion.</p>
    <p num="100">The mapping section 12a maps data bits of the I- and Q-channels into a constellation (or an arrangement of signal points) in groups data bits--which are equal in number to a multivalued modulation number--and encodes the amplitude and phase of the transmitted signal.</p>
    <p num="101">
      The roll-off filter 13a-1 processes the I-channel signal through waveform shaping at a rate which is four times the modulation rate, in order to prevent intersymbol interference at the receiving end.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the roll-off filter 13a-2 processes the Q-channel signal at a rate which is four times the modulation speed.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      The quadrature modulation section 14a performs a baseband modulation operation by multiplying the oversampled I-channel signal--which is an outputted from the roll-off filter 13a-1--and the oversampled Q-channel signal-which is an outputted from the roll-off filter 13a-2--by a clock signal which is four times as fast as the modulation rate.
      <br/>
      The quadrature modulation section 14a comprises a mixer 15a-1, a mixer 15a-2, a quadrature carrier signal generator 16a, and an adder 17a.
    </p>
    <p num="103">The mixer 15a-1 multiplies the I-channel signal--which is oversampled at a rate four times the modulation rate and is outputted from the roll-off filter 13a-1--by a quadrature carrier signal which is as fast as the I-channel signal.</p>
    <p num="104">More specifically, as is obvious from boxes provided in FIG. 2, the I-channel data signal--whose amplitude is sampled at a rate four times the modulation rate fQ --is multiplied by cos�2 *  PI  * (4 * fQ) * t� which is produced by the quadrature carrier signal generator 16a and assumes three values 1,0,-1,0,1 . . . , whereby the data are converted into a data string of I,0,-I,0,I,0,-I,0,I,0,-I, . . . .</p>
    <p num="105">Similarly, the Q-channel data signal--whose amplitude is sampled at a rate four times the modulation rate fQ --is multiplied by sin�2 *  PI  * (4 * fQ) * t� which is produced by the quadrature carrier signal generator 16a and assumes three values 0,1,0,-1,0 . . . , whereby the data are converted into a data string of 0,Q,0,-Q,0,Q,0, -Q,0,Q,0, . . . .</p>
    <p num="106">The adder 17a adds the I-channel data outputted from the mixer 15a-1 to the Q-channel data outputted from the mixer 15a-2, thus outputting a data string of I,Q,-I,-Q,I,Q,-I,-Q,I,Q,-I, . . . because of only a phase difference of ( PI /2) between cos and sin.</p>
    <p num="107">In short, in view of an output of the modulation section, the I-channel data and the Q-channel data appear to be selectively output.</p>
    <p num="108">
      More specifically, the quadrature carrier signal generator 16a is a counter provided within an LSI (Large Scale Integration) circuit and produces the carrier signal by dividing the fastest clock signal.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, an arbitrary frequency cannot be selected.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      The digital-to-analog converter 18a converts digital data outputted from the quadrature modulation section 14a into analog data and produces an output spectrum such as that shown in FIG. 3 (a).
      <br/>
      The spectrum comes about while being centered on the modulation rate fM.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      The first frequency converter 3a converts a first IF signal (a first intermediate frequency signal) outputted from the digital modulation section 2a into a second IF signal (a second intermediate frequency signal) which is higher in frequency than the first IF signal by only the frequency of a first local signal of the first frequency converter.
      <br/>
      In the first frequency converter 3a, a mixer 3a-1 mixes a signal outputted from a first local signal oscillator 3a-2 into the first IF signal outputted from the digital modulation section 2a.
    </p>
    <p num="111">The way the frequency value of the second IF signal is determined will be described later.</p>
    <p num="112">
      The first band-pass filter 4a eliminates a frequency component of the first local signal outputted from the first frequency converter 3a, thus permitting passage of only the second IF signal.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3(b) shows the band-pass characteristics of the first band-pass filter 4a.
      <br/>
      As shown in this drawing, the first band-pass filter 4a permits passage of only the frequency of 844 MHz, which is the frequency of the second IF signal (the way the frequency of the second IF signal is determined will be described later) but prevents the passage of the first local signal whose frequency (818 MHz) is lower than that of the second IF signal by about 26 MHz.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      The second frequency converter 5a outputs a radio frequency (RF) signal by up-converting an outputted from the first band-pass filter 4a through use of a second local signal capable of oscillating eight kinds of frequencies.
      <br/>
      A mixer 5a-1 mixes a second local signal outputted from a second local signal oscillator 5a-2 with the second IF signal outputted from the first band-pass filter 4a.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      For example, FIG. 4 shows allocation of a group of frequencies of the second local signal and radio frequencies (RF), through use of the U6G band as a sub-band.
      <br/>
      As shown in the drawing, the group of frequencies of the second local signal and the group of radio frequency (RF) signals do not overlap one another and are separated in frequency from one another.
    </p>
    <p num="115">Further, the second band-pass filter 6a has at least a band-pass width corresponding to radio frequency signals of a plurality of channels to be used and filters the radio frequency (RF) signal outputted from the second frequency converter 5a, thus eliminating a frequency component of the second local signal.</p>
    <p num="116">
      The band-pass characteristics of the second band-pass filter 6a shown in FIG. 4 are such that the center frequency lies in the microwave band, and the second band-pass filter has a band-pass width of 340 MHz.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the pass-band width corresponds to the sum of the radio frequency (RF) group of 280 MHz and the bandwidth guard space of 30 MHz provided on either side thereof.
      <br/>
      As a result, individual channels of the group of radio frequency (RF) signals can be collectively passed through use of only one type of second band-pass filter having broad band-pass characteristics, without need for a second band-pass filter having narrow band-pass characteristics for each radio frequency (RF) signal channel.
    </p>
    <p num="117">A signal-to-noise ratio of the receiver can be improved, so long as the value of the second IF frequency is selected in such a way as to prevent collision between the image frequency obtained by multiplication of the second IF frequency by the local signal and a signal in another sub-band within C-band.</p>
    <p num="118">The high power amplifier 7a amplifies a radio frequency (RF) signal outputted from the second band-pass filter 6a with high efficiency and low distortion.</p>
    <p num="119">
      The antenna 8a is connected to each of the radio transmission sections 10a via the antenna diplexer 9a and transfers to the radio propagation path 29 the digitally-modulated radio frequency (RF) signals outputted from the individual radio transmission sections 10a.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the antenna 8a is configured as an antenna to be shared among the radio transmission sections 10a.
    </p>
    <p num="120">The antenna diplexer 9a connects the radio frequency (RF) signals outputted from the individual radio transmission sections 10a to the shared antenna 8a.</p>
    <p num="121">
      In contrast, the receiver 20b digitally demodulates the radio frequency (RF) signal, which has passed through the radio propagation path 29, and sends the STM-1 signal to another synchronous multiplex repeater or another transmission-end apparatus.
      <br/>
      To this end, the receiver 20b shown in FIG. 1 comprises an antenna 8b, an antenna diplexer 9b, a plurality of radio receiving sections 10b provided so as to correspond to the individual channels, and a baseband processing section (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      The antenna 8b is connected to each of the radio receiving sections 10b via the antenna diplexer 9b and receives a radio frequency (RF) signal.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the antenna 8b is constituted as an antenna to be shared among the radio receiving sections 10b.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      Each radio receiving section 10b digitally demodulates the radio frequency (RF) signal received by the antenna 8b and outputs the STM-1 signal after having subjected the RF signal to a baseband processing treatment.
      <br/>
      The radio receiving section 10b comprises a low-noise amplifier 7b, a third band-pass filter 6b, a third frequency converter 5b, a fourth band-pass filter 4b, a fourth frequency converter 3b, and a digital demodulator 2b.
    </p>
    <p num="124">The low-noise amplifier 7b amplifies the radio frequency (RF) signal received by the antenna 8b with little noise.</p>
    <p num="125">
      The third band-pass filter 6b has at least a band-pass width corresponding to radio frequency signals of a plurality of channels to be used.
      <br/>
      The third band-pass filter 6b eliminates a frequency component of the image signal from the radio frequency (RF) signal outputted from the low-noise amplifier 7b, thus selecting a desired signal.
      <br/>
      As a result, individual channels of radio frequency (RF) signals can be collectively passed through use of only one type of band-pass filter without need for a band-pass filter for each radio frequency (RF) signal channel.
      <br/>
      The third band-pass filter 6b has band-pass characteristics such as those shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The third IF signal used in the receiver has a frequency of 844 MHz; the reason for this will be described later.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      The third frequency converter 5b converts the frequency of the radio frequency (RF) signal outputted from the third band-pass filter 6b, through use of a third local signal, thereby outputting a third IF signal whose frequency is lower than that of the radio frequency (RF) signal by the frequency of the third local signal.
      <br/>
      A mixer 5b-1 mixes a third local signal outputted from a third local signal oscillator 5b-2 with the radio frequency (RF) signal outputted from the third band-pass filter 6b.

      As shown in FIG. 3(b), the band-pass characteristics of the fourth band-pass filter 4b permit passage of only a frequency of 844 MHz, which corresponds to the third IF signal, but prevent passage of the first local signal (818 MHz) whose frequency is lower than that of the third IF signal by about 26 MHz.

    <p num="131">The analog-to-digital converter 18b converts the fourth IF signal received from the fourth frequency converter 3b through analog-to-digital conversion.</p>
    <p num="132">The quadrature detection section 14b demodulates a digital signal outputted from the analog-to-digital converter 18b and comprises a hybrid section 17b which converts an outputted from the analog-to-digital converter 18b through serial-to-analog conversion; a quadrature carrier signal generator 16b which produces quadrature carrier signals cos�2 *  PI  * (4 * v) * t� and sin�2 *  PI  * (4 * v) * t� (v: modulation rate); a mixer 15b-1 which reproduces a bit string having amplitude values by multiplication of I-channel data by the quadrature carrier signal; and a mixer 15b-2 which reproduces a bit string having amplitude values by multiplication of Q-channel data by the quadrature carrier signal.</p>
    <p num="133">
      The integrator 13b-1 extracts the bit position of demodulated data regarding the modulation rate "v" from an I-channel bit string which is outputted from the quadrature detection section 14b and is sampled at high speed.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the integrator 13b-2 extracts the bit position of demodulated data regarding the modulation rate "v" from a Q-channel bit string which is outputted from the quadrature detection section 14b and is sampled at high speed.
    </p>
    <p num="134">The reverse mapping section 12b decodes the amplitude and phase of the transmitted signal from the demodulated data bits regarding the modulation speed outputted from the integrators 13b-1 and 13b-2, thereby extracting demodulated data in an actual signal space in groups of data bits which are equal in number to the multivalued modulation number.</p>
    <p num="135">The demodulated data are subjected to a required baseband processing treatment in the baseband processing section and are sent as STM-1 data to another synchronous multiplex repeater or a transmission-end apparatus.</p>
    <p num="136">
      Full duplex communication is established between the two opposing repeaters over the radio propagation path 29 through use of required channels.
      <br/>
      Of these channels, one type of channel is used for a backup purpose.
      <br/>
      A master repeater transmits a radio signal at, e.g., a downlink transmission frequency X which is one of seven types of channels.
      <br/>
      A slave repeater which opposes the master repeater receives the thus-transmitted signal having the transmission frequency X. Simultaneously, the slave repeater transmits a signal at an uplink transmission frequency X', and the master repeater which opposes the slave repeater receives the signal having the transmission frequency X'.
    </p>
    <p num="137">For example, frequencies in a U6G band within C-band are allocated in a manner such as that shown in FIG. 13; namely, the uplink channel is allocated channel 1' (a frequency of 6800.0 MHz) to channel 8' (a frequency of 7080.0 MHz); and the downlink channel is allocated channel 1 (a frequency of 6460.0 MHz) to channel 8 (a frequency of 6740.0 MHz).</p>
    <p num="138">Since the transmitter and the receiver each select one channel from the eight types of channels, they become symmetrical to each other in terms of band-pass characteristics.</p>
    <p num="139">
      For example, in a case where a frequency of 844 MHz is selected as the second and third IF frequencies, three bands, i.e., the radio frequency (RF) signal, band the local signal band, and the image frequency band, can be allocated as shown in FIG. 4 in such a way as not to overlap one another.
      <br/>
      As a result, the local signal band is separated from the group of radio frequency (RF) signals, and the transmitter requires only one type of band-pass filter capable of permitting collective passage of the plurality of radio frequency (RF) signals.
      <br/>
      Members having common specifications can be used for the individual radio transmission sections disposed within the multiplex radio transmitter or for repeaters.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is no need for individual band-pass filters having different band-pass characteristics, which would otherwise be provided for individual radio transmission sections or repeaters.
    </p>
    <p num="140">So long as the second IF signal is selected so as to prevent collision between the image frequency obtained by multiplication of the second IF frequency by the local signal and a signal in another sub-band within C-band, the transmitter will be prevented from producing spurious radiation, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the receiver can be improved.</p>
    <p num="141">
      Similarly, the receiver does not require in its front-end stage filters having band-pass characteristics corresponding to the channels used for individual radio receiving sections or repeaters.
      <br/>
      The receiver requires only one type of band-pass filter, thus enabling use of members having common specifications for the individual radio receiving sections provided within the multiplex radio receiver or for repeaters.

    <p num="142">The intermediate frequency determined in consideration of such a special value will be referred to as an "optimum second IF" at the sending end and as an "optimum third IF" at the receiving end.</p>
    <p num="143">A method of selecting the optimum second and third IF frequencies will now be described in detail.</p>
    <p num="144">The optimum second IF signal F1 (or the optimum third IF signal) is determined in consideration of the following:</p>
    <p num="145">
      (1) The radio frequency (RF) signal band and the local signal band must be sufficiently separated from each other in order to prevent overlap among the radio frequency (RF) signal band, the local signal band, and the image frequency band and to separate them from one another.
      <br/>
      This is because small difference between the bands may cause the local signal band to mixedly exist within the radio frequency (RF) signal band.
    </p>
    <p num="146">(2) The lower limit of the optimum second or third IF frequency is taken into consideration.</p>
    <p num="147">
      (3) The image frequency �a theoretically infinite number of frequency groups produced from a harmonic of the local signal and a harmonic of the radio frequency (RF) signal� must be prevented from falling within the radio frequency (RF) signal band.
      <br/>
      In short, the radio frequency (RF) signal is protected from the influence of the image frequency.
    </p>
    <p num="148">(4) The second IF frequency is selected not only so as to become effective within one transmit/receive sub-band within C-band (ranging in frequency from 3.4 GHz to 3.5 GHz) but also so as to become useful as a shared second IF among all the other sub-bands.</p>
    <p num="149">The foregoing items (1) through (4) will now be examined.</p>
    <p num="150">With regard to item (1), a frequency difference on the order of several tens of mega-hertz is evidently insufficient, and hence the frequency difference is set to about several hundreds of mega-hertz.</p>
    <p num="151">
      Next, item (2) is examined.
      <br/>
      Since the second IF frequency at the sending end and the third IF frequency at the receiving end are equal to each other, attention is focused on only the second IF frequency at the sending end.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      The lower limit of the optimum second IF frequency described in item (2) is determined by the bandwidth of the sub-band.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, when the transmission radio frequency (RF) signal is extracted for each band through use of the common band-pass filter, in each frequency band the band-pass of the filter must be wider than the sum of the bandwidth of channels 1 through 8 and a band-width guard space widths provided at each end of the band, in order to prevent the upper limit of the local signal band from overlapping with the lower end of the radio frequency (RF) signal band.
      <br/>
      Of the individual sub-bands, the sub-band having the widest bandwidth is U6G band (680 MHz).
      <br/>

      The frequency converter shown in FIG. 6 multiplies the fundamental harmonic P1 of the second intermediate frequency by the fundamental harmonic P2 of the carrier frequency.
      <br/>
      Here, the harmonics of P1 and P2 are also multiplied together, thereby resulting in unwanted image frequency components.
      <br/>
      An image frequency fi is expressed by the sum of an integral multiple of P1 and an integral multiple of P2.

      This signal is at the upper side of the carrier and is not eliminated by the band-pass filter: namely, the signal corresponds to the transmission radio frequency (RF) signal.

      In contrast, fi =-P1+P2 represents a signal obtained when m=-1 and n=1.

      More specifically, carrier P2 assumes a large value ranging in frequency from 3.4 GHz to 8.3 GHz, and carrier P1 representing a signal frequency assumes a value which does not exceed the value of P2.

      The range of the horizontal axis (P1/P2) must be limited to a range which can be of practical use.

    <p num="167">The optimum second intermediate frequency F1 is determined, and a possible range of the carrier frequency F2 is examined, whereby a range of (F1/F2) is plotted on the coordinate system comprising the (P1/P2) axis and the (fi /P2) axis.</p>
    <p num="168">First, in view of the foregoing items (1) and (2), the optimum second intermediate frequency F1 must be lower than 3.4 GHz and greater than at least 680 MHz which is the maximum value of the radio frequency (RF) signal bandwidth.</p>
    <p num="169">
      Further, in view of item (4), the optimum second intermediate frequency F1 must be considerably low so that it can be shared among sub-bands within C-band.
      <br/>
      For example, in a case where the transmission radio frequency (RF) signal band is the 4G band and where the second optimum intermediate frequency F1 is set to a large value such as 3 GHz, the carrier F2 is allocated to a low value such as 620 MHz to 860 MHz.

      The optimum second intermediate frequency F1 is not limited to 800 MHz but can be set to an arbitrary value within the foregoing range.

      Hence, (F1/F2) also assumes a range which is substantially the same as that of the second intermediate frequency.

    <p num="172">At this time, the third intermediate frequency F2 assumes a value within a range in the vicinity of C-band �e.g., a range (2.6 GHz to 7.5 GHz) lower than C-band by 800 MHz�, and hence (F1/F2) assumes a value within a range from 800/7500 to 800/2600 (=0.11 to 0.31).</p>
    <p num="173">In consideration of item (3), attention is paid to the order of the harmonic within a range of m=-6-+6 and n=-6 to +6.</p>
