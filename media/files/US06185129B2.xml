      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a power reset circuit of a flash memory device.
      <br/>
      In particular, the present invention relates to a power reset circuit of a flash memory device which can feed back the output of the power reset circuit to remove a standby current, thus improving the integration degree of a device.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Upon an initial operation of the flash memory device, respective components of the device has to maintain an initial set value so that they can perform a normal operation.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the operation of the flash memory device, it is important to initiate (or reset) the device.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The power reset circuit performs the finction of initializing the device.
      <br/>
      Generally, the standby current of the flash memory device is limited within about 5  MU A. Therefore, upon power-up, after the devices are initialized, the power reset circuit does not have to consume any current.
    </p>
    <p num="6">A conventional power reset circuit will be explained by reference to FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="7">FIG. 1 is a circuit diagram for illustrating a conventional power reset circuit.</p>
    <p num="8">A delay section 11 for delaying the increase of the supply voltage is connected between the supply terminal Vcc and the first node K1, and a fourteenth NMOS transistor N14 the gate of which is connected to the first node K1 is connected between the first node K1 and tie supply terminal Vcc.</p>
    <p num="9">
      In the delay section 11, a plurality of PMOS transistors P101 to P112 the gates of which are connected to the ground terminal Vss, respectively, are serially connected between the supply terminal Vcc and the second node K2, and a plurality of PMOS transistors P113 to P132 the gates of which are connected to the ground terminal Vss, respectively, are serially connected between the second node K2 and the third node K3.
      <br/>

    <p num="13">The operation of the power reset circuit constructed as above may be explained by dividing three steps as the supply voltage thereof increases from 0V to Vcc slowly.</p>
    <p num="14">First, the initial state in which the supply voltage is applied will be explained.</p>
    <p num="15">
      At initial state, the voltage level of the fourth node K4 being an input terminal of the first inverter I1 is maintained at low level.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the first PMOS transistor P1 is turned on and the supply voltage is applied to the fifth node K5 via the second and third PMOS transistors P2 and P3.
      <br/>
      At this time, as a low voltage level of the initial state is applied to the gates of the first to fifth NMOS transistors N1 to N5, the first to fifth NMOS transistors N1 to N5 are kept turned off.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the fourth PMOS transistor P4 will be turned on by the voltage level of the fourth node K4 being an input terminal of the second inverter I2, and thereby the supply voltage is applied to the sixth node K6 via the fifth PMOS transistor P5.
      <br/>
      Then, as the voltage level of the sixth node K6 is higher than that of the fifth node K5, the seventh to ninth NMOS transistors N7 to N9 are kept turned off Also, as the voltage level of the supply voltage is at low level, the sixth node K6 is kept at a low level.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a low level of voltage is outputted via the output terminal PURST.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Second, the case that the supply voltage is maintained more than a constant level will be explained.</p>
    <p num="17">
      In this case, as the supply voltage is not so higher enough to turn on the NMOS transistor, a constant increased supply voltage is applied to the fifth node K5, Also, a constant increased supply voltage is applied to the sixth node K6.
      <br/>
      However, as the voltage level of the sixth node K6 is higher than that of the fifth node K5, a high level of voltage is outputted by the second bootstrap circuit 29 via the output terminal PURST and the initial operation for the device is accomplished.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Third, the state in which the supply voltage is completely increased will be explained.</p>
    <p num="19">
      After the supply voltage becomes a constant level to accomplish the initial operation, when a high level of voltage is outputted via the first node K1 being the output terminal of the delay section 11, the first and fourth PMOS transistors P1+character pullout} P4 will be turned off and the tenth to thirteenth AMOS transistors N10 to N13 will be turned on, thus making the sixth node K6 a low level.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the operation of the first and second inverters I1 and I2 will stop and a low level of voltage will be outputted via tle output terminal PURST, thus stopping the initial operation.

    <p num="20">
      The fourteenth and fifteenth NMOS transistors N14 and N15 are consisted of transistors having a low threshold voltage, i. e, about 0.3V than a different transistor.
      <br/>
      In this case, if the supply voltage is lowered to 0V, it functions to lower the voltage level of the fourth node K4 to 0V.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      However, in the conventional power reset circuit, as the delay section 11 for delaying the increase of the supply voltage upon power-up is consisted of a plurality of PMOS transistors P101 to P132 and a capacitor C1, the area in which the power reset circuit occupies in the flash memory device is large.
      <br/>
      Also, if the power-up time is too long, the delay section 11 does not operate corresponding to the long power-up time.

      The output of the voltage detector 23 is feedbacked to the eighth node K28 via the second delay means (feedback means 28).

      The third delay means 25 is connected between the eighth node K28 and the sixth node K26.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In the third delay means 25, the fourth inverter I4 is connected between the eighth node K28 and the ninth node K29, which inverts the voltage level of the fourth node K24 that is delayed in a given time by the ninth to the twelfth inverters I9 to I12.
      <br/>
      Also, a capacitor C21 consisted of NMOS transistors is connected between the ninth node K29 and the ground terminal Vss.
      <br/>
      The fifth inverter I5 is connected between the ninth node K29 and the sixth node K26, and the second capacitor C22 is connected between the sixth node K26 and the ground terminal Vss.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Also, a second bootstrap circuit 29 is connected between the eighth node K28 and the fourteenth node K34, and a twelfth and twenty first inverters I20 and I21 are connected between the fourteenth node K34 and the tenth node K30.</p>
    <p num="38">
      In the power reset circuit constructed as above, upon a power-up, the tenth node K30 is raised to a high level by the first bootstrap circuit 21, and the latch means 300 latches the voltage level of the tenth node K30.
      <br/>
      The voltage detector operates depending on the output of the latch means 200, that is it outputs a high level or a low level signal depending on the supply voltage.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, upon a power-up, the voltage level of the fourteenth node is made to a high level by the second bootstrap circuit 29, and the third delay means 25 delays and outputs the voltage level of the fourteenth node K34.
      <br/>
      The transfer means 300 operates depending on the output of the third delay means 25, and the voltage detector 23 transfers it to the output terminal.
      <br/>
      Also, the output of the voltage detector 23 is feedbacked to the tenth node K30 and the fourteenth node K34 by the second delay means (feedback means 28).
    </p>
    <p num="39">The operation of which will be explained below.</p>
    <p num="40">
      Upon a power-up when the supply voltage is applied, the tenth node K30 is made a high level by the bootstrap operation of the first bootstrap circuit 21.
      <br/>
      The voltage level of the tenth node K30 is made a low level via the thirteenth to fifteenth inverters I13 to I15 being the fist inverter 26 and is then inputted to the second inverter 22.
      <br/>
      As the voltage level of the first inverter 26 is inverted via the second inverter 22 and is made a low level via the sixteenth inverter I16 being the third inverter, the voltage level of the first node K21 becomes a low level.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In the second inverter 22, the voltage of the eleventh node K31 is inverted via the sixth inverter I6 to turn off the fourth PMOS transistor P24, while tuning on the sixth NMOS transistor N26.
      <br/>
      This is outputted as a high level via an inverting latch consisted of a pair of inverters I7 and I8.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      If the first node K21 becomes a low level, the voltage detector 23 will operate.
      <br/>
      The voltage detector 23 is constructed so that it outputs a high voltage if it is less than a given voltage but outputs a low voltage if it is more than a given voltage.
      <br/>
      As the first node K21 is at low level, the first PMOS transistor P21 is turned on so that it can apply a supply voltage the voltage level of which is raised more than a given level.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the second node K22 becomes a high level.
      <br/>
      However, as the voltage level of the second node K22 is not so high enough to turn on the NMOS transistor, the first, second, third and fifth NMOS transistors N21, N22, N23 and N25 the gates of which are connected to the second node K22 will be kept turned off.
      <br/>
      Also, the second and the third NMOS transistors N22 and N23 will be kept turned off.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, as the voltage level of the third node K23 is kept at low level, the second and third PMOS transistors P22 and P23 will be turned on and the fourth node K24 being the output terminal of the voltage detector 23 will be kept at high level.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Meanwhile, upon a power-up, the fourteenth node K34 becomes a high level by the bootstrap operation of the second bootstrap circuit 29.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the eighth node K28 will have a high level and the third delay means 25 will delay and output the voltage level of the eighth node K28.
      <br/>
      To explain more particularly, the voltage level of the eighth node K28 causes the voltage level of the ninth node 29 to be low via the fourth inverter I4, but the first capacitor C21 will not be charged.
      <br/>
      The voltage level of the ninth node K29 is again inverted via the fifth inverter I5 to make the sixth node 26 high, and thus while the second capacitor C22 is charged, the output level of the third delay means 25 is delayed by a given time.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The transfer means 300 operates depending on the output of the third delay means 25.
      <br/>
      As the sixth node K26 is at high level, the output voltage of the first delay means 27 is passed via the transfer transistor T1 to make the seventh node K27 high.
      <br/>
      This is latched into a low level by the latches I2 and I3 and is inverted via the nineteenth inverter I19 being the fifth inverter to become a high level, thus it is passed to the output terminal VOUT.
      <br/>
      When the output terminal VOUT becomes a high level, the elements within the flash memory are reset (initialized).
      <br/>
      Also, the output of the voltage detector 23 is feedbacked to the fourteenth node K34 via the second delay means (feedback means 28).
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      If the supply voltage becomes a given level, the second node K22 of the voltage detector 23 becomes a high voltage, which is a high voltage enough to turn on the first, second, third and fifth NMOS transistors N21, N22, N23 and N25.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a current is passed from the supply terminal Vcc to the ground terminal Vss, which causes the fourth node K24 being the output terminal of the voltage detector 23 to be a low voltage.
      <br/>
      The output voltage of the voltage detector 23 is feedbacked to the fourteenth node K34 via the second delay means (feedback means 28) and is simultaneously passed to the transfer means 300.
      <br/>
      By the feedback operation of the second delay means 28, as the eighth node K28 has a low voltage, the sixth node K26 being the output node of the third delay means 25 will become a low voltage, and the transfer transistor T1 will not operate.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a low voltage is outputted to the output terminal VOUT to complete the initialization of tle device.
      <br/>
      The third delay means 25 is designed to have enough a latch time so that it can sufficiently delay the output value of the first delay means 27 in the third inverter 24.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Meanwhile, as the eighth node K28 is maintained at a low voltage, the tenth node K30 will become a low voltage.
      <br/>
      The voltage level of the tenth node K30 is latched and inverted via the latch means 200 and is then passed to the first node K21 At this time, the voltage level of the first node K21 becomes a high state.
      <br/>
      The first node K21 is the input terminal of the voltage detector 23 which it will not stop its operation as it reach a high voltage state.
      <br/>
      All the current within the voltage detector 23 is passed to the ground terminal Vss and thus any driving current will not flow on
    </p>
    <p num="47">FIGS. 3 and 4 are graphs for illustrating the output voltages of each of the nodes depending on the power-up time of the power reset circuit according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="48">
      FIG. 3 shows the case where the power-up time is 10 ms, and FIG. 4 shows the case where the power-up time is 100 ms.
      <br/>
      As can be seen from the graph, with the use of the power reset circuit, the output voltage can be maintained for a given time period even when the power-up time is long enough.
      <br/>
      Thus, the initialization of the device can be stabled performed even when the power-up time is long enough.
    </p>
    <p num="49">As described above, according to the present invention, it can provide the advantages that it can remove the standby current by feedbacking the output value of the power reset circuit, and also can reduce the layout area of the power reset circuit, thus improving the integration degree of the device</p>
