      A model train locomotive has a set of drive wheels and a power system for rotating the drive wheels.
      <br/>
      The power system comprises an electric motor mounted for rotating a power input shaft, a control mechanism for regulating the amount of electric current supply to the motor for varying the rotational speed of the power input shaft, and power transmission assembly for transmitting power from the power input shaft to rotate a driven output shaft which is coupled to rotate the locomotive drive wheels.
      <br/>
      The power transmission assembly includes a flywheel and gear train for rotating the flywheel about an axis of rotation when the electric motor is rotating the power input shaft while the driven output shaft is not rotating.
      <br/>
      The gear train is effective to rotate the driven output shaft while the flywheel is rotating without stalling the electric motor when the control mechanism increases the amount of electric current supplied to the motor to increase the rotational speed of the power input shaft and rotate the locomotive drive wheels.

      <br/>
      No. 09/329,673 filed Jun. 10, 1999.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates generally to a power transmission system for rotating a driven shaft coupled to a work performing assembly.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the invention relates to a power transmission system for driving a working assembly from start-up through various slow speeds, and at top speed without stalling the drive motor.
      <br/>
      And a specific embodiment of the invention is directed to a power transmission system for a scale model train locomotive.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Model railroad locomotives exist in various sizes.
      <br/>
      Serious model railroaders operate these locomotives in all scales from the smallest N gauge to the largest G gauge.
      <br/>
      A locomotive may have a length greater than one foot and a weight of several pounds in the larger scales.
      <br/>
      And larger models are often used in a sight-seeing park such as a zoo.
      <br/>
      Currently, the desire to have these model locomotives operate in the same fashion as full size locomotives is thwarted because of drive motor size limitations with respect to the various available model locomotives.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Of particular importance is the manner in which these locomotives operate from a standstill to acquire an equivalent scale operation of a full-size train.
      <br/>
      The model railroader is always looking for a more realistic looking operation of the model locomotive.
      <br/>
      But because of space limitations, the motors used to drive existing model locomotives, usually called "can" motors because they look like a small can, are very small and weak.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The known electric drive motors range from about 1/2 inch to about 11/2 inches in diameter with a length from about 1 inch to about 13/4 inches.
      <br/>
      These small direct current (DC) electric motors have a power range from about 0.002 to about 0.009 horsepower with a rotational speed range for the rotatable power shaft of the motor in the range of about 7,000 to about 16,000 revolutions per minute (rpm).
      <br/>
      The locomotive motor power shaft is connected to a drive shaft that rotates a worm and worm gearset connected to rotate the locomotive drive wheels also known as drivers.
      <br/>
      The normal installation uses a 31:1 worm and worm gear ratio to produce one revolution of the drivers for 31 revolutions of the drive shaft to provide sufficient power once the motor is running.
      <br/>
      The problem with these existing locomotives, however, is that slow realistic starts and very low speed control are difficult to achieve without stalling the drive motor.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Attempts have been made to effect the noted desired results by using pulsating current to operate the electric motors and/or by using technological advances such as skewed armatures in the motor construction itself.
      <br/>
      Yet at slow operating speeds, the armature of the electric motor turns very slowly and is thus subject to stalling from any unexpected load increase or any slight bind in the locomotive drive mechanism.
      <br/>
      Moreover, operating these motors at very slow speeds under a load for more than short time periods may soon overheat the motor causing possible motor damage.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The known motors used to drive these locomotives require 11/2 to 2 volts to start the motor running for rotating a driven shaft coupled to rotate the locomotive drivers.
      <br/>
      Known locomotive drivers will not rotate on track provided until there is enough power input to the worm and worm gearset to move currently available locomotives along the track.
      <br/>
      Problems often occur when increasing electric power to the DC motor to increase the rotational speed of the motor and drive shaft.
      <br/>
      The model railroad locomotive may give a lunging or uneven thrust movement and its motor may ultimately stall.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is extremely difficult to achieve the desired result of a realistic slow motion start without stalling the locomotive drive motor or without the locomotive producing a lunging or thrusting movement because of a lack of a continuous, adequate power supply to the locomotive drive wheels.
    </p>
    <p num="8">The mechanism of the present invention used to drive scale model locomotives would be modified in each of the other potential uses for the physical and mechanical characteristics of the particular item.</p>
    <p num="9">
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,234,164 and 4,721,083 show different systems for producing a stall preventative feature in the power transmission train for a motor.
      <br/>
      Neither of these prior art systems are operable to achieve the results achieved in the power transmission system of the current invention.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,121 shows a planetary gear mechanism used in conjunction with a flywheel for producing inertia moment of the flywheel during idling.
      <br/>
      This configuration, however, is not equivalent to the structure of the power transmission system disclosed herein.
    </p>
    <heading>PURPOSE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">The primary object of the present invention is to provide a power transmission system for a model train locomotive to enable its motor to start and continue running while the locomotive itself is not moving.</p>
    <p num="12">Another object of the invention is to incorporate a power transmission system between the existing motor and the worm gearset of a standard model railroad locomotive to eliminate the long standing problems of start-up motor stall and lunging movement during a slow, variable speed operation under load.</p>
    <p num="13">
      A further object of the invention is to provide a power transmission system usable in other settings such as in the common 3/8ths inch variable speed electric drill that has a normal rotational output of 1,500 rpm for the tool-holding mechanism and a cooling fan.
      <br/>
      By using the power transmission system between the electric drive motor of the drill and the driven shaft that rotates the tool holding mechanism, a more powerful and consistent rotating capability is achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Still another object of the invention is to provide a power transmission system that is adaptable for driving units having much greater loads and larger drive motors including hydraulic motors, internal combustion engines, and larger battery driven motors used in land vehicles such as golf carts, motorcycles, and automobiles, for example.</p>
    <p num="15">A further object is to provide a power transmission combination in an apparatus that performs a desired operational function in response to a rotating drive shaft member wherein a motor power input shaft drives the drive shaft member of the apparatus.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      The power transmission combination of the invention may be placed in any apparatus that performs a desired operational function in response to a rotating drive shaft member wherein motor means includes a rotatable power input shaft means for rotating the drive shaft member and motor control means regulates the rotational speed of the power input shaft means.
      <br/>
      The combination comprises driven output shaft means coupled to rotate the drive shaft member and flywheel means mounted to rotate on shaft means about a flywheel axis of rotation.
      <br/>
      Gear train means is connected to rotate with the power input shaft means for effecting rotation of the flywheel means about the flywheel axes of rotation for rotating the driven output shaft means when the motor means rotates the power input shaft means.
      <br/>
      The gear train means is effective to rotate the flywheel means when a load is applied to the driven output shaft means so that the motor means continues to operate smoothly without being adversely affected when the motor control means increases the rotational speed of the power input shaft means for rotating the driven output shaft means through the gear train means under an increased applied load.
    </p>
    <p num="17">

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="31">
      FIG. 3 shows the current state of the art with respect to a model train drive system into which the invention is disposed.
      <br/>
      Worm gears 40 and 42 mesh with spur gears 41 and 43, respectively, to form a worm and worm gearset that rotates the locomotive drivers with motor 12'. Power transmission unit 10' disposed between motor 12' and first worm gear 40 shows how the power transmission assembly 10 of FIG. 1 is used according to the invention.
      <br/>
      No such transmission currently exists in the standard model train locomotive driven by DC electric motor 12' that is normally connected to drive shaft 17 as shown.
      <br/>
      Drive shaft 17 rotates worm gears 40 and 42 and corresponding worm engaging spur gears 41 and 43 in the standard manner.
      <br/>
      The size of motor 12' will vary depending upon the size and weight of the locomotive.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The drivers shown in FIG. 3 are standard equipment for a Bowser, HO Challenger Kit No. 100300 produced by Bowser Manufacturing Co. of Montoursville, Pa.
      <br/>
      While the power transmission system 10' is diagrammatically shown in line with motor 12' and worm and worm gear set 40, 41, the power transmission system 10 and motor 12 of FIG. 1 may both be placed in a single housing or the flywheel and gear train assembly made an integral part of the motor housing itself.
      <br/>
      It is also contemplated that the motor and power transmission system assembly be disposed in the model tender coupled to the rear of the locomotive.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, motor 12 rotates power shaft 11 coupled to input drive shaft 15 through universal coupling joint 14.
      <br/>
      Drive shaft 15 passes through flange bearing 30, split flywheel, generally designated 20, and extends into the inner end of coaxially disposed driven output shaft 13.
      <br/>
      Shaft 15 terminates at a point about half-way along the length of flange bearing 32 as shown.
      <br/>
      Sun gear 26 is affixed to the outside end surface of the inner end section of driven output shaft 13.
      <br/>
      The inner end shaft 13 includes an inside end bearing surface that frictionally rotatably supports the outer surface bearing section of drive shaft 15.
      <br/>
      In other words, the bearing end section of drive shaft 15 fits rotatably and slidably fixed into the end section of driven output shaft 13 as shown.
      <br/>
      Flywheel assembly 20 has two sections 20a and 20b interconnected by counter-balance portion 20c all of which are rotatably mounted on shaft 15 and thus rotate about a first flywheel axis of rotation corresponding to the longitudinal axis of shaft 15.
      <br/>
      A first sun gear member 22 is affixed to an intermediate portion of shaft 15 to rotate with shaft 15 about the first axis of rotation separate from rotating flywheel assembly 20.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      A first input sun gear 22 has 20 gear drive teeth that mesh with driven teeth of the input planetary gear member 23 also having 20 teeth.
      <br/>
      Sun gear 22 and planetary gear 23 are of the same size therefore rotate with respective drive shafts 15 and 25 at the same rotational speed with respect to each other.
      <br/>
      Planetary gears 23 and 24 are each fixed to the second drive shaft 25 that extends into and through flywheel sections 20a and 20b as shown.
      <br/>
      As shown, planetary gear 24 is larger than planetary gear 23 and therefore necessarily has more teeth.
      <br/>
      Sun gear 26 is smaller than sun gear 22 and planetary gear 24 and therefore necessarily has fewer teeth than either of these gears.
      <br/>
      Counter-balance portion 20c balances the weight of flywheel assembly 20 to correspond with the weight of second drive shaft 25 and planetary gears 23 and 24.
      <br/>
      Driven output shaft 13 is coupled to shaft 17 through universal joint 16.
      <br/>
      When driven shaft 17 is rotated, the worm gears 40 and 42 (FIG. 3) rotate while engaged with worm-engaging spur gears 41 and 43, respectively, to rotate the locomotive's drive shaft member and thus drive it along a track.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Drive shaft support assembly, generally designated 18, includes an intermediate support section 18c with a drive shaft support 18a disposed at a first end thereof and a driven shaft support 18b disposed at the other end of intermediate section 18c.
      <br/>
      Drive shaft support section 18a mounts first drive shaft 15 in the flange bearing 30 and driven shaft support 18b mounts the driven output shaft 13 to rotate within flange bearing 32.
      <br/>
      Drive shaft support 18a, driven shaft support 18b, and intermediate support section 18c together form a U-shaped structural configuration of the support assembly 18 when the configuration is viewed in an elevational direction transverse to the first axis of rotation as shown in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      As shown, flywheel assembly 20 includes two sections 20a and 20b that are laterally spaced with respect to each other with second drive shaft 25 extending between and rotatably mounted in these flywheel sections.
      <br/>
      First planetary gear member 23 is disposed between first and second flywheel sections 20a and 20b and second planetary gear member 24 is disposed on a side of section 20b opposite the side where first flywheel section 20a is disposed.
      <br/>
      Counterbalance weight 20c is fixed between flywheel section 20a and 20b and circumferentially disposed at a location to balance the combined weight of second drive shaft 25 and first and second planetary gear members 23 and 24 carried on drive shaft 25.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In operation, when motor 12 starts to rotate power shaft 11 and first drive shaft 15, with only slightly more current to motor 12 than its no-load start-up requirement, the power of motor 12 will take the path of least resistance.
      <br/>
      Flywheel assembly 20 will therefore start rotating clockwise on shaft 15 so that planetary gear 24 moves around sun gear 26 as first sun gear 22 rotates with drive shaft 15.
      <br/>
      If flywheel assembly 20 were to remain stationary and second sun gear 26 were not engaged with the planetary gear 24, sun gear 22 and planetary gears 23 and 24 would all rotate at the same rotational speed because sun gear 22 and planetary gear 23 are the same size and thus have the same number of teeth.
    </p>
    <p num="38">With the larger planetary gear 24 engaged with the smaller driven sun gear 26, however, planetary gear 24 will rotate around sun gear 26 so that even at very slow start-up speeds, any resistance that flywheel assembly 20 has to rotating will be transmitted as an equal torque to also rotate sun gear 26 in the same clockwise direction.</p>
    <p num="39">
      Under standard conditions, worm gears 40 and 42 as shown in FIG. 3 have a ratio of 31 revolutions to 1 revolution of spur gears 41 and 42 that drive the locomotive drive wheels.
      <br/>
      The small resistance created by the rotating flywheel assembly 20 is not only strong enough to move the locomotive but strong enough to spin the drivers if the locomotive is manually held and not allowed to move.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In this embodiment, flywheel assembly 20 is about 3/4 of an inch in diameter and each flywheel segment 20a and 20b is about 1/4 of an inch thick.
      <br/>
      Flywheel assembly 20 is made of steel and weighs about two ounces.
      <br/>
      Power transmission system 10 including the flywheel sections 20a and 20b and its gear train arrangement enables the small motor 12 to rotate flywheel assembly 20 without stalling the motor and as power and rotational speed of motor 12 is increased as discussed.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the locomotive will begin a very slow smooth start without stalling the motor or without producing any kind of jerking thrust movement.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      As the rotational speed of flywheel assembly 20 increases, the amount of torque is transferred to rotate output shaft 13, and drive shaft member 17 by way of coupling 16.
      <br/>
      Motor 12 in combination with power transmission system 10 will never stall regardless of the amount of load imposed through the locomotive because flywheel assembly 20 will simply continue to rotate and create the torque required to move such a load.
      <br/>
      That is, the train of gears 22, 23, 24, and 26 will drivingly rotate flywheel assembly 20 to transmit torque effective to rotate the driven output shaft means 13, 16, and 17 and to preclude an adverse effect on the operation of motor 12.
      <br/>
      In short, any additional load placed on driven output shaft 13 will be diverted from having any effect on motor 12 because of the planetary and sun gear arrangement that operates flywheel assembly 20.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      In any given specific embodiment of the invention, the total power output from the transmission can be altered by either decreasing or increasing the size, weight and speed of flywheel assembly 20.
      <br/>
      And the size, weight and speed of flywheel assembly 20 determines the amount of torque that the transmission delivers to rotate output shaft means 13, 16, and 17.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      In summary, motor 12 will start to rotate with only slightly more current than the motor's no-load start-up requirement.
      <br/>
      Once motor 12 is running, it will not stall regardless of the amount of load on driven shaft 13 as noted.
      <br/>
      And even if output shaft 17 could be secured so that it is not rotating, flywheel assembly 20 will continue to rotate planetary gear 24 around sun gear 26 thereby precluding the potential stalling of motor 12.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the model locomotive is running alone or pulling a 50 car train, motor 12 will never stall while the power transmission system of the invention supplies a very slow speed control capability.
      <br/>
      As the speed of motor 12 is increased, the rotational speed of flywheel assembly 20 increases thereby creating more torque, which is delivered to the locomotive drivers through planetary gear 24 that rotates driven sun gear 26.
      <br/>
      The locomotive will have a very steady and smooth acceleration and when the throttle is fully opened, the locomotive will accelerate at about the same speed as the current state of the art.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Another advantage of the invention is that the power transmission system of the invention will automatically adjust to any load increase without changing the throttle setting.
      <br/>
      The rotational speed of flywheel assembly 20 will increase transmitting more torque to the locomotive and will automatically adjust to any gear reduction required to do the job with the available power.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In another embodiment of the invention, the power transmission system 37 schematically shown in FIG. 4 is installed between a variable speed electric motor and the spur gear reduction train that drives a tool holding assembly of a common 3/8 inch variable speed electric drill.
      <br/>
      The same results achieved with the model locomotive drive are gained when used in the variable electric drill.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The drill includes a variable switch mechanism 35 and a variable speed motor 36.
      <br/>
      A power transmission system 37 of the invention includes a combination of a flywheel and a sun gear/planetary gear train as in the earlier embodiment.
      <br/>
      The electric motor has a fan to cool the motor and is the first component attached to the drive shaft that ultimately drives the tool-holding assembly.
      <br/>
      The driven shaft of the drill goes into a spur gear reduction train to arrive at a normal 1,500 rpm output.
      <br/>
      Power transmission 37 is attached between the cooling fan and the spur gear reduction train 38, which is part of the driven tool-holding assembly 39.
      <br/>
      Upon increasing the amount of rotational speed using the variable switch mechanism 35 for driving the variable speed motor 36, the flywheel assembly of the power transmission 37 will increase in rotational speed but transmit a more powerful reduction to the shaft that drives the tool-holding assembly in the precise manner as described with respect to the first embodiment of FIGS. 1-3.

    <p num="47">
      The embodiment of FIG. 5 shows a transmission system mounted directly on motor power input shaft 51 without a separate external bearing structure as used in the earlier embodiments.

      The power transmission combination includes a flywheel assembly, generally designated 50, having three flywheel sections 52, 54, and 56 rotatably mounted to motor power input shaft 51 and output driven shaft 57.
      <br/>
      A gear train includes a first sun gear 62, first planetary gear 63, second planetary gear 64, and second sun gear 66 that press fit to each respective shaft on which it is mounted.
      <br/>
      Machine screw 59 extends through counter-balance weights 53 and 53a, flywheel sections 54 and 56, and threadingly engages a threaded hole in flywheel section 52, as shown, to secure these parts together to form flywheel assembly 50.
      <br/>
      Bolts 61b fixedly mount spacers 61, 61a, 65, and 65a in place with flywheel sections 52, 54, and 56, as shown.

      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the flywheel axis of rotation is coextensive with the axis of rotation of input shaft 51.
      <br/>
      Planetary driven gear 63 necessarily rotates in unison with sun gear 62 because of the equal number of teeth that mesh in gears 62 and 63.

      In the earlier embodiment shown in FIG. 3 the apparatus is a model locomotive having an operational function of traveling along a track.

      <br/>
      Flywheel sections 52, 54, and 56 freely rotate with respect to motor output shaft 51 and system output shaft 57 so that regardless of the load on output shaft 57, motor 60 will continue to smoothly rotate flywheel assembly 50.

      And with only slightly more current to motor 60 than required for a no-load start-up, the rotational power from motor 60 will take the path of least resistance.
      <br/>
      The gear train will therefore rotate flywheel assembly 50 about shafts 51 and 57 to carry planetary gear 64 around first sun gear 62 that rotates with power input shaft 51.
      <br/>
      If flywheel assembly 50 were to remain stationary and second sun gear 66 were not engaged with planetary gear 64, planetary gears 63 and 64 would rotate with shaft 55 about the planetary axis of rotation at the same rotational speed as the rotational speed of first sun gear 62.
      <br/>
      With planetary gear 64 engaged with driven sun gear 66, however, planetary drive gear 64 will rotate around sun gear 66 so that even at very slow start-up speeds, any resistance from flywheel assembly 50 will be transmitted as an equal torque to also rotate sun gear 66 in a gear reduction mode.
      <br/>
      If planetary gears 63 and 64 and shaft 55 rotate fifty revolutions about the planetary axis of rotation that means that power input shaft 51 is rotating 50 revolutions.
      <br/>
      At the same time, however, the flywheel assembly 50 remains free to rotate about shafts 51 and 57 depending on the load applied to driven output shaft 57.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      As in the earlier embodiments, planetary gears 63 and 64 rotate about the planetary axis of rotation of shaft 55 in a counter-clockwise direction when meshed with sun gear 62 that rotates clockwise with power input shaft 51.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the flywheel assembly 50 is free to rotate, about shafts 51 and 57 carrying with it the drive shaft 55 and planetary gears 63 and 64.
      <br/>
      Flywheel assembly 50 will rotate in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction depending upon the relative sizes of each gear in the flywheel gear train and the load applied to output shaft 57.
      <br/>
      A most important function of flywheel assembly 50 is that it is free to rotate regardless of the load applied to driven output shaft 57 thereby protecting the drive motor 60 from any adverse effect that might be otherwise caused by such a load if power input shaft 51 were directly connected to the apparatus performing the desired operational function as currently exists in the prior art.
      <br/>
      The new and unexpected results attained in using the flywheel assembly of the invention in driving model train locomotives is particularly significant in the modeling industry.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The rotational speed of flywheel assembly 50 about shafts 51 and 57 will vary as the load on output shaft 57 changes.
      <br/>
      In the earlier embodiment where the second planetary gear 24 is larger and thus has more teeth than driven output sun gear 26, flywheel assembly 50 generally rotates clockwise with shafts 15 and 13.
      <br/>
      In the embodiments of FIGS. 5-9, however, planetary gear 64 is smaller and has fewer teeth than sun gear 66.
      <br/>
      Thus, when a load is applied, planetary gear 64 begins to walk in a counter-clockwise direction about driven output shaft 57 thus carrying flywheel assembly 50 in a counter-clockwise direction.
      <br/>
      In short, regardless of the load being applied to output shaft 57, motor 60 is unaffected because it simply continues to rotate flywheel assembly 50 and carry planetary gears 63 and 64 along with it.
      <br/>
      Under these circumstances, the greater the load on output shaft 57, the faster flywheel assembly 50 rotates in a counter-clockwise rotation about shafts 51 and 57.
      <br/>
      Therefore, as the rotational drive power of motor 60 increases, the flywheel assembly of the invention precludes any stalling effect on motor 60 or lunging of the locomotive regardless of the load being applied.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      With this embodiment, flywheel assembly 50 can rotate counterclockwise about shafts 51 and 57 at the same rotational speed that gears 62, 63, and 64 are rotating with shafts 51 and 55.
      <br/>
      If that happens, it takes more rotational energy from motor 60 to keep the flywheel rotating counter-clockwise so that the torque created is equal to the torque required to rotate output shaft 57 clockwise.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The effect of the freely rotating flywheel assembly in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation around the power shaft of motors 12, 12', 60, or 70 of the various embodiments described herein produces a smooth increase and decrease of movement for the locomotives of the invention or any other vehicle or apparatus in which the novel power transmission assembly is coupled between a motor or prime mover and the drive shaft member of an apparatus that performs a desired operational function.
      <br/>
      Motors 12, 12', and 73 represent commercially available can motors commonly used to drive model locomotives.
      <br/>
      Motors 60 and 70 may also represent such can motors but also might be any motor used to drive any apparatus to perform a desired operational function.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      In the specific embodiments of FIGS. 1-7, a novel unit of the invention includes a motor and flywheel transmission assembly as a complete unit factory installed in a model locomotive.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 3 and 5, the combination of a motor and flywheel assembly might be used to retrofit an existing locomotive after removing its original equipment motor.
      <br/>
      The embodiment of FIG. 8, moreover, discloses a flywheel power transmission assembly 50 that can be retrofit to power shaft 71 of motor 70.
      <br/>
      The flywheel assembly shafts 72 and 77 have a diameter larger than the common 1/8 or 3/32 inch diameters used for motor power shaft 71.
      <br/>
      The modeler simply needs to bore a hole in assembly shaft 72 with a diameter that will receive the end of shaft 71, place an adhesive on shaft 71, and then insert it into the drilled bore of shaft. 72, as shown.
      <br/>
      In some instances, the bore hole of this embodiment may be bored by the manufacturer to eliminate the first step of the foregoing installation process.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      In the embodiments used for the power transmission system in a model locomotive, flywheel sections 52 and 56 are 0.100 inch thick, section 54 is 0.225 inch thick and all three flywheel sections are made of cold-rolled steel.
      <br/>
      Gears 62, 63, 64 and 66 have a thickness of less than 0.100 inch.
      <br/>
      The overall diameter of the flywheel assembly may be less than 0.750 inch but the size of each portion of the flywheel assembly of the invention will depend on its particular application.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when used on vehicles that transport people or equipment used in manufacturing parts or otherwise processing production materials, the relative overall size of the flywheel assembly will be much larger with its separate parts being made larger accordingly.
      <br/>
      For example, if so desired, a flywheel assembly of the invention may be adapted for use in driving full size locomotives or in any other situation where a prime mover is rotating an output shaft for driving a load associated with performing a desired operational function.

    <p num="57">
      The embodiment of FIG. 9 shows a model locomotive drive system 75 having flywheel assemblies 74 and 76 fitted to both ends of can motor 73 to rotate worm gears 81 and 82.
      <br/>
      This embodiment is particularly adaptable to the known Athearn H24-26 TRAINMASTER model diesel locomotive.
      <br/>
      The locomotive may be manufactured with this drive system at the factory or retrofit to those already owned by a modeler since it requires no more room for installation than the original drive motor and its two attached flywheels.
      <br/>
      The invention contemplates the production of complete retrofit kits that includes an appropriately sized can motor, motor mount fixtures, and flywheel power transmission(s) of the invention, with appropriately sized input drive and output driven shafts.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The gear train as shown in the various embodiments includes gear members having teeth that are directly engaged so that clockwise rotation of sun gear 62, for example, will produce a counter-clockwise rotation of planetary gears 63 and 64 about the planetary axis of rotation, and clockwise rotation of output sun gear 66 about its axis of rotation.
      <br/>
      It is contemplated that a gear train having an endless closed belt or chain mounted to rotate each sun gear and planetary gear combinations can be adapted for use in a flywheel assembly of the invention in the same manner as described herein.
      <br/>
      In this instance, however, the use of such an endless belt about each sun gear and planetary gear pair will cause the gears to rotate in the same direction about their respective axes of rotation.
      <br/>
      The principles associated with such a gear train for the power transmission system of this invention, however, will not change the function of the unique flywheel assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Any number of modifications can be made in the relative size of each of the gears or number of teeth involved in rotating the output shaft so long as the flywheel is freely rotatable apart from the power input shaft so that the motor is not adversely affected by any load applied to a driven output shaft.
      <br/>
      Any such modifications to the power transmission system of this invention will be determined by the nature and condition of operation for the particular apparatus to which it is applied.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      In the power transmission assembly of the invention, the flywheel assembly may rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise depending upon the load being applied and the comparative sizes of the gears involved.
      <br/>
      The circumstance may be such that the flywheel does not turn at all.
      <br/>
      However, once a load is applied, it may turn in either direction depending upon the specific forces being handled through the power transmission system.
    </p>
    <p num="61">Where different sized gears are used, a significant gear reduction may be effected so that as the flywheel assembly rotates very rapidly, it will enable the driven output shaft to rotate at a fewer number of revolutions thereby effecting a gear reduction so that much greater loads could be handled than is otherwise now possible with power input shafts being directly linked in a 1:1 rotational relationship to the drive shaft member of an apparatus that performs a desired operational function.</p>
    <p num="62">While the power transmission system has been shown and described in detail, it is obvious that this invention is not to be considered as limited to the exact form disclosed, and that changes in detail and construction may be made therein within the scope of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof.</p>
