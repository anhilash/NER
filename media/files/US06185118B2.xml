      In a driver circuit for driving a half bridge, that has a high-side semiconductor switch and a low-side semiconductor switch that are connected in series between a first and a second supply potential terminal, a drive is allocated to each of the two semiconductor switches that are respectively switched inhibited or transmissive by the respective semiconductor switches according to the direction of a drive signal.
      <br/>
      A load can be connected between the high-side semiconductor switch and the low-side semiconductor switch.
      <br/>
      For an inhibited state of a semiconductor switch, its drive terminal is charged approximately with the potential of the second supply potential terminal in order to attain a negative bias voltage of the drive terminal opposite the source terminal.

      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention is directed to a driver circuit for driving a half bridge formed by a high-side semiconductor switch and a low-side semiconductor switch that are connected in series between a first terminal and a second terminal for a supply potential, with a driver allocated to each semiconductor circuit, the drive switching the respective semiconductor switches to be either transmissive or inhibited by a drive signal, and wherein a load can be connected between the high-side and the low-side semiconductor switch.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Semiconductor switches that are interconnected with a conductor path between a first supply potential terminal, that customarily carries the positive operating voltage, and a load output are characterized as high-side semiconductor switches.
      <br/>
      Low-side semiconductor switches, on the other hand, are interconnected with a conductor path between the load output and a second supply potential terminal.
      <br/>
      The second supply potential terminal then as a rule is a reference potential, e.g. ground potential.
      <br/>
      Each of the two semiconductor switches requires a drive that switches the respective semiconductor circuit transmissive or inhibited.
      <br/>
      When connecting a semiconductor circuit to form a half bridge, only one of the two semiconductor switches may be transmissive or inhibited at a given time.
      <br/>
      The drives respectively allocated to the high-side and the low-side semiconductor switches are consequently coupled together as a rule in order to accommodate this requirement.
      <br/>
      MOSFETs can be used, for example, as the semiconductor switches.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A drive for a high-side semiconductor switch is shown in FIG. 1, on the basis of which the basic manner of functioning will be explained.
      <br/>

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      An object of the present invention is to provide a driver circuit for driving a half-bridge that prevents unintended switching of a semiconductor switch, that is in an inhibiting state, to a transmissive state in accordance with the invention in a driver circuit of the type initially described wherein the drive allocated to a semiconductor switch for an inhibited state loads the control terminal of that semiconductor switch approximately with the potential of the second supply potential terminal.
      <br/>
      This has the result of reducing the magnitude of the Miller capacitance of the semiconductor switch to be inhibited.
      <br/>
      By reducing the Miller capacitance, the cutoff voltage at the inhibiting switch is prevented from being exceeded by the changing of the potential at its source terminal from the operating voltage to the reference potential, and is prevented from conducting a quadrature-axis component.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In an embodiment at least one of the drives allocated to each semiconductor switch has an inhibiting arrangement provided between the control terminal and the second supply potential terminal.
      <br/>
      In an H-bridge circuit, for example, this allows the pulse width modulation signal to be selectively applied to the high-side semiconductor switch or the low-side semiconductor switch.
      <br/>
      The inhibiting arrangement can be, or can include, a controllable semiconductor switch.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In a further embodiment, the inhibiting arrangement also includes a diode connected in series with the load conductive path of the semiconductor switch of the inhibiting arrangement.
      <br/>
      This diode causes the source terminal of the inhibited semiconductor switch always to be at a lower potential than the gate terminal of the semiconductor switch to be inhibited.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In another embodiment, the inhibiting arrangement is connected between the control terminal and the source terminal of the semiconductor switch to be inhibited.
      <br/>
      As a result, the Miller capacitance can be reduced given a high-side semiconductor switch as well as given a low-side semiconductor switch.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In another version of the embodiment, a resistor is connected between the semiconductor switch of the inhibiting arrangement and the second supply potential terminal.
      <br/>
      Usually the reference potential of the drive circuit is not the same as the reference potential in the conductive path.
      <br/>
      This could cause a higher potential opposite the source terminal to occur at the control terminal of the semiconductor switch to be inhibited given fluctuations of the reference potential.
      <br/>
      In this event, the semiconductor switch would be transmissive.
      <br/>
      This problem is reduced by means of the resistor.
      <br/>
      Given undesired ground potential fluctuations, this assures that reliable inhibiting of the high-side semiconductor switch or the low-side semiconductor switch is maintained.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In another version of the embodiment wherein the inhibiting arrangement includes a diode, another semiconductor switch is provided that is interconnected with its conductive path between the first supply potential terminal and the junction of the semiconductor switch to the diode inhibiting arrangement, and the control terminal thereof is connected to the respective drive.
      <br/>
      This other semiconductor switch makes it possible to bring the potential of the source terminal of the semiconductor switch of the inhibiting arrangement to a high reference potential in order to assure that this can change to an inhibited state.
      <br/>
      As a result, a connection of the high-side semiconductor switch or the low-side semiconductor switch is in turn possible.
      <br/>
      The provision of the additional semiconductor switch, moreover, allows faster switching events of the driver arrangement.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In another embodiment of the invention, a semiconductor switch is connected in parallel with the semiconductor switch of the inhibiting arrangement, the gate and source terminals of which are connected to a switch controllable with a drive signal.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a semiconductor switch is also connected in parallel with the diode of the inhibiting arrangement.
      <br/>
      By means of these circuit elements, the pulse width modulated semiconductor switch of the half-bridge can also be operated at very large duty-cycles independent of the frequency without the semiconductor switch of the half-bridge to be inhibited becoming unintentionally inhibited.
      <br/>
      This is achieved by using a very low impedance semiconductor switch as the semiconductor switch connected parallel to the semiconductor switch of the inhibiting arrangement, whereas the semiconductor switch of the inhibiting arrangement is designed as a rule for the requirements of a given slew rate.
      <br/>
      In this manner, a clamping of the gate terminal of the semiconductor switch of the half-bridge becomes possible independent of the slew rate of the semiconductor switch of the inhibiting arrangement.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Preferably, the inhibiting arrangement inhibits the allocated semiconductor switch only just before the other semiconductor switch becomes transmissive.
      <br/>
      This is of particular significance when the high-side and the low-side switches of a half-bridge are operated by pulse width modulation in order to prevent a direct current path between the first and the second supply potential terminals.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In a further embodiment, a first voltage detector is allocated to the low-side semiconductor switch and a second voltage detector is allocated to the high-side semiconductor switch.
      <br/>
      These detectors respectively acquire the voltage at the control terminal of the allocated semiconductor switch and are respectively connected to the drive of the non-allocated semiconductor switch.
      <br/>
      The first voltage detector enables the transmissive switching of the high-side semiconductor switch after the inhibiting of the low-side semiconductor switch of the drive.
      <br/>
      The second voltage detector enables the transmissive switching of the low-side semiconductor switch after the inhibiting of the high-side semiconductor switch of the drive.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The first voltage detector can be a semiconductor switch, the control terminal of which is connected to the control terminal of the low-side semiconductor switch, and the conductive path of which lies between the control terminal of the high-side semiconductor switch and the second supply potential terminal.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the state of the low-side semiconductor switch can be detected by means of a single component.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The second voltage detector can be a first voltage divider, having a center tap connected to a second voltage divider, the center tap of the second voltage divider being connected to and driving the driver allocated to the low-side semiconductor switch.
      <br/>
      As a result, the state of the high-side semiconductor switch is detectable and at the same time a transmissive switching of the low-side semiconductor switch becomes possible for the driver arrangement of the low-side semiconductor switch only when the high-side semiconductor switch is in the inhibited state.

    <p num="28">
      FIG. 3 shows the sequence of the Miller capacitance dependent on the gate-drain voltage UGD of a semiconductor switch, particularly a MOSFET.
      <br/>
      The same dependency results for the gate-source voltage UGS.
      <br/>
      The Miller capacitance is then greatest when the voltage difference between the gate and the drain is "0".
      <br/>
      One operating point that the Miller capacitance assumes given a circuit arrangement according to the Prior Art is referenced AP1.
      <br/>
      If a semiconductor switch is to be inhibited according to the Prior Art, then its gate-source voltage is made approximately zero.
      <br/>
      When the load output from FIG. 1 is, for example, at the supply potential Vbb, then the gate also approximately lies at Vbb.
      <br/>
      If the load output is brought to the reference potential by means of a switching event of the low-side semiconductor switch of the half bridge, then the potential at the gate of the high-side semiconductor switch must also follow the potential of the load output.
      <br/>
      The operating point AP1 would consequently have to migrate further to the right on the characteristic curve shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      This means the Miller capacitance would very rapidly become recharged.
      <br/>
      In practice, however, this recharging event is not rapid enough so that the gate-source voltage of the high-side circuit would not exceed the cut-off voltage.
      <br/>
      This causes the high-side semiconductor switch to become transmissive for a short time.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      When the low-side semiconductor switch of the half-bridge switches between a transmissive state and an inhibited state with very high frequency, then the short-term activation of the semiconductor switch occurs corresponding to the drive frequency.
      <br/>
      The energy converted in the semiconductor switch is so high that the high-side semiconductor switch could be thermally destroyed.
      <br/>
      When the capacitance of an inhibited semiconductor switch lies above the straight line running parallel to the x-axis in FIG. 3, then the danger of a quadrature-axis component exists.
      <br/>
      The smaller the Miller capacitance is, however, given a potential change at the load output, the slighter the danger of a quadrature-axis component becomes.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      According to the invention, the potential difference between the gate and source is not forced to zero.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, the gate of the inhibited semiconductor switch is brought closer to the second supply potential.
      <br/>
      A larger voltage drop across the Miller capacitance thus occurs due to the limited potential at the gate of the semiconductor switch to be inhibited.
      <br/>
      This is characterized in FIG. 3 by the operating point AP2.
      <br/>
      This has the advantage that significantly less time is needed for recharging the Miller capacitance, i.e. the operating point AP2 can migrate to the right much faster along the characteristic curve.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is assured by means of the biasing of the gate relative to the source terminal that the cut-off voltage of the semiconductor switch to be inhibited can not be exceeded.
      <br/>
      Physically, this means that an inversion layer is formed under the gate given a sufficiently large negative gate voltage opposite the source terminal, which shields the gate from the substrate and, in this manner, reduces the effect of the Miller capacitance.
      <br/>
      It is therefore essential to build up a voltage across the Miller capacitance, by bringing the gate of the semiconductor switch to be inhibited to, for example, reference potential.

      The semiconductor switch M1 is usually dimensioned such that it causes no disturbing electromagnetic emission.

      <br/>
      In spite of the inventive clamping of the gate of the semiconductor switch T1, given unfavorable duty cycles of the pulse width modulated low-side semiconductor switch T3, this dimensioning could cause this semiconductor switch T1 to briefly conduct a quadrature-axis component.

      The auxiliary voltage VH can be selected to be smaller than the potential at the second supply potential terminal 2.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The critical switching state at a low-side semiconductor switch occurs upon a rise of the potential at the load output 10 from the reference potential of the second supply potential terminal 2 to the supply voltage Vbb.
      <br/>
      In this case, a brief rise in the gate voltage can occur due to capacitive coupling between the drain and the gate G3 of the low-side semiconductor switch T3 so that the cut-off voltage of the MOSFET T3 might be exceeded.
      <br/>
      The Miller capacitance is therefore reduced by bringing the gate G3 of the low-side semiconductor switch T3 to a negative potential relative to the second supply potential terminal 2 by means of the auxiliary voltage VH.
      <br/>
      In this case, the operating point is in turn below the critical level that runs parallel to the x-axis from FIG. 3.

    <p num="51">The manner in which the driver circuit functions is as follows:</p>
    <p num="52">
      A state is assumed in which a logic "low" is present at the control input IN.
      <br/>
      This has the consequence that the high-side semiconductor switch UH1 is in the transmissive state, while the low-side semiconductor switch UL1 is inhibited.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the operating voltage Vbb exists at the load output U. If the signal at the input IN changes from a logic low" to a logic "high", then the MOSFET M4 is switched transmissive via the two inverters 11, 12.
      <br/>
      The high-side semiconductor switch UH1 begins to inhibit.
      <br/>
      The voltage at the gate GH1 of the MOSFET UH1 is detected by the voltage divider R7, D7.
      <br/>
      The MOSFET M8 is switched transmissive by the voltage divider R8, M7 in order to switch the low-side semiconductor switch UL1 transmissive.
      <br/>
      To enable the transmissive switching of the MOSFET UL1, the MOSFET M7 must be switched off.
      <br/>
      The switching off of the MOSFET M7 only ensues when the voltage at the gate GH1 of the high-side semiconductor switch UH1 has dropped so far that the Miller capacitance of the MOSFET UH1 is already so small so that a quadrature-axis component can no longer be produced by the MOSFET UH1 on the basis of a connection to the low-side semiconductor switch UL1.
      <br/>
      As long as the low-side semiconductor switch UL1 is in the transmissive state, the MOSFET M5 is inhibited via the output of the first inverter 11.
      <br/>
      The MOSFET M6 is in the inhibited state during the transmissive state of the low-side semiconductor switch UL1, i.e. the depletion mode transistor M6 exhibits a positive gate-source voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      When the signal at the control input IN changes back to a logic "low", then the MOSFET M5 is switched transmissive via the inverter 11.
      <br/>
      Also, a negative voltage is briefly generated via C5 at the anode of D5 so that the gate GL1 of the low-side semiconductor switch UL1 is brought to a negative potential in order to make the Miller capacitance C2 of UL1 smaller.
      <br/>
      As soon as a logic "low" exists at the control input IN, the MOSFET M4 switches to the inhibited state.
      <br/>
      The gate of the MOSFET M8 is brought to the supply potential 2 via the voltage dividers R7, D7 and R8, M7.
      <br/>
      Its substrate is at negative potential, so that M8 is brought to the inhibited state.
      <br/>
      A continued flow of charge via the MOSFET M8 that essentially represents a controllable resistor is thereby no longer possible.
      <br/>
      Because the MOSFET M4 is in the inhibited state, however, a continued flow of charge to the gate GH1 of the high-side semiconductor switch UH1 would be possible.
      <br/>
      This is suppressed by the MOSFET M6 as long as the voltage at the gate GL1 of the low-side semiconductor switch UL1 has not reached a value that results in a limited Miller capacitance.
      <br/>
      Only as soon as the Miller capacitance is small enough so that a quadrature-axis component is suppressed by the low-side semiconductor switch UL1 during the switching on of the high-side semiconductor switch UH1, is the semiconductor switch M6 inhibited.
      <br/>
      Only now can the gate GH1 of the high-side semiconductor switch UH1 be biased in order to bring the high-side semiconductor switch UH1 into the transmissive state.

    <p num="54">
      Using the inventive driver circuit, it is thereby possible to prevent quadrature-axis components in half bridges in a simple manner.
      <br/>
      It is insignificant whether only one of the two semiconductor switches is switched transmissive and inhibited by means of a pulse width modulated signal or if, however, both semiconductor switches are switched transmissive and inhibited in a mutual change.
