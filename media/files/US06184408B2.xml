    <heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      It is well known that silicone rubbers formed from the vulcanization of polydiorganosiloxane fluids or gums alone generally have low elongation and tensile strength properties.
      <br/>
      One means for improving the physical properties of such silicone rubbers involves the incorporation of a reinforcing silica filler such as fumed silica, colloidal silica, silica gel, or precipitated silica into the fluid or gum prior to curing.
      <br/>
      However, such silicas have a tendency to interact with the polydiorganosiloxane fluid or gum causing a phenomenon typically referred to as "crepe hardening." A great deal of effort has been made in the past to treat the surface of reinforcing silica fillers with silicon compounds to make the surface of the silica hydrophobic.
      <br/>
      This surface treatment reduces or diminishes the tendency of the compositions to crepe harden and improves the physical properties of the cured silicone rubber.
      <br/>
      The present invention is a cost effective method for preparing hydrophobic precipitated silicas, which are particularly useful as reinforcing fillers in curable silicone compositions.
      <br/>
      In addition to being cost effective, the present method produces hydrophobic precipitated silicas which retain more of their structure, such as void volume, than hydrophobic precipitated silicas prepared by other methods known in the art.

      <br/>
      The hydrophobic silica hydrogel in the aqueous phase is contacted with a water-immiscible organic solvent to convert the hydrophobic silica hydrogel to a hydrophobic silica organogel which segregates into the organic phase.

    <p num="16">
      In the present method the hydrophilic precipitated silica is made hydrophobic by reacting hydroxyl groups on the silica with an organosilicon compound.
      <br/>
      By "precipitated silica " it is meant amorphous aggregates of primary particles of colloidal silica prepared by coagulation of a silica hydrosol, which aggregates have not at any point existed as macroscopic gel during their preparation.
      <br/>
      Methods for preparing such hydrophilic precipitated silicas are well known in the art and are described in, for example, Iler, The Chemistry of Silica, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY, N.Y., pp 554-564, 1979.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The precipitated silicas treated by the present method are distinguishable from amorphous silica gels by their different properties as referenced in Iler, supra.
      <br/>
      While amorphous silica gel is usually produced commercially at low pH by acidifying an aqueous solution of a soluble metal silicate, typically sodium silicate, with acid it can also be produced by adding sodium silicate to the acid.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the terms alcogel and aquagel are sometimes used to indicate silica gels in which the pores are filled with the corresponding alcohol or water.
      <br/>
      The acid used is generally a strong mineral acid such as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid, although carbon dioxide is sometimes used.
      <br/>
      Since there is essentially no difference in density between the gel phase and the surrounding liquid phase while the viscosity is low, the gel phase does not settle out, i.e. it does not precipitate.
      <br/>
      Amorphous silica gel, then, may be described as a non- precipitated, coherent, rigid, three-dimensional network of contiguous particles of colloidal amorphous silica which can fill the whole volume of the sol.
      <br/>
      This gelatinous mass is sometimes referred to as a silica hydrogel.
      <br/>
      Following gel formation and washing the liquid is removed by drying to yield a silica xerogel.
      <br/>
      The state of subdivision of amorphous silica gel ranges from large solid masses to submicroscopic particles and the degree of hydration from almost anhydrous silica to a soft gelatinous mass containing on the order of 100 parts water per part of silica by weight.
      <br/>
      Amorphous aerogel is a class of amorphous silica gel which is produced by (a) forming amorphous silica gel by acidification in the conventional manner, (b) replacing most of the water in the gel with a liquid such as either an alcohol or another organic solvent which wets the surface of the silica gel pores, has a very low surface tension, and evaporates at ordinary temperatures, and (c) removing the liquid under pressure above the critical temperature of the alcohol or solvent so that there is no meniscus between the liquid and gas phases.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In comparison, amorphous precipitated silica is produced commercially by combining an aqueous solution of a soluble metal silicate, typically an alkali metal silicate such as sodium silicate, and an acid to that colloidal particles will grow in weakly alkaline solution and be coagulated by the alkali metal ions of the resulting soluble alkali metal salt.
      <br/>
      Various acids may be used including mineral acids and/or carbon dioxide.
      <br/>
      In the absence of a coagulant, the colloidal silica particles are not precipitated from solution at any pH.
      <br/>
      The coagulant used to effect precipitation may be the soluble alkali metal salt produced during formation of the colloidal silica particles, added electrolyte such as a soluble inorganic or organic salt, or a combination of both.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Therefore, the term "precipitated silica" as used herein refers to amorphous precipitated aggregates of primary particles of colloidal silica prepared by coagulation of a silica hydrosol, which aggregates have not at any point existed as macroscopic gel during their preparation.
      <br/>
      The size of the aggregates and the degree of hydration may vary widely.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Precipitated silica powders differ from amorphous silica gels that have been pulverized in ordinarily having a more open structure, i.e. a higher specific pore volume.
      <br/>
      In addition, the specific surface area of amorphous precipitated silica as measure by the Brunauer, Emmett, Teller (BET) method using nitrogen as the adsorbate is typically lower than that of amorphous silica gel.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The BET surface area of the hydrophilic precipitated silica used in the present method can generally be within a range of about 50 m2 /g to 1000 m2 /g.
      <br/>
      Preferred is when the hydrophilic precipitated silica has a surface area within a range of about I 00 m2 /g to 500 m2 /g.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The hydrophilic precipitated silica is added to the present method as an aqueous suspension.
      <br/>
      The concentration of hydrophilic precipitated silica in the aqueous suspension is not critical and can be within a range of about 4 to 90 weight percent.
      <br/>
      Preferred is when the concentration of hydrophilic precipitated silica in the aqueous suspension is within a range of about 4 to 50 weight percent.
      <br/>
      Most preferred is when the concentration of hydrophilic precipitated silica in the aqueous suspension is within a range of about 4 to 20 weight percent.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In the present method the aqueous suspension of hydrophilic precipitated silica is contacted with one or more of the organosilicon compounds described by formulas (1), (2), and (3) in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid.
      <br/>
      The acid catalyst can be, for example, a mineral acid such as hydrochloric, hydroiodic, sulfuric, nitric, benzene sulfonic, and phosphoric acid.
      <br/>
      When the organosilicon compound is, for example, a chlorosilane, the catalytic amount of the acid may be generated in situ by hydrolysis of the chlorosilane or the reaction of the chlorosilane directly with hydroxyl substituents of the hydrophilic precipitated silica.
      <br/>
      It is only necessary that the acid be present in an amount sufficient to effect reaction of the organosilicon compound with the hydrophilic precipitated silica.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the acid catalyst provide a pH less than about pH 6.
      <br/>
      More preferred is when the acid catalyst provides a pH less than about pH 3.
    </p>
    <p num="24">The temperature at which the contacting of the present method is conducted is not critical and can be within a range of about 15 (degree)  C. to 250 (degree)  C. Generally, it is preferred that the contacting be conducted at a temperature within a range of about 20 (degree)  C. to 150 (degree)  C. The temperature at which the contacting is conducted can be the reflux temperature of the water-miscible organic solvent.</p>
    <p num="25">
      The present method requires the presence of a water-miscible organic solvent in an amount sufficient to facilitate the hydrophobing of the hydrophilic precipitated silica with the organosilicon compound.
      <br/>
      Preferred is when the water-miscible organic solvent comprises at least 5 weight percent of the aqueous suspension comprising the hydrophilic precipitated silica .
      <br/>
      Even more preferred is when the water miscible organic solvent comprises about 15 to 50 weight percent of the aqueous suspension.
      <br/>
      Most preferred is when the water-miscible organic solvent comprises about 20 to 30 weight percent of the aqueous suspension.
      <br/>
      Suitable water-miscible solvents include, for example, alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol, and tetrahydrofuran.
      <br/>
      Isopropanol is a preferred water- miscible organic solvent for use in the present method.

      Most preferred is a solvent to silica weight ratio within a range of about 1:1 to 5:1.
      <br/>
      The upper limit for the amount of water-immiscible solvent added to the method is limited only by economic considerations such as solvent cost, solvent recovery or disposal expense, and equipment capacity.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      It is preferred that the water-immiscible organic solvent have a boiling point below about 250 (degree)  C. to facilitate its removal from the hydrophobic precipitated silica.
      <br/>
      However, the boiling point of the water-immiscible organic solvent is not critical since the solvent may be removed from the hydrophobic silica by filtration, centrifuging, or other suitable means.
    </p>
    <p num="36">The hydrophobic precipitated silica formed by the present method may be used as an aqueous suspension or slurry, may be recovered by such techniques as filtration or centrifugation with or without the addition of water immiscible organic solvent to facilitate recovery, may be further washed to reduce contaminates, and may be dried prior to use.</p>

    <p num="38">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="39">
      A precipitated silica was formed by neutralizing a sodium silicate solution.
      <br/>
      The precipitated silica was filtered and washed until a low electrolyte level was obtained.
      <br/>
      An aliquot of the precipitated silica was dried and the BET surface area determined to be 320 m2 /g.
      <br/>
      To a 5 L flask having a bottom drain and equipped with a thermometer, mechanical stirrer, and a Dean-Stark trap equipped with a reflux condenser was added 1875 g of the precipitated silica filter cake (90 g of silica) and 588 ml of isopropyl alcohol to form a suspension.
      <br/>
      To this stirred suspension was added a mixture of dimethyldichlorosilane and vinylmethyldichlorosilane in the amounts described in Table 1a.
      <br/>
      The resulting mixture was heated at 75 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      The mixture was cooled to room temperature and 500 ml of toluene were added to the mixture to effect separation of the hydrophobic precipitated silica from the aqueous phase.
      <br/>
      The aqueous phase was drained from the flask.
      <br/>
      An additional 500 ml of toluene were added to the flask and the flask content refluxed to remove water by azeotropic distillation.
      <br/>
      The resulting slurry was poured into pans and the toluene allowed to evaporate overnight.
      <br/>
      The resulting hydrophobic precipitated silica was further dried for 16 hours at 100 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The BET surface area for each hydrophobic precipitated silica was determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method as described in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 60, p 309, February 1938.
      <br/>
      The void volume of each hydrophobic precipitated silica was determined by a densitometer and is expressed as the difference between the reciprocal of the true density and the reciprocal of the bulk density measured under compression as described in Polmanteer et al., Rubber Chem. &amp; Technology, 48:796, 1975.
      <br/>
      The percent carbon content of the hydrophobic precipitated silica was determined by CHM analysis.
      <br/>
      The results of these determinations are reported in Table 1a.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The treated precipitated silicas were dispersed into a vinyl functional polydimethylsiloxane gum (0.18 mole % vinyl) at 38 parts per hundred (pph) and the resulting silicone base mixed for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      To each silicone base was added 0.3 parts per hundred of 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butylperoxy)hexane.
      <br/>
      This catalyzed silicone base was allowed to age for 1 to 3 days.
      <br/>
      Cured slabs of silicone rubber were prepared by hot pressing samples of the catalyzed silicone base in a mold at 5000 psi for 10 minutes at 177 (degree)  C.
