    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a novel poly(disulfonyl diazomethane) compound suitable as a radiation-sensitive acid-generating agent in a positive-working chemical-amplification photoresist composition and a photoresist composition containing the same.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention relates to a poly(disulfonyl diazomethane) compound capable of generating bulky sulfonic acid molecules by the irradiation with actinic rays and a positive-working chemical-amplification photoresist composition containing the same capable of giving a patterned resist layer of high pattern resolution having an excellently orthogonal cross sectional profile with high photosensitivity.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      It is a trend in recent years that, in the photolithographic patterning technology for the manufacture of semiconductor devices, liquid crystal display panels and the like, so-called chemical-amplification photoresist compositions are more and more widely employed as the photoresist.
      <br/>
      A chemical-amplification photoresist composition utilizes the catalytic activity of an acid generated from a radiation-sensitive acid-generating agent as an essential ingredient of the photoresist composition in the areas pattern-wise exposed to actinic rays.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, chemical-amplification photoresist compositions are advantageous in respect of the high photosensitivity and excellent pattern resolution even with a relatively low content of the radiation-sensitive acid-generating agent in the photoresist composition.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Chemical-amplification photoresist compositions, which are classified into the positive-working type and negative-working type, each comprise, in general, a radiation-sensitive acid-generating agent and a film-forming resinous ingredient capable of changing the solubility behavior in an aqueous alkaline solution by interacting with the acid generated from the acid-generating agent in the areas irradiated pattern-wise with actinic rays.</p>
    <p num="5">
      The film-forming resinous ingredient most widely employed in the above mentioned positive-working photoresist composition of the chemical-amplification type is a polyhydroxystyrene resin of which a part of the hydroxyl groups are substituted by acid-dissociable solubility-reducing groups such as tert-butoxycarbonyl group, tetrahydropyranyl group and the like.
      <br/>
      In the negative-working chemical-amplification photoresist compositions, on the other hand, the film-forming resinous ingredient is usually a combination of a resinous ingredient such as the above mentioned polyhydroxystyrene substituted for a part of the hydroxyl groups by the solubility-reducing groups, polyhydroxystyrene or novolak resin with an acid-crosslinkable compound such as melamine resins, urea resins and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Along with the trend in recent years for an increasing fineness in the photolithographic patterning in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, intensive investigations are now under way for the development of the photolithographic technology capable of accomplishing a fineness of about 0.25  MU m in pattern resolution by employing a chemical-amplification positive-working photoresist composition.
      <br/>
      As to the light source for pattern-wise exposure of the photoresist layer, investigations are also undertaken for the use of KrF excimer laser beams of 248 nm wavelength by which a still finer pattern resolution of smaller than 0.25  MU m could be accomplished to comply with the requirement in the semiconductor devices of next generation.
    </p>
    <p num="7">While various types of radiation-sensitive acid-generating compounds have been proposed in the formulation of chemical-amplification positive-working photoresist compositions, diazomethane compounds having a single -SO2 -C(N2)-SO2 -linkage in the molecule disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,332,936 and British Patent 1,231,789 form a class of promising acid-generating agents in a chemical-amplification photoresist composition as is disclosed in Japanese Patent Kokai 2-118655, 2-84648, 2-187764, 3-103854, 4-210960 and 4-217249.</p>
    <p num="8">The above mentioned diazomethane compounds, however, are not quite satisfactory for use in the modern photolithographic patterning works requiring extreme fineness of 0.25  MU m or finer in the pattern resolution because such fine resolution of pattern cannot be accomplished by using the diazomethane compound if not to mention the problem of a poor cross sectional profile of the patterned resist layer.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The present invention accordingly has a primary object to provide a novel diazomethane compound which can overcome the above mentioned disadvantages of conventional diazomethane compounds as an acid-generating agent in a chemical-amplification photoresist composition and is useful as a radiation-sensitive acid-generating agent in a high-performance positive-working photoresist composition of the chemical-amplification type.
      <br/>
      Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel chemical-amplification positive-working photoresist composition containing the above mentioned novel diazomethane compound as an acid-generating agent.

      In the first place, namely, 2 moles of an  ALPHA -halogenothioanisole (II) are reacted with 1 mole of an  ALPHA , OMEGA -alkanedithiol (III) in an inert solvent such as an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent, e.g., toluene, in the presence of a hydrogen halide acceptor to give the compound of the general formula (IV), which is then, in a suitable organic solvent, oxidized with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide to give the  ALPHA , OMEGA -bis(phenylsulfonylmethyl sulfonyl) alkane of the general formula (V).

      This compound (V) is diazotized in a suitable organic solvent with a diazotizing agent such as tosyl azide to give the  ALPHA , OMEGA -bis(phenylsulfonyl diazomethyl sulfonyl) alkane compound (Ia) which is isolated from the reaction mixture and purified by a known method.

    <p num="63">
      Since the photoresist composition generally should have transparency to the excimer laser beams of 248 nm wavelength as high as possible in order to accomplish high pattern resolution, the group R is, preferably, an alkyl or cycloalkyl group or, more preferably, a cyclohexyl group.
      <br/>
      When the substrate surface is provided with a coating film of a metal such as aluminum having high reflectivity, however, the transparency of the photoresist layer should have relatively low transparency in order to reduce the phenomenon of halation so that aryl groups having 6 to 15 carbon atoms can be used as the group R. Phenyl group is also preferable as the group R in respect of a relatively large focusing depth latitude.

    <p num="64">
      The divalent hydrocarbon group denoted by Z in the general formula (IA) is preferably a straightly linear or branched alkylene group or, preferably, a polymethylene group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms.

      Particularly preferable poly(disulfonyl diazomethane) compound as the component (B) are those represented by the general formula (IA) in which each R is a cyclohexyl group or a phenyl group, the subscript n is 1 and Z is a polymethylene group.

      Examples of these compounds in which R is a cyclohexyl group include 1,2-bis(cyclohexylsulfonyl diazomethylsulfonyl) ethane, 1,3-bis(cyclohexylsulfonyl diazomethylsulfonyl) propane, 1,6-bis(cyclohexylsulfonyl diazomethylsulfonyl) hexane and 1,10-bis(cyclohexylsulfonyl diazomethylsulfonyl) decane.

      These poly(disulfonyl diazomethane) compounds can be used as the component (B) either singly or as a combination of two kinds or more according to need.

    <p num="66">
      The amount of the radiation-sensitive acid-generating agent as the component (B) in the inventive photoresist composition is, usually, in the range from 0.5 to 20 parts by weight or, preferably, from 1 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the component (A).
      <br/>
      When the amount thereof is too small, complete patterning can hardly be accomplished.
      <br/>
      When the amount thereof is too large, on the other hand, difficulties are encountered in the preparation of a homogeneous solution of the photoresist composition due to the limited solubility of the compound in the organic solvent or, even if a homogeneous solution could be formed, a decrease is caused in the storage stability of the photoresist solution.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      Besides the above described components (A) and (B) as the essential ingredients, the inventive photoresist composition can be compounded, according to need, with other additive compounds including an amine compound which serves to prevent diffusion of the acid generated from the acid-generating agent in the areas irradiated with actinic rays and to improve the stability of the latent images formed in the photoresist layer exposed to actinic rays before being subjected to a post-exposure baking treatment and further additionally a carboxylic acid which serves to improve the photosensitivity of the photoresist composition and to decrease the dependency of the cross sectional profile of the patterned resist layer on the nature of the substrate surface layer which may be a coating film of silicon nitride (SiN), boron-phosphorus-silicate glass (BPSG) or titanium nitride (TiN).
      <br/>
      It is sometimes the case that the substrate surface is provided with a reflection preventing layer of an organic or inorganic material.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      It is usual that the inventive photoresist composition is prepared in the form of a homogeneous solution by dissolving the essential and optional ingredients in an organic solvent which can be applied to the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable organic solvents include ketone solvents such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, methyl isoamyl ketone and 2-heptanone, polyhydric alcohols and derivatives thereof such as ethyleneglycol, ethyleneglycol monoacetate, diethyleneglycol, diethyleneglycol monoacetate, propyleneglycol, propyleneglycol monoacetate, dipropyleneglycol and dipropyleneglycol monoacetate as well as monomethyl, monoethyl, monopropyl, monobutyl and monophenyl ethers thereof, cyclic ether solvents such as dioxane and ester solvents such as methyl lactate, ethyl lactate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, methyl pyruvate, ethyl pyruvate, methyl methoxypropionate and ethyl ethoxypropionate, which can be used either singly or as a mixture of two kinds or more.

    <p num="69">Various known additives having compatibility can optionally be added to the photoresist composition of the invention each in a limited amount including auxiliary resins to improve the properties of the resist layer, plasticizers, stabilizers, coloring agents, surface active agents and so on.</p>
    <p num="70">
      The photolithographic patterning procedure by using the inventive photoresist composition is not particularly different from the procedure by using a conventional photoresist composition.
      <br/>
      For example, namely, the surface of a substrate such as a semiconductor silicon wafer is coated with the inventive photoresist composition on a suitable coating machine such as a spinner followed by a drying treatment to form a dried photoresist layer, which is then pattern-wise exposed to actinic rays such as KrF excimer laser beams on a minifying projection exposure machine through a pattern-bearing photomask followed by a post-exposure baking treatment to form a latent image in the photoresist layer.
      <br/>
      The latent images are developed by a development treatment using an aqueous alkaline developer solution such as a 1 to 10% by weight aqueous solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide to selectively dissolve away the photoresist layer in the exposed areas leaving a patterned resist layer having high fidelity to the photomask pattern and an excellently orthogonal cross sectional profile with very fine pattern resolution of 0.15 to 0.22  MU m fineness.

      The minimum exposure dose to obtain a line-and-space pattern of 0.25  MU m line width as a measure of the photosensitivity was 20 mJ/cm2 and the critical pattern resolution there was 0.18  MU m. The patterned resist layer had a trapezoidal cross sectional profile close to triangular.
