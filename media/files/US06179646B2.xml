    <p num="3">2. Brief Description of Prior Developments</p>
    <p num="4">
      Various devices have been suggested for holding an electrical cable within an electrical connector.
      <br/>
      One disadvantage to such devices has been that ordinarily design to accommodate only one size and a narrow range of sizes of electrical cable.
      <br/>
      There is, therefore, a need for cable clamp assembly which accommodates a wide range of cable sizes and is easy to use and economical to manufacture.
      <br/>
      There is also a need for such a device which provides strain relief and flex relief for the crimp to wire or solder to wire interconnections.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="7">
      Referring to FIGS. 1-2, the cable clamp bushing shown generally at numeral 10 includes a tubular base section 11 and a resilient first finger 12 and a resilient second finger 14 which is positioned in opposed relation to said first finger with respect to the tubular base section.
      <br/>
      The first finger 12 has a terminal projection 16 which extends in a forward and inward direction.
      <br/>
      The first finger also has an outward radial projection which is positioned rearwardly from its forward terminal end.
      <br/>
      The second finger has a terminal projection 20 which extends in a forward and inward direction.
      <br/>
      The second finger also has an outward radial projection 22.
      <br/>
      A resilient third finger 24 and a resilient fourth finger 26 also extend from the tubular base section 11.
      <br/>
      The third finger has a terminal inward and forward projection 28.
      <br/>
      The fourth finger 26 has a terminal inward and forward projection 30.
      <br/>
      Between the first finger 12 and the third finger 24 there is an axial groove 32.
      <br/>
      Between the first finger 12 and the fourth 26 there is an axial groove 34.
      <br/>
      Between the second finger 14 and the fourth finger 26 there is an axial groove 36.
      <br/>
      Between the second finger 14 and the third finger 24 there is an axial groove 38.
      <br/>
      The bushing 10 also has an axial bore 40 for receiving a cable.
      <br/>
      The rearward edge 41 of the bushing 10 is also rounded to accommodate cable flex as explained further hereafter.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Referring to FIG. 3, the insertion of a cable shown generally at numeral 42 in this axial bore 40 is illustrated.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 4, as the cable moves axially forward the fingers as at finger 12 and finger 14 flex to expand to accommodate the cable's diameter.
      <br/>
      The inward and forward projections of the fingers as at projections 16 and 20, grip the outer insulative jacket of the cable.
      <br/>
      It will be understood, that although fingers 24 and 26 are not shown in FIG. 4, that these fingers also flex to expand to accommodate the cable's diameter.
      <br/>
      It will be also understood that their inward and forward projections 28 and 30 grip the outer insulative jacket 43 of the cable 42.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the fingers will flex to a greater degree to accommodate a cable of a larger diameter and will flex to a smaller degree to accommodate a cable of a smaller diameter.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Referring to FIGS. 5-6, the bushing is enclosed within a machined metal connector shell shown generally at numeral 44.
      <br/>
      This shell is bifurcated into a first opposed section 46 and a second opposed section 48.
      <br/>
      The connector shell also has a central opening 50 for housing the bushing.
      <br/>
      Adjacent the central opening 50, the shell 44 has a cylindrical inner wall 52 with a peripheral groove 54.
      <br/>
      Referring particularly to FIG. 6, it will be seen that the peripheral groove receives the outward radial projection 18 of the first finger 12 and the outward radial projection 22 of the second finger 14.
      <br/>
      The inward and forward projections on the fingers grip the outer insulative jacket 43 of the cable 42 to cause resistance to forces that would pull the cable out of the connector shell 44.
      <br/>
      The connector shell 44 includes an upper transverse aperture 56 and a lower transverse aperture 58 which receive, respectively, clamping bolt 60 and clamping bolt 62 which fix the first opposed section 46 and the second opposed section 48 of the shell 44 together.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      It will be appreciated that a cable clamp assembly has been described which allows a single assembly to be used for mounting a variety of different cable diameters in an electrical connector.
      <br/>
      Relatively smaller differences in diameter can be accommodated by having the fingers flex radially outwardly or inwardly.
      <br/>
      Larger differences in diameter can be accommodated by removing the bushing 10 from the shell and replacing the original bushing with another bushing.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that it would be feasible to manufacture a number of bushings having different sizes of central bores which would have a uniform outer dimension that would fit the inner wall 52 and peripheral groove 54 of the shell 44.
      <br/>
      It will also be appreciated that providing a variety of bushings would ordinarily be economically advantageous as compared with providing a similar variety of different sizes of connector shells.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      It will also be appreciated that this assembly provided flex relief and strain relief for any crimp to wire or solder to wire interconnections which may be made to the cable.
      <br/>
      The rounded surface on the rear end 41 of the bushing allows such flex relief.
      <br/>
      Referring particularly to FIG. 6, it will be seen that if there is a crimp to wire or solder to wire interconnection on the cable in the direction of the arrow, the cable would tend to be pulled in that direction.
      <br/>
      Such strain on the interconnection would, therefore, tend to tighten the projections 16 and 20 on the outer insulative jacket 43 of the cable 42 and thereby tend to relieve strain on the interconnection.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      While the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the various figures, it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications and additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating therefrom.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment, but rather construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the recitation of the appended claims.
