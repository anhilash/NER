    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      A number of structural classes of compounds with antibacterial properties are known.
      <br/>
      Historically, the most important classes of antibacterials have been the  BETA -lactams, macrolides, lincosamides, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, polypeptides, and sulfonamides.
      <br/>
      The bulk of these antibacterial compounds were isolated originally from molds, fungi or bacteria; synthetic and semi-synthetic compounds, additionally, have proven to be efficacious in the treatment of bacterial infections.
      <br/>
      In the broadest possible sense, known antibacterials work by influencing at least one of the following cellular processes or characteristics: cell wall synthesis; protein synthesis; nucleic acid synthesis; cellular metabolism; and cytoplasmic membrane permeability.
      <br/>
      Brief descriptions follow of the mechanisms of action of members of each of the aforementioned classes of antibacterials.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The  BETA -lactam antibiotics inhibit penicillin binding proteins (PBPs).
      <br/>
      The PBPs are ubiquitous bacterial enzymes that are involved in cell wall biosynthesis (reviewed in Waxman et al., 1983 Annual Review of Biochemistry 58:825-869; Georgopapadkou et al., 1983 Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology 67:1-77; and Ghuysen, 1991 Annual Review of Microbiology 45:37-67); inhibition of these proteins disrupts the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall.
      <br/>
      Specifically, these compounds act as substrate analogs for the PBPs and form an acyl enzyme intermediate.
      <br/>
      This acyl enzyme intermediate is resistant to subsequent hydrolysis and ties up the enzyme in a relatively long-lived inactive form.
      <br/>
      Bacteria have responded to the widespread use of  BETA -lactam antibiotics by evolving a class of  BETA -lactam hydrolyzing enzymes known as  BETA -lactamases.
      <br/>
      These enzymes are one of the sources of drug resistance now being observed in a number of bacterial diseases including tuberculosis, malaria, pneumonia, meningitis, dysentery, bacteremia, and various venereal diseases.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The macrolides are a family of antibiotics whose structures contain large lactone rings linked through glycoside bonds with amino sugars.
      <br/>
      The most important members of the group are erythromycin and oleandomycin.
      <br/>
      Erythromycin is active against most Gram-positive bacteria, Neisseria, Legionella and Haemophilus, but not against the Enterobacteriaceae.
      <br/>
      Macrolides inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit.
      <br/>
      Binding inhibits elongation of the protein by peptidyl transferase or prevents translocation of the ribosome or both.
      <br/>
      Macrolides are bacteriostatic for most bacteria but are bactericidal for a few Gram-positive bacteria.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The lincosamides are sulfur-containing antibiotics isolated from Streptomyces lincolnensis.
      <br/>
      There are two important lincosamides: lincomycin and clindamycin.
      <br/>
      Clindanycin is preferred over lincomycin due to its greater potency, fewer adverse side effects, and its more favorable pharmacokinetic properties.
      <br/>
      Bacterial resistance and cross resistance to clindamycin have begun to emerge.
      <br/>
      The lincosamides are active against Gram-positive bacteria especially cocci, but also non-spore forming anaerobic bacteria, Actinomycetes, Mycoplasm and some Plasmodium.
      <br/>
      The lincosamides bind to the 50S ribosomal subunit and thereby inhibit protein synthesis.
      <br/>
      These drugs may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal depending upon several factors, including their local concentration.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Aminoglycosides are important antibacterials used primarily to treat infections caused by susceptible aerobic Gram-negative bacteria.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, they have a narrow margin of safety, producing characteristic lesions in kidney, cochlea, and vestibular apparatus within the therapeutic dose range.
      <br/>
      Because they are polycations, the aminoglycosides cross cellular membranes very poorly.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The tetracyclines consist of eight related antibiotics which are all natural products of Streptomyces, although some can now be produced semi-synthetically.
      <br/>
      Tetracycline, chlortetracycline and doxycycline are the best known members of this class.
      <br/>
      The tetracyclines are broad-spectrum antibiotics with a wide range of activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
      <br/>
      The tetracyclines act by blocking the binding of aminoacyl tRNA to the A site on the ribosome.
      <br/>
      Tetracyclines inhibit protein synthesis on isolated 70S or 80S (eukaryotic) ribosomes, and in both cases, their effect is on the small ribosomal subunit.
      <br/>
      Most bacteria possess an active transport system for tetracycline that will allow intracellular accumulation of the antibiotic at concentrations 50 times as great as that in the surrounding medium.
      <br/>
      This system greatly enhances the antibacterial effectiveness of tetracycline and accounts for its specificity of action, since an effective concentration is not accumulated in host cells.
      <br/>
      Thus a blood level of tetracycline which is harmless to mammalian tissues can halt protein synthesis in invading bacteria.
      <br/>
      The tetracyclines have a remarkably low toxicity and minimal side effects in mammals.
      <br/>
      The combination of their broad spectrum and low toxicity has led to their overuse and misuse by the medical community and the wide-spread development of resistance has reduced their effectiveness.
      <br/>
      Nonetheless, tetracyclines still have some important uses, such as in the treatment of Lyme disease.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The polypeptide antibacterials have in common their basic structural elements--amino acids.
      <br/>
      Representatives of this class include vancomycin, and bacitracin.
      <br/>
      Vancomycin can be used to treat both systemic and gastrointestinal infections, whereas because of serious systemic toxicities bacitracin, is limited to topical applications.
      <br/>
      Vancomycin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by inhibiting peptidoglycan synthase, apparently by binding to D-alanyl-D-alanine, a component of the cross-link between chains.
      <br/>
      This action inhibits peptidoglycan chain elongation, and as might be expected, the effect is bactericidal for most organisms if they are dividing rapidly.
      <br/>
      Because it does not target penicillin-binding enzymes, vancomycin is not cross-resistant with the  BETA -lactams.
      <br/>
      Bacitracin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic which inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by inhibiting lipid pyrophosphatase; this enzyme is involved in transmembrane transport of peptidoglycan precursors.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The sulphonamides are usually bacteriostatic and arrest cell growth by inhibiting bacterial folic acid synthesis.
      <br/>
      They are effective against sensitive strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, Actinomyces, Nocardia and Plasmodia.
      <br/>
      However, extensive clinical use of sulfonamides over many years has resulted in a high level of resistance and their current use is limited.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Antibacterial resistance is a global clinical and public health problem that has emerged with alarming rapidity in recent years and undoubtedly will increase in the near future.
      <br/>
      Resistance is a problem in the community as well as in health care settings, where transmission of bacteria is greatly amplified.
      <br/>
      Because multiple drug resistance is a growing problem, physicians are now confronted with infections for which there is no effective therapy.
      <br/>
      The morbidity, mortality, and financial costs of such infections pose an increasing burden for health care systems worldwide, but especially in countries with limited resources.
      <br/>
      Strategies to address these issues emphasize enhanced surveillance of drug resistance, increased monitoring and improved usage of antimicrobial drugs, professional and public education, development of new drugs, and assessment of alternative therapeutic modalities.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">Alternative and improved agents are needed for the treatment of bacterial infections, particularly for the treatment of infections caused by resistant strains of bacteria, e.g. penicillin-resistant, methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-resistant, and/or vancomycin-resistant strains, as well as for the decontamination of objects bearing such organisms, e.g. non-living matter, hospital equipment, walls of operating rooms, and the like.</p>
    <p num="12">
      In general, the present invention provides compounds, pharmaceutical preparations thereof, and methods for inhibiting the growth of bacterial microorganisms or eradicating them, including infections of Gram-positive bacteria, e.g., Staphylococcus infections, Streptococcus infections, and Enterococcus infections; and infections of Gram-negative bacteria, e.g., Enterobacteriaceae infections, Mycobacterium infections, Neisseria infections, Pseudomonas infections, Shigella infections, Escherichia infections, Bacillus infections, Micrococcus infections, Arthrobacter infections, and Peptostreptococcus infections.
      <br/>
      For instance, the compounds of the present invention are particularly useful in the treatment of infections caused by methicillin-resistant strains of bacteria, e.g., methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; Micrococcus pyogenes var. aureus), ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of bacteria, e.g., ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (CRSA), and vancomycin-resistant strains of bacteria, e.g., vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium (VREF).
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, the present invention can be used to inhibit bacterial infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, e.g., S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumonia.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Certain embodiments of the invention, as described herein, are directed to the use of small (e.g., Mr&lt;1 kD) organic molecules, e.g., 2-(3-indolyl)-di- and tetra-hydroquinolines, substituted derivatives thereof, and their pharmaceutical formulations, in the treatment of bacterial infections.
      <br/>
      Specifically, compounds based on 4-(3-indolyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,9b-hexahydrofuro�3,2-c�quinoline (See Definitions) and derivatives thereof are exploited as antibacterial agents.
      <br/>
      As described herein, certain compounds of the present invention antibacterials in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) at or below single-digit micromolar concentrations in assays against cultures of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE), and/or penicillin-resistant Pseudomonas (PRP).
      <br/>
      The wide range of antibacterial compounds disclosed herein enables the potential to tailor potency, specificity, solubility, bioavailability, stability, toxicity, and other physical properties to suit specific clinical or treatment needs.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">
      In the last several years, the frequency and spectrum of antimicrobial-resistant infections has increased in both the hospital and the community.
      <br/>
      Certain infections that are essentially untreatable are reaching epidemic proportions in both the developing world and institutional settings in the developed world.
      <br/>
      Antimicrobial resistance is manifested in increased morbidity, mortality, and health-care costs.
      <br/>
      For example, Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of nosocomial infection, especially nosocomial pneumonia, surgical wound infection, and bloodstream infection (Panlilio et al., Infect. Cont. Hosp. Epidemiol. 13: 582-586 (1992)).
      <br/>
      Other pathogens commonly associated with nosocomial infection include, but are not limited to, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The present invention relates to heterocyclic antibacterial agents with antimicrobial activity, and particularly, antibacterial activity against both sensitive and resistant strains of various bacteria.
      <br/>
      The subject antibacterial compounds comprise two distinct heterocycles that are covalently linked, preferably via a carbon-carbon single bond.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, the respective heterocyclic moieties are di- or tetra-hydroquinolinyl, and indolyl nuclei interconnected at their respective 2- and 3-positions.
      <br/>
      Independent of their particular identities, the individual heterocyclic nuclei of the subject compounds may bear substituents.

    <p num="40">
      The term "prodrug" is intended to encompass compounds which, under physiological conditions, are converted into the antibacterial agents of the present invention.
      <br/>
      A common method for making a prodrug is to select moieties, e.g., for any of the R1 -R5 substituents of formula 1, which are hydrolyzed under physiological conditions to provide the desired.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the prodrug is converted by an enzymatic activity of the host animal or the target bacteria.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The term "heteroatom" as used herein means an atom of any element other than carbon or hydrogen.
      <br/>
      Preferred heteroatoms are boron, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur and selenium.

    <p num="42">
      The term "electron-withdrawing group" is recognized in the art, and denotes the tendency of a substituent to attract valence electrons from neighboring atoms, i.e., the substituent is electronegative with respect to neighboring atoms.
      <br/>
      A quantification of the level of electron-withdrawing capability is given by the Hammett sigma ( SIGMA ) constant.
      <br/>
      This well known constant is described in many references, for instance, J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, McGraw Hill Book Company, New York, (1977 edition) pp. 251-259. The Hammett constant values are generally negative for electron donating groups ( SIGMA �P�=-0.66 for NH2) and positive for electron withdrawing groups ( SIGMA �P�=0.78 for a nitro group),  SIGMA �P� indicating para substitution.
      <br/>
      Exemplary electron-withdrawing groups include nitro, acyl, formyl, sulfonyl, trifluoromethyl, cyano, chloride, and the like.
      <br/>
      Exemplary electron-donating groups include amino, methoxy, and the like.

    <p num="43">Herein, the term "aliphatic group" refers to a straight-chain, branched-chain, or cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbon group and includes saturated and unsaturated aliphatic groups, such as an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, and an alkynyl group.</p>
    <p num="44">
      The term "alkyl" refers to the radical of saturated aliphatic groups, including straight-chain alkyl groups, branched-chain alkyl groups, cycloalkyl (alicyclic) groups, alkyl substituted cycloalkyl groups, and cycloalkyl substituted alkyl groups.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, a straight chain or branched chain alkyl has 30 or fewer carbon atoms in its backbone (e.g., C1 -C30 for straight chain, C3 -C30 for branched chain), and more preferably 20 or fewer.
      <br/>
      Likewise, preferred cycloalkyls have from 3-10 carbon atoms in their ring structure, and more preferably have 5, 6 or 7 carbons in the ring structure.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Moreover, the term "alkyl" (or "lower alkyl") as used throughout the specification, examples, and claims is intended to include both "unsubstituted alkyls" and "substituted alkyls", the latter of which refers to alkyl moieties having substituents replacing a hydrogen on one or more carbons of the hydrocarbon backbone.
      <br/>
      Such substituents can include, for example, a halogen, a hydroxyl, a carbonyl (such as a carboxyl, an alkoxycarbonyl, a formyl, or an acyl), a thiocarbonyl (such as a thioester, a thioacetate, or a thioformate), an alkoxyl, a phosphoryl, a phosphonate, a phosphinate, an amino, an amido, an amidine, an imine, a cyano, a nitro, an azido, a sulfhydryl, an alkylthio, a sulfate, a sulfonate, a sulfamoyl, a sulfonamido, a sulfonyl, a heterocyclyl, an aralkyl, or an aromatic or heteroaromatic moiety.
      <br/>
      It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the moieties substituted on the hydrocarbon chain can themselves be substituted, if appropriate.
      <br/>
      For instance, the substituents of a substituted alkyl may include substituted and unsubstituted forms of amino, azido, imino, amido, phosphoryl (including phosphonate and phosphinate), sulfonyl (including sulfate, sulfonamido, sulfamoyl and sulfonate), and silyl groups, as well as ethers, alkylthios, carbonyls (including ketones, aldehydes, carboxylates, and esters), --CF3, --CN and the like.
      <br/>
      Exemplary substituted alkyls are described below.
      <br/>
      Cycloalkyls can be further substituted with alkyls, alkenyls, alkoxys, alkylthios, aminoalkyls, carbonyl-substituted alkyls, --CF3, --CN, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="46">The term "aralkyl", as used herein, refers to an alkyl group substituted with an aryl group (e.g., an aromatic or heteroaromatic group).</p>
    <p num="47">The terms "alkenyl" and "alkynyl" refer to unsaturated aliphatic groups analogous in length and possible substitution to the alkyls described above, but that contain at least one double or triple bond respectively.</p>
    <p num="48">
      Unless the number of carbons is otherwise specified, "lower alkyl" as used herein means an alkyl group, as defined above, but having from one to ten carbons, more preferably from one to six carbon atoms in its backbone structure.
      <br/>
      Likewise, "lower alkenyl" and "lower alkynyl" have similar chain lengths.
      <br/>
      Throughout the application, preferred alkyl groups are lower alkyls.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, a substituent designated herein as alkyl is a lower alkyl.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The term "aryl" as used herein includes 5-, 6- and 7-membered single-ring aromatic groups that may include from zero to four heteroatoms, for example, benzene, pyrrole, furan, thiophene, imidazole, oxazole, thiazole, triazole, pyrazole, pyridine, pyrazine, pyridazine and pyrimidine, and the like.
      <br/>
      Those aryl groups having heteroatoms in the ring structure may also be referred to as "aryl heterocycles" or "heteroaromatics." The aromatic ring can be substituted at one or more ring positions with such substituents as described above, for example, halogen, azide, alkyl, aralkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, hydroxyl, alkoxyl, amino, nitro, sulfhydryl, imino, amido, phosphonate, phosphinate, carbonyl, carboxyl, silyl, ether, alkylthio, sulfonyl, sulfonamido, ketone, aldehyde, ester, heterocyclyl, aromatic or heteroaromatic moieties, --CF3, --CN, or the like.
      <br/>
      The term "aryl" also includes polycyclic ring systems having two or more cyclic rings in which two or more carbons are common to two adjoining rings (the rings are "fused rings") wherein at least one of the rings is aromatic, e.g., the other cyclic rings can be cycloalkyls, cycloalkenyls, cycloalkynyls, aryls and/or heterocyclyls.

    </p>
    <p num="333">The antibacterial properties of the compounds of the present invention may be determined from a bacterial lysis assay, as well as by other methods, including, inter alia, growth inhibition assays (e.g., such as described by Blondelie et al. (1992) Biochemistry 31:12688), fluorescence-based bacterial viability assays (e.g., Molecular Probes BacLight), flow cytometry analyses (Arroyo et al. (1995) J. Virol. 69: 4095-4102), and other standard assays known to those skilled in the art.</p>
    <p num="334">The assays for growth inhibition of a microbial target can be used to derive an ED50 value for the compound, that is, the concentration of compound required to kill 50% of the microbial sample being tested.</p>
    <p num="335">
      Alternatively, growth inhibition by an antimicrobial compound of the invention may also be characterized in terms of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), which is the concentration of compound required to achieve inhibition of microbial cell growth.
      <br/>
      Such values are well known to those in the art as representative of the effectiveness of a particular antimicrobial agent (e.g., an antibiotic) against a particular organism or group of organisms.
      <br/>
      For instance, cytolysis of a bacterial population by an antimicrobial compound can also be characterized, as described above by the minimum inhibitory concentration, which is the concentration required to reduce the viable bacterial population by 99.9%. The value of MIC50 can also be used, defined as the concentration of a compound required to reduce the viable bacterial population by 50%.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, the compounds of the present invention are selected for use based, inter alia, on having MIC values of less than 25  MU g/mL, more preferably less than 7  MU g/mL, and even more preferably less than 1  MU g/mL against a desired bacterial target, e.g., a Gram positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae.
    </p>
    <p num="336">
      Another parameter useful in identifying and measuring the effectiveness of the antimicrobial compounds of the invention is the determination of the kinetics of the antimicrobial activity of a compound.
      <br/>
      Such a determination can be made by determining antimicrobial activity as a function of time.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the compounds display kinetics which result in efficient lysis of a microorganism.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the compounds are bacteriocidal.
    </p>
    <p num="337">
      Furthermore, the preferred antimicrobial compounds of the invention display selective toxicity to target microorganisms and minimal toxicity to mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      Determination of the toxic dose (or "LD50 ") can be carried using protocols well known in the field of pharmacology.
      <br/>
      Ascertaining the effect of a compound of the invention on mammalian cells is preferably performed using tissue culture assays, e.g., the present compounds can be evaluated according to standard methods known to those skilled in that art (see for example Gootz, T. D. (1990) Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 3:13-31).
      <br/>
      For mammalian cells, such assay methods include, inter alia, trypan blue exclusion and MTT assays (Moore et al. (1994) Compound Research 7:265-269).
      <br/>
      Where a specific cell type may release a specific metabolite upon changes in membrane permeability, that specific metabolite may be assayed, e.g., the release of hemoglobin upon the lysis of red blood cells (Srinivas et al. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267:7121-7127).
      <br/>
      The compounds of the invention are preferably tested against primary cells, e.g., using human skin fibroblasts (HSF) or fetal equine kidney (FEK) cell cultures, or other primary cell cultures routinely used by those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Permanent cell lines may also be used, e.g., Jurkat cells.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, the subject compounds are selected for use in animals, or animal cell/tissue culture based at least in part on having LD50 's at least one order of magnitude greater than the MIC or ED50 as the case may be, and even more preferably at least two, three and even four orders of magnitude greater.
      <br/>
      That is, in preferred embodiments where the subject compounds are to be administered to an animal, a suitable therapeutic index is preferably greater than 10, and more preferably greater than 10, 1000 or even 10,000.
    </p>
    <p num="338">
      Antibacterial assays for the compounds of the invention can be performed to determine the bacterial activity toward both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms.
      <br/>
      Typical Gram-negative pathogens which may be sensitive to the antibacterial agents of the present invention can include, for example, species of genus Escherichia, genus Enterobacter, genus Klebsiella, genus Serratia, genus Proteus and genus Pseudomonas.
      <br/>
      For example, the subject compositions and methods can be used as part of treatment and prevention regimens for infections by some of the most frequently encountered Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, including those involving Escherichia coli (E.
      <br/>
      Coli), Klebsiella peumoniae (K. peumoniae), Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae (E. aerogenes and E. cloacae), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis), Group B Streptococcus aureus and Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacter diphtheriae, Gardnierella vaginalis, Actinetobacter spp., Bordella pertussis, Haemophilus aegyptius, Haemophilus influenza, Haemophilus ducreyi, Shigella spp, Serratia spp., and Propionibacterium acnes.
    </p>
    <p num="339">The above list of pathogens is purely illustrative and is in no way to be interpreted as restrictive.</p>
    <p num="340">Examples of conditions which can be treated include illnesses of the respiratory passages and of the pharyngeal cavity; otitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, peritonitis, pyelonephritis, cystitus, endocarditis, systemic infections, bronchitis, arthritis, local inflammations, skin infections, conjuntivitus, and infections of any surgically created vascular access for the purpose of hemodialysis.</p>
    <p num="341">The antibiotics of the present invention can also be used prophylactically in animal breeding and livestock husbandry, and as an agents for promoting and accelerating growth and for improving feedstuff utilization in both healthy and sick animals.</p>
    <p num="342">
      In preferred embodiments, the antibacterial agents of the present invention are selected based on their ability to inhibit growth of Gram-positive bacteria.
      <br/>
      Such Gram-positive bacteria include bacteria from the following species: Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Micrococcus, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Enterococcus, Bacillus, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Listeria, Erysipelothrix, Propionibacterium, Eubacterium, and Corynebacterium.
    </p>
    <p num="343">
      A variety of Gram-positive organisms are capable of causing sepsis.
      <br/>
      The most common organisms involved in sepsis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptoccocus pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococci, but any Gram-positive organism may be involved. (see, e.g., Bone, (1993) J. Critical Care 8:51-59).
      <br/>
      Thus, it is specifically contemplated that the subject compositions and methods can be used as part of a therapeutic treatment or prevention program for sepsis involving Gram-positive bacteria.
    </p>
    <p num="344">
      Accordingly, in one embodiment, S. aureus is used as a model of a Gram-positive microorganism in testing/selecting the compounds of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This bacteria is also a significant clinical target as well because it is refractive to most systemic antibiotic treatments.
      <br/>
      Staphylococcus aureus is the most frequent cause of skin, wound, and blood infections and the second most frequent cause of lower respiratory tract infections, and the microorganism tends to prey on immunocompromised and institutionalized patients.
      <br/>
      Thus, the subject compounds can be used to treat such infections caused by Staphylococcus, as well as in the treatment of conjunctivitis, outer ear infections and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="345">
      One of the key contributors to the increase in mortality and morbidity due to bacterial infections is the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria.
      <br/>
      Examples of the seriousness of antibiotic resistance are methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRSA), and the emergence of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus which have become resistant to virtually all currently used antibiotics.
      <br/>
      Thus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus may also be used as an antibiotic-resistant model organism for selecting the subject compounds.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the antibacterial agents of the present invention can be used in the treatment and/or prevention of endocarditis, e.g., which may be caused by MRSA.
    </p>
    <p num="346">
      The heavy use of vancomycin to treat MRSA infections has in turn contributed to the emergence of new strains of enterococci, the third most prevalent cause of bacterial infection in the U.S., which are resistant to vancomycin.
      <br/>
      Enterococcus causes as many as 15 percent of bacterial endocarditis cases; it is also the cause of meningitis, and infections in the urinary tract, stomach and intestines.
      <br/>
      Infections caused by these vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) frequently do not respond to any current therapies, and in many cases prove fatal.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the subject compounds can be selected using an assay based on E. faecalis sensitivity, and in particular, the vancomycin-resistant isolates found in clinical settings such as a hospital.
    </p>
    <p num="347">
      The subject compositions may also be selected for treatment of infection by Streptococcus.
      <br/>
      Streptococcus species are found associated in a great variety of pathologic conditions among which are gangrene, puerperal infections, subacute bacterial endocarditis, septic sore throat, rheumatic fever, and pneumonia.
      <br/>
      Agents which are active against Streptococcus species are, therefore, greatly needed.
    </p>
    <p num="348">
      To further illustrate, E. coli and P. aeruginosa are examples of Gram-negative organisms which may be sensitive to the subject antibacterial agents. P. aeruginosa is a particularly problematic source of disease in such conditions as lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis, burn infections, eye and urinary tract infections, and infection with P. aeruginosa may result in serious septicemia.
      <br/>
      Moreover, imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa are increasing in the clinical field.
      <br/>
      Enteropathogenic E. coli are responsible for outbreaks of diarrhea in infants and newborns, and diarrhea, including "traveler's diarrhea", in adults. E. coli may be invasive and toxin-producing, causing sometimes fatal infections, such as cystitis, pyelitis, pyelonephritis, appendicitis, peritonitis, gallbladder infection, septicemia, meningitis and endocarditis.
    </p>
    <p num="349">
      In still other embodiments, the subject compounds can be used in the treatment of infections caused by Serratia spp.
      <br/>
      For instance, S. marcescens is a source of ophthalmic and other topical infections, and can be readily provided in assays intended to identify those compounds of the present invention which are bactercidal at suitable concentrations agains that bacteria.
    </p>
    <p num="350">The subject compounds may also be used in the treatment of external ear infections (otitis externa), or in the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases such as Niesseria gonorrhea and trichomonas infections.</p>
    <p num="351">
      Certain compounds according to the invention may also be selected on the basis of their activity against typical and atypical Mycobacteria and Helicobacter pylori, and also against bacteria-like microorganisms, such as, for example, Mycoplasma and Rickettsia.
      <br/>
      They are therefore particularly suitable in human and veterinary medicine for the prophylaxis and chemotherapy of local and systemic infections caused by these pathogens.
      <br/>
      Mycobacterium boris, like M. tuberculosis, M. africanum, M. ulcerans, and M. leprae, is a strict pathogen. M. bovis is a significant patbogen throughout much of the world, causing tuberculosis, primarily in cattle.
    </p>
    <p num="352">
      In other embodiments, the subject compositions can be used in the treatment/prevention of infection by Salmonella.
      <br/>
      Salmonella spp. cause food poisoning, resulting in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and sometimes-fatal septicemia.
      <br/>
      For instance, S. typhi is the etiological agent of typhoid fever.
    </p>
    <p num="353">
      The compositions and methods of the present invention may also be useful in the treatment of infection by Shigella.
      <br/>
      Shigella spp., including S. dysenteriae, are common waterborne pathogenic agents, causing bacillary dysentery as well as bacteremia and pneumonia.
      <br/>
      In the United States and Canada, S. sonnei and S. flexneri have become the most common etiological agents in bacillary dysentery.
    </p>
    <p num="354">
      Bacteria of the genus Yersinia are also pathogens which may be treated by the subject compositions. Y. Enterocolitica, for example, is an enteric pathogen.
      <br/>
      Infection with this microorganism causes severe diarrhea, gastroenteritis and other types of infections such as bacteremia, peritonitis, cholecystis, visceral abscesses, and mesenteric lymphadenitis.
      <br/>
      Septicemia with 50% mortality has been reported. Y. pestis is the etiologic agent of bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic plague in humans.
    </p>
    <p num="355">The subject compositions can be used for sterilization of surfaces such as countertops, surgical instruments, bandages, and skin; as pharmaceutical compositions, including by way of example creams, lotions, ointments, or solutions for external application to skin and mucosal surfaces, including the cornea, dermal cuts and abrasions, bums, and sites of bacterial or fungal infection; as pharmaceutical compositions, including by way of example creams, lotions, ointments, emulsions, liposome dispersions, tablets, or solutions, for administration to internal mucosal surfaces such as the oral cavity or vagina to inhibit the growth of bacteria (or other microorganisms); and as pharmaceutical compositions such as creams, gels, or ointments for coating indwelling invasive devices such as intravenous lines and catheters and similar implants which are susceptible to harboring bacteria.</p>

      The preparation of many related compounds in a single reaction greatly reduces the number of purification steps associated with the synthesizing the compounds, and also enables the initial screening of many compounds simultaneously.

      Accordingly, a variety of libraries on the order of about 16 to 1,000,000 or more compounds (so-called "diversomers") can be synthesized and screened for a particular activity or property.

    <p num="410">

      PCT publication WO 94/08051, e.g., being linked to a polymer bead by a hydrolyzable or photolyzable group, e.g., located at one of the positions of substrate.
      <br/>
      According to the Still et al. technique, the library is synthesized on a set of beads, each bead including a set of tags identifying the particular diversomer on that bead.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, which is particularly suitable for discovering enzyme inhibitors, the beads can be dispersed on the surface of a permeable membrane, and the diversomers released from the beads by lysis of the bead linker.
      <br/>
      The diversomer from each bead will diffuse across the membrane to an assay zone, where it will interact with an enzyme assay.
      <br/>
      Detailed descriptions of a number of combinatorial methodologies are provided below.
    </p>
    <p num="411">A) Direct Characterization</p>
    <p num="412">
      A growing trend in the field of combinatorial chemistry is to exploit the sensitivity of techniques such as mass spectrometry (MS), e.g., which can be used to characterize sub-femtomolar amounts of a compound, and to directly determine the chemical constitution of a compound selected from a combinatorial library.
      <br/>
      For instance, where the library is provided on an insoluble support matrix, discrete populations of compounds can be first released from the support and characterized by MS.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, as part of the MS sample preparation technique, such MS techniques as MALDI can be used to release a compound from the matrix, particularly where a labile bond is used originally to tether the compound to the matrix.
      <br/>
      For instance, a bead selected from a library can be irradiated in a MALDI step in order to release the diversomer from the matrix, and ionize the diversomer for MS analysis.
    </p>
    <p num="413">B) Multipin Synthesis</p>
    <p num="414">
      The libraries of the subject method can take the multipin library format.
      <br/>
      Briefly, Geysen and co-workers (Geysen et al. (1984) PNAS 81:3998-4002) introduced a method for generating compound libraries by a parallel synthesis on polyacrylic acid-grated polyethylene pins arrayed in the microtitre plate format.
      <br/>
      The Geysen technique can be used to synthesize and screen thousands of compounds per week using the multipin method, and the tethered compounds may be reused in many assays.
      <br/>
      Appropriate linker moieties can also been appended to the pins so that the compounds may be cleaved from the supports after synthesis for assessment of purity and further evaluation (c.f., Bray et al. (1990) Tetrahedron Lett 31:5811-5814; Valerio et al. (1991) Anal Biochem 197:168-177; Bray et al. (1991) Tetrahedron Lett 32:6163-6166).
    </p>
    <p num="415">C) Divide-Couple-Recombine</p>
    <p num="416">
      In yet another embodiment, a variegated library of compounds can be provided on a set of beads utilizing the strategy of divide-couple-recombine (see, e.g., Houghten (1985) PNAS 82:5131-5135; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,631,211; 5,440,016; 5,480,971).
      <br/>
      Briefly, as the name implies, at each synthesis step where degeneracy is introduced into the library, the beads are divided into separate groups equal to the number of different substituents to be added at a particular position in the library, the different substituents coupled in separate reactions, and the beads recombined into one pool for the next iteration.
    </p>
    <p num="417">
      In one embodiment, the divide-couple-recombine strategy can be carried out using an analogous approach to the so-called "tea bag" method first developed by Houghten, where compound synthesis occurs on resin sealed inside porous polypropylene bags (Houghten et al. (1986) PNAS 82:5131-5135).
      <br/>
      Substituents are coupled to the compound-bearing resins by placing the bags in appropriate reaction solutions, while all common steps such as resin washing and deprotection are performed simultaneously in one reaction vessel.
      <br/>
      At the end of the synthesis, each bag contains a single compound.
    </p>
    <p num="418">D) Combinatorial Libraries by Light-Directed, Spatially Addressable Parallel Chemical Synthesis</p>
    <p num="419">
      A scheme of combinatorial synthesis in which the identity of a compound is given by its locations on a synthesis substrate is termed a spatially-addressable synthesis.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the combinatorial process is carried out by controlling the addition of a chemical reagent to specific locations on a solid support (Dower et al. (1991) Annu Rep Med Chem 26:271-280; Fodor, S.P.A. (1991) Science 251:767; Pirrung et al. (1992) U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854; Jacobs et al. (1994) Trends Biotechnol 12:19-26).
      <br/>
      The spatial resolution of photolithography affords miniaturization.
      <br/>
      This technique can be carried out through the use protection/deprotection reactions with photolabile protecting groups.
    </p>
    <p num="420">
      The key points of this technology are illustrated in Gallop et al. (1994) J Med Chem 37:1233-1251.
      <br/>
      A synthesis substrate is prepared for coupling through the covalent attachment of photolabile nitroveratryloxycarbonyl (NVOC) protected amino linkers or other photolabile linkers.
      <br/>
      Light is used to selectively activate a specified region of the synthesis support for coupling.
      <br/>
      Removal of the photolabile protecting groups by light (deprotection) results in activation of selected areas.
      <br/>
      After activation, the first of a set of amino acid analogs, each bearing a photolabile protecting group on the amino terminus, is exposed to the entire surface.
      <br/>
      Coupling only occurs in regions that were addressed by light in the preceding step.
      <br/>
      The reaction is stopped, the plates washed, and the substrate is again illuminated through a second mask, activating a different region for reaction with a second protected building block.
      <br/>
      The pattern of masks and the sequence of reactants define the products and their locations.
      <br/>
      Since this process utilizes photolithography techniques, the number of compounds that can be synthesized is limited only by the number of synthesis sites that can be addressed with appropriate resolution.
      <br/>
      The position of each compound is precisely known; hence, its interactions with other molecules can be directly assessed.
    </p>
    <p num="421">
      In a light-directed chemical synthesis, the products depend on the pattern of illumination and on the order of addition of reactants.
      <br/>
      By varying the lithographic patterns, many different sets of test compounds can be synthesized simultaneously; this characteristic leads to the generation of many different masking strategies.

    <p num="422">E) Encoded Combinatorial Libraries</p>
    <p num="423">
      In yet another embodiment, the subject method utilizes a compound library provided with an encoded tagging system.
      <br/>
      A recent improvement in the identification of active compounds from combinatorial libraries employs chemical indexing systems using tags that uniquely encode the reaction steps a given bead has undergone and, by inference, the structure it carries.
      <br/>
      Conceptually, this approach mimics phage display libraries, where activity derives from expressed peptides, but the structures of the active peptides are deduced from the corresponding genomic DNA sequence.
      <br/>
      The first encoding of synthetic combinatorial libraries employed DNA as the code.
      <br/>
      A variety of other forms of encoding have been reported, including encoding with sequenceable bio-oligomers (e.g., oligonucleotides and peptides), and binary encoding with additional non-sequenceable tags.
    </p>
    <p num="424">1) Tagging with Sequenceable Bio-oligomers</p>
    <p num="425">
      The principle of using oligonucleotides to encode combinatorial synthetic libraries was described in 1992 (Brenner et al. (1992) PNAS 89:5381-5383), and an example of such a library appeared the following year (Needles et al. (1993) PNAS 90:10700-10704).
      <br/>
      A combinatorial library of nominally 77 (=823,543) peptides composed of all combinations of Arg, Gln, Phe, Lys, Val, D-Val and Thr (three-letter amino acid code), each of which was encoded by a specific dinucleotide (TA, TC, CT, AT, TT, CA and AC, respectively), was prepared by a series of alternating rounds of peptide and oligonucleotide synthesis on solid support.
      <br/>
      In this work, the amine linking functionality on the bead was specifically differentiated toward peptide or oligonucleotide synthesis by simultaneously preincubating the beads with reagents that generate protected OH groups for oligonucleotide synthesis and protected NH2 groups for peptide synthesis (here, in a ratio of 1:20).
      <br/>
      When complete, the tags each consisted of 69-mers, 14 units of which carried the code.
      <br/>
      The bead-bound library was incubated with a fluorescently labeled antibody, and beads containing bound antibody that fluoresced strongly were harvested by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).
      <br/>
      The DNA tags were amplified by PCR and sequenced, and the predicted peptides were synthesized.
      <br/>
      Following such techniques, compound libraries can be derived for use in the subject method, where the oligonucleotide sequence of the tag identifies the sequential combinatorial reactions that a particular bead underwent, and therefore provides the identity of the compound on the bead.
    </p>
    <p num="426">
      The use of oligonucleotide tags permits exquisitely sensitive tag analysis.
      <br/>
      Even so, the method requires careful choice of orthogonal sets of protecting groups required for alternating co-synthesis of the tag and the library member.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the chemical lability of the tag, particularly the phosphate and sugar anomeric linkages, may limit the choice of reagents and conditions that can be employed for the synthesis of non-oligomeric libraries.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, the libraries employ linkers permitting selective detachment of the test compound library member for assay.
    </p>
    <p num="427">
      Peptides have also been employed as tagging molecules for combinatorial libraries.
      <br/>
      Two exemplary approaches are described in the art, both of which employ branched linkers to solid phase upon which coding and ligand strands are alternately elaborated.
      <br/>
      In the first approach (Kerr J M et al. (1993) J Am Chem Soc 115:2529-2531), orthogonality in synthesis is achieved by employing acid-labile protection for the coding strand and base-labile protection for the compound strand.
    </p>
    <p num="428">
      In an alternative approach (Nikolaiev et al. (1993) Pept Res 6:161-170), branched linkers are employed so that the coding unit and the test compound can both be attached to the same functional group on the resin.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, a cleavable linker can be placed between the branch point and the bead so that cleavage releases a molecule containing both code and the compound (Ptek et al. (1991) Tetrahedron Lett 32:3891-3894).
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the cleavable linker can be placed so that the test compound can be selectively separated from the bead, leaving the code behind.
      <br/>
      This last construct is particularly valuable because it permits screening of the test compound without potential interference of the coding groups.
      <br/>
      Examples in the art of independent cleavage and sequencing of peptide library members and their corresponding tags has confirmed that the tags can accurately predict the peptide structure.
    </p>
    <p num="429">2) Non-sequenceable Tagging: Binary Encoding</p>
    <p num="430">
      An alternative form of encoding the test compound library employs a set of non-sequencable electrophoric tagging molecules that are used as a binary code (Ohlmeyer et al. (1993) PNAS 90:10922-10926).
      <br/>
      Exemplary tags are haloaromatic alkyl ethers that are detectable as their trimethylsilyl ethers at less than femtomolar levels by electron capture gas chromatography (ECGC).
      <br/>
      Variations in the length of the alkyl chain, as well as the nature and position of the aromatic halide substituents, permit the synthesis of at least 40 such tags, which in principle can encode 240 (e.g., upwards of 1012) different molecules.
      <br/>
      In the original report (Ohlmeyer et al., supra) the tags were bound to about 1% of the available amine groups of a peptide library via a photocleavable o-nitrobenzyl linker.
      <br/>
      This approach is convenient when preparing combinatorial libraries of peptide-like or other amine-containing molecules.
      <br/>
      A more versatile system has, however, been developed that permits encoding of essentially any combinatorial library.
      <br/>
      Here, the compound would be attached to the solid support via the photocleavable linker and the tag is attached through a catechol ether linker via carbene insertion into the bead matrix (Nestler et al. (1994) J Org Chem 59:4723-4724).
      <br/>
      This orthogonal attachment strategy permits the selective detachment of library members for assay in solution and subsequent decoding by ECGC after oxidative detachment of the tag sets.
    </p>
    <p num="431">
      Although several amide-linked libraries in the art employ binary encoding with the electrophoric tags attached to amine groups, attaching these tags directly to the bead matrix provides far greater versatility in the structures that can be prepared in encoded combinatorial libraries.
      <br/>
      Attached in this way, the tags and their linker are nearly as unreactive as the bead matrix itself.
      <br/>
      Two binary-encoded combinatorial libraries have been reported where the electrophoric tags are attached directly to the solid phase (Ohlmeyer et al. (1995) PNAS 92:6027-6031) and provide guidance for generating the subject compound library.
      <br/>
      Both libraries were constructed using an orthogonal attachment strategy in which the library member was linked to the solid support by a photolabile linker and the tags were attached through a linker cleavable only by vigorous oxidation.
      <br/>
      Because the library members can be repetitively partially photoeluted from the solid support, library members can be utilized in multiple assays.
      <br/>
      Successive photoelution also permits a very high throughput iterative screening strategy: first, multiple beads are placed in 96-well microtiter plates; second, compounds are partially detached and transferred to assay plates; third, a metal binding assay identifies the active wells; fourth, the corresponding beads are rearrayed singly into new microtiter plates; fifth, single active compounds are identified; and sixth, the structures are decoded.
