    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates in general to telecommunications networks and more particularly to a grooming device and method for consolidating information onto a minimum number of output links.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Frame relay service providers, as well as asynchronous transfer mode service providers, require a sufficient number of ports in order to provide frame relay, and asynchronous transfer mode, services.
      <br/>
      However, these ports are extremely expensive to obtain compared to ports for a conventional cross-connect systems.
      <br/>
      Further, time division multiplexed links that provide access to frame relay services are extremely under-utilized due to the bursty nature of the information being transferred.
      <br/>
      The frame relay traffic is carried on fully allocated digital circuits such as DS-0, n * DS-0, Ti, E1, T3, E3, et al.
      <br/>
      As a result, the variable bit rate characteristic of the frame relay traffic is not effectively exploited.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is desirable to improve the efficiency of frame relay traffic transfer that would reduce the number of frame relay or asynchronous transfer mode ports required by the service provider.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      From the foregoing, it may be appreciated that a need has arisen for an effective technique for transferring frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode traffic in order to reduce the number of ports required in handling this traffic.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the present invention, a system, device, and method for consolidating information onto a minimum number of output links are provided that substantially reduce or eliminate disadvantages and problems associated with conventional frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode traffic transfer and processing.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a digital cross-connect system that includes an input port operable to receive digital signal level zero telecommunications signals from a plurality of input ports.
      <br/>
      The digital signal level zero telecommunications signals are consolidated into a minimum number of digital signal level one telecommunications signals by a cross-connect matrix.
      <br/>
      A frame groomer identifies frame relay traffic in the digital signal level zero telecommunications signals and consolidates the frame relay traffic into a minimum number of digital signal level zero telecommunications signals.
      <br/>
      An output port transfers the digital signal level one telecommunications signals carrying the consolidated frame relay traffic onto an output link. (Complete according to claim 1 to be done).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention provides various technical advantages over conventional frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode traffic transfer and processing techniques.
      <br/>
      For example, one technical advantage is to consolidate frame relay or asynchronous transfer mode traffic onto preferably a single output link.
      <br/>
      Another technical advantage is to reduce the number of ports required to receive and transfer frame relay or asynchronous transfer mode traffic.
      <br/>
      Yet another technical advantage is to select frames from a plurality of input links for placement onto a consolidated output link.
      <br/>
      Other technical advantages are readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, description, and claims.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a digital cross-connect system 10 within a telecommunications network 12.
      <br/>
      Telecommunications network 12 preferably provides a frame relay permanent virtual connection exchange service.
      <br/>
      In a frame relay permanent virtual connection service, variable length frames are relayed from the source to the desired destination by means of permanent virtual connections.
      <br/>
      Each frame is addressed by a unique data link connection identifier which is associated with a particular permanent virtual connection connecting two end systems.
      <br/>
      Permanent virtual connections that define the logical paths between endpoints in a customer's network are established at service subscription time through administrative procedures.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In the downstream direction, digital cross-connect system 10 receives individual DS-0 signals carried over T-1 links 14 and/or multiple DS-0 signals carried over FT-1 links 16 from frame relay assembly/disassembly devices 18 of frame relay customers 20.
      <br/>
      Digital cross-connect system 10 extracts the frames making up the frame relay traffic from the DS-0 signals and consolidates the frames by multiplexing them into DS-1 signals onto an output link 22 for transfer to an edge switch 24.
      <br/>
      In the upstream direction, digital cross-connect system 10 demultiplexes frames received within DS-1 signals transferred by edge switch 24 over output link 22.
      <br/>
      The frames are then placed into DS-0 signals for transfer to frame relay assembly/disassembly devices 18 of frame relay customers 20 over T-1 links 14 and/or FT-1 links 16.
      <br/>
      Administration procedures for defining consolidation and permanent virtual connections is determined by a service provider 26 through provisioning criteria programmed into a cross-connect manager 28 in response to digital link connection identifiers determined by a frame relay network manager 30.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      FIG. 2 shows an operation of a frame groomer 40 within digital cross-connect system 10.
      <br/>
      Digital cross-connect system 10 receives frame relay information carried in individual or multiple DS-0 signals over T-1 links 14 and/or FT-1 links 16 at TDM input ports 42.
      <br/>
      The DS-0 signals pass through TDM input ports 42 over an internal bus to a cross-connect matrix 44.
      <br/>
      Cross-connect matrix 44 consolidates the DS-0 signals into internal data bus format.
      <br/>
      DS-0 signals identified as carrying frame relay information are carried over the internal data bus to frame groomer 40.
      <br/>
      Frame groomer 40 uses frame relay virtual circuit parameters and frame parameters to extract frames from each DS-0 signal within the internal data bus.
      <br/>
      The extracted frames are consolidated onto a frame relay groomed consolidated circuit carried in the internal data that are returned to cross-connect matrix 44 over the internal bus.
      <br/>
      Cross-connect matrix 44 sends the internal data signals carrying the frame groomed consolidated circuit over the internal bus to TDM output ports 46.
      <br/>
      TDM output ports 46 transfer the DS-1 signals over T-1 links to edge switch 24.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      FIG. 3 shows an extension of frame groomer 40 to higher bandwidth capability.
      <br/>
      Once frame groomer 40 generates the frame relay consolidated circuit, DS-0 signals carrying the frame relay consolidated circuit are transferred over a high speed internal bus to a frame switch 48.
      <br/>
      Frame switch 48 places the DS-1 signals into DS-3 signals for transfer to the network through high bandwidth output ports 50.
      <br/>
      Frame switch 48 can also process frame relay information received at high bandwidth input ports 52 for transfer to the network through high bandwidth output ports 50 or through frame groomer 40 and digital cross-connect system 10.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      FIG. 4 shows the mapping performed by frame groomer 40 in consolidating frames of the frame relay information.
      <br/>
      During TDM provisioning on digital cross-connect system 10, frame groomer 40 through cross-connect manager 28 is provided information to identify physical circuits, such as T-1 links 14 and DS-0 signals, that carry frame relay traffic in and out of digital cross-connect system 10.
      <br/>
      During frame relay permanent virtual connection provisioning, frame groomer 40 receives standard frame relay control messages from edge switch 24 or by alternate network management connections that include data link connection identifier information associated with individual permanent virtual connections.
      <br/>
      Frame groomer 40 maps data link connection identifiers for edge switch 24 to data link connection identifiers for frame relay assembly/disassembly devices 18.
      <br/>
      Mapping and creation of data link connection identifiers is performed in frame groomer 40 through an internal mapping table.
      <br/>
      Table 1 shows an example of an internal mapping table for frame groomer 40.

      Using Table 1 as an example, frames 50 carried in DS-0 signals and each having their own DLCI 52 are received at digital cross-connect system 10 over input links 334, 380, and 393.
      <br/>
      The DS-0 signals from input links 334, 380, and 393 are consolidated into a DS-1 physical circuit 54 by cross-connect matrix 44.
      <br/>
      Logical circuits 56, each associated with one of the input links, within physical circuit 54 identified as carrying frame relay information are sent to frame groomer 40 over the internal bus of digital cross-connect system 10.
      <br/>
      Frame groomer 40 consolidates individual permanent virtual connections 58, each associated with a specific DLCI 52, from each logical circuit 56 and maps these individual permanent virtual connections 58 into permanent virtual connections 60 consolidated into a DS-0 logical circuit 62 associated with edge switch 24.
      <br/>
      DS-0 logical circuits 62 are placed into a DS-1 physical circuit 64 by frame groomer 40 and cross-connect matrix 44 for transfer to edge switch 24.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      During a congestion situation, frame groomer 40 will initiate congestion management procedures.
      <br/>
      Congestion occurs when the input frame traffic associated with one or a group of permanent virtual connections associated with an output link exceeds the capacity of the output link.
      <br/>
      Upon this occurrence, frame groomer 40 will discard frames according to a priority order pre-determined by network administration.
      <br/>
      Frame groomer 40 initially discards frames tagged as discard eligible.
      <br/>
      Each frame carries a flag that determines whether the particular frame has been pre-determined as being eligible for discard.
      <br/>
      Next, frame groomer 40 discards frames associated with permanent virtual connections that have a committed information bit rate value of zero with no peak rate.
      <br/>
      Next, frame groomer 40 discards frames associated with permanent virtual connections that are exceeding their pre-defined peak rate.
      <br/>
      Next, frame groomer 40 discards frames associated with permanent virtual connections that are exceeding their pre-defined committed information rate value.
      <br/>
      Upon discarding a frame, frame groomer 40 sends a far end congestion notification message per frame relay standards.
      <br/>
      For congestion situations occurring in the network beyond edge switch 24 and/or in frame relay assembler/disassembler devices 18, frame groomer 40 transparently passes far end and back end congestion notification messages without taking any further action on these messages.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      FIG. 5 shows an example of how consolidation is performed by digital cross-connect system 10.
      <br/>
      Digital cross-connect system 10 receives frame relay traffic from a plurality of time division multiplexed (TDM) circuit input links 70.
      <br/>
      Each TDM circuit input link 70 such as DS-0 signals carried over T-1 links 14 and FT-1 links 16, carries the frame relay traffic without being fully utilized.
      <br/>
      The bursty nature of the frame relay traffic controls the transfer rate and occupancy of the TDM circuit links.
      <br/>
      Digital cross-connect system 10, through frame groomer 40, accumulates the frame relay traffic from multiple TDM circuit input links for placement onto as few as one TDM circuit output link 72.
      <br/>
      TDM circuit output link 72 improves the efficiency of the under-utilized TDM circuit output links 70 by consolidating their frame relay traffic for improved circuit link utilization.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Thus, it is apparent that there has been provided, in accordance with the present invention, a system, device, and method for consolidating frame information on a minimum number of output links that satisfy the advantages set forth above.
      <br/>
      Although the present invention has been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions, and alterations can be made herein.
      <br/>
      For example, though discussed in terms of frame relay information, the present invention can equally be incorporated into an asynchronous transfer mode system in order to consolidate asynchronous transfer mode cells received from multiple links for transfer onto as few as a single link.
      <br/>
      Other examples are readily ascertainable by one skilled in the art and can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims.
