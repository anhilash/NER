    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to novel methods and devices for iontophoretically administering therapeutic doses of integrin receptor antagonists in a controlled manner through the skin.
      <br/>
      Such integrin receptor antagonists include but are not limited to antagonists of the IIb/IIa and  ALPHA v BETA 3 integrins and related cell surface adhesive protein receptors.
      <br/>
      The present invention includes iontophoretic delivery devices comprising integrin inhibitors.
      <br/>
      Such methods and devices are useful, alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents, for the treatment of thromboembolic disorders, angiogenic disorders, inflammation, bone degradation, cancer metastasis, diabetic retinopathy, restenosis, macular degeneration, and other conditions mediated by cell adhesion and/or cell migration and/or angiogenesis.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      A number of cell surface receptor proteins, referred to as integrins, have been identified which bind to extracellular matrix ligands or other cell adhesion protein ligands thereby mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion processes.
      <br/>
      The integrins are encoded by genes belonging to a gene superfamily and are composed of heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins containing  ALPHA - and  BETA -subunits.
      <br/>
      Integrin subfamilies contain a common  BETA -subunit combined with different  ALPHA -subunits to form adhesion protein receptors with different specificities.
      <br/>
      The genes for at least eight distinct  BETA -subunits have been cloned and sequenced to date.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The integrin glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa or IIb/IIIa), also referred to as the fibrinogen receptor, is the membrane protein mediating platelet aggregation.
      <br/>
      IIb/IIIa in activated platelets is known to bind four soluble RGD-containing adhesive proteins, namely fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, and vitronectin. "RGD" refers to the amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp.
      <br/>
      The binding of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor to IIb/IIIa causes platelets to aggregate.
      <br/>
      The binding of fibrinogen is mediated in part by the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) recognition sequence which is common to the adhesive proteins that bind IIb/IIIa.
      <br/>
      RGD-peptidomimetic IIb/IIIa antagonist compounds are known to block fibrinogen binding and prevent platelet aggregation and the formation of platelet thrombi.
      <br/>
      IIb/IIIa antagonists represent an important new approach for antiplatelet therapy for the treatment of thromboembolic disorders.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In addition to IIb/IIIa, a number of other integrin cell surface receptors have been identified.
      <br/>
      For example, members of the  BETA 1 subfamily,  ALPHA 4 BETA 1 and  ALPHA 5 BETA 1, have been implicated in various inflammatory processes, including rheumatoid arthritis.
      <br/>
      In addition, studies with monoclonal anti- ALPHA 4 antibodies provide evidence that  ALPHA 4/ BETA 1 may additionally have a role in allergy, asthma, and autoimmune disorders.
      <br/>
      Anti- ALPHA 4 antibodies block the migration of leukocytes to the site of inflammation.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The  ALPHA v BETA 3 integrin, also referred to as the vitronectin receptor, is a heterodimer and is a member of the  BETA 3 integrin subfamily.
      <br/>
      The  ALPHA v BETA 3 integrin is found on platelets, endothelial cells, melanoma cells, smooth muscle cells, and osteoclasts.
      <br/>
      Like the integrin IIb/IIIa, the  ALPHA v BETA 3 integrin binds a variety of RGD-containing adhesive proteins such as vitronectin, fibronectin, von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, osteopontin, bone sialo protein II and thrombosponden in a manner mediated by the RGD sequence.
      <br/>
      Thus,  ALPHA v BETA 3 acts as the endothelial cell, fibroblast, and smooth muscle cell receptor for adhesive proteins including von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen (fibrin), vitronectin, thrombospondin, and osteopontin.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The integrin  ALPHA v BETA 3 allows endothelial cells to interact with a wide variety of extracellular matrix components.
      <br/>
      These adhesive interactions are considered to be important for angiogenesis since vascular cells must ultimately be capable of invading virtually all tissues.
      <br/>
      Integrin  ALPHA v BETA 3 is involved in bone resorption since a key event in bone resorption is the adhesion of osteoclasts to the matrix of bone.
      <br/>
      During endothelium injury, the basement membrane zones of blood vessels express several adhesive proteins, including von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, and fibrin.
      <br/>
      Additionally, several members of the integrin family of adhesion protein receptors are expressed on the surface of endothelial, smooth muscle and on other circulating cells.
      <br/>
      Among these integrins is  ALPHA v BETA 3.
      <br/>
      These integrins initiate a calcium-dependent signaling pathway that can lead to endothelial cell, smooth muscle cell migration and, therefore, may play a fundamental role in vascular cell biology.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Inhibitors of  ALPHA v BETA 3 integrin have been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and are recognized as being useful as therapeutic agents for the treatment of human diseases such as cancer, restenosis, thromoembolic disorders, rheumatoid arthritis and ocular vasculopathies.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The use of iontophoresis, also referred to as electrotransport, in drug delivery is well known.
      <br/>
      The iontophoresis process has been found to be useful in the transdermal administration of therapeutic drugs including lidocaine hydrochloride, hydrocortisone, fluoride, penicillin, dexamethasone sodium phosphate, insulin and other drugs.
      <br/>
      A common use of iontophoresis is in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis by delivering pilocarpine salts iontophoretically, where the pilocarpine stimulates sweat production and the sweat is collected and analyzed for its chloride content to detect the presence of the disease.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The present invention provides novel methods and devices for iontophoretically administering therapeutic doses of integrin receptor antagonists in a controlled manner through the skin.
      <br/>
      Such integrin receptor antagonists include but are not limited to antagonists of the IIb/IIIa and  ALPHA v BETA 3 integrins and related cell surface adhesive protein receptors.
      <br/>
      The present invention includes iontophoretic delivery devices comprising integrin inhibitors.
      <br/>
      Such methods and devices are useful, alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents, for the treatment of thromboembolic disorders, angiogenic disorders, inflammation, bone degradation, cancer metastasis, diabetic retinopathy, restenosis, macular degeneration, and other conditions mediated by cell adhesion and/or cell migration and/or angiogenesis.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The present invention provides novel methods of delivery of therapeutic compounds which bind to integrin proteins thereby altering cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion processes.
      <br/>
      Such compounds, referred to herein as "integrin inhibitors" or "integrin antagonists", act as inhibitors of the binding of the integrin protein to endogenous protein ligands of such integrin.
      <br/>
      Preferred integrin inhibitors used in the present invention are RGD-peptidomimetic compounds.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term "RGD-peptidomimetic compounds" refers to chemical compounds which bind to the RGD-binding region of the integrin and which block RGD-mediated binding of one or more adhesive proteins to such integrin.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The present invention provides a means for the controlled and continuous delivery of integrin antagonists through skin using an iontophoretic transdermal delivery device.
      <br/>
      The present invention further provides a means for attaining consistent plasma concentrations of integrin antagonists and for controlling their pharmacologic and toxic effects.
      <br/>
      The method of the present invention for delivering integrin receptor antagonists transdermally utilizes an iontophoretic transdermal drug delivery device or apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      As used herein, the term "iontophoretic device" or "iontophoretic patch" or "patch" refers to a device or apparatus suitable for the transdermal iontophoretic delivery of therapeutic levels of a compound to a subject.
      <br/>
      Such iontophoretic devices are well known in the art and are also referred to as "iontophoresis devices" or "electrotransport devices".
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The present invention provides methods of integrin inhibitor drug delivery which provides controlled, continuous delivery of the drug at a relatively low rate.
      <br/>
      Such controlled, continuous delivery of the integrin inhibitor ensures relatively constant plasma concentrations and control of pharmacologic and toxic drug effects.
      <br/>
      This is particularly desirable for drugs having steep dose versus response profiles, for which there are relatively small differences between ineffective, therapeutic, and toxic plasma concentrations or doses.
      <br/>
      Transdermal iontophoretic delivery provides a means of controlled, continuous drug delivery and avoids the uncertainties of oral administration and the inconvenience and discomfort of administration by injection.
      <br/>
      In addition, iontophoresis transdermal delivery methods are used in the present invention since generally the integrin inhibitor compounds do not passively diffuse through skin at rates sufficient for delivering therapeutic doses and the skin is especially impermeable to polar and ionic drugs.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The iontophoretic drug delivery device used in the present invention comprises a power source for generation of an electrical current and two electrode compartments that when adhering to the skin of a subject will pass a generated electrical current through the skin.
      <br/>
      In the presence of the electrical current the passage through the skin of the integrin antagonist, which is contained in one of the electrode compartments, is enhanced.
      <br/>
      As is appreciated by one of skill in the art of iontophoresis drug delivery, the rate of transdermal delivery of the integrin antagonist in accordance with the present invention can be controlled by selection of the patch design, including the selection of the contents of the electrode compartments, the surface area of the patch, and by the strength of the generated electrical current.
    </p>
    <p num="18">One embodiment of the present invention provides for an iontophoretic device comprising:</p>
    <p num="19">
      (a) a current distributing member;
      <br/>
      (b) an agent reservoir containing an ionized or ionizable substance, in electrical communication with the current distributing member and adapted to be placed in ionic communication with the epithelial surface, wherein the ionized or ionizable substance is an integrin inhibitor compound;
      <br/>
      (c) an electrolyte reservoir containing an electrolyte, in electrical communication with an indifferent electrode and in ionic communication with an epithelial surface;
      <br/>
      (d) an electrical power source in current delivering connection with the current distribution member and the electrolyte reservoir.
    </p>
    <p num="20">This device is capable of delivering an amount of cell adhesion molecules to a patient over a period of time which provides a therapeutic concentration of cell adhesion molecules capable of inhibiting platelet aggregation.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Another embodiment of the present invention is a method of non-invasively administrating a therapeutic concentration of cell adhesion molecules to a patient.
      <br/>
      Cell adhesion molecules are iontophoretically passed through a predetermined area of skin of the patient, wherein such therapeutic concentration of cell adhesion molecules is capable of inhibiting platelet aggregation.

Nos., the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference: 3,991,755; 4,141,359; 4,250,878; 4,395,545; 4,744,787; 4,747,819; 4,927,408; 5,080,646; 5,084,006; 5,125,894; 5,135,477; 5,135,480; 5,147,296; 5,147,297; 5,158,537; 5,162,042; 5,162,043; 5,167,616; 5,169,382; 5,169,383; 5,415,628; 5,203,768; 5,207,752; 5,221,254; 5,232,438; 5,234,992; 5,240,995; 5,246,417; 5,288,389; 5,298,017; 5,310,404; 5,312,326; 5,314,502; 5,320,598; 5,322,502; 5,326,341; 5,344,394; 5,374,242; 5,380,271; 5,385,543; 5,387,189; 5,395,310; 5,403,275; 5,405,317; 5,415,628; 5,423,739; 5,443,442; 5,445,606; 5,445,609; 5,464,387; 5,466,217; 4,950,229; 5,246,418; 5,256,137; 5,284,471; 5,302,172; 5,306,235; 5,310,403; 5,320,597; 5,458,569; 5,498,235; 4,557,723; 4,713,050; 4,865,582; 4,752,285; 5,087,242; 5,236,412; 5,281,287.</p>
    <p num="23">
      In general, at least two electrodes are used in the iontophoretic device.
      <br/>
      Both of these electrodes are disposed so as to be in intimate electrical contact with some portion of the skin of the body.
      <br/>
      One electrode, called the active or donor electrode, is the electrode from which the ionic integrin inhibitor drug precursor or drug is delivered into the body by iontophoresis.
      <br/>
      The other electrode, called the counter or return or indifferent electrode, serves to close the electrical circuit through the body.
      <br/>
      In conjunction with the patient's skin contacted by the electrodes, the circuit is completed by connection of the electrodes to a source of electrical energy, for example, a battery.
      <br/>
      If the integrin inhibitor to be delivered into the body is positively charged (i.e., a cation), then the anode will be the active electrode and the cathode will serve to complete the circuit.
      <br/>
      If the integrin inhibitor to be delivered is negatively charged (i.e., an anion), then the cathode will be the active electrode and the anode will be the counter electrode.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Alternatively, both the anode and cathode may be used to deliver drugs of opposite charge into the body.
      <br/>
      In such a case, both electrodes are considered to be active or donor electrodes.
      <br/>
      For example, the anode can deliver a positively charged ionic substance into the body while the cathode can deliver a negatively charged ionic substance into the body.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Iontophoretic delivery devices can also be used to deliver an uncharged drug into the body.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished by a process called electroosmosis.
      <br/>
      Electroosmosis is the transdermal flux of a liquid solvent (e.g., the liquid solvent containing the uncharged drug or agent) which is induced by the presence of an electric field imposed across the skin by the donor electrode.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The iontophoresis device includes a drug or agent reservoir or source of the integrin inhibitor drug (which is preferably an ionized or ionizable form of the drug or a precursor of such drug) to be iontophoretically delivered or introduced into the body.
      <br/>
      Such drug reservoir is electrically connected to the anode or the cathode of the iontophoresis device to provide a fixed or renewable source of one or more desired integrin inhibitors.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      A variety of iontophoresis patch designs may be suitably used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, iontophoretic delivery devices have been developed in which the donor and counter electrode assemblies have a "multi-laminate" construction.
      <br/>
      In these devices, the donor and counter electrode assemblies are each formed by multiple layers of usually polymeric matrices.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,731,049 discloses a donor electrode assembly having a hydrophilic polymer based electrolyte reservoir and drug reservoir layers, a skin-contacting hydrogel layer, and optionally one or more semipermeable membrane layers. U.S. Pat. No. 4,474,570 discloses an iontophoresis device wherein the electrode assemblies include a conductive resin film electrode layer, a hydrophilic gel reservoir layer, and aluminum foil conductor layer and an insulating backing layer.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The drug and electrolyte reservoir layers of the iontophoretic delivery device may be, for example, formed of hydrophilic polymers, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,474,570, 4,383,529, 4,764,164.
      <br/>
      Hydrophilic polymers may be desired since water is the preferred solvent for ionizing many drug salts, and hydrophilic polymer components of the drug reservoir in the donor electrode and the electrolyte reservoir in the counter electrode can be hydrated in situ while attached to the body by absorbing water from the skin through transepidermal water loss or sweat or from a mucosal membrane by absorbing saliva in the case of oral mucosal membranes.
      <br/>
      Once hydrated, the device begins to deliver ionized agent to the body.
      <br/>
      This enables the drug reservoir to be manufactured in a dry state, giving the device a longer shelf life.
      <br/>
      Hydrogels have been particularly favored for use as the drug reservoir matrix and electrolyte reservoir matrix in iontophoretic delivery devices, in part due to their high equilibrium water content and their ability to quickly absorb water.
      <br/>
      In addition, hydrogels tend to have good biocompatibility with the skin and with mucosal membranes.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The present invention provides improved methods for the delivery of integrin antagonists.
      <br/>
      Preferred in the present invention are inhibitors of the IIb/IIIa integrin and inhibitors of the  ALPHA v BETA 3 integrin.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Inhibitors of the integrin IIb/IIIa useful as therapeutic antithrombotic agents.
      <br/>
      IIb/IIIa antagonists bind to IIb/IIIa on the membrane of platelets.
      <br/>
      By binding to IIb/IIIa these agents prevent platelets from aggregating.
      <br/>
      Platelet aggregation is associated with various cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders, including unstable angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, and atherosclerosis.
      <br/>
      IIb/IIIa antagonists are useful in preventing platelet aggregation and thrombosis, and for the treatment, including prevention, of various cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      IIb/IIa antagonists have been found to have relatively steep dose versus response profiles.
      <br/>
      Thus, within a relatively narrow range of plasma concentrations, the effect of a IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist could vary from no anticoagulant effect, to partial inhibition of platelet aggregation, to excessive prolongation of coagulation.
      <br/>
      In addition, IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists may have relatively low to modest or variable oral bioavailability.
      <br/>
      Low and variable oral bioavailability may be associated with variability in plasma concentrations and poor control of pharmacologic and toxic responses.
      <br/>
      The controlled iontophoretic transdermal delivery methods of the present invention, provide methods for administering a IIb/IIIa antagonist at a constant, relatively low rate, thereby to provide plasma concentrations and effects that do not vary excessively with time or from patient-to-patient, and provide therapeutic advantages over methods of drug delivery that produce variable plasma concentrations and effects.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Another preferred aspect of this invention provides iontophoresis methods of pharmaceutical delivery of compounds which are antagonists of the  ALPHA v BETA 3 integrin.
      <br/>

      When any variable (for example but not limited to, R2, R4, R6, R7, R8, R12,and R14, n, etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent or in any formula, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-2 R4, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to two R4 and R4 at each occurrence is selected independently from the defined list of possible R4.

    <p num="78">The iontophoretic device useful in the present invention may, by way of example and not limitation, include the following component and materials.</p>
    <p num="79">A. Current Distributing Member/Active Electrode</p>
    <p num="80">
      The iontophoretic electrode of the invention includes a current distributing member which conveys electrical current into the iontophoretic reservoirs for the delivery of an ionized substance.
      <br/>
      The current distributing member is constructed of any of a large variety of electrically conductive materials, including both inert and sacrificial materials.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      Inert conductive materials are those electrically conductive materials which, when employed in the iontophoretic devices of the invention, do not themselves undergo or participate in electrochemical reactions.
      <br/>
      Thus, an inert material distributes without being eroded or depleted due to the distribution of current, and conducts current through the generating hydronium or hydroxyl ions by, respectively, either reduction or oxidation of water.
      <br/>
      Inert conductive materials typically include, for example, stainless steel, platinum, gold, and carbon or graphite.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Alternatively, the current distributing member may be constructed from a sacrificial conductive material.
      <br/>
      A material may be considered sacrificial if, when employed as an electrode in an iontophoretic device of the invention, material is eroded or depleted due to its oxidation or reduction.
      <br/>
      Such erosion or depletion occurs when the materials and formulations used in the iontophoresis device enable a specific electrochemical reaction, such as when a silver electrode is used with a formulation containing chloride ions.
      <br/>
      In this situation, the current distributing member would not cause electrolysis of water, but would itself be oxidized or reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Typically, for anodes, a sacrificial material would include an oxidizable metal such as silver, zinc, copper, etc.
      <br/>
      In contrast to the hydroxyl and hydronium ions electrochemically generated via an inert material, the ions electrochemically generated via a sacrificial material would include metal cations resulting from oxidation of the metal.
      <br/>
      Metal/metal salt anodes may also be employed.
      <br/>
      In such cases, the metal would oxidize to metal ions, which would then be precipitated as an insoluble salt.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      For cathodes, the current distributing member may be constructed from any electrically conductive material provided an appropriate electrolyte formulation is provided.
      <br/>
      For example, the cathodic current distributing member may be constructed from a metal/metal salt material.
      <br/>
      A preferred cathodic material is a silver/silver halide material.
      <br/>
      In such embodiments, a metal halide salt is preferably employed as the electrolyte.
      <br/>
      In this case, the device would electrochemically generate halide ions from the electrode as the metal is reduced.
      <br/>
      Also, accompanying silver ions in a formulation would be reduced to silver metal and would deposit (plate) onto the electrode.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the cathode material may be an intercalation material, an amalgam, or other material which can take electrolyte cations such as sodium out of solution, below the reduction potential of water.
      <br/>
      In addition, other materials may be used which permit the plating out of a metal from the appropriate eletrolyte solution.
      <br/>
      Thus, metals such as silver, copper, zinc, and nickel, and other materials, such as carbon, may be employed when an appropriate metal salt such as silver nitrate or zinc sulfate is in solution in the electrolyte reservoir.
      <br/>
      While such materials may develop increased resistivity as a metal plates out during use, they are not eroded or depleted during use as cathodic current distributing members.
      <br/>
      They are therefore not strictly "sacrificial" in this context.
      <br/>
      Nonetheless, the term sacrificial encompasses such materials and is intended to include materials that undergo physical and/or chemical changes during iontophoresis.
    </p>
    <p num="85">The current distributing member may take any form known in the art, such as the form of a plate, foil layer, screen, wire, or dispersion of conductive particles embedded in a conductive matrix.</p>
    <p num="86">B. The Electrolyte Reservoir</p>
    <p num="87">
      In the iontophoretic devices of the invention, an electrolyte reservoir is arranged in electrical communication with a current distributing member.
      <br/>
      Typically, electrical communication requires that electrons from the current distributing member are exchanged with ions in the electrolyte reservoir upon the application of electrical current.
      <br/>
      Such electrical communication is preferably not impeded to any excessive degree by any intervening material(s) used in the construction of the iontophoretic device.
      <br/>
      In other words, the resistivity of the interface is preferably low.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      The electrolyte reservoir comprises at least one electrolyte, i.e., an ionic or ionizable component which can act to conduct current toward or away from the current distributing member.
      <br/>
      Typically, the electrolyte comprises one or more mobile ions, the selection of which is dependent upon the desired application.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable electrolytes include aqueous solutions of salts.
      <br/>
      A preferred electrolyte is an aqueous solution of NaCl, having a concentration of less than 1 mole/liter (&lt;1 mM), more preferably at about physiological concentration.
      <br/>
      Other electrolytes include salts of physiological ions including, but not limited to, potassium, chloride, and phosphate.
      <br/>
      The salt and its concentration may be selected as desired for particular applications.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      Other chemical species may be selected by the skilled artisan for inclusion in the electrolyte reservoir.
      <br/>
      Such other reservoir species include, without limitation, chelation agents (e.g., citrate ions, EDTA) surfactants (e.g., non-ionic, cationic, or anionic), buffers, ionic excipients, osmolarity adjusters (e.g., polyethylene glycols, sugars), ionic antibiotics, penetration enhancers (e.g., alkanols), stabilizers, enzyme inhibitors, preservatives, thickening agents (e.g., acrylic acids, cellulosic resins, clays), and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      Alternatively, the electrolyte may comprise a material which is itself relatively immobile in the absence of an electric field, but which acts to deliver mobile ions in the presence of an electric field.
      <br/>
      In the latter case, the electrolyte may more properly be termed an "ion source." Examples of ion sources according to the invention include polyelectrolytes, ion exchange membranes and resins, non-ionic buffers which become ionic upon pH change, and other known ion sources.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      Alternatively, the electrolyte reservoir may contain counterions that form a soluble salt with an electrochemically generated ion.
      <br/>
      For example, in an apparatus employing a silver anodal current distributing member, a suitable counterion might be acetate or nitrate.
      <br/>
      Such counterions are useful when other means are provided for sequestering electrochemically generated ions.
    </p>
    <p num="92">Thus, the electrolyte reservoir can provide at least one ion of the same charge as the electrochemically generated ion, to permit current to be conducted, and at least one oppositely charged ion.</p>
    <p num="93">C. Agent Reservoir</p>
    <p num="94">
      The reservoir structure of the iontophoretic apparatus of the invention further includes an agent reservoir.
      <br/>
      The agent reservoir must be capable of ionic communication with an epithelial surface and is in electrical communication with the anode or cathode of the iontophoresis device.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      The construction of the ionized substance reservoir must be consistent with the requirements for ionic communication with the epithelial surface and electrical communication with current distribution member.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the structure of the ionized substance reservoir would vary, depending upon the desired application.
      <br/>
      The ionized substance reservoir may include a liquid, semi-liquid, semi-solid, or solid material.
      <br/>
      With a flowable material, the ionized substance reservoir preferably further comprises means for at least substantially inhibiting the flow of the contents out of the reservoir preferably further comprises means for at least substantially inhibiting the flow of the contents out of the reservoir.
      <br/>
      In such situations, the flow of the contents is desirably minimized when the device is in storage.
      <br/>
      For example, a membrane may be deployed to surround the contents of the ionized substance reservoir.
      <br/>
      In certain situations the flow of the contents of the reservoir may be minimized while in storage, but increased in use.
      <br/>
      For example, a surrounding membrane may increase in porosity, permeability, or conductivity upon the application of an electric field across the membrane.
      <br/>
      Examples of such membranes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,080,546; 5,169,382; and 5,232,438, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      In preferred embodiments, the ionized substance reservoir is constructed to retain its physical integrity and to inherently resist migration and loss of the ionized substance.
      <br/>
      Such embodiments include those in which the ionized substance reservoir includes a solid or semi-solid material such as a gel or other polymeric material.
      <br/>
      In an especially preferred embodiment, the ionized substance reservoir includes a polymeric film in which the substance to be iontophoretically delivered is dispersed.
      <br/>
      The mobility of the substance to be delivered is substantially increased by the application of the electric field, permitting effective delivery across the target epithelial surface.
      <br/>
      Such a film need not contain any significant amount of hydrating material.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, a cross-linked hydrogel in the electrolyte reservoir, because it inherently contains significant amounts of water, can server as a water reservoir during iontophoresis.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      It may be desirable to provide the solution of active ingredient with a buffer.
      <br/>
      The ion of the buffer of like charge to the drug ion should have low ionic mobility.
      <br/>
      The limiting ionic mobility of this ion is preferably no greater than 1 * 10-4 cm2 /volt-sec.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Additionally, it may be desirable to control the flux profile of the drug being delivered by iontophoresis by adding to or having present in the reservoir containing the drug, ions which would compete with the drug ions for current (competing ions).
      <br/>
      To achieve various flux profiles for the drug being iontophoretically delivered, one may apply constant current but vary the concentration of the competing ions.
    </p>
    <p num="99">D. Ionizable Substance (Drug) for Iontophoretic Delivery</p>
    <p num="100">
      The ionizable drug can be delivered from either the anode, the cathode, or both simultaneously.
      <br/>
      For example, if the compound to be driven into the body is positively charged, then the positive electrode (anode) will be the active electrode and the negative electrode (cathode) will serve to complete the electrochemical circuit.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, if the ionic substance to be delivered is negatively charged, then the negative electrode (cathode) will be the active electrode and the positive electrode (anode) will be the indifferent electrode.
    </p>
    <p num="101">It is believed that this invention has utility in connection with the delivery of active ingredients within the broad class of cell adhesion molecules as well as chemical modifications of cell adhesion molecules.</p>
    <p num="102">E. Protective Backing</p>
    <p num="103">
      The iontophoretic apparatus of the invention may also include a suitable backing film positioned on top of the electrolyte reservoir.
      <br/>
      The backing film provides protection against contamination and damage to the current distributing member, if present, and the electrolyte reservoir of the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="104">F. Release Liner</p>
    <p num="105">
      The iontophoretic apparatus of the invention optionally includes a release liner which may be fixed to the underside of the ionized substance reservoir by an adhesive.
      <br/>
      The release liner protects the surface of the ionized substance reservoir which contact the epithelial surface from contamination and damage when the device is not in use.
      <br/>
      When the device is ready for use, the release liner may be peeled off to expose the epithelial contacting surface of the ionized substance reservoir for application of the device to a patient.
    </p>
    <p num="106">G. Indifferent Electrode</p>
    <p num="107">
      Iontophoretic devices require at least two electrodes to provide a potential to drive drug ions into the skin of a patient.
      <br/>
      Both electrodes are disposed to be in intimate electrical contact with the skin thereby completing the electrochemical circuit formed by the anode pad and cathode pad of the iontophoretic device.
      <br/>
      The electrode pads may be further defined as an active electrode from which an ionic drug is delivered into the body.
      <br/>
      An indifferent or ground electrode serves to complete the electrochemical circuit.
    </p>

      <br/>
      The skin contacting compartment 13 and the anode electrode compartment 11 are separated by a compartment separation means (membrane) 17.
      <br/>
      The anode electrode compartment 11 also contains an anode 14 and an electrolyte (anolyte) 15.
      <br/>
      The skin contacting compartment is attached to the patient's skin 36.

      The skin contacting compartment 23 and the cathode electrode compartment 21 maybe separated by a compartment separation means (membrane) 27.
      <br/>

    <p num="110">
      Applicants have recognized that some cell adhesion molecules are zwitterions, they have no net charge, they are electrically neutral, and in order to deliver the molecule across the skin in adequate quantity, it must have a net charge.

      <br/>
      Such modification may be accomplished through process and methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art, by way of example and not limitation, such modification may be accomplished by esterification of the molecule, addition or deletion of amino acids.

    <p num="113">
      The integrin inhibitor compounds delivered by iontophoresis in accordance with the present invention possess activity as antagonists of integrins such as, for example, IIb/IIIa,  ALPHA v BETA 3,  ALPHA v BETA 5 and  ALPHA 5 BETA 1, and as such have utility in the treatment of a variety of disease conditions as discussed herein.
      <br/>
      The integrin antagonist activity of the compounds iontophoretically delivered in the present invention may be demonstrated using assays which measure the binding of a specific integrin to a native ligand, for example, using the ELISA assay described below for the binding of vitronectin to the  ALPHA v BETA 3 receptor, or for example, an ELISA assay for the binding of fibrinogen to the IIb/IIIa receptor.

      Platelet-Fibrinogen Binding Assay Binding of 125 I-fibrinogen to platelets was performed as described by Bennett et al. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80: 2417-2422, with some modifications as described below.
      <br/>
      Human PRP (h-PRP) was applied to a Sepharose column for the purification of platelet fractions.
      <br/>
      Aliquots of platelets (5 * 108 cells) along with 1 mM calcium chloride were added to removable 96 well plates prior to the activation of the human gel purified platelets (h-GPP).
      <br/>
      Activation of the human gel purified platelets was achieved using ADP, collagen, arachidonate, epinephrine, and/or thrombin in the presence of the ligand, 125 I-fibrinogen.
      <br/>
      The 125I-fibrinogen bound to the activated platelets was separated from the free form by centrifugation and then counted on a gamma counter For an IC50 evaluation, the test compounds were added at various concentrations prior to the activation of the platelets.

      The integrin inhibitor compounds used in the present invention may also possess thrombolytic efficacy, that is, they are capable of lysing (breaking up) already formed platelet-rich fibrin blood clots, and thus are useful in treating a thrombus formation, as evidenced by their activity in the tests described below.
      <br/>
      Venous blood was obtained from the arm of a healthy human donor who was drug-free and aspirin free for at least two weeks prior to blood collection, and placed into 10 mL citrated Vacutainer tubes.
      <br/>
      The blood was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 1500 * g at room temperature, and platelet rich plasma (PRP) was removed.
      <br/>
      To the PRP was then added 1 * 10-3 M of the agonist ADP, epinephrine, collagen, arachidonate, serotonin or thrombin, or a mixture thereof, and the PRP incubated for 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      The PRP was centrifuged for 12 minutes at 2500 * g at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The supernatant was then poured off, and the platelets remaining in the test tube were resuspended in platelet poor plasma (PPP), which served as a plasminogen source.
      <br/>
      The suspension was then assayed on a Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics, Inc., Hialeah, Fla.), to determine the platelet count at the zero time point.
      <br/>
      After obtaining the zero time point, test compounds were added at various concentrations.
      <br/>
      Test samples were taken at various time points and the platelets were counted using the Coulter Counter.
      <br/>
      To determine the percent of lysis, the platelet count at a time point subsequent to the addition of the test compound was subtracted from the platelet count at the zero time point, and the resulting number divided by the platelet count at the zero time point.
      <br/>
      Multiplying this result by 100 yielded the percentage of clot lysis achieved by the test compound.

    <p num="154">
      The transdermal patch design used in these studies included an absorbent drug reservoir with 2 cm2 active area of skin contact and a volume of 0.3 mL. The drug reservoir compartment was separated from the electrode compartment by a semi-permeable membrane with a molecular weight cutoff of 100.
      <br/>
      The electrode compartment included a silver anion and a cation exchange media in a hydrogel matrix.
      <br/>
      The drug reservoir compartment was filled with dosing solution just before application to the skin.
      <br/>
      A silver-silver chloride mesh return cathode was located upstream of the polycarbonate flow-through cells.
      <br/>
      Freshly dermatomed (1 mm) porcine skin was mounted in the cells on a porous support polyethylene.
      <br/>
      The patches included an absorbent reservoir in contact with silver and silver chloride electrodes.
      <br/>
      They were dosed with aqueous solutions of the drug and then placed on top of the excised skin.
      <br/>
      The patches were secured by a spring loaded mechanism which maintained even pressure over the patch.
      <br/>
      The cells were "perfused" by means of a peristaltic pump which pulls receiver solution through them.
      <br/>
      Effluents from the cells were collected with a fraction collector.
      <br/>
      Flow rates were typically 0.25 mL/min. The receiver solution was an isotonic pH 7.4 buffered saline solution containing 10 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, PEG 400, and a surfactant, Pluronic P-103.

      Results for the experiments in which there was no applied current indicate very low skin permeation.
      <br/>
      However, in the presence of the applied current the transdermal delivery of Compound A was greatly increased.
      <br/>
      The delivery profiles of flux vs time showed that delivery was maximum after about 5 hours of iontophoresis, after which the delivery rate was constant or slightly decreasing.
      <br/>
      The dosing rates were within the target range of 5-250  MU g/hr.
      <br/>
      When the current was turned off the delivery rates fell to very low levels.
      <br/>
      These studies show that the delivery of Compound A at an optimal rate is possible through manipulation of the applied current or the concentration of the drug solution Furthermore, the delivery of Compound A by transdermal iontophoresis was generally very consistent for any specified drug concentration and applied current.
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      Additional studies were performed using lower applied currents, lower concentrations of Compound A in the patch, and dosing solutions containing various concentrations of NaCl.
      <br/>
      Transdermal delivery rates with dosing solutions containing 10 mg/mL Compound A and 154 mM NaCl were proportional to the applied current for currents of 0, 25, 50, and 100  MU A. At 100  MU A the delivery rate of Compound A was approximately 10  MU g/hr for the 2 cm2 surface area, which was also within the targeted range.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      An alternative patch design, a monolithic patch rather than the membrane separated patch, was also tested.
      <br/>
      This patch is composed of two layers of absorbent material between which is sandwiched a silver anode.
      <br/>
      This monolithic patch provided similar profiles of transdermal iontophoretic delivery of compound 1 as the membrane separated patches.
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      FIG. 2 demonstrates that iontophoresis transport is a capable means for delivering Compound A to constant flux levels over a period of 24 hours.
      <br/>
      The variability in delivery from skin to skin is also extremely low.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      FIG. 3 shows that the in vitro delivery is proportional to increase in current and that the flux is again very constant over the 24 hour period and between skin specimens as well.
      <br/>
      In these experiment the flux reaches "steady state" rapidly and it is also evident that flux levels drop rapidly on termination of the current.
      <br/>
      This latter feature is likely to be valuable in situations where the administration of the drug must be stopped rapidly to avoid a risk of harm or injury to the patient.

      The in vivo iontophoretic delivery of the representative integrin inhibitor Compound A was demonstrated using pigs.
      <br/>
      In each experiment, the patches were loaded with drug solution immediately before application to the skin of the animals.
      <br/>
      Unanesthetized Yorkshire swine with weights from about 20 to 35 kg were used.
      <br/>
      The skin sites receiving the patches were wiped clean with moist gauze pads.
      <br/>
      Patches were overwrapped with an adhesive, elastic wrap to hold the patches in place.
      <br/>
      Separate constant current power supplies were provided for each iontophoresis patch system.
      <br/>
      Current and voltage readings were made and recorded on-board dataloggers.
      <br/>
      Blood samples were withdrawn from the vena cava through an IV catheter into VACUTAINER (tm)  blood collection tubes containing EDTA.
      <br/>
      After gentle mixing, the tubes were centrifuged to separate the plasma, which transferred to clean polypropylene tubes and frozen on dry ice.
      <br/>
      Frozen samples were stored at -80 (degree)  C. until assayed.

    <p num="166">
      In vivo, Compound A is rapidly converted to its acid form, N3 -�2-+3-(4-formamidinophenyl)-isoxazolin-5(R)-yl}-acetyl�-N2 -(n-butyloxycarbonyl)-2,3-(S)-diaminopropanoic acid (Compound B).
      <br/>
      Compound B concentrations in plasma were determined by LC-MS.
      <br/>
      The patches used were of the monolithic design described above, and having a 2 cm2 skin coverage area.
      <br/>
      Patches were filled with solutions containing 10-20 mg/mL Compound A and 154 mM NaCl.
      <br/>
      Using a 20 mg/mL Compound A dosing solution, and an applied current of 100  MU A, plasma concentrations of Compound B increased for the first 5-8 hours of dosing and then reached steady-state.
      <br/>
      Steady-state plasma concentrations of approximately 1-2 ng/mL were attained.
      <br/>
      After an intravenous infusion of Compound B at 10  MU g/hr, steady-state plasma concentrations of Compound B were also approximately 1-2 ng/mL.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the transdermal delivery rate at steady-state was approximately 10  MU g/hr.
    </p>
    <p num="167">
      Pigs were also dosed with patches containing 10 mg/mL of Compound A, using currents of 50 and 100  MU A. In these studies four patches were used for each pig, for a total skin coverage area of 8 cm2.
      <br/>
      Plasma concentrations of Compound B again increased over the first several hours of dosing and then reached an apparent steady-state.
      <br/>
      Transdermal iontophoretic dosing was maintained for 24 hours, during which plasma concentrations of Compound B were maintained fairly constant.
      <br/>
      Plasma concentrations were proportional to the applied current.
      <br/>
      Actual in vivo delivery rates were estimated by comparison with plasma concentrations after intravenous infusion of Compound B. The 50  MU A current delivered Compound A at approximately 25  MU g/hr, and the 100  MU A current delivered Compound A at approximately 40  MU g/hr.
      <br/>
      These results show that the in vivo continuous, controlled delivery of therapeutic doses of integrin receptor anagonists may be obtained using trandermal iontophoresis.

      The results show that blood levels obtained from both delivery techniques is similar and the variability in plasma levels seen with the iontophoresis is extremely low.
