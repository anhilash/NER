      The present invention relates to the atomization of a liquid stream.
      <br/>
      In another aspect, the invention relates to a method and apparatus for atomizing and uniformly distributing an oil feed stream into a stream of fluidized catalyst in a fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) unit or a coker unit.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The process of atomizing a liquid stream for such purposes as rapid cooling of the liquid (artificial snow making) or enhanced contact of the atomized liquid with another medium, such as a fluidized catalyst, is well known in the art.
      <br/>
      It would clearly be desirable to provide an improved process and apparatus for atomizing a liquid stream.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      A specific example of an atomization process is the atomization of an oil stream in an FCC or coker unit prior to contacting the oil stream with a fluidized catalyst.
      <br/>
      Typical FCC unit operations are described below.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy petroleum fractions to produce products such as gasoline and heating oils is well known in the art.
      <br/>
      In fluidized catalytic cracking, heavy petroleum fractions are often preheated prior to contact with hot, fluidized catalyst particles in a riser reactor.
      <br/>
      The contact time in the riser reactor is generally in the order of a few seconds.
      <br/>
      The relatively short contact time encourages the production of gasoline and heating oil range hydrocarbons.
      <br/>
      Longer contact times can result in overcracking to undesirable end products, such as methane and coke.
      <br/>
      Important aspects of contacting the heavy petroleum fraction with the fluidized catalyst include the atomization of the heavy petroleum fraction and uniform distribution of the atomized heavy petroleum fraction within the fluidized catalyst.
      <br/>
      Non-uniform distribution of the heavy petroleum fraction in the fluidized catalyst can lead to localized regions of high catalyst-to-oil ratios and overcracking.
      <br/>
      Also, poor atomization of the heavy petroleum fraction can lead to localized regions of low catalyst-to-oil ratios resulting in wetting of the catalyst which results in increased coke laydown.
      <br/>
      In addition, if the heavy petroleum fraction is not sufficiently atomized and does not directly contact the fluidized catalyst upon injection into the riser reactor, then thermal cracking can occur instead of catalytic cracking.
      <br/>
      Thermal cracking can result in the generation of the undesirable end products of methane and coke.
      <br/>
      Excess coke is undesirable because the process duties of the stripper and regenerator are increased and the coke can be deposited on the surfaces of the equipment involved.
      <br/>
      It would be clearly desirable to provide a process and apparatus in which an oil feed stream comprising a heavy petroleum fraction is sufficiently atomized and uniformly distributed within a fluidized catalyst in a fluidized catalytic cracking process.

      Axs2 preferably has a value such that the mass flux of the atomizing enhancing medium (MF2) at the point of exit from the plurality of holes 128 is in the range of from about 30 lbm/(ft2 sec) to about 50 lbm/(ft2 sec), preferably in the range of from about 32 lbm/(ft2 sec) to about 48 lbm/(ft2 sec;) and most preferably from 35 lbm/(ft2 sec) to 45 lbm/(ft2 sec).

      FIG. 4 shows one type of FCC unit 20 which comprises a feed injection zone 200 having incorporated therein the inventive atomizer 10 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Feed injection zone 200 is connected in fluid flow communication with an oil feed line 201, an atomizing enhancing medium line 202 and a riser reactor 203.
      <br/>
      A conduit 204 connects riser reactor 203, in fluid flow communication, with a catalyst/product separation zone 206 which usually contains several cyclone separators 208 and is connected in fluid flow communication with a conduit 210 for withdrawal of an overhead product from catalyst/product separation zone 206.
      <br/>
      Catalyst/product separation zone 206 is connected in fluid flow communication with a stripping section 212 in which gas, preferably steam, is introduced from lines 214 and 216 and strips entrained hydrocarbon from spent catalyst.
      <br/>
      Conduit or stand pipe 218 connects stripping section 212, in fluid flow communication, with a regeneration zone 220.
      <br/>
      Regeneration zone 220 is connected in fluid flow communication with a conduit 222 for introducing air to regeneration zone 220.
      <br/>
      Manipulative valve 224 (preferably a slide valve) connects regeneration zone 220, in fluid flow communication, with a catalyst conveyance zone 226.
      <br/>
      Catalyst conveyance zone 226 is connected in fluid flow communication with the feed injection zone 200.
      <br/>
      Catalyst conveyance zone 226 is also connected in fluid flow communication with a conduit 228 for introducing fluidizing gas into catalyst conveyance zone 226.

    <p num="32">Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, therein is illustrated, in greater detail, feed injection zone 200 from FIG. 4 including a frustroconical section 230, a typical guide 232 and the inventive atomizer 10.</p>
    <p num="33">
      The frustoconical section 230 is situated in an inverted manner and has a centerline axis 234.
      <br/>
      That is, the frustom end is situated below the base end, and the frustom and base ends are open to flow.

      In one embodiment, FIG. 6 represents a downwardly looking sectional view of feed injection zone 200 which illustrates the configuration of a plurality of guides 232 about frustoconical section 230 in which the atomizers 10 (not depicted in FIG. 6) are positioned.
      <br/>
      Referring again to FIG. 5, atomizer 10 is fixedly secured to guide 232 and is in fluid flow communication with frustoconical section 230 of the feed injection zone 200.
      <br/>
      Atomizer 10 can be fixedly secured to guide 232 by any means sufficient to provide a suitable seal.

      Regarding the operation of the FCC unit 20, and referring again to FIG. 4, an oil stream and an atomizing enhancing medium are introduced to feed injection zone 200 through lines 201 and 202, respectively, for contact with regenerated fluidized catalyst from catalyst conveyance zone 226 (described in greater detail below).
      <br/>
      The contacting of the oil stream with the regenerated catalyst catalyzes the conversion of the oil stream to gasoline range and lighter hydrocarbons as the mixture passes up the riser reactor 203.
      <br/>
      As the oil stream is cracked the catalyst is progressively deactivated by the accumulation of hydrocarbons and coke on the surface and in the interstitial spaces of the catalyst.
      <br/>
      This partially deactivated catalyst is thereafter referred to as spent catalyst and passes from riser reactor 203 to catalyst/product separation zone 206 via conduit 204.
      <br/>
      Hydrocarbon product gases and spent catalyst separate in catalyst/product separation zone 206 and the hydrocarbon product gases exit through conduit 210 with the spent catalyst flowing downwardly.
      <br/>
      The spent catalyst passes down through stripping section 212 and is stripped of its hydrocarbons by counter flowing stripping gas from conduits 214 and 216.
      <br/>
      The stripped catalyst flows downwardly to regeneration zone 220 via conduit 218 where the stripped catalyst is reactivated by burning off any remaining coke deposits with air supplied via conduit 222.
      <br/>
      The regenerated catalyst then flows to the catalyst conveyance zone 226 wherein fluidizing gas from conduit 228, preferably steam, fluidizes the regenerated catalyst and aids in passing the regenerated catalyst to the feed injection zone 200.

      <br/>
      Axs2 preferably has a value such that the mass flux of the atomizing enhancing medium (MF2) at the point of exit from the plurality of holes 128 is in the range of from about 30 lbm/(ft2 sec) to about 50 lbm/(ft2 sec), preferably in the range of from about 32 lbm/(ft2 sec) to about 48 lbm/(ft2 sec;) and most preferably from 35 lbm/(ft2 sec) to 45 lbm/(ft2 sec).

      Upon exit from the plurality of holes 128, the atomizing enhancing medium contacts the oil stream thereby forming a turbulent mixture of the oil stream and the atomizing enhancing medium.

      Where the value of D3 is as described above, the turbulent mixture, upon passing from downstream end portion 114 of first conduit 100 to third conduit 104, will be converted in the third conduit 104 to an annular-mist flow mixture which is necessary in order to produce atomization of the oil stream at the exit of the nozzle.
      <br/>
      The annular-mist flow mixture is preferably substantially circumferentially uniform.
      <br/>
      The annular-mist flow mixture can then be passed to nozzle 106 from which the annular-mist flow mixture is withdrawn resulting in the at least partial atomization of the oil stream to form an atomized oil stream.
      <br/>
      The atomized oil stream is then uniformly distributed by nozzle 106 into the regenerated fluidized catalyst from catalyst conveyance zone 226 which is flowing through the frustoconical section 230 of the feed injection zone 200.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Efficient atomizers in an FCC unit must both atomize the oil feed and distribute the oil feed uniformly to the riser reactor.
      <br/>
      The atomizers must be designed to produce a droplet size distribution, which can be vaporized and catalytically reacted in the riser reactor's residence time.
      <br/>
      The products of this vaporization process are gaseous hydrocarbons and a residual aerosol composed of high temperature boilers.
      <br/>
      While the vapor products can react catalytically, the residual aerosols are adsorbed onto the available surfaces (particles and wall) and thermally decompose.
      <br/>
      If the riser reactor performance is poor, the residual aerosols can be carried over to the main fractionator where it can present a potential stability problem.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In addition to atomization, the efficient vaporization of the feed oil requires good distribution of the feed oil over the cross section of the riser reactor.
      <br/>
      This allows uniform contacting of the oil with the hot regenerated catalyst.
      <br/>
      The nature of the spray from the atomizer must be matched to the density of the catalyst entering the mix zone.
      <br/>
      If this is done correctly, the spray will penetrate the dense catalyst and fully distribute.
      <br/>
      If not, the spray from the atomizer may be bent upward and not fully contact the catalyst.
      <br/>
      This inefficient contacting can result in eddies which drag part of the feed oil down below the mix zone.
      <br/>
      As a result, selectivities and throughput will suffer.
      <br/>
      Overall, the properly designed atomizer acts to limit the external mass transfer resistance between the oil and the catalyst particle by good atomization and distribution.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      When the atomizer performance is good, one should see trends in various indices as the catalyst to oil (C/O) ratio varies.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the external mass transport of the vaporized feed to the catalyst particles will not be limiting.
      <br/>
      As a result, when the C/O ratio is increased, the number of active sites available on the catalyst will increase, the extent of catalytic reactions should increase, and the extent of thermal reactions should decrease.
      <br/>
      These trends should appear in hydrogen transfer and thermal cracking indices.
      <br/>
      The hydrogen transfer should increase and the thermal cracking should decrease.
      <br/>
      This shift impacts the riser reactor's heat of cracking and the overall unit coke make.

    <p num="46">
      The hydrogen transfer index is defined as the ratio of the isobutane yield to the isobutene yield.
      <br/>
      Hydrogen transfer is a strongly exothermic bimolecular catalytic reaction which dehydrogenates one unsaturated molecule and hydrogenates the other unsaturated molecule.
      <br/>
      The index represents the extent of the hydrogen transfer reaction by comparing the amount of isobutane, which is an end product of hydrogen transfer, and the amount of isobutene, which is an end product of catalytic cracking.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The thermal cracking index is defined as the ratio of the yield of the ethane and lighter components to the yield of isobutene.
      <br/>
      The thermal cracking reaction is noncatalytic and endothermic.
      <br/>
      Ethane and lighter components are the end products of thermal cracking, while isobutene is an end product of catalytic cracking.
      <br/>
      This index is a gage of the extent of thermal cracking compared to catalytic cracking.
