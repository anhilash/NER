      An electronic pattern circular knitting machine and method are provided in which a first encoder is operatively associated with the needle cylinder with which it rotates synchronously and generates a pulse signal for each knitting needle and transmits that signal to a central controller for the knitting machine, in which is stored a datum position for the first encoder, for comparison with pre-stored pattern data to calculate the position of each knitting needle; in which a second encoder is operatively associated with a dial and its cam system, the movement of which changes the knitting timing, for generation and transmission of a position signal to the central controller for comparison with a stored corresponding position to the datum position of the first encoder and a determination of whether the knitting timing has been changed and if so, to adjust automatically the needle selection timing.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to circular knitting machines and more particularly to a method of and apparatus for controlling an electronic pattern circular knitting machine.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Electronic pattern circular knitting machines are currently in extensive use in the production of knitted fabrics of various designs from relatively simple to very complex.
      <br/>
      Typically, circular knitting machines include a rotatable needle cylinder having a multiplicity of grooves in the outer periphery parallel to the axis of rotation of the cylinder, each of which contains a knitting needle for reciprocation between a plurality of operative and inoperative positions.
      <br/>
      The rotatable needle cylinder cooperates with a rotatable, horizontal dial having a multiplicity of radial grooves in the upper surface thereof, each of which contains either a dial needle or a sinker depending on the type of knitting machine.
      <br/>
      The cylinder and dial are driven in rotation by a drive mechanism and the cylinder needles and dial needles or sinkers are moved past respective stationary cams which reciprocate the cylinder needles and dial needles or sinkers.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Since the cylinder needles and dial needles or sinkers cooperate in the knitting operation, the timing of the operation thereof is very important.
      <br/>
      Examples of such timing are synchronous and delayed.
      <br/>
      As knit patterns are changed, it is frequently necessary to change the knitting timing by changing the position of the needle cams.
      <br/>
      Of course, any change in the knitting timing must be correlated to the electronic pattern control and needle selection mechanism, which may be difficult and historically has been time consuming and expensive.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 298857/1998 (Japanese Patent Application No. 113469 of 1997), it is proposed to employ an optical encoder associated with the needle cylinder for monitoring the position of each knitting needle and therefore determining changes in the timing of the needles by the cams associated with such knitting needles.
      <br/>
      While an improvement over conventional technology, this proposed arrangement has the disadvantage of only accommodating timing changes with respect to the knitting needles on the cylinder and therefore cannot accommodate timing changes with respect to dial needles or sinkers.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">With the foregoing in mind, it is an object of the present invention to provide an electronic pattern circular knitting machine and method that automatically calculates the changed position of the dial corresponding to the needle cylinder when the knitting timing is changed.</p>
    <p num="6">
      This object is accomplished by providing an electronic pattern circular knitting machine having a controlling device for controlling the changing of the knitting timing, which device includes a first encoder operatively associated with the needle cylinder, a second encoder operatively associated with the dial, and transmission means connecting the first and second encoders, and by operating this electronic pattern circular knitting machine by initially determining the datum position of the first encoder for the knitting timing then in use and entering that datum position into the main controller for the circular knitting machine; and based on the entered datum position of the first encoder, entering the corresponding position of the second encoder into the main controller.
      <br/>
      Upon a change in the knitting timing, such as by moving the dial cam, the value of the moved position, outputted by the second encoder, is compared with the initial value stored in the main controller, and the comparison value is compared with the value of the first encoder monitoring the timing of each knitting needle on the needle cylinder and the resultant comparison is output to the needle-selection actuator to adjust automatically the needle-selection timing.
    </p>
    <p num="7">The method of the present invention further includes the following steps for each needle: determining whether the knitting timing position has been changed; if such timing has been changed, adjusting automatically the needle-selection timing on the basis of the comparison value as described above; if such timing has not been changed, determining whether the current timing is the cylinder-needle-selection timing; if so, outputting the cylinder-needle-selection data to the cylinder-needle-selection actuator; if the current timing is not the cylinder-needle-selection timing, then determining whether the current timing is the dial-needle-selection timing (or dial-sinker-selection timing); if so, then outputting the dial-needle-selection data to the dial-needle-selection actuator; and if the current timing is not the dial-needle-selection timing, returning to the first step and repeating these steps until the current timing is the dial-needle-selection timing.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      Referring now more specifically to the drawings, there is illustrated in FIG. 1, an electronic pattern circular knitting machine, generally referred to at 10.
      <br/>
      Knitting machine 10 includes a bed 11 supported by a plurality of legs 12.
      <br/>
      A lower gear wheel 13 (ring gear) is rotatably mounted on bed 11 by suitable bearings (not shown) and mounts for rotation therewith a needle cylinder 14 (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      Needle cylinder 14 has a multiplicity of vertical, spaced-apart grooves in the outer periphery thereof and a knitting needle 15 is slidably mounted in each such groove.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      A cylinder cam block 16 is mounted on bed 11 adjacent the needle cylinder 14 and carries a plurality of cams 17 on the side thereof facing the needle cylinder 14.
      <br/>
      As cylinder 14 rotates, it carries the knitting needles 15 past the cams 17 where butts on the needles 15 engage the cams 17 to reciprocate the needles 15.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      A needle dial 20 is rotatably mounted above and in operative association with the needle cylinder 11 by an axle 21.
      <br/>
      Dial 20 has a multiplicity of radial spaced-apart grooves in the upper surface thereof.
      <br/>
      A dial needle 22 is slidably mounted in each such dial groove.
      <br/>
      It should be understood that the present invention, while being described in connection with a needle dial, is applicable to knitting machines having sinker dials.
      <br/>
      An internal cylinder 23 surrounds axle 21 and is telescopically received in an external cylinder 24.
      <br/>
      A dial cam block 25 is mounted on the lower end of internal cylinder 23 and carries dial cams 26 on the lower surface thereof in operative association with the dial needles 22.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      An upper gear wheel 27 is mounted on the upper end of axle 21 for driving axle 21 and thus needle dial 20 in rotation.
      <br/>
      As with all knitting machines, knitting machine 10 includes a main drive motor (not shown) which is drivingly connected to a drive shaft 30 (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      A lower pinion gear 31 is mounted on drive shaft 30 for rotation therewith and meshes with lower gear wheel 13 to rotate gear wheel 13 and thus needle cylinder 14.
      <br/>
      An upper pinion gear 32 is mounted on the upper end of drive shaft 30 for rotation therewith and meshes with upper gear wheel 27 to rotate gear wheel 27, axle 21 and dial 20.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the needle cylinder 14 and dial 20 rotate synchronously when the main motor is operating.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The knitting machine 10 includes a main electronic pattern controller (CPU); generally indicated at 40 (FIG. 7), as is well known in the knitting art.
      <br/>
      Controller 40 includes a memory in which pattern data and yarn-switching data are stored as part of a pre-set knitting pattern, a numeric key pad, a monitor, etc. (not shown).
      <br/>
      In addition to the controller 40, knitting machine 10 includes a cylinder needle selection actuator 41 and a dial needle selection actuator 42 for selecting and actuating the cylinder needles 15 and dial needles 22, respectively, in accordance with the knitting pattern then active.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      A first encoder 43 (FIGS. 3 and 7) is provided for cylinder 14 and a second encoder 44 (FIGS. 4, 5 and 7) is provided for dial 20.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the encoders 43 and 44 are absolute type encoders, such as Model TRD-NA2048 NWE2486 made and sold by Koyo Electronics Industries Co., Ltd. (Kodaira-shi, Tokyo).
      <br/>
      This encoder inputs and outputs signals of absolute positions corresponding to rotational angles.
      <br/>
      Because of this characteristic, the encoders 43 and 44 do not require a counter, and as long as it is turned on, it generates a continuous output according to the angle of the input rotation axis.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The first encoder 43 is mounted on the bottom of bed 11 (FIG. 3) together with a datum sensor (not shown).
      <br/>
      Encoder 43 has a shank 43a on which are mounted double pinions 45, 46 for rotation therewith.
      <br/>
      Pinions 45, 46 have internal springs (not shown) biasing these pinions together so that no gap is formed therebetween and both pinions 45, 46 mesh with lower gear wheel 13.
      <br/>
      First encoder 43 is connected to the controller 40 by a cable 47.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The second encoder 44 is mounted on the upwardly widening portion of external cylinder 24 and includes a shank 44a on which are mounted double pinions 50, 51 for rotation therewith (FIGS. 4 and 5).
      <br/>
      Pinions 50, 51 have internal springs biasing the pinions 50, 51 together so that no gap is formed therebetween and mesh with a rack 52 carried by the internal cylinder 23.
      <br/>
      Second encoder 44 is connected to the controller 40 by a cable 53.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In setting the knitting timing, the first encoder 43 is adjusted initially by rotating the knitting machine to locate the datum position "0" using the datum sensor, the datum-detecting element (not shown) that is attached to lower gear wheel 13, and three LED lamps for datum adjustment (also not shown).
      <br/>
      When the datum position "0" is located, that position is entered into the controller 40 by means of the key pad on the control panel.
      <br/>
      The meshing of the pinions 45, 46 with the gear wheel 13 is then fine-tuned until two of the LED lamps are lit simultaneously which indicates that the datum position "0" of the first encoder 43 has been determined and established.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The second encoder 44 is then adjusted after the datum position "0" of the first encoder 43 has been determined by fine-tuning or fine-adjusting the meshing of the pinions 50, 51 with the rack 52.
      <br/>
      When one of the LED lamps for mesh adjustment is lit, the position of the second encoder 44 corresponding to the datum position "0" of the first encoder 43 is determined.
      <br/>
      When all of the LED lamps for datum adjustment, the LED lamps for mesh adjustment corresponding to pinions 45, 46 of first encoder 43 and the LED lamps for mesh adjustment corresponding to pinions 50, 51 of second encoder 44 are lit, the position of the second encoder 44 is stored in the memory of Controller 40.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The lower gear wheel 13 and pinions 45, 46 of the first encoder 43 rotate at the same speed ratio.
      <br/>
      Adjust any knitting needle 15 on the needle cylinder 14 to the datum position "0" of the knitting machine 10 and it will return to its original position after pinions 45, 46 of the first encoder 43 have rotated a dozen or so times.
      <br/>
      Because of this configuration, when the electronic pattern circular knitting machine 10 operates, the controller 40 can ascertain the rpm of the pinions 45, 46 from the output of the rotation angle of the first encoder 43, and in addition, can deduce the datum position "0" of the electronic pattern circular knitting machine 10 from the rpm.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The operation of the control means of the present invention will now be described.
      <br/>
      When the knitting machine 10 operates, the cylinder 14 and dial 20 rotate, as does lower gear wheel 13 causing first encoder 43 to generate a pulse signal synchronized with each knitting needle 15 as a needle sensor and to transmit this needle sensor signal by cable 47 to the controller 40.
      <br/>
      The controller 40 compares this signal with the pre-stored pattern data to calculate the position of the cylinder knitting needle 15.
      <br/>
      The calculated comparison value generates an actuator-activating signal, which is output to the cylinder needle selection actuator 41 or the dial needle selection actuator 42.
      <br/>
      At this time, the striper data is also compared and calculated to allow the yarns to be changed if required.
    </p>
    <p num="21">When the knitting timing (i.e. the cam timing of the needle cylinder and the dial) is changed, such as, for example, a change from the synchronized cam timing shown in FIG. 6A to the delayed cam timing shown in FIG. 6B or vice versa, the dial cam 26 opposing the dial needles 22 moves over the distance "X" in FIG. 6B with respect to the cylinder cam 17 opposing the cylinder needles 15, and the dial cam 26 disengages.</p>
    <p num="22">The movement of dial cam 26 the distance "X" is output by the second encoder 44 to the controller 40 and is compared with the previously determined value when the position of the second encoder 44 was stored in the controller 40 during the initial setting or set-up, and this comparison value automatically adjusts the timing of the output to the dial needle selection actuator 42.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The method of operation of the electronic pattern circular knitting machine 10 will now be described with particular reference to the flow chart of FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      When the knitting machine 10 is started, the first step, indicated at N50, is to determine whether or not the knitting timing has been changed.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished by comparing the signals from the first and second encoders 43 and 44 with the pre-stored values from the initial set-up.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      If the knitting timing is determined to have been changed, the value after the dial 20 has been moved is compared with the initial set-up value pre-stored.
      <br/>
      Then, the needle selection timing is automatically adjusted using this comparison value, indicated at N51.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      If the knitting timing is determined not to have been changed by step N50, the step 51 is by-passed and a determination of whether or not the current timing in the cylinder needle timing is made, as indicated at N52.
      <br/>
      If so, the cylinder needle selection data is output to the cylinder needle selection actuator 41, as indicated at N53.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      If the current timing is determined not to be the cylinder needle timing by step N52, step N53 is by-passed and a determination of whether or not the current timing in the dial needle selection timing is made, as indicated at N54.
      <br/>
      If so, the dial needle selection data is output to the dial needle selection actuator 42, as indicated at N55, and the process is repeated for each succeeding needle 15.
    </p>
    <p num="27">If the current timing is determined not to be the dial needle selection timing by step N54, the process returns to step N50 and repeats until the current timing becomes the dial needle selection timing.</p>
