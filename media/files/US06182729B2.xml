      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to a system that slices silicon ingots used as the material for semiconductors, or the like.
      <br/>
      The present invention also relates to a method and apparatus for adhering ingots to support members, which are used to mount ingots on slicing machines, and an ingot slicing method.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Semiconductor wafers are generally formed by slicing ingots, which are constituted by silicon monocrystals, into a predetermined thickness using a wire saw or the like.
      <br/>
      An example of one method to slice the ingots will now be described.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, an ingot 13 is lifted out of a crucible (not shown) and machined cylindrically.
      <br/>
      An intermediate plate 20, which is made of carbon or the like, is adhered to the cylindrical surface of the ingot 13.
      <br/>
      A support plate 21 (FIG. 6) is adhered to the upper surface of the intermediate plate 20 with a glass insulating plate 21a arranged therebetween.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 13, the ingot 13 is mounted on a wire saw 326 by way of the support plate 21.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The wire saw 326 includes a plurality of rollers 327, a wire 328 wound spirally around the rollers 327 with a predetermined pitch between each winding, and supply pipes 329 through which slurry containing abrasive grains is supplied to the wire 328.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 8, the wire 328 is drawn in either a single direction or two directions while the slurry, which includes abrasive grains, is supplied to the wire 328.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In this state, the wire 328 is pressed against the ingot 13.</p>
    <p num="8">This enables the wire saw 326 to slice the ingot 13 and produce a plurality of wafers 13a simultaneously.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The silicon monocrystals, in the form of ingots, have an accurate lattice structure.
      <br/>
      Such monocrystals have certain crystal planes and crystal orientations.
      <br/>
      The physical and chemical characteristics of the ingot are affected by the crystal orientation of the monocrystals.
      <br/>
      The crystal orientation refers to a direction perpendicular to the crystal plane.
      <br/>
      Prior to the slicing, the crystal orientation of the ingot with respect to the axis of the ingot differs from one ingot to another.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, slicing ingots having different crystal orientations in the same manner results in the wafers having differing characteristics since the relationship between the sliced surface and the crystal plane is not constant in each wafer.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      To cope with this problem, an ingot angle setting device is arranged on the wire saw.
      <br/>
      The support plate holding the ingot is secured to the angle setting device by bolts.
      <br/>
      In this state, the displacement of the ingot's crystal orientation with respect to the ingot's axis in horizontal and vertical directions is measured by a goniometer.
      <br/>
      The angle setting device then appropriately aligns the ingot's crystal orientation with the wire traveling direction.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the angle setting device pivots the ingot along a horizontal plane and along a vertical plane so as to align the crystal orientation of the ingot with a vertical plane perpendicular to each winding of the wire.
      <br/>
      In other words, as shown in the flowchart of FIG. 50, in the slicing step of the prior art, the ingot, to which the support plate is adhered, is first mounted on the wire saw.
      <br/>
      The crystal orientation of the ingot is then measured.
      <br/>
      Afterwards, the ingot is sliced apart into wafers.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      However, it is required that each wire saw be provided with an angle setting device.
      <br/>
      Thus, when using a plurality of wire saws, the cost of the entire system including the wire saws is increased.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the attachment of the ingots to the angle setting device is performed manually.
      <br/>
      This is burdensome for the operator and takes a great deal of time.
      <br/>
      As a result, attaching the ingots decreases the operational time of the wire saws.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A typical wafer production system includes an adhering step in which the above plates are adhered to the ingot, a mounting step in which the ingots are mounted on the wire saws, an adjusting step in which the crystal orientation of the ingots is measured and adjusted, and a slicing step in which the ingots are sliced.
      <br/>
      The wafer production system may further include a separating step in which the sliced wafers are separated from one another, a washing step in which the wafers are washed, an inspecting step in which the wafers are inspected, and other steps.
      <br/>
      In prior art production systems, these steps are performed in an off-line manner.
      <br/>
      Thus, the mounting, removing, and transporting of the ingots and wafers with respect to the associated apparatus is often performed manually.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      However, there is a recent trend in production systems in which the dimensions (diameter and length) of the ingots are becoming larger.
      <br/>
      This has resulted in the manual mounting, removing, and transporting of the ingots and wafers becoming more burdensome.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the management of each step is performed manually, it is difficult to increase the manufacturing efficiency of the wafers while upgrading the quality of the wafers.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to reduce the costs required for the entire wafer production system.</p>
    <p num="15">It is another object of the present invention to increase the operational time of an ingot slicing apparatus.</p>
    <p num="16">It is a further object of the present invention to automate the wafer production system to increase the manufacturing efficiency of the wafers and upgrade the quality of the wafers.</p>
    <p num="17">
      To achieve the above objects, a method for adhering support members to a cylindrical ingot is proposed.
      <br/>
      The ingot has a crystal orientation.
      <br/>
      A support plate is mounted on a machine for slicing the ingot.
      <br/>
      The method comprises rotating the ingot about a center axis thereof, the center axis being held to be parallel to a prescribed first plane so that the crystal orientation is placed in a plane parallel to the first plane, adjusting a position of one of the support plate and the ingot in the plane parallel to the first plane so that a mounting axis extending along a longitudinal direction of the support plate is aligned to the crystal orientation, and adhering the ingot to the support plate.

      According to another aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for adhering support members to a cylindrical ingot is proposed.

      The ingot has a crystal orientation.

      A support plate is mounted on a machine for slicing the ingot.
      <br/>
      The apparatus has a measuring device for measuring the crystal orientation of the ingot based on a diffraction of X-rays.
      <br/>
      Based on the measured crystal orientation, a rotating device rotates the ingot about a center axis thereof which is kept parallel to a prescribed first plane so that the crystal orientation is placed in a plane parallel to the first plane.
      <br/>
      Based on the measured crystal orientation, an adjusting device adjusts a position of one of the support plate and the ingot in the plane parallel to the first plane so that a mounting axis extending along a longitudinal direction of the support plate is aligned to the crystal orientation.
      <br/>
      An adhering device adheres the ingot to the support plate.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="22">
      An automated wafer production system according to a first embodiment of the present invention will hereafter be described with reference to FIGS. 1-17. A flowchart illustrated in FIG. 17 shows the operational flow of the production system.
      <br/>
      Each step of the production system will now be described in accordance with the flowchart.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      As shown in FIG. 1, the first stocker 311 has a plurality of racks 312.
      <br/>
      An ingot 13 constituted by silicon monocrystals is temporarily stored on each rack 312.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, the peripheral surface of each ingot 13 is machined cylindrically at a prior step.
      <br/>
      A bar code 314, on which production management data of the associated ingot 13 is recorded, is provided on the cylindrical surface of each ingot 13.
      <br/>
      The production management data includes information such as the lot number, the ingot dimensions, and the ingot serial number.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 11, a goniometer 315, a second adhering apparatus 316, a first adhering apparatus 317, and a drying apparatus 318 are arranged in front of the first stocker 311.
      <br/>
      A belt conveyor 319 connects the first stocker 311 to the apparatuses 315, 316, 317, 318.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The first stocker 311 includes a loading/unloading apparatus (not shown).
      <br/>
      When the loading or unloading of each ingot 13 is required, the loading/unloading apparatus performs the so-called first in first out processing.
      <br/>
      The loading/unloading apparatus transfers the ingot 13 from each rack 312 of the first stocker 311 onto the belt conveyor 319.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The goniometer 315 measures the crystal orientation of each ingot 13 that is conveyed by the conveyor 319 from the associated rack 312 of the first stocker 311.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, the goniometer 315 irradiates the end face of the ingot with X-rays to measure the displacement of the crystal orientation (the direction indicated by line L2 in FIG. 4) with respect to the center axis L1 of the ingot 13 in horizontal and vertical directions.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Based on the crystal orientation measured by the goniometer 315, the second adhering apparatus 316 applies an adhesive to several sections on the cylindrical surface of the ingot to adhere an intermediate plate 20, which is made of carbon or the like, onto the ingot, as illustrated in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the second adhering apparatus 316 adheres the intermediate plate 20 onto the ingot 13 so as to have the crystal orientation of the ingot 13 aligned along a horizontal plane when the ingot 13 is mounted on a wire saw 326.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Based on the crystal orientation measured by the goniometer 315, the first adhering apparatus 317 applies an adhesive to the intermediate plate 20 to adhere a support plate 21 onto the intermediate plate 20 with a glass insulating plate 21a arranged in between, as illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the first adhering apparatus 317 adheres the support plate 21 to the intermediate plate 20 so as to have the crystal orientation of the ingot 13 aligned with a plane that is perpendicular to each winding of a wire 328 when the ingot 13 is mounted on the wire saw 326.
      <br/>
      There are cases in other embodiments of the present invention in which the insulating plate 21a, which is arranged between the intermediate plate 20 and the support plate 21 in this embodiment, may not be provided.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      As shown in FIGS. 1, 6, and 7, the drying apparatus 318 blows heated air against the ingot 13 after the plates 20, 21, 21a are adhered thereto to dry the ingot 13.
      <br/>
      The drying apparatus 318 then blows cool air against the ingot 13 to solidify the adhesive.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      As shown in FIGS. 1, 3, and 7, a first data writing apparatus 322 is arranged near the outlet of the drying apparatus 318.
      <br/>
      The writing apparatus 322 reads the production management data from the bar code 314 provided on the ingot 314.
      <br/>
      The data is written into another bar code 323 and applied to the side surface of the support plate 21.
      <br/>
      During this procedure, a computer 339, which serves as a central management apparatus, judges which wire saw 326 is most appropriate for slicing the ingot 13 based on the management data.
      <br/>
      The writing apparatus 322 then adds the datum containing the number of the designated wire saw 326 to the bar code 323.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      A second stocker 324 is arranged adjacent to the first stocker 311 and along the belt conveyor 319.
      <br/>
      The second stocker 324 is provided with a plurality of racks 325.
      <br/>
      The ingots 13, which the plates 20, 21, 21a are adhered to, are stored on the racks 325.
      <br/>
      The second stocker 324 is provided with a loading/unloading apparatus (not shown).
      <br/>
      When the loading or unloading of each ingot 13 is required, the loading/unloading apparatus performs the first in first out processing.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The plurality of wire saws 326 is arranged in two rows with a predetermined interval between one another on the opposite side of the conveyor 319 with respect to the second stocker 324.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 8 and 13, each wire saw 326 includes a plurality of rollers 327, a wire 328 wound spirally around the rollers 327 with a predetermined pitch between each winding, and supply pipes 329 through which slurry containing abrasive grains is supplied to the horizontally extending wire 328.
      <br/>
      The wire 328 is drawn in either a single direction or two directions while the slurry, which includes abrasive grains, is supplied to the wire 328.
      <br/>
      In this state, the wire 328 is pressed against the ingot 13.
      <br/>
      This enables the wire saw 326 to slice the ingot 13 and produce a plurality of wafers 13a simultaneously with each wafer 13a having a predetermined thickness.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 14, a slurry management system 331 is arranged near the wire saws 326 to manage the slurry supplied to each wire saw 326 in a centralized manner.
      <br/>
      The slurry discharged from the wire saws 326 is sent to a recovering apparatus 331c, which includes a decanter 331a and a filter 331b, through a pipe C2.
      <br/>
      The decanter 331a receives the slurry sent through the pipe C2 and separates the granular components that are smaller than the abrasive grains (cutting chips, fragmented abrasive grains, metal particles, etc.) and dispersing liquid from the slurry to recover abrasive grains, which may be recycled.
      <br/>
      The dispersing liquid containing the small granular components is strained by the filter 331b.
      <br/>
      This sieves out the granular components and recovers the dispersing liquid.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The abrasive grains and the dispersing liquid recovered by the recovering apparatus 331c is sent to a mixing tank 331d through a pipe C3.
      <br/>
      A hopper 331e is provided to reserve abrasive grains that are supplied to the mixing tank 331d.
      <br/>
      An oil tank 331f is provided to reserve dispersing liquid that is supplied to the mixing tank 331f.
      <br/>
      The computer 339 controls the percentage content of the abrasive grains contained in the slurry through a controller 429.
      <br/>
      The controller 429 adjusts the amount of the abrasive grains from the hopper 331e and the amount of the dispersing liquid from the oil tank 331f that are supplied to the mixing tank 331d.
      <br/>
      This enables the slurry, which is produced in the mixing tank 331d and sent to each wire saw 326 through a pipe C1, to maintain a high slicing capability.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 12, a transporter 332, or an automated guided vehicle (AGV), is provided in the system.
      <br/>
      A reflective tape 332a (FIG. 12), serving to mark a traveling route, extends between the two rows of the wire saws 326.
      <br/>
      The transporter 332 travels automatically along the traveling route.
      <br/>
      A transferring robot 332d having a pair of arms 332b, 332c is mounted on the transporter 332.
      <br/>
      The computer 339 commands the robot 332d to provide the wire saws 326 with the ingots 13 from the second stocker 324 so that the ingots 13 may be sliced into wafers 13a.
      <br/>
      The computer 339 also commands the robot 332d to retrieve the sliced ingots 13 (the wafers 13a) from the wire saws 326 and transport them to a wafer processing apparatus 333.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 15, the wafer processing apparatus 333 is located adjacent to the wire saws 326.
      <br/>
      The ingots 13 that have been sliced by the wire saws 326 are sent to the processing apparatus 333 one at a time by the transporter 332.
      <br/>
      Each ingot 13 is first washed by a prewashing apparatus 333a.
      <br/>
      A removing apparatus 333b then removes the intermediate plate 20, the insulating plate 21a, and the support plate 21 from the ingot 13.
      <br/>
      Afterwards, a separating apparatus 333c separates the sliced wafers 13a from one another and stores the wafers 13a in a cassette 334.
      <br/>
      The wafers 13a accommodated in the cassette 334 are washed by a washing apparatus 333d and then dried by a drying apparatus 333e.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 7, a second data writing apparatus 335 is arranged near the inlet of the processing apparatus 333.
      <br/>
      Before each ingot 13 is processed in the wafer processing apparatus 333, the writing apparatus 335 reads the production management data from the bar code 323 on the support plate 21.
      <br/>
      The data is written into another bar code 336 and applied to the outer wall of the cassette 334 accommodating the associated wafers 13a, as shown in FIG. 10.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 16, an inspecting apparatus 337 is arranged near the outlet of the processing apparatus 333.
      <br/>
      A handling robot 337a transfers the cassettes 334, which are conveyed from the processing apparatus 333 by a conveyor 338, to the inspecting apparatus 337 one at a time.
      <br/>
      The inspecting apparatus 337 removes each wafer 13a from the cassette 334 and inspects its quality.
      <br/>
      The wafer 13a is returned to the cassette 334 only if it has the required quality.
      <br/>
      The inspecting apparatus 337 sends data including the inspection results and the number of wafers 13a to the computer 339 each time the inspection of each wafer 13a in a single cassette 334 is completed.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The computer 339 has an operation panel 340 and a display 341.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the computer 339 is connected to the first stocker 311, the goniometer 315, the second adhering apparatus 316, the first adhering apparatus 317, the drying apparatus 318, the second stocker 324, the wire saws 326, the slurry management system 331, a wafer processing system 333, and the inspecting apparatus 337 by controllers 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, respectively.
      <br/>
      During production of the wafers 13a, the computer 339 sends command signals to the controllers 421-429 to control the associated apparatuses 311, 315-318, 324, 326, 331, 333, 337.
      <br/>
      The computer 339 also evaluates the slicing performance of each wire saw 326 by analyzing the inspection data of the wafers 13a that is sent from the inspecting apparatus 337.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The operation of the production system having the above structure will now be described.
      <br/>
      In the production system, the computer 339 sequentially controls the apparatus associated to each step to obtain the wafers 13a from the ingots 13.
      <br/>
      That is, the ingots 13 are retrieved one at a time from the first stocker 311 and conveyed sequentially to the goniometer 315, the second adhering apparatus 316, the first adhering apparatus 317, and the drying apparatus 318 by the conveyor 319.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The goniometer 315 irradiates X-rays to measure the crystal orientation of each ingot 13.

      The second adhering apparatus 316 adheres the intermediate plate 20 to the cylindrical surface of the ingot 13 in accordance with the crystal orientation, as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The first adhering apparatus 317 adheres the support plate 21 and the insulating plate 21a to the intermediate plate 20 in accordance with the crystal orientation, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7.
      <br/>
      The drying apparatus 318 dries and solidifies the adhesive applied by the adhering apparatuses 316, 317.

    <p num="42">
      The first data writing apparatus 322 than reads the data contained in the bar code 314 on the ingot 13.
      <br/>
      The read data and newly added data is written into another bar code 323 and applied to the side surface of the support plate 21.
      <br/>
      The ingot 13 is then temporarily stored in the second stocker 324 on one of the racks 325 with the plates 20, 21 adhered thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The ingots 13 stored on the racks 325 of the second stocker 324 are retrieved and sent to the designated wire saw 326 by the transporter 332 one at a time.
      <br/>
      Each ingot 13 is then sliced into wafers 13a by the wire saw 326.
      <br/>
      During the slicing, the slurry management system 331 supplies slurry, which is produced by the management system 331, to the wire saw 326.
      <br/>
      The sliced ingot 13 is then transported from the wire saw 326 to the wafer processing apparatus 333 by the transporter 332.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The processing apparatus 333 removes the plates 20, 21 from the sliced ingot 13.
      <br/>
      The wafers 13a are then separated from one another and placed in one of the cassettes 334.
      <br/>
      The wafers 13a are washed and dried afterward.
      <br/>
      The cassette 334 accommodating the wafers 13a therein is conveyed to the inspecting apparatus 337 by the conveyor 338.
      <br/>
      The inspecting apparatus 337 takes out each wafer 13a from the cassette and inspects its quality.
      <br/>
      The inspection data obtained by the inspecting apparatus 337 is sent to the computer 339 and analyzed to have the slicing performance of each wire saw 326 evaluated.
    </p>
    <p num="45">The advantageous effects of the above embodiment will now be described.</p>
    <p num="46">
      (1) Since the computer 339 controls the apparatuses associated to each step, the mounting, removing, and transporting may be performed automatically.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, this reduces the burden imposed on the operator and improves the production efficiency and quality of the wafers 13a.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      (2) The ingots 13 are temporarily stored in the first and second stockers 311, 324.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the ingots 13 may be held in a stand-by state in the stockers 311, 324 when a long period of time is required for the wire saws 326 to slice the ingot 13.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the production system may be operated smoothly.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      (3) The production management system data and other information related to each ingot 13 is relayed from the bar code 314 on the ingot 13 to the bar code 323 on the support plate 21 and then onto the bar code 336 on the associated cassette 34.
      <br/>
      As a result, the information included in these bar codes 314, 323, 336 enables each step to be managed properly.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      (4) The management of the slurry sent to each wire saw 326 is centralized by the slurry management system 331.
      <br/>
      That is, the recovering apparatus 331c separates the small granular components from the slurry discharged from the wire saws 326 and recovers the abrasive grains and the dispersing liquid that are suitable for the slicing of the ingots 13.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the abrasive grains and the dispersing liquid may be recycled.
      <br/>
      This decreases the necessary amount of the abrasive grains and the dispersing liquid and reduces industrial waste.
      <br/>
      When the recovered abrasive grains and dispersing liquid are returned to the mixing tank 331d, the amount of abrasive grains fed by the hopper 331e and the amount of dispersing liquid supplied by the oil tank 331f is controlled so that the proportion of the abrasive grains in the slurry in the mixing tank 331d is adjusted to an adequate value.
      <br/>
      This enables the wire saws 326 to be supplied with slurry having a high slicing capability.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the slicing of each ingot 13 and the mixing of the slurry may be performed independently in each wire saw 326.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the supplying of the slurry to the wire saw 326 and the slicing of the ingots 13 may be performed continuously in each wire saw 326.
      <br/>
      This improves efficiency of the slicing process.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      (5) Each ingot 13 is transported to and from the designated wire saw 326 by the transporter 332.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, large ingots 13 may be transported automatically between the second stocker 324, the wire saw 326, and the wafer processing apparatus 333.
      <br/>
      In addition, the employment of the transporter 332 lessens obstacles such as conveyors that are arranged on the floor.
      <br/>
      This enables the operator to move more freely on the floor and facilitates maintenance of the wire saws 326 and other apparatuses.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      (6) The slicing performance of each wire saw 326 may be evaluated through the inspection data from the inspecting apparatus 337.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the slicing condition of each wire saw 326 may be maintained optimally.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      (7) The intermediate and support plates 20, 21 are adhered to each ingot 13 with respect to the crystal orientation of the ingot 13 outside the wire saws 326.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is unnecessary to provide an angle setting device, of the like, for each wire saw 326.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, equipment costs required for the entire production system is reduced.
      <br/>
      In addition, the mounting of each ingot 13 to the designated wire saw 326 may be automated.
      <br/>
      This improves the operational rate of the wire saws 326.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      (8) The conveyor 319, which conveys the ingots 13, has a simple structure.
      <br/>
      The conveyor 319 conveys each ingot 13 to the first and second adhering apparatuses 316, 317 in exactly the same state in which its crystal orientation was measured by the goniometer 315.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the intermediate plate 20 is accurately adhered to the ingot 13 in accordance with the measured crystal orientation.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      (9) The intermediate plate 20 and the support plate 21 are removed from the sliced ingot 13 in the wafer processing apparatus 333.
      <br/>
      The wafers 13a are separated from one another and then stored in one of the cassettes 334 to be washed and dried.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the washing and drying of the wafers 13a may be performed efficiently.

      When the rotation of the ingot 13 is stopped, the value detected by the encoder 61, which is coupled to the servo motor 56, is initialized.

      The output data of the reflected X-rays is read for every 90 degrees.

      Based on the data taken at four angles, the computing apparatus 117 computes the inclination  THETA  (FIG. 25) of the crystal orientation L2 of the ingot 13 in the horizontal direction with respect to the center axis L1 of the ingot 13 (step S4).

      An adhesive is applied to the bottom surface of the intermediate plate 20 beforehand.

      The side surface of the support plate 21 is abutted against the side surface of the adjusting plate 93.

      In other words, the crystal orientation L2 of the ingot 13 and the mounting axis 23 of the support plate 21 are aligned along the same vertical plane.

      In this state, the first adhering mechanism 103 releases the support plate 21 and places the support plate 21 on the intermediate plate 20.

      <br/>
      Therefore, the sliced surfaces of each wafer 13a is parallel to the crystal plane of the ingot 13.

      In addition, the ingot 13 is automatically attached to the mounting mechanism 121 of the designated wire saw 326 with the support plate 21 adhered thereon.
