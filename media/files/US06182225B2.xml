    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to a network control device and method including network control software.</p>
    <p num="2">
      In recent years local area networks (LAN) for connecting computers together have become widespread.
      <br/>
      These type of local area networks are capable of connecting computers in the same floor of a building or the entire building, a group of buildings, a district or even larger areas and can even connect to networks on a worldwide scale.
      <br/>
      Each of these mutually connected local area networks (LAN) may utilize diverse hardware connection technology or a plurality of network protocol.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Other isolated local area networks (LAN) of simple structure can be supervised by individual users.
      <br/>
      In other words, the user can replace equipment, install software and diagnose problems.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      However, large-scale complex LAN and large, mutually interconnected LAN groups require management referred to here as "Management".
      <br/>
      This "Management" means both a person to act as the network administrator and the software used by the network administrator.
      <br/>
      In this document, the term "management" signifies control utilizing software to manage the entire system, and the term "user" signifies the person utilizing the network control software.
      <br/>
      The user usually acts as the system control administrator.
      <br/>
      The user can make use of the network control software to obtain control data on the network and change this data.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Large-scale network systems are usually required to be active systems that must constantly perform equipment expansion or removal, software updating and problem detection, etc.
      <br/>
      Generally, such systems are owned by various persons or exist as various systems supplied by various operators.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Hereafter, the handling of the password as well as the password set in the network device during start-up in the network management program of the conventional art will be described.</p>
    <p num="7">
      When for instance a network management program is started up on a personal computer (PC) connected to a network, and the user selects a desired printer from among a plurality of printers capable of information acquisition and settings by means of this network management program that was started up; the device password information stored in the network board (NB) connected to the selected printer is then acquired.
      <br/>
      Whether or not a device password was set is determined based on this acquired device password information and when a device password has in fact been set, this device password is input in order to allow acquisition and settings of printer and network board (NB) information from the network management program.
      <br/>
      In this way, whether or not the device password acquired from the printer, and the device password entered by the user match each other can be determined.
      <br/>
      When the two passwords match, detailed information acquisition and settings for this printer are performed.
      <br/>
      However, when the two passwords do not match, the program stands by for entry of the correct device password by the user.
    </p>
    <p num="8">When device password information for this selected printer has not been set, a decision is made from information instructions as to whether to set this password and password setting is then made if in fact determined that the password must be set.</p>
    <p num="9">The network management program of the conventional art as explained above, therefore sets a password during start-up of the management program in order to maintain security and the setting of a password for a network device to be controlled is the general practice in such cases.</p>
    <p num="10">
      However, in this network management program of the conventional art, the password needed at start-up of this network management program and the password for the network device to be controlled were separate entities so that when acquiring information and making settings for a network device that was selected for control, a password had to be entered which was identical to that set for the network device to be controlled.
      <br/>
      This process impeded improved operability of the network management program.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Also, in this network management program of the conventional art, due to the need for security a password had to be set for all network devices subject to control.
      <br/>
      For the user of the network management program control of numerous network devices therefore involved a big load in terms of password settings and their instructions.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Further, this network management program of the conventional art is configured when used with large-scale networks so that a user sets a controller mode (an administrator mode) for the device and the user is then connected to the network and these device settings are also capable of being changed.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if for instance a plurality of users are connected on the network simultaneously to access one device, then a situation will likely occur where those device settings are changed.
      <br/>
      Under such circumstances, with a plurality of users mutually making diverse settings, setting conflicts are easily prone to occur resulting in problems or breakdowns in the operation of that device.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">In view of the above problems with the conventional art, it is therefore an object of this invention to provide a network device control method and unit in which the same password is used for both starting up the network management software, and for acquiring information and making settings in the target network data base, so that password entry for access to a network device can be omitted and the operability of network management software can be greatly improved.</p>
    <p num="14">Another object of this invention is to provide a network device control method and unit in which a password for the network device identical to an the password used during start-up of the control management software are both automatically entered as the network device password for the device to be controlled on the network management software to alleviate the burden of setting a password for the network device to be controlled.</p>
    <p num="15">This invention proposes to view of the above mentioned drawbacks in the conventional art, to provide a network device control method and unit in which setting conflicts do not occur since a plurality of users is restricted from accessing the administrator mode which is the mode for changing settings of a device.</p>
    <p num="16">Another object of this invention is to provide a network device control method and unit in which when another user accesses the administrator mode for changing the settings of a device, information showing this status is displayed on the screen along with notice that all other users are prohibited from accessing administrator mode.</p>
    <p num="17">Yet another object of this invention is to provide a network device control method and unit in which a user can automatically obtain access as an administrator even though another user is accessing the administrator mode for changing the settings of a device.</p>
    <p num="18">Still another object of this invention is to provide a network device control method and unit in which access can be obtained to a device in user mode which only displays information, in the event another user is accessing the administrator mode for changing the settings of a device.</p>
    <p num="19">In order to achieve the above objects of the invention, the network device control unit is characterized by comprising:</p>
    <p num="20">

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="26">Hereafter, the embodiment of the invention will be described while referring to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="27">A large-scale network requiring management by the embodiment of this invention will first be described.</p>
    <p num="28">
      FIG. 1 shows a network board (NB) for connecting the printer to the network, connected to a printer 102 having an open-style architecture.
      <br/>
      The NB101 is connected to the local area network (LAN) 100 by for instance an LAN interface such as Ethernet interface 10Base-2 having a coaxial connector or 10 Base-T having RJ-45.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      A plurality of personal computers (PC) such as a PC103 or PC104 are also connected to the LAN 100.
      <br/>
      The PC103 and PC104 can communicate with NB101 within the network operating system.
      <br/>
      One personal computer such as the PC103 can be directed to function as the network controller.
      <br/>
      Also, a printer 105 connected to the PC104 can be connected to the PC103.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      A file server 106 is connected to the LAN 100.
      <br/>
      This file server 106 controls access to files stored in a large-capacity (for example 10 billion byte) network disk 107 .
      <br/>
      A printer server 108 performs printer on the connected printers 109a, 109b or with printer 105 in a remote location, etc.
      <br/>
      Other peripheral equipment not shown in the drawing may also be connected to the LAN100.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      More specifically, the network shown in FIG. 1 can utilize network software such as Novell or Unix software for achieving efficient communications between the various network members.
      <br/>
      Any network software is capable of being used such as NetWare (commercial trademark of the Novell Company, omitted hereafter).
      <br/>
      A detailed explanation relating to this software package may be found by referring to the on-line documentation enclosed with the NetWare package.
      <br/>
      This explanation can also be purchased along with the NetWare package from the Novell Company.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In a simplified description of the layout of FIG. 1, a file server 106 fulfills the function of file manager for receiving data files, storing, queueing, caching and transmission of data files with the LAN members.
      <br/>
      For instance, files made on the PC103 and PC104 are respectively sent to the file server 106 which sorts these files in order, and in compliance with commands from the print server 108, sends these ordered data files to the printer 109a.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The data files created on the PC103 and PC104 are sent to the LAN100 and files received from the LAN100 or such kind of files are labeled and processed on a computer configured to perform such tasks.
      <br/>
      The computer equipment is shown in FIG. 1, however other computer equipment suitable for running the network software may also be included.
      <br/>
      For instance, when using UNIX software, a UNIX workstation can be incorporated into the network and under appropriate conditions, can be used along with the computers shown in the figure.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Usually, a local area network such as the LAN100 provides services to a certain number of local user groups such as on one floor of a building, or a plurality of connected floors in a building.
      <br/>
      For instance, a wide area network (WAN) can be formed to handle users isolated from other users such as users in other buildings or in other prefectures, etc.
      <br/>
      The WAN is fundamentally an aggregate consisting of high-speed digital lines such as telephones lines of high-speed digital networks (ISDN) to connect a plurality of LAN.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Accordingly, as shown in FIG. 1, the LAN100, LAN110 and LAN120 form WAN connected by modulators/demodulators (modem) and a transponder 130 and a backbone 140.
      <br/>
      These are simple electrical connections implemented by several bus lines.
      <br/>
      Each LAN incorporates a custom personal computer.
      <br/>
      Though not always needed, a file server and a print server are normally incorporated into the LAN.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Therefore, as shown in FIG. 1, the LAN110 incorporates a PC111, a PC112, a file server 113, a network disk 114, a print server 115, a printer 116 and a printer 117.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the LAN120 incorporates only a PC121 and PC122.
      <br/>
      The equipment connected with the LAN100, LAN110 and LAN120 can access other LAN equipment functions by means of WAN connections.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Up until now different methods have been attempted with standards systems from many organizations as methods for controlling devices on networks comprising a large-scale network system.
      <br/>
      The International Standards Organization (ISO) has proposed a general-purpose standards framework called the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model.
      <br/>
      The network control protocol for the OSI model is called the Common Management Information Protocol.
      <br/>
      The Common Management Information Protocol or CMIP is a common network control protocol from Europe.
    </p>
    <p num="38">Also, from the USA, a network management protocol for greater common use is known as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) which is a complete change from the CMIP associated with it. (See "Introduction to TCP/IP Network Management--For Practical Network Control" by M. T. Rose, translated by Takeshi Nishida, First edition Aug. 20, 1992 Toppan.)</p>
    <p num="39">
      This Simple Network Management Protocol has at least one network management station (NMS) in the network management system.
      <br/>
      Each station has a plurality of management nodes including agents, as well as a network protocol so that the management stations and agents can exchange management information.
      <br/>
      The user can therefore obtain data on the network and also make changes to this data by utilizing electronic communication (modem) and the agent software for the management node via this network management software on NMS (network management station).
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The agent here, refers to the software running as a background process of the target devices.
      <br/>
      When the user requests management data for equipment on the network, the management software places the object identification information in a management packet frame and sends this object information to the target agent.
      <br/>
      The agent interprets this object identification information, extracts data corresponding to this object identification information, places this data back in the packet and sends this packet back to the user.
      <br/>
      In some cases, a process corresponding to the data that was extracted, may be called up.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      This agent also maintains data regarding its own status in a data base configuration.
      <br/>
      This data base is called a Management Information Base (MIB)).
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows a concept view of the MIB configuration.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, the MIB has a tree type data structure and all nodes are affixed with a number.
      <br/>
      The number inside the parentheses in FIG. 4 is an identifier for that node.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      For instance, the identifier for node 401 is "1".
      <br/>
      The identifier for node 402 is a "3" under node 401 and therefore listed as "1 * 3".
      <br/>
      In the same way, the identifier for node 403 is listed as "1 * 3 * 6 * 1 * 2".
      <br/>
      The identifier for these nodes is known as the object identifier.
    </p>
    <p num="43">The structure of this MIB is called the Structure of Management Information (SMI) and conforms to the specifications in "RC1155 Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets".</p>
    <p num="44">Only a portion of the MIB specified as a standard has been extracted and shown in FIG. 4.</p>
    <p num="45">
      In FIG. 4, the numeral 404 is a node representing the peak of the object group and referred to as a standard MIB provided as a standard feature in equipment managed by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
      <br/>
      The detailed structure of the objects ranked below this node are specified in "RFC1213 Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II.
      <br/>
      The numeral 405 is a node at the peak of the object group called the printer MIB and is provided as a standard item in printers managed by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
      <br/>
      The detailed structure of the objects ranked below this node are specified in "RFC1759 Printer MIB.
      <br/>
      Further, the numeral 406 is referred to as a private MIB and is a peak node for defining autonomous MIB such as used by companies and organizations.
      <br/>
      The numeral 407 is called a company expansion MIB and is a peak node for autonomous expansion of a company within the private MIB.
      <br/>
      The Canon Corporation has been assigned "1602" as a company number for definition as an autonomous entity and the peak node 408 for defining Canon MIB which is a Canon autonomous MIB and "408" is ranked at a position below the node 407 which signifies companies.
      <br/>
      The object identifier "1 * 3 * 6 * 1 * 4 * 1602" is for the peak node of the Canon MIB.
    </p>
    <p num="46">Installing agents on network boards</p>
    <p num="47">
      Agents are installed on network boards for connecting the printer to the network.
      <br/>
      This process allows the printer to be controlled by the network management software.
      <br/>
      The user can acquire or change the status of the information for the printer subject to control by the network control software.
      <br/>
      More specifically for instance, the characters shown on the liquid crystal display of a printer can be acquired or the default paper feed cassette changed.
      <br/>
      Hereafter, a sample connection to a printer, of a network board (NB) mounted with an agent will be described.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      As shown in FIG. 2, the NB101 is preferably mounted in the internal expansion slot of the printer 102.
      <br/>
      The NB101 becomes a "built-in" network node having a data storage function and performing the processing shown below.
      <br/>
      The structure of this NB101 has the merit of possessing special auxiliary functions for integrating and controlling a large multi-area WAN network.
      <br/>
      These auxiliary functions for instance, include printer control and status monitoring of remote network locations (for instance offices of network coordinators) and automatic control and printer load characteristics of the printer for providing a guaranteed initial printer environment for the next printer user once the current printing job is finished or may include access through the network for setting a schedule for toner cartridge replacement and incorporating a printer log or statistical records.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      An essential element in this NB design is the function for accessing printer control status from NB101 by way of a two-way interface such as the shared memory 200.
      <br/>
      Besides this shared (or joint) memory, an interface such as an SCSI interface can also be used.
      <br/>
      Thus, print operation information for a plurality of convenient auxiliary function programs can be sent to the NB101 or to external network nodes.
      <br/>
      The print image data and control information blocks are formed by a microprocessor 301 on the NB101, listed in the shared memory 200 and then loaded into the printer 102.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the printer status information is sent from the printer 102 to the shared memory 200 and then loaded by means of the microprocessor 301 on the NB.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      FIG. 2 shows a fragmentary view of the NB101 installed in the printer 102.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the NB101 is comprised of a print circuit board 101a installed on a faceplate 101b for making the network connection and connected to the printer interface card 150 by means of the connector 17.
      <br/>
      The printer interface card 150 directly controls the printer engine of the printer 102.
      <br/>
      The printing data and the printer commands are input to the printer interface card 150 by way of the connector 170 from the NB101, while the printer status information is acquired by way of the connector 170 from the printer interface card 170.
      <br/>
      The NB101 communicates this information to the LAN100 by way of the network connector of the faceplate 101b.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the printer 102 can also receive printing data from the serial port 102a and the parallel port 102b, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing the electrical connections of the NB101, the printer 102 and the LAN100.
      <br/>
      The NB11 is directly to the LAN100 by way of the LAN interface and connected by way of the printer interface card 150 to the printer 102.
      <br/>
      The NB101 is comprised of a microprocessor 301 to control the NB101, a ROM 303 to store the operating program for the microprocessor 301, a RAM 302 for utilizing the program run by the microprocessor 301 as work, and a shared memory 200 for exchanging data between the NB101 and the printer interface card 150 and these various components are mutually connected by internal buses.
      <br/>
      The program used by the NB101 for operating the SNMP agent is stored in the ROM303.
      <br/>
      The microprocessor 301 performs operation in compliance with the program stored in the ROM303 and utilizes the RAM 302 as the work area.
      <br/>
      The shared memory 200 is utilized as the buffer zone for communication with printer interface card 150.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The microprocessor 151 on the printer interface card 150 performs data access with the NB101 by way of the shared memory 200 installed in the NB101.
      <br/>
      The microprocessor 151 of the printer interface card 150 also performs communication with the printer engine 160 for actually moving the printer mechanism.

    <p num="53">PC Configuration</p>
    <p num="54">The configuration of the personal computer operating the network management software is described as follows.</p>
    <p num="55">FIG. 5 is a block diagram showing the configuration of the PC capable of being operated by the network management software.</p>
    <p num="56">
      The reference numeral 500 in FIG. 5 denotes the PC operated by the network management software and is equivalent to numeral 103 in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The PC500 is controlled by a network management program executed by a CPU501 supplied with the program from a floppy disk drive (FD) 512 or stored in a ROM 502 or in a hard disk (HD) 511. Devices connected to the system through the system bus 504 are driven by this network management program in a coordinated manner.
      <br/>
      The numeral 503 is a RAM which functions as the main memory of CPU 501 or the work area and the like.
      <br/>
      The numeral 505 denotes a keyboard (KBC) controller for performing control via instructional inputs from a keyboard (KB) 509 and a pointing device not shown in the figure.

    <p num="57">Network Management Software Modular Structure</p>
    <p num="58">The configuration of the network management structure will next be described.</p>
    <p num="59">
      The network control device of this embodiment is attained by a PC configured as shown for a network control unit in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The hard disk (HD) 511 stores the network management program performing the main operation of this embodiment as is described later on.
      <br/>
      In all explanations related from hereon, the CPU501 will serve as the main element of the hardware unless otherwise stated.
      <br/>
      However, the main item in software control is the network management software stored in the hard disk (HD) 511. The operating system (OS) of this embodiment is assumed to be Windows95 (Microsoft) however the OS need not be restricted to Windows95.
      <br/>
      The network management program relating to this embodiment may be provided in a form stored on a recording medium such as floppy disks or a CD-ROM, etc.
      <br/>
      In such a case, a floppy disk controller (FD) 512 such as shown in FIG. 5 or a CD-ROM drive not shown in the drawing may be utilized to load the program from the recording medium and install the program in the hard disk (HD) 511.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      FIG. 6 is a block diagram view of a modular structure of the network management software relating to the embodiment of this invention.
      <br/>
      This network management software is stored in the hard disk 511 of FIG. 5 and the software is run by means of the CPU501.
      <br/>
      In such cases, the CPU501 uses the RAM 503 as the work area.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      The numeral 601 in FIG. 6 denotes the device list module which is a module for displaying on a list, all the devices connected to the network (this list is given in more detail in FIG. 15 as explained later).
      <br/>
      The numeral 602 denotes the overall control module which serves to coordinate the other modules based on instructions from the device list.
      <br/>
      The numeral 603 denotes the configurator which is the module that performs special processing relating to network settings for the agent.
      <br/>
      The numeral 604 denotes the search module which searches for a device connected to the network.
      <br/>
      Devices that the module 604 searches for are displayed on a device list 601.
      <br/>
      The numeral 605 is a network job module for acquiring print job status from the network server by utilizing the NetWare API616. (For details on NetWare API refer for instance, to the "NetWare Programmer's Guide for C" issued by the Novell Company.
      <br/>
      This text may be purchased from the Novell Company.) The numerals 606 and 607 denote the UI module for displaying the device window as related later.
      <br/>
      A UI module is provided for each model displaying detailed information.
      <br/>
      The numerals 608 and 609 denote the control modules which handle special control of models acquiring detailed information.
      <br/>
      These control modules, just as with the control modules are provided for each model displaying detailed information.
      <br/>
      The control A module 608 and the control B module 609 acquire MIB data from the device subject to net control by utilizing the MIB module 610 and then convey this data to the corresponding UI A module 606 or the UI B module 607.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      An MIB module 601 performs object identifier and object key conversions.
      <br/>
      Here, the object key is a 32 bit integer matching the object identifier in a one to one relationship.
      <br/>
      The object identifier is an identifier of variable length.
      <br/>
      This variable object identifier is difficult to handle when installed as is in the network management software so the network management software of this document utilizes an object identifier and fixed length identifier internally in a one to one relationship.
      <br/>
      The host module for the MIB module 610 handles the MIB information utilizing this object key and this arrangement allows easy use in the network management software.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The numeral 611 denotes the SNMP module for sending and receiving the SNMP packet.
      <br/>
      The numeral 612 denotes the shared transport module that absorbs differences in lower ranked (downstream) protocol for transporting the SNMP data.
      <br/>
      During actual operation, the IPX handler 613 or the UDP handler 614 has the role of transporting the data.
      <br/>
      The UDP handler utilizes WinSock 617 for installation. (Refer to specifications for instance for Windows Socket API v1.1 for details on WinSock.
      <br/>
      This document can be procured from a plurality of locations and comes enclosed with Visual C++ a compiler of the Microsoft Corporation.) The numeral 615 denotes the current protocol utilized by the configurator 603 and during operation shows either the IPX protocol or the UDP protocol selected by the user.
      <br/>
      In the following explanation, the network management software of this document is called "NetSpot" (A commercial trademark of the Canon Corporation.)
    </p>
    <p num="64">NetSpot Install</p>
    <p num="65">
      The files required for install of NetSpot are usually taken from a recording medium such as a floppy disk (FD) or a CD-ROM or else may be transferred by way of the network.
      <br/>
      After the user has obtained the files needed for NetSpot install by one of these methods, the NetSpot install is commenced in compliance with the specified install procedure.
      <br/>
      This NetSpot install procedure is similar to other general software installation procedures.
      <br/>
      Namely, in that the user starts up the NetSpot installer on the personal computer (PC) and the installer then automatically performs the install.
      <br/>
      The installer copies the necessary files from the hard disk of the PC and when needed also has the user input required information so that the necessary files for NetSpot operation are edited or created.
    </p>
    <p num="66">The information entered by the user during this NetSpot install includes selection of the following two types of operating modes (controller mode and general user mode).</p>
    <p num="67">NetSpot Operating Mode</p>
    <p num="68">
      NetSpot has the following two types of operating modes; a controller mode and a general user mode.
      <br/>
      One of these two modes is specified.
      <br/>
      Basically, the NetSpot install must be corrected in order to change the NetSpot operating mode.
    </p>
    <p num="69">Controller Mode (administrator mode): A mode utilized by users have specially designated rights (for instance, the network administrator or network peripheral equipment administrator).</p>
    <p num="70">General User Mode (user mode): A mode utilized by a general user having no specially designated rights.</p>
    <p num="71">
      Functions that support the general user mode are functions supported with limits applied in the controller mode.
      <br/>
      In other words, the functions supported in the general user mode are equivalent to a portion of the functions supported in the controller mode.
    </p>
    <p num="72">A list of functions supported by NetSpot are related below for both the controller mode and the general user mode.</p>

    <p num="94">NetSpot Start-Up and Password Approval</p>
    <p num="95">
      When NetSpot is installed in the general user mode, the user can start NetSpot just by executing the NetSpot file.
      <br/>
      However, when NetSpot is installed in the controller mode, entry of the NetSpot password is requested after the user executes the NetSpot file.
      <br/>
      The NetSpot cannot start at this time in controller mode, unless the user enters the correct password.
      <br/>
      In NetSpot controller mode, the user can make all types of network peripheral equipment (device) settings.
      <br/>
      A mistake in these settings can cause misoperation or equipment breakdowns.
      <br/>
      So during startup in controller mode in NetSpot, the user is requested to enter the NetSpot password in order to prevent using controller mode by the general user.
      <br/>
      However, when entry of the NetSpot password is requested, the user can start up NetSpot in the general user mode without entering the password.
      <br/>
      This process is described in detail later on in the description of the NetSpot password entry dialog box (FIG. 10).
    </p>
    <p num="96">During install of NetSpot in controller mode, the user performing the install can set the NetSpot password during controller mode startup.</p>
    <p num="97">
      Further, after the user has started up NetSpot in controller mode, the NetSpot password can be set or changed at controller mode startup.
      <br/>
      Details are related later on, in the explanation of the NetSpot password change dialog box (FIG. 38).
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      The NetSpot password which has been set or changed is used from the next time NetSpot is started in controller mode.
      <br/>
      NetSpot controller mode will start if the NetSpot password entered during controller mode startup matches the actual entry but will not start if the two passwords do not match.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      In NetSpot controller mode, instead of requesting the NetSpot password from the user during start-up, a check can be made in the NetWare file server for log-in by the administrator.
      <br/>
      In other words, during start-up in NetSpot controller mode, the request for entry of the NetSpot can be omitted if the user has previously logged-in to the NetWare file server as the administrator.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      In actual network operation, there may be a plurality of administrators in one network environment and the administrator may vary with each piece of network peripheral equipment (device).
      <br/>
      So in NetSpot controller mode, a device password can be set as an option for each network interface board, in addition to the NetSpot password during start-up of the controller mode.
      <br/>
      This allows approval of a device password for each piece of network peripheral equipment selected by the user from the device list display window (FIG. 15) described later on.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      The controller can set a device password as needed for each network interface board during selection of network peripheral equipment.
      <br/>
      When a device password has been set in the network interface board, at the time of new selection of network peripheral equipment by the user in NetSpot controller mode from the device list display window (FIG. 15) or in other words when the device window has been opened again, the device password set by the controller for each network interface board is approved.
    </p>
    <p num="102">Entry of the device password during new selection of network peripheral equipment from the device list display window in the NetSpot controller mode can be omitted if the user sets the NetSpot password during controller mode start-up as equivalent to the device password at the time of network peripheral equipment selection.</p>
    <p num="103">This process is related more specifically, in the explanation for the device password entry dialog box (FIG. 50) and the device password change dialog box (FIG. 137).</p>
    <p num="104">In password approval as described above, approval of the device password during the latter selection of network peripheral equipment is performed by implementing the Canon MIB for the network interface board so this function is not supported for network interface boards not implementing the Canon MIB.</p>
    <p num="105">NetSpot Exclusive Control</p>
    <p num="106">
      A conflict may possible occur between the network peripheral equipment (device) settings and the network settings, when a plurality of NetSpot controller modes are started up for one piece of network peripheral equipment.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the number of NetSpot controller modes that can be started versus one piece of peripheral equipment are restricted to one mode.
      <br/>
      In other words, the same piece of network peripheral equipment cannot be selected by a plurality of NetSpot controller modes.
      <br/>
      In contrast, a plurality of general user modes can be started for one piece of network peripheral equipment.
      <br/>
      In other words, the same piece of network peripheral equipment can be selected on more than one NetSpot general user mode.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      In the exclusive control in the type of controller mode related above, the network interface boards are implemented by a Canon MIB so this exclusive control function is not supported on network interface boards not implemented by a Canon MIB.
      <br/>
      When exclusive control is not implemented then network peripheral equipment on the same network can be selected by more than one NetSpot controller mode just the same as in the NetSpot general user mode.
    </p>
    <p num="108">An illustration demonstrating the concept of exclusive control in the controller mode is shown in FIG. 9.</p>
    <p num="109">Transition Chart of Windows displayed by NetSpot</p>
    <p num="110">
      FIGS. 7 and 8 are window transition drawings showing in sequence the NetSpot changes in response to user instructions when the user has started NetSpot in controller mode.
      <br/>
      However, the windows shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 do not represent all the windows that NetSpot displays.
      <br/>
      Even when NetSpot receives no instructions from the user, all types of windows are automatically displayed according to the NetSpot operating status and information acquired from the network.
      <br/>
      These windows are however explained later on so a description is omitted here.
      <br/>
      A screen transition view of NetSpot when started in general user mode is omitted and fractional views are shown respectively in FIGS. 7 and 8.
    </p>
    <p num="111">The user can monitor the network peripheral equipment status (device) by viewing the information displayed on the respective window shown by NetSpot and can set a suitable value in these windows in order to control the network peripheral equipment (device).</p>
    <p num="112">When NetSpot is started in controller mode a list on a dialog box as shown in FIG. 7 is called up from each sheet related later on.</p>

      When NetSpot is started in controller mode, the NetSpot password entry dialog box shown in FIG. 10 is displayed only in cases when the NetSpot password has been set.
      <br/>
      The NetSpot password entry dialog box is a dialog box for the user to enter the NetSpot password at start-up of NetSpot.
      <br/>
      The NetSpot password entry dialog box does not appear in the NetSpot general user mode.
      <br/>
      Also, when ON has been selected in "Substitute NetWare server controller password" in the NetSpot password change dialog box (FIG. 38), the controller mode then starts up if the user has logged-in as the controller in the NetWare file server so that the NetSpot password entry dialog box does not appear.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the user has not logged-in as the controller in the NetWare file server, the NetSpot password entry dialog box will appear.

      This Printer Environment Dialog Box is for making printer environmental settings for the device selected by the user.
      <br/>
      The Printer Environment Dialog Box is basically comprised of five sheets with tabs as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="450">(1) Printer paper feed/eject basic sheet (FIG. 58)</p>
    <p num="451">(2) Shared print environment basic sheet (FIG. 59)</p>
    <p num="452">(3) LIPS print environment basic sheet (FIG. 69)</p>
    <p num="453">(4) N201 print environment basic sheet (FIG. 76)</p>
    <p num="454">(4) ESC/P print environment basic sheet (FIG. 88)</p>
    <p num="455">
      When the print environment dialog box is opened by the user, the foremost sheet shown is the default sheet which is the printer paper feed/eject basic sheet (FIG. 58).
      <br/>
      As a typical view, the Printer Environment Dialog Box shown as a common (shared) sheet is displayed in FIG. 143.
    </p>
    <p num="456">
      When the user clicks one of the �Feed/Eject Paper� �Shared� �LIPS� �N201� �ESC/P� tabs on the upper part of the Printer Environment Dialog Box, the sheet corresponding to that tab, moves to the foremost place on the Printer Environment Dialog Box.
      <br/>

      Hereafter, the operation during settings and entry of the network device password (hereafter referred to as device password) in the network management software (hereafter referred to as NetSpot) of the embodiment of this invention is explained.
      <br/>
      In all explanations related from hereon, the CPU501 (FIG. 5) will serve as the main element of the hardware unless otherwise stated.
      <br/>
      However, the main item in software control is NetSpot, the network management software which is stored in the hard disk (HD) 511 (FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, NetSpot is installed with the controller mode and the setting of a password (hereafter referred to as Netspot password) required when starting up with the controller mode during the NetSpot install is assumed to have been made.
      <br/>
      Refer to &lt;&lt;NetSpot Install&gt;&gt; explanation for detailed information on this installation and to the &lt;&lt;NetSpot Operating Mode&gt;&gt; for detailed information relating t the controller mode.
    </p>
    <p num="1000">
      FIG. 150 is a flowchart showing the process implemented by NetSpot and the personal computer (103, 104 etc.) for a printer 102 connected to the LAN100 by way of the network board (NB) shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In particular, the flowchart shows NetSpot operation during device password entry for data set in a RAM 302 of the network board (NB) 101.
    </p>
    <p num="1001">
      In Step S100 in this same figure, NetSpot which was installed in the hard disk (HD) 511 (FIG. 5) is started by the user.
      <br/>
      The process next proceeds to Step S101, in which a NetSpot Password Entry Dialog Box (FIG. 10) appears requesting entry of the NetSpot password.
      <br/>
      Then in Step 102 the user enters the NetSpot password in the NetSpot Password Entry Dialog Box (FIG. 10).
      <br/>
      In Step S103 it is determined made as to whether the NetSpot password entered by the user in Step S102 matches the password set during the NetSpot install.
      <br/>
      If the two passwords are a match, the process proceeds to Step S105 and if the two passwords do not match the process proceeds to Step S104.
    </p>
    <p num="1002">
      In Step S104, the warning message of FIG. 11 appears to instruct the user to enter the correct NetSpot password.
      <br/>
      Once the user selects the OK button, the process once again proceeds to Step S102.
    </p>
    <p num="1003">
      In this way, the process with the matching passwords then proceeds to Step S105 where the device list window shown in FIG. 15 is displayed and a list of network printers capable of acquiring information and settings is shown.
      <br/>
      Then in Step S106, the user selects the desired network printer from the network printer list shown in the device list window (FIG. 15) Step S105.
      <br/>
      Then in Step S107 the device word stored in the RAM 302 of the network board (NB) 101 for the network printer 102 selected in Step S106, is acquired.
    </p>
    <p num="1004">
      The process next proceeds to Step S108, in which it is determined whether the device password acquired in Step S107 matches the NetSpot password entered by the user in Step S102.
      <br/>
      If the two passwords match the process shifts to Step S113 and if the two do not match the process shifts to Step S109.
      <br/>
      In this Step S109, the password acquired in Step S107 is determined not to match the NetSpot password entered by the user so that a device password entry dialog box (FIG. 50) is displayed to request the user to enter the correct password and the process standby for entry of the password by the user.
      <br/>
      Thus, in Step S110, the device password is entered in the device password entry dialog box (FIG. 50) shown in Step S109.
    </p>
    <p num="1005">In Step Sill, a determination is made whether the device password acquired in Step S107 matches the device password entered by the use in Step S110 and if the two passwords match, the process proceeds to Step S113, while if the two passwords do not match, the process proceeds to Step S112.</p>
    <p num="1006">
      In Step S112 a message appears to instruct the user to enter the correct password by means of the warning message displayed in FIG. 51 and after the user selects the OK button, the process proceeds again to Step S109.
      <br/>
      Also, in Step S113, the device window (FIG. 43) is displayed and acquisition and settings of detailed information are performed for the network printer selected by the user in Step S106.
    </p>
    <p num="1007">
      In the above described embodiment, it is determined whether the device password acquired from the network printer in Step S107, matches the NetSpot password entered by the user in Step S110.
      <br/>
      When these two passwords match, detailed information on the device can be acquired in Step S113.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the password entry operation of Step S109, Step S110, Step Sill and Step S113 can be eliminated.
      <br/>
      This eliminating unit that the operability of NetSpot can be drastically improved.
    </p>
    <p num="1008">FIG. 151 is a flowchart showing the process when controlling the printer 102 from NetSpot in operation by the computer (103, 104, etc.) of this embodiment when setting the device password in that network board (NB) 101. Here, the flowchart in FIG. 151 shows NetSpot password settings during the NetSpot install and assumes that the device password has not yet been set for controlling the target network printer.</p>
    <p num="1009">
      In the same figure, in Step S200, NetSpot installed in the hard disk (HD)511 in FIG. 5, by the user is started up.
      <br/>
      In Step S201, a NetSpot password entry dialog box (FIG. 10) appears to request NetSpot password entry by the user.
      <br/>
      The process then proceeds to Step S202 and awaits entry by the user of the NetSpot password in the NetSpot password entry dialog (FIG. 10) box shown in Step S201.
    </p>
    <p num="1010">
      In Step S203, it is determined whether the device password set during the NetSpot install, matches the NetSpot password entered by the user in Step S202.
      <br/>
      If the two passwords match, the process proceeds to Step S205 and when these two passwords do not match the process proceeds to Step S204.
      <br/>
      In this Step S204, the warning message shown in FIG. 11 is displayed to instruct the user to enter the correct password.
      <br/>
      After the user selects the OK button, the process proceeds again to Step S202.
    </p>
    <p num="1011">
      The process then proceeds to Step S205 where the device list window shown in FIG. 15 is displayed and a list of network printers capable of acquiring information and settings is shown.
      <br/>
      Then in Step 206, the process awaits selection by the user of the desired network printer from the network printer list shown in the device list window (FIG. 15).
      <br/>
      In Step S207, it is determined whether or not to use the device password at the NetSpot password.
      <br/>
      When using the device password at the NetSpot password, the process proceeds to Step S211.
      <br/>
      When not using the device password at the NetSpot password the process proceeds to Step S208.

      Next, the exclusive control sequence for the controller mode is explained.
      <br/>
      The following explanation is made while mainly referring to FIG. 153 (exclusive control sequence in controller mode), FIG. 154 (inquiry sequence to find if device can be accessed in controller mode), FIG. 155 (agent operation), FIG. 156 (SNMP message format), and FIG. 157 (Figure showing SNMP command exchange between manager and agent).
      <br/>
      Further, in the explanation of these figures, a description of the functions for the figure just mentioned is given while referring in particular to FIG. 3, FIG. 5, FIG. 15, FIG. 43, FIG. 52, FIG. 53 and FIG. 145 through FIG. 147.
    </p>
    <p num="1015">FIG. 153 is a flowchart showing the exclusive control sequence of the controller mode for the embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="1016">
      The user selects the device for control on the device window (FIG. 15) of NetSpot installed in controller mode, and when �Device-Open� is selected from the menu, or when the device to be controlled is double-clicked on the device list; the sequence shown in this flowchart starts up.
      <br/>
      In the following explanation, unless specified to the contrary, the CPU501 shown in FIG. 5 will serve as the main element of hardware for making determinations and implementing functions.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the network management utility program stored in the hard disk 511 serves as the hardware.
    </p>
    <p num="1017">
      In the exclusive control sequence of the controller mode shown in FIG. 153, a check is first made in Step S15301 as to whether the device to be controlled can be accessed in controller mode.
      <br/>
      Various methods are available to perform this check.
      <br/>
      For instance in one method, an MIB equivalent to flag is mounted in the device for showing if a user is obtaining access in controller mode and when a value is written from the network management utility program showing access in controller mode, a determination can be made based the written value.
    </p>
    <p num="1018">The method is shown in FIG. 154. In the following sequence description, the operation in Step S15301 is described in detail utilizing FIG. 153.</p>
    <p num="1019">The description assumes that an SNMP agent operates the device to be controlled and that a Canon MIB as described in FIG. 4 is installed.</p>
    <p num="1020">
      This Canon MIB has an MIB object to show whether or not a user is operating the device in controller mode.
      <br/>
      A �1� is set as the value when no user is operating in controller mode; a �2� is set as the value when there is a user operating in controller mode.

    </p>
    <p num="1021">
      This SNMP protocol is briefly explained using on the following explanation.
      <br/>
      The PC (hereafter referred to as the manager) operated by the network manager utility software, and the SNMP agent operating the network device (hereafter referred to as agent) to be controlled, utilize the SNMP protocol to perform communications tasks.
      <br/>
      The SNMP protocol has five types of commands.
      <br/>
      These are called respectively, Get-Request, Get-next-request, Get-response, Set-request, and Trap.
      <br/>
      The situation in which these commands are exchanged between the manager and the agent is shown in FIG. 157.
    </p>
    <p num="1022">
      The "Get-request" and "Get-next-request" are commands sent by the manager to the agent in order that the manager can acquire MIB object values of the agent.
      <br/>
      Agents that receive these commands send a "Get-response" command to the manager in order to report the MIB values to the manager (15701 and 15702 of FIG. 157).
    </p>
    <p num="1023">
      The "Set-request" is a command sent by the manager to the agent in order to set MIB object values of the agent.
      <br/>
      The agent that receives these commands sends a "Get-response" command to the manager in order to report the setting results to the manager (15703).
    </p>
    <p num="1024">The "Trap" is a command sent by the agent to the manager to report that a change has occurred in the agent's own status (15704).</p>
    <p num="1025">
      FIG. 156 shows all commands except for the Trap.
      <br/>
      In other words, Get-Request, Get-next-request, Get-response, and Set-request.
    </p>
    <p num="1026">
      FIG. 156 shows the SNMP message of 15600.
      <br/>
      This SNMP message comprises a version 15601, a community name 15602 and a zone 15603 referred to as a PDU.
      <br/>
      This PDU is shown in more detail with PDU15610.
      <br/>
      This PDU15610 has a PDU type 15611, a request ID15612, an error status 15613, an error status 15614 as well as an MIB information 15615.
      <br/>
      A value to identify commands is stored in the PDU type 15611.
      <br/>
      In other words, a value of �0� in this field signifies "Get-request, �1� signifies "Get-next-request", �2� signifies "Get-response", �3� signifies "Set-request".
      <br/>
      Values showing error information are stored in the error status 15313.
      <br/>
      The value in this field is "0" when no errors are present.
      <br/>
      Sets formed of object Ids and their values are stored in the MIB information 15615.
    </p>
    <p num="1027">
      To investigate whether a device to be controlled can be accessed in controller mode, first in Step 15401 of FIG. 154, in order to determine whether access to the device to be controlled is possible in controller mode, a set request for writing of the value �2� in the MIB object is sent for the device to be controlled to find out if another user is operating the device in controller mode.
      <br/>
      Next, the process proceeds to Step S15402, where the process stands by for a reply from the SNMP agent operating the device to be controlled.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the process awaits a Get-response to come back from the SNMP agent in reply to the Set request.
      <br/>
      Once the Get-response comes back, the process proceeds to Step 15403 and a check is made as to whether the writing onto the MIB object succeeded.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the error status 15413 from among the Get-response packet is checked and the presence or absence of an error is determined.
      <br/>
      If the error status field 15413 is �0�, in other words if the writing was a success, then the process proceeds to Step S15404 and access to the controller mode is now known to be possible so the access okay flag is raised (set to on).
      <br/>
      This access okay flag is assigned to one zone of the RAM503 in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      This access okay flag is referred to in the subsequent Step S15302 in FIG. 153. When this procedure is completed in Step S15404, the process then ends with Step 15301 in FIG. 153.
    </p>
    <p num="1028">
      However, in Step S15403, if the value in the error status field is other than �0�, in other words if a write failure occurred, then the process proceeds to Step S15404 and the access okay flag is lowered (set to off) to show access is not possible in controller mode.
      <br/>
      When the process ends in this way in Step S15405, the process ends with Step S15301 in FIG. 153.
    </p>
    <p num="1029">
      Next the explanation returns to FIG. 153, and a check is made in Step S15301 as to whether access to the device to be operated is possible in controller mode and the process then moves to Step S15302.
      <br/>
      In Step 15302, the access okay flag is checked for results reflecting the check in Step S15301 and if it is found that access is possible (flag at on) in controller mode for the device to be operated then the process moves to Step S15303 where the device window is opened in controller mode (FIG. 43) in order to access the device.
      <br/>
      Consequently, when the device window is opened in controller mode in Step S15303, then the exclusive control procedure for controller mode ends.
    </p>
    <p num="1030">
      On the other hand, in Step S15302, when results of the check in Step 15301 show that access is not possible (flag is off) in controller mode to the device to be operated, then the process proceeds to Step S15304.
      <br/>
      In Step S15304, the information that the device to be operated is already being operated by another user in controller mode is displayed.
      <br/>
      More specifically, for instance as shown for the third device in FIG. 146 or FIG. 147, a key mark is affixed on the device display in order to show that the device is already locked (in use) by another user.
    </p>
    <p num="1031">
      When the operation in Step S15304 ends, the process proceeds to Step S15305 in which an inquiry dialog is displayed (FIG. 52) to inquire whether to automatically operate in controller mode even when another user is already operating the device in controller mode.
      <br/>
      The process then waits for the user to enter a "Y" or an "N" from a keyboard 509 in FIG. 5, or utilize a pointing device to specify the "Yes" or the "No" button.
      <br/>
      Once the user has made entry, the process proceeds to Step S15306 and identifies the entry from the user.
      <br/>
      In Step S15306, if the input from the user was "Yes", in other words, when an automatic display in Controller Mode" is to be shown then the process proceeds to Step S15307.
      <br/>
      In this step S15307, a �1� value is written to show in the MIB installed in the device to be controlled, that there is currently no user accessing the device in controller mode.
      <br/>
      More specifically, a Set-request packet is sent for the device to be operated in order to write the �1� value.
      <br/>
      Further in this Step S15307, the process awaits the return of the Get-response from the device to be operated in response to the writing (Set) and once the response is received the process returns to Step S15301 and then continues.
      <br/>
      In this way when the process returns to Step S15301 after performing the process of Step S15307, the results of the check as to whether access of the device to be operated is possible in controller mode in Step S15301 will always show that access is possible.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a decision on the results in Step S15302 will always cause the process to shift to Step S15303, and the device window will open in controller mode (FIG. 43).
    </p>
    <p num="1032">
      On the other hand, if the user selects "No" in Step S15306, in other words, decides not to automatically display in "Controller Mode", then the process proceeds to Step S15308.
      <br/>
      In this Step S15308, an inquiry dialog box (FIG. 53) is displayed to inquire whether or not to open a device window for the user in user mode, in order to make available the chance to open a device window in user mode to display information relating to the device to be controlled, even when the device to be controlled is already being operated by another user in controller mode.
      <br/>
      The process then stands by for the use to enter "Y" or "N" from the keyboard 509 in FIG. 5 or to select the "Yes" or "No" buttons with a pointing device not shown in the display.
      <br/>
      Once the user makes this entry, the process moves to Step S15309 which identifies the users entry.
      <br/>
      If the user entry was "Yes", in other words, if the user specified displaying the device window in "User Mode" then the process moves to Step S15310 and the device window then opens up in "User Mode" (FIG. 145).
      <br/>
      In this way, the device window is opened in "User Mode" in Step S15310 and the exclusive control sequence for the controller mode ends.

    <p num="1033">However when it is identified in Step S15309 that the user entered "No", in other words, if display of the device window in User Mode was not specified, then the process ends without opening the device window.</p>
    <p num="1034">Though not shown in FIG. 153, a Set is requested for writing a value �1� for the MIB object to display whether or not a user is accessing the device in controller mode, in order to determine that there is no user already accessing the device in controller mode when attempting to close the device window.</p>
    <p num="1035">
      Next, referring to the flowchart in FIG. 155, the functioning of the agent that operates the device to be controlled is explained.
      <br/>
      This operation is performed in conjunction with the network management program shown in FIG. 154. The main element in the hardware for implementing the sequence described in FIG. 155 is a microprocessor 301 on the network board 101 shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The main software element in implementing the same sequence is the agent program stored in the ROM303 in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      This agent communicates with a PC, for instance a PC103, operated by the network management software and provides information on the network device in which the agent is mounted according to the request from the network management software by way of the LAN100.
      <br/>
      The network management program in the PC103 shows the various screen displays as in FIG. 7 based on information acquired from the agent and shows on that screen display the various information acquired from the agent.
      <br/>
      The information set on the screen display is also set into the agent.
    </p>
    <p num="1036">
      In the agent operation, the arrival of an SNMP packet from the PC operated by the network management program connected via the LAN 100, is awaited in Step S15501.
      <br/>
      This PC (personal computer) may for instance be the PC103 in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The SNMP packet sent from the PC103 arrives at the network board 101 by way of the LAN100.
      <br/>
      The SNMP packet that arrived from the network board 101 is deployed on the RAM302 in FIG. 3 and the receipt of the SNMP packet is reported to the microprocessor 301 by means of a break-in routine.
      <br/>
      Therefore when the SNMP packet is received, the process proceeds to Step S15502 and whether or not that SNMP packet is requesting Set operation is determined.
      <br/>
      More specifically, a check is made as to whether a value �3� is present in the PDU type 15611 in the SNMP message shown in FIG. 156.
    </p>
    <p num="1037">
      When there has in fact been a request for Set operation the process moves to Step S15503 and a decision then made as to whether an exclusive control object subject to the Set operation is present, while referring to the MIB information field 15615 of FIG. 156. When this object subject to Set operation is in fact an exclusive control object the process moves to Step S15504.
      <br/>
      A decision is then made as to whether a �2� write value is present in this object or not for showing operation in controller mode.
      <br/>
      When a �2� is in fact present as the write value in the object for performing operation in controller mode, the process proceeds to Step S15505 and the presence or absence of a current value �2� in the exclusive control object for access in the RAM302 in FIG. 3 is determined.
    </p>
    <p num="1038">
      If the current value �2� is present for the exclusive control object, then this agent is already in the midst of being operated in controller mode by means of another terminal different from the terminal that sent the SNMP packet in step S15501.
      <br/>
      So the operation then proceeds to Step S15506 and a Get-response packet is sent to show a write-failure by the terminal that sent the SNMP packet.
      <br/>
      More specifically, a "genErr" is entered and sent to show a general error in the error status field 15613 of the Get-response packet.
    </p>
    <p num="1039">
      On the other hand, when the object subject to the set operation in Step S15503 is not an exclusive control object; or when there was no �2� as a write value in an object for exclusive control in Step S15504, to show the performing of operation in controller mode; or when the current value of the current object of exclusive control was not �2� in Step S15505; then the process shifts to Step S15507, the value of the MIB object is changed as requested in Set operation in the SNMP packet that was received.
      <br/>
      An appropriate Get-response packet is then sent according to the results according to the MIB object value, to the terminal that sent the Step S15501 packet in Step S15501.
      <br/>
      If there is no particular problem with the write operation, a Get-response packet whose error status field 15613 is �0� is sent.
    </p>
    <p num="1040">
      In Step S15502 if the SNMP packet that was received is not requesting Set operation, in other words, if the value of the PDU type 15611 to identify commands is �0� or if the value is �1� for showing the Get-next-request, then the process proceeds to Step S15508 and Get or Get-next operation is performed according to the configuration of the SNMP packet that was received.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the process in Steps 15506, Step S15507 and Step S15508 ends, the process proceeds to Step S15501 and the operation repeats from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p num="1041">
      The network device control program for the embodiment of the above described invention may be implemented with the PC500 through an externally installed program.
      <br/>
      Other methods for loading the PC500 are also applicable to this invention such as loading the program into the PC500 from a recording medium such as a CD-ROM, flash memory or floppy disk; or from an information group that includes a program from an external recording medium by way of a network such as via electronic mail or computer communications.
    </p>
    <p num="1042">
      One example of a recording medium is shown by the CD-ROM memory map in FIG. 158. The numeral 9999 shows the zone for storing the directory information and shows the position of zone 9998 for storing the subsequent install programs as well as the position of zone 9997 for storing the network device control program.
      <br/>
      The numeral 9998 is the zone for storing the install program.
      <br/>
      The numeral 9997 is the zone for storing the network device control program.
      <br/>
      To install the network control program of the embodiment of this invention in the PC500, first the install program stored in the zone 9998 is loaded and then run by the CPU501.
      <br/>
      Next, the install program run by the CPU501, extracts the network device control program from the zone 9997 where the network device control program is stored and sets the program into the hard disk 511.
    </p>
    <p num="1043">A system comprised of a plurality of devices (such as host computers, interface equipment) or an integrated unit or a unit consisting of one device are all applicable to this invention.</p>
    <p num="1044">Needless to say, the objective of this invention may also be fulfilled by a recording medium (such as FIG. 152) for recording a software program code for implementing functions of the aforementioned embodiment which is supplied to the computer (or CPU or MPU) of the system or unit to load and run the program code stored in the recording medium.</p>
    <p num="1045">In such a case, the program code loaded from the recording medium may itself be used to implement a novel function of this invention, and the recording medium that stores this program code may comprise this invention.</p>
    <p num="1046">
      As a recording medium for supplying the program code; floppy disks, hard disks, optical disks, magneto-optical disks, CD-ROMs, CD-Rs, magnetic tape, non-volatile memory cards and ROMs may for instance be utilized.
      <br/>
      Further, besides implementing the aforementioned functions of the embodiment by running the program code loaded by the computer, the OS (operating system) of the computer may perform all or a portion of the actual processing based on the instructions in the program code and by this processing implements the aforementioned functions of the embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="1047">Still further, after the program code loaded from the recording medium is written into the memory having a consisting of a function board inserted in the computer or a function expansion unit connected to the computer; the CPU performs all or a portion of the actual processing and by this processing implements the aforementioned functions of the embodiment.</p>
    <p num="1048">Needless to say, cases such as in which the program is sent to the person making the request by way of communications lines such as personal computer communications in which the program is loaded from a recording medium on which is recorded the software program code for implementing the functions of the aforementioned embodiment are also applicable to this invention.</p>
    <p num="1049">
      In the above described embodiment therefore, a decision is made in Step S207 whether or not to use the NetSpot password as the device password.
      <br/>
      In cases where the NetSpot password is used as the device password, the NetSpot password can be automatically set as the device password for the network printer selected in Step S206 and the device password setting process in Steps S209 and Step S210 can be eliminated.
      <br/>
      Eliminating these steps drastically improves the operability of network device management in NetSpot while maintaining system security.
    </p>
    <p num="1050">The embodiment of this invention also provides the benefit of preventing setting conflicts between users from occurring by limiting to one, the number of persons that can access one device for making changes to the settings in controller mode.</p>
    <p num="1051">Further, when another user is already accessing the device in the mode for changing settings (controller mode), this fact is shown on the screen display, to instruct all other users that access as a controller is currently impossible.</p>
    <p num="1052">Also, this embodiment provides a means for automatically accessing the device as controller even when another user is accessing the device in a mode that can change settings (controller mode).</p>
    <p num="1053">Still further, this embodiment provides a means to access the target device in a mode just for the display of information (user mode) and display information about the device, even when another user is accessing the device in a mode for making settings (controller mode).</p>
    <p num="1054">The embodiment of the inventions thus described therefore has the effect of allowing the same password to be used for both starting up the network management software, and for acquiring information and making settings in the target network device, so that password entry for access to a network device can be omitted and the operability of network management software can be greatly improved.</p>
    <p num="1055">This invention also has the effect of automatically setting a password identical to the password at startup of the network management software, as the network device password so that the burden on the user of setting a password for the network device to be controlled is alleviated.</p>
    <p num="1056">Another effect of the invention is preventing setting conflicts between users from occurring by limiting to one, the number of persons that can access one device for making changes to the settings in administrator mode.</p>
    <p num="1057">Still, another effect of the invention is that when another user is already accessing the device in mode for changing settings (administrator mode), this fact is shown on the screen display, to instruct all other users that access as an administrator is currently impossible.</p>
    <p num="1058">Yet another effect of this invention is that a means is provided for automatically accessing the device as an administrator even when another user is accessing the device in a mode that can change settings (administrator mode).</p>
    <p num="1059">A yet further effect of this invention is that a means is provided to access the device to be controlled, in a mode solely for the display of information (user mode) and for displaying information about the device, even when another user is accessing the device in a mode for making settings (administrator mode).</p>
    <p num="1060">As many apparently widely different embodiments of the present invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the appended claims.</p>
