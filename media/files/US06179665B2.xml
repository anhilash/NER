    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to an outlet strip designed to supply power to a plurality of devices in an organized manner.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to an outlet strip having a cable manager shaped to maintain cables of powered devices in an organized manner, and formed to permit coupling of a variety of devices thereto in an organized manner.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Accompanying the increasing use of powered devices is the increasing use of outlet strips permitting a plurality of devices to be powered through the same wall outlet.
      <br/>
      However, the connection of a plurality of power cables of various devices to the same outlet strip tends to result in the power cables extending in varying directions in a disorganized manner.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there has been an ongoing need to provide an outlet strip with the capability of maintaining order among the various power cables coupled to and extending therefrom.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Patent Des. 350,940 to Rossman et al. provides a surge protector having a cable management element and outlets along two faces of the housing.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Moreover, there has been an increase in the variety of electric, electronic, telecommunication devices used, such as computers, monitors, printers, telephones, facsimile machines, dictation equipment, and lamps, which devices have different power requirements.
      <br/>
      If the outlet strip only provides one type of outlet, then several different outlet strips must be provided, increasing the disorder of the environment of the powered devices.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there has been an ongoing need for the appropriate connections for such differently configured powered devices to be provided in an orderly manner on the same outlet strip.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in a surge protected outlet strip it would be desirable to provide similar surge protection for devices, such as communication devices and devices utilizing coaxial cable connections, which cannot be electrically connected to the surge protector circuit.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      The present invention provides an outlet strip which includes a plurality of electronic device receptacles for receiving electrical plugs or jacks.
      <br/>
      A cable manager comprising a plurality of cable management devices is associated with the housing of the outlet strip for ordering power cables along the housing.
      <br/>
      Each of the device receptacles provided on the outlet strip may be surge protected to protect the device coupled thereto against power surges.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Additionally, the present invention provides an outlet strip which has a top surface and two side surfaces.
      <br/>
      An electronic device receptacle for receiving electrical plugs or jacks is present on each of the housing surfaces.
      <br/>
      Thus, the number of devices which may be coupled to the outlet strip of the present invention is greater than the number of devices which may be coupled to an equivalently sized outlet strip not formed in accordance with the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a cable manager is provided on the outlet strip housing to order the cables coupled thereto.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="7">

      As may be appreciated with reference to FIG. 1, each electrical plug receptacle 20 includes at least a pair of parallel elongated openings 21a, 21b shaped to receive the parallel elongated flat blades of a standard electrical plug.
      <br/>
      Electrical plug receptacles 20 preferably also include a third prong opening 21c for receiving a grounding prong if provided on the electrical plug to be received by electrical plug receptacle 20.
      <br/>
      These plugs or jacks contain metal prongs or leads which transmit electrical current.
      <br/>
      Because receptacles 20 and 22 have different power requirements, these receptacles preferably are electrically isolated from each other.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, at least some of electrical plug receptacles 20 are sufficiently spaced apart to permit transformer blocks (e.g., a/c adapters) to be plugged into an electrical plug receptacle 20 without interfering with access to an adjacent receptacle.
      <br/>
      As may be appreciated with reference to FIGS. 1, 3, and 4, the parallel longitudinal axes of elongated openings 21a and 21b of each of the electrical plug receptacles 20 on at least one surface of outlet strip 10 are parallel to each other and are not collinear.
      <br/>
      Such orientation permits a transformer block to be plugged into any of electrical plug receptacles 20 without interfering with access to an adjacent receptacle and without requiring the same amount of spacing between the receptacles as would be required if all elongated openings 21a on the same surface were collinear and all elongated openings 21b on the same surface were collinear, as in standard outlet strips (or as in top surface 28a of the outlet strip 10 shown in FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      The space saved by orienting receptacles 20 with all elongated openings 21a and 21b parallel and non-collinear permits additional receptacles, such as an additional electrical plug receptacle 20 or communication data line jack receptacles 22, to be provided on the same surface as such receptacles are provided.
      <br/>
      Additionally, if electrical plug receptacles 20 are grounded, the three receptacle holes are arranged to accept a transformer block securely, without offsetting the physical balance of housing 26.
      <br/>
      For example, the third prong may be positioned above the adjacent pair of prongs so that the typically longer portion of a transformer block is oriented upwards.
      <br/>
      Greater than two communication line jacks 22 may be provided such that communication signals for greater than one device may be passed through outlet strip 10, an input signal being available or two or more output jacks 22.
      <br/>
      Any type of communication line jack 22 (e.g., RJ11 or RJ45) may be provided for any desired number of lines.

    <p num="10">
      A power button 16 and preferably also an associated on/off indicator 17, such as a light, are provided to selectively supply power to receptacle 12 of outlet strip 10.
      <br/>
      However, at least one of receptacles 12 may be constantly provided with power regardless of whether power button 16 is on or off.
      <br/>
      Outlet strip 10 preferably provides surge protection for each of receptacles 12 such that each device connected thereto is protected against power surges which otherwise may damage the device.
      <br/>
      Surge protection may be achieved through the use of surge suppression devices such as transient voltage surge suppressor devices (e.g., metal oxide varisters (MOVs), varisters, or SIDACtors (tm)  (manufactured by Teccor Electronics, Inc. of Irving, Tex.)).
      <br/>
      Preferably, surge protection is provided even if power button 16 is off, so long as outlet strip 10 is plugged into a wall receptacle.
      <br/>
      Because receptacles 20 and 22 have different power requirements, the surge suppression circuits for these different types of receptacles are preferably electrically isolated from each other.
      <br/>
      If desired, a circuit breaker may also be provided with a reset button 18.
      <br/>
      Communication line jacks 22 may be provided with line filtering if desired in addition or as an alternative to surge protection.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Outlet strip 10 is preferably provided with indicators 19, 21 electrically coupled to the internal circuitry of outlet strip 10 for electrical status indicating purposes.
      <br/>
      For example, indicator 19 may be provided to indicate whether the surge suppression circuit is functioning properly and providing surge protection.
      <br/>
      Indicator 19 may be a light which is on so long as surge protection is provided by outlet strip 10.
      <br/>
      Alternatively or additionally, an alarm may sound if surge protection is no longer being provided.
      <br/>
      A wiring status indicator 21, such as a light or an audible alarm, may be provided for such purpose as to indicate the site wiring, i.e., whether the wall receptacle into which outlet strip 10 is plugged is properly wired.

    <p num="12">
      In accordance with the principles of the present invention, and as will be appreciated with reference to FIGS. 1, 3, and 4, housing 26 of outlet strip 10 has at least three power surfaces along which device receptacles 12 are provided.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 1, 3, and 4, a plurality of receptacles 12 are provided on each of a top power surface 28a, a first side power surface 28b, and a second side power surface 28c.
      <br/>
      Although communication line jacks 22 are shown along first side power surface 28b, it will be appreciated that communication line jacks 22 may instead, or in addition, be provided along any or all of the other power surfaces 28a, 28c.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it will be appreciated that the present invention is not to be limited to the precise arrangement of receptacles 12 shown in the Figures.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The arrangement of receptacles 12 along greater than two surfaces of housing 26 increases the total number of receptacles 12 which may be provided on outlet strip 10 without increasing the overall size and amount of space occupied by outlet strip 10.
      <br/>
      Thus, it will be appreciated that other arrangements of power surfaces 28a, 28b, 28c relative to each other are within the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      It will be further appreciated that although housing 26 is substantially rectangular such that side power surfaces 28b and 28c are each substantially perpendicular to top power surface 28a, other housing shapes are within the scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Housing 26 of outlet strip 10 is designed to handle a plurality of functions.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the circuits for each function are electrically isolated from one another.
      <br/>
      In order to permit the unique arrangement of receptacles 12 on greater than three surfaces of outlet strip housing 26, the internal wiring and circuitry of outlet strip 10 must be efficiently arranged within the confines of housing 26.
      <br/>
      Preferably the signals passing through outlet strip 10 are isolated from one another so that clean signals are output to devices coupled thereto.
      <br/>
      Such isolation may be accomplished, for example, by providing circuitry for different types of receptacles on different circuit boards.
      <br/>
      Preferably, such different circuit boards are also physically separated from one another.
      <br/>
      In particular, it is preferable to separate the low voltage circuits from the high voltage circuits.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, receptacles 12 along side power surfaces 28b, 28c are mounted on vertically arranged circuit boards.
      <br/>
      Embossments on the interior of housing 26 preferably are provided to hold the circuit boards in vertical, spaced apart positions as well as to support the side receptacles.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that other arrangements of the internal circuitry of outlet strip 10 are within the scope of the invention.

      Cable manager 14 of outlet strip 10 preferably is provided at a location convenient for retention of power cables PC coupled to any or all of receptacles 12.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, as may be appreciated with reference to FIG. 1, cable manager 14 is provided on an end face 28d of outlet strip housing 26 adjacent and extending between power surfaces 28a, 28b, and 28c.
      <br/>
      Thus, power cables PC extend along longitudinal axis 11 from a respective receptacle 12 to cable manager 14.
      <br/>
      Cable manager 14 is sized and configured to retain the power cables PC within a substantially confined region adjacent end face 28d.

      In a preferred embodiment, as shown in FIG. 1, cable manager 14 includes first and second arms 14a, 14b with an insertion slot 15 therebetween through which power cables PC are inserted to be maintained within retention space 40 between arms 14a, 14b.
      <br/>
      Arms 14a, 14b are sufficiently long to permit power cables PC coupled to receptacles 12 along side power surfaces 28b, 28c to enter cable manager 14 sideways.

      Outlet strip 110 of FIG. 2 also has a plurality of electronic device receptacles 112, including, without limitation, electrical plug receptacles 120, communication data line jack receptacle 122 (such as described above with reference to jacks 22 of outlet strip 10), and coaxial cable connector receptacles 124 (at least one receptacle for receiving a signal and a corresponding receptacle for emitting the surge protected and/or line filtered signal).
      <br/>
      Preferably, electrical plug receptacles 120 are grounded.
      <br/>
      Because receptacles 120, 122, and 124 have different power requirements, these different types of receptacles are preferably electrically isolated from one another.
      <br/>
      As may be appreciated with reference to FIG. 2, electrical plug receptacles 120 preferably are substantially symmetrically positioned on top power surface 128a on either side of longitudinal axis 111 of outlet strip 110.
      <br/>
      Preferably electrical plug receptacles 120 are sufficiently spaced to permit transformer blocks (e.g., a/c adapters) to be coupled thereto without interfering with access to an adjacent receptacle 12.
      <br/>
      Communication line jacks 122 may be provided in an end surface 128d of housing 126 and coaxial cable connectors 124 may be provided on top surface 128a, preferably along longitudinal axis 111, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      However, other arrangements are within the scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Outlet strip 110 preferably provides similar surge protection, circuit breakers, and/or line filtering as provided by outlet strip 110.
      <br/>
      Thus, a power button 116 with accompanying power indicator 117, reset button 118, and indicators 119, 121 are similarly provided to serve functions similar to those described above with reference to corresponding elements of outlet strip 10 (referenced by the same reference numeral decreased by a value of one-hundred).

      If desired, a speaker 123 may be provided for further indicating purposes, such as an alarm.
      <br/>
      For instance, an alarm may sound if outlet strip 110 takes a surge.
      <br/>
      Preferably, surge protection is available so long as outlet strip 10 is plugged into a wall outlet, even if power button 116 is off.
      <br/>
      Because receptacles 120, 122, and 124 have different power requirements, the surge suppression circuits for these different types of receptacles are preferable electrically isolated from one another.

      In accordance with the principles of the present invention, in order to provide orderly management of power cables PC extending from top power surface 128a on both sides of longitudinal axis 111, cable manager 114 includes preferably a plurality of cable management devices 130 extending from each side 128b, 128c of outlet strip housing 126.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, a cable management device 130 is provided for each electrical plug receptacle 120.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Each cable management device 130 is shaped to at least partially encircle and thereby restrain a power cable PC.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, as may be appreciated with reference to FIG. 5, each cable management device 130 is in the form of a hook-like member shaped and configured to maintain power cables PC adjacent outlet strip housing 126 in an orderly manner.
      <br/>
      Preferably, cable management device 130 has at least a top extension 132 extending outwardly from and substantially parallel to top power surface 128a and a side extension 134 extending downwardly from top extension 132 substantially parallel to side surfaces 128b, 128c.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Although housing 126 and cable manager 114 may be molded as a unitary piece, in order to facilitate manufacturing each cable management device 130 is preferably formed separately from the remainder of housing 126.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, top extension 132 and side extension 134 are molded as a single, unitary angled piece shaped to form extensions 132, 134.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 5, top extension 132 is formed with a recess 133 for receiving an attachment extension 128e of top power surface 128a.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, housing 126 is formed with upper and lower halves.
      <br/>
      A portion of top extension 132 preferably extends and is locked between the housing halves, thereby fixing the cable management device 130 to housing 126 and to the remainder of outlet strip 110.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that other manners of fixing each cable management device 130 to housing 126 are within the scope of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In a preferred embodiment, each cable management device 130 also includes a lower extension 136 extending inwardly, towards outlet strip housing 126, from lower end 135 of side extension 134.
      <br/>
      Lower extension 136 preferably is formed as a unitary piece with upper extension 132 and side extension 134 (i.e., the entire cable management device 130 is molded as a unitary angled piece with extensions 132, 134, 136).
      <br/>
      Lower extension 136 preferably extends parallel to, but is shorter than upper extension 132, such that free end 137 of lower extension 136 is spaced from outlet strip housing 126 to leave an insertion space 139 therebetween.
      <br/>
      Insertion space 139 is sized to permit insertion of power cables PC therethrough for retention within a cable retention space 140 substantially enclosed by extensions 132, 134, 136 and outlet strip housing 126.
      <br/>
      Lower extension 136 permits power cables PC with small diameters to be securely retained by cable management device 130 along with thicker power cables PC.
      <br/>
      Thus, the size of insertion space 139 and the length of lower extension 136 are selected such that thicker power cables may be passed therethrough, yet small diameter wires also securely maintained within retention space 140.
      <br/>
      The shape of lower extension 136 need not correspond exactly to the shape of top extension 132, so long as a sufficient ledge is formed by lower extension 136 to support power cables within retention space 140.
      <br/>
      For instance, free end 137 of lower extension 136 may be pointed, as shown in FIG. 6, or rounded, as shown in FIG. 7.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      If it is desired to provide greater flexibility to lower extension 136, such as to facilitate insertion of power cables PC past lower extension 136 and into retention space 140, lower extension 136 may be formed to be more flexible than extensions 132, 134.
      <br/>
      In such embodiment, it is preferable to choose a flexible material for lower extension 136 which is compatible with the material of extensions 132, 134 so that lower extension 136 may be securely bonded to lower end 135 of side extension 134.
      <br/>
      For example, cable management devices 130 formed of top extension 132 and side extension 134 may be formed from a relatively rigid moldable material such as polystyrene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or acrylonitrile butabiene styrene (ABS), and a separate lower extension 136 formed of polypropylene (or other suitable material) may be bonded thereto.
      <br/>
      Outlet strip housing 126 is formed from a suitable UL (Underwriter's Labs) grade material which provides the desired rigidity and forming properties (e.g., moldability), such as polystyrene, polypropylene, PVC or ABS.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      As described above, cable manager 114 of outlet strip 110 includes a cable management device 130 for each receptacle 120.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, cable management devices 130 are formed from a colorable material, each cable management device 130 being colored differently.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a plurality of bands, labels, tags, clips, or other marking elements 142 are provided for placement on a power cable PC.
      <br/>
      Each marking element 142 is preferably color coded for one-to-one correspondence with the colored cable management devices 130.
      <br/>
      Thus, a user may identify the receptacle 114 to which a power cable PC is coupled by matching the color of the associated cable management device 130 (adjacent the receptacle 114) with the color of the matching marking element 142 on the power cable PC, thereby reducing the chance of decoupling the wrong power cable PC from outlet strip 110.

      As may be seen with reference to FIG. 6, mounting element 200 is in the form of an elongated keyhole having a pair of slots 206 extending from opposite sides of an insertion opening 206.
      <br/>
      As may be seen with reference to FIG. 7, mounting element 202 is in the form of a traditional keyhole having a single slot 206 extending, preferably along longitudinal axis 11, 111, from one side of an insertion opening 206.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that other forms of mounting elements may be provided in addition to or instead of the mounting elements described herein, the scope of the present invention not being limited to the precise configurations depicted in FIGS. 6 or 7.
      <br/>
      It will further be appreciated that although mounting elements 200, 202 are shown on the bottom face of outlet strip 110, the same mounting elements 200, 202 may be provided on the bottom face of outlet strip 10, and thus the bottom face of outlet strip 10 is not shown for the sake of simplicity.
