      The present invention relates to a process and an integrated plant to be used in the process for the preparation of synthetic fuel (synfuel) and production of electrical energy.
      <br/>
      A part of the energy produced is used for the operation of the energy requiring steps of the process, whereas the residual part is exported for other purposes.
      <br/>
      The warm exhaust gas from the part of the plant producing electrical energy is fed to a preheating step for natural gas being used as a starting material for the preparation of synfuel.

  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <p num="1">This application is a 371 of PCT/No. 98/00023 filed on Jan. 23, 1998.</p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a processing and converting a hydrocarbonous gas, particularly natural gas in an integrated plant for the preparation of useful products, including chemical reaction products and mechanical or electrical power, as well as an integrated process plant for the accomplishment of such a process.</p>
    <p num="3">By the term &lt;&lt;hydrocarbonous gas&gt;&gt; in the present context and the appending claims is understood hydrocarbon compositions consisting of hydrocarbon components substantially existing in a gaseous form at standard pressure and temperature conditions.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Natural gas is an important part of numerous petrochemical reservoirs and can find utilization as starting materials for further refined products in the form of pure hydrocarbons and in the form of oxidized derivatives thereof.
      <br/>
      Further, natural gas can be used for the production of power such as electrical power or mechanical power.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In many instances the natural gas reservoirs are situated at remote sites from the established natural gas markets where the utilization thereof, as mentioned above, takes place.
      <br/>
      This is e.g. the case in Europe, where the petrochemical sources are situated at the sea bottom far away from the European continent.
    </p>
    <p num="6">As a consequence thereof it will not be economical to transport the gas through pipelines to the users, the pipeline systems being long and expensive to install and later also to maintain.</p>
    <p num="7">
      For this reason the options of converting natural gas to other transportable and useful products will be considered, such as e.g. synfuel (synthetically prepared engine fuels in liquid form) and electrical power.
      <br/>
      Depending on whether the further handling of the gas takes place at an offshore production platform or at the site of entering the ground, it is--provided that the further useful products are to be prepared at one and the same geographical site--economical to evaluate the integration benefits which may be achieved by a suitable connection of the various kinds of plants for the abovementioned purposes.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Natural gas substantially consists of methane admixed with other gaseous hydrocarbons, CO2 and gaseous sulphur compounds such as H2 S and lower mercaptanes.</p>
    <p num="9">
      When the methane is preheated to a temperature of the order 800 (degree)  C. and then is supplied with oxygen in a reforming step, oxygenated products of the methane are formed primarily in the form of CO and H2.
      <br/>
      This gas composition is called &lt;&lt;synthesis gas&gt;&gt;. Such a synthesis gas may alternatively be prepared by reacting the hydrocarbonous material with aqueous vapour under pressure and at high temperatures according to the scheme:
      <br/>
      CH4 +H2 O --&gt; CO+3H2.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      When the synthesis gas is formed by partial oxidation, energy is released in the form of heat.
      <br/>
      This heat may be recovered from this step and optionally transferred to mechanical or electrical power.
    </p>
    <p num="11">The synthesis gas may then be reacted in a further step to methanol and dimethyl ether or in a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to straight alkanes and/or alkenes of a higher molecular weight than the prevailing hydrocarbons of the natural gas.  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="12">
      The products of the reaction step of carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas is the product called &lt;&lt;synfuel&gt;&gt;(synthetic fuel) and being the intended product of the process.
      <br/>
      The chemical composition of the product will depend on the preparation method and the operation conditions.
      <br/>
      The term synfuel thus covers products such as methanol, dimethyl ether, mixtures of methanol and dimethyl ether, other oxygenates, Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbons and further processed products thereof, among others lubricants which may be prepared from the heavier Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbonous fractions.

      The Norwegian publication 179 169 discloses a process of converting natural gas to a normally liquid, carbonous compound such as methanol and/or dimethyl ether and/or liquid hydrocarbons of gasoline quality and/or olefins.
      <br/>
      The process avoids requirement of vapor reforming and/or adiabatic reforming of natural gas to synthesis gas using a substantially pure oxygen.
      <br/>
      The synthesis gas may be prepared at an operative pressure which is useful for converting the gas to methanol and/or dimethyl ether without recompression of the synthesis gas.
      <br/>
      The exhaust gas from the overhead has, subsequent to the conversion of the crude product methanol/DME and/or conversion to liquid hydro-carbons of gasoline quality, generally a BTU-capacity which is required for the use as fuel gas for the power supply being required for the operation of the required gas compression facilities used in the process.

      <br/>
      The exhaust gas is passed in a unit 2 through a heat exchange plant for efficient transfer of heat to the natural gas to be heated.
      <br/>
      When required, a plant for further direct heating of the prewarming unit may be provided.
      <br/>
      The exhaust gas is vented to the atmosphere after the delivery of heat to the prewarming unit.
    </p>
    <p num="49">The prewarmed natural gas at a temperature of at least 600 (degree)  C. is then passed through conduits 3 to a reforming reactor 4.</p>

      The synthesis gas including molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide as the further desired reactants, but in admixture with oxygen, carbondioxide, nitrogen and other unreacted natural gas components, is passed through the pipe 5 to a heat recovery plant 6.
      <br/>
      About 400 MW may be recovered therefrom on a yearly basis.
      <br/>
      This heat can be used for the production of power as e.g. indicated by a steam turbine 17.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The cooled synthesis gas is then passed through a pipe 10 to a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis plant 11.
      <br/>
      The Fischer-Tropsch reaction of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis plant will include a catalyst, e.g. a cobalt catalyst which, in addition to cobalt, may include parts of rhenium and thorium oxide as disclosed in European patent application 0220343 A-1 and Norwegian patent No. 178 958. The catalyst may exist in a fixed layer as well as in a suspended form in the process.
    </p>
    <p num="54">Typical operation conditions for Fischer-Tropsch conversion are:</p>
    <p num="55">
      1.
      <br/>
      Total pressure of 5-80 bar, preferably 10-50 bar, particularly 20-40 bar,
    </p>

    <p num="59">
      The produced synfuel is recovered as the product from the Fischer-Tropsch reaction through the outlet 12.
      <br/>
      This synfuel will be subject to a further refining process depending on the intended use, but this refining is not considered part of the present invention and is not disclosed herein.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      Fuel gas is recovered from the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis through the outlet 13.
      <br/>
      Part of this gas stream may be recycled to a conduit 15 to the process, mixed with the preheated gas and together with this, passed to the reforming reactor.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      The residual part is passed through a pipe 14 and mixed with natural gas fed through a conduit 32 to a gas power plant 30 which is simultaneously supplied with fuel air through a pipe 31.
      <br/>
      On an annual basis the gas power plant produces, by combustion of the mixture of natural gas and fuel gas from the Fischer-Tropsch reactor, about 1800 MW, at the same time supplying exhaust gas as previously mentioned for the preheating of the natural gas to the reforming.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      In the present embodiment the integrated plant further comprises a plant 40 comprising equipment for the preparation of liquefied natural gas (=LNG) by compression and cooling of 4 giga standard m3 per year of natural gas.
      <br/>
      Prior to condensing the natural gas to LNG, it is required to remove CO2 from the gas to be condensed.
      <br/>
      This is performed in a CO2 elimination plant 45.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      If the natural gas includes heavier components (NGL components such as methane, propane, butane etc.), it may also be required, depending on the amount and identity of such components, to separate such components from the starting material being fed to the LNG plant 40.
      <br/>
      Such separation of heavier components is performed in a NGL separation plant 47.

    <p num="64">The separated CO2 and heavier components which are separated in the NGL separation plant 47, are passed through conduit 46 and 48 respectively together with the fed 8 to the preheating step 2 prior to the reformation.</p>
    <p num="65">A cryogenic process for the separation of air or preparation of nitrogen (and which concomitantly will result in an oxygen enriched stream of air) which can be used in the present air separation plant, is e.g. described in the Norwegian publication for opposition No. 177728.</p>
    <p num="66">A process for the preparation of intermediate distillates in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis with cobalt catalysts including parts of zirconium, titanium and chromium, followed by a hydrogenation conversion of the total synthesized products on a born noble-metal catalyst is disclosed in the European patent application 0147873 A-1, and the conditions for the preparation of methanol from synthesis gas, is e.g. disclosed in the European patent application 0317035 A-2.</p>
    <p num="67">Particular benefits achieved by a plant according to the present invention of the kind disclosed herein, is that an integrated plant for the production of synfuel is obtained which, in addition to produce gas power in considerably economical amount, also results in exhaust gas which may be used for preheating the plant, the exhaust gas from the synfuel production constituting part of the fuel for the gas power plant to obtain a maximum utilization of products and side-products from this plant.</p>
    <p num="68">Such an integrated operation and such an integrated plant are, according to the applicant's knowledge, not previously described and constitute a valuable contribution to the field natural gas technology.</p>
