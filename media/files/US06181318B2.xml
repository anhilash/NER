      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates in general to an apparatus for converting resolution of an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) monitor, and more particularly to an apparatus for converting resolution of an LCD such that when a resolution of an image provided from an LCD monitor is low, it is converted according to a resolution of the LCD monitor by using a DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) and an IDCT (Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform).</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Generally, a LCD monitor has advantages in that it is light and can be made thin and an image is displayed usually clearly without distortion, so that its application is being extended for coverage including lap-top computers.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is necessary to convert the resolution of an image output from a computer the a resolution of the LCD monitor.
      <br/>
      When converting the resolution to that of the LCD monitor, a level of a color signal of predetermined R, G and B image signals provided from the computer to be displayed on a screen of the LCD monitor are amplified, brightness adjusted and converted to a digital signal.
      <br/>
      Then a microcomputer in the LCD monitor detects the operating mode of the computer by detecting the frequency of a horizontal synchronous signal and a vertical synchronous signal in order to recognize the image resolution.
      <br/>
      The resolution is recognizable because the frequencies between the horizontal synchronous signal and the vertical synchronous signal provided from various computers are different from each other according to the display graphics mode of the computer.
    </p>
    <p num="6">The computer may output the horizontal synchronous signal and the vertical synchronous signal in several ways that include separating to output the horizontal synchronous signal and the vertical synchronous signal; outputting a composite synchronous signals by mixing the horizontal synchronous signal and the vertical synchronous signal; or mixing and outputting the horizontal synchronous signal, vertical synchronous signal and R, G or B color signals.</p>
    <p num="7">
      The display graphics modes include: CGA (Color Graphics Adapter) mode; VGA (Video Graphics OuTay) mode; and SVGA (Super Video Graphics Array) mode.
      <br/>
      The frequency and resolution of the horizontal synchronous signal and the vertical synchronous signal are different for each of these modes.
      <br/>
      For example, in the CGA mode, a frequency of the horizontal synchronous signal is 15.75 KHz while that of vertical synchronous signal is 60 Hz and a resolution is 640 * 350.
      <br/>
      In the VGA mode, a frequency of the horizontal synchronous signal is 31.5 KHz while that of the vertical synchronous signal is 60 Hz or 70 Hz, and its resolution is 720 * 350 or 640 * 480.
      <br/>
      In the SVGA mode, a frequency of the horizontal synchronous signal is 35-37 KHz while that of the vertical synchronous signal V is interlaced, and its resolution is 800 * 600.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      As described above, when the microcomputer recognizes the resolution according to the display graphics mode, the separated horizontal synchronous signal and the vertical synchronous signal are output to a graphic controller in the monitor.
      <br/>
      The graphic controller varies divided values of a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) circuit according to the resolution recognized by the microcomputer, and adjusts a frequency of a pulse signal applied to an LCD panel so as to control the display.
      <br/>
      The LCD panel may provide a resolution of 1024 * 768.
      <br/>
      Thus, when an image with a resolution of 640 * 480 or 800 * 600 is applied, the graphic controller applies an artificial signal satisfying the resolution of 1024 * 768 to convert the image signal resolution to the resolution of 1024 * 768 and then outputs it to the LCD panel to be displayed.
      <br/>
      Namely, when an image with resolution of 640 * 480 is applied to an LCD panel with resolution of 1024 * 768, an actual picture through the LCD panel is converted to the resolution of 1024 * 768 through a resolution adjusting unit.
      <br/>
      In order to display the input image, additional pixels are inserted by the resolution adjusting unit, which has bad influence on the picture quality to be actually displayed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the conventional apparatus for converting resolution in a LCD monitor, when an image with a resolution of 640 * 480 or 800 * 600 is applied, this applied signal is converted to resolution of 1024 * 768 by simply fitting the size of the image to the LCD panel, thus the picture to be displayed is not clear.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="15">
      In FIG. 1 a block diagram of an apparatus for converting resolution of a conventional LCD monitor is shown having a signal amplifying and adjusting unit 10 which amplifies a level of a color signal of predetermined R, G and B image signals to be displayed on a screen of the LCD monitor which are provided from a computer.
      <br/>
      A clamp 20 adjusts a brightness by varying an image signal provided from signal amplifying and adjusting unit 10 according to a brightness control signal.
      <br/>
      An analog-to-digital converter 30 converts the analog amplified signal provided from clamp 20 to a digital image signal.
      <br/>
      A microcomputer 40 controls an overall operation of the LCD monitor.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Namely, the microcomputer 40 detects a horizontal synchronous signal H and a vertical synchronous signal V provided from the computer.
      <br/>
      The computer may output the horizontal synchronous signal H and the vertical synchronous signal V in several ways that include separating to output the horizontal synchronous signal H and the vertical synchronous signal V; outputting a composite synchronous signals by mixing the horizontal synchronous signal H and the vertical synchronous signal V; or mixing and outputting the horizontal synchronous signal H, a vertical synchronous signal V and R, G or B color signals.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the microcomputer 40 detects the horizontal synchronous signal H and the vertical synchronous signal V which are input from the computer through various ways.
      <br/>
      The microcomputer 40 detects the graphic display mode by means of the frequency of the horizontal synchronous signal H and the vertical synchronous signal V, and recognizes the resolution, accordingly.
      <br/>
      The resolution is recognizable because the frequencies between the horizontal synchronous signal H and the vertical synchronous signal V provided from the computer are different to each other according to each graphic display mode.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      As described above, when the microcomputer 40 recognizes the resolution according to the graphic display mode, the separated horizontal synchronous signal H and the vertical synchronous signal V are output to a graphic controller 50.
      <br/>
      The graphic controller 50 varies divided values of a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) circuit 53 according to the resolution recognized by the microcomputer 40, adjusts a frequency of an output pulse signal to apply it to an LCD panel 60 so as to be displayed.
      <br/>
      The graphic controller 50 includes a quantizing unit 51 for quantizing the digital image signal output from the analog-to-digital converter 30, and a resolution adjusting unit 52 for adjusting a resolution of the image represented by the quantized data output from the quantizing unit 51.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      As to the LCD monitor with the above construction, LCD panel 60 provides a resolution of 1024 * 768.
      <br/>
      Thus, when an image with a resolution of 640 * 480 or 800 * 600 is applied, the graphic controller 50 applies an artificial signal satisfying the resolution of 1024 * 768 to convert it to the resolution of 1024 * 768 and then outputs it to the LCD panel 60 to be displayed.
      <br/>
      Namely, as shown in FIG. 2, for example, when an image with resolution of 640 * 480 is applied to the LCD panel 60 with resolution of 1024 * 768, an actual picture through the LCD panel 60 is displayed with size of 640 * 480 at a central partial region, not the whole part of the LCD panel 60.
      <br/>
      However, when the image is converted to the resolution of 1024 * 768 through the resolution adjusting unit 52, in order to display the input image to the LCD panel 60, pixels of 1024-640=384 in number and lines of 768-480=288 in number are to be additionally inserted, which has a bad influence on the picture quality to be actually displayed.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Therefore, in the apparatus of FIG. 1, when an image with resolution of 640 * 480 or 800 * 600 is applied, since this applied signal is quantized and converted to a resolution of 1024 * 768 for simply fitting the size of the LCD panel, the picture to be displayed through the LCD is not clear.</p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 3 is a schematic block diagram of an apparatus for converting resolution of an LCD monitor in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      As shown in this drawing, a signal amplifying and adjusting unit 100 amplifies the levels of the R, G and B color components of an image signal provided from a computer 90 to be displayed on a screen of an LCD panel 600.
      <br/>
      A clamp 200 controls brightness by varying the levels of the image signal provided from the signal amplifying and adjusting unit 100 in accordance with a brightness control signal.
      <br/>
      An analog-to-digital converter 300 converts the analog signal provided from the clamp 200 to a digital image signal.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      A microcomputer 400 controls the general operation of the LCD monitor.
      <br/>
      Namely, the microcomputer 400 detects and/or separates the horizontal synchronous signal H and the vertical synchronous signal V provided from the computer 90, detects a graphic display mode by using the frequency of the horizontal synchronous signal H and the vertical synchronous signal V, and recognizes the resolution in accordance with the detected graphic display mode.
      <br/>
      When the microcomputer 400 recognizes the resolution, the horizontal synchronous signal H and the vertical synchronous signal V are output to a graphic controller 500.
    </p>
    <p num="22">Graphic controller 500 varies the divided value of a PLL circuit 550 in accordance with the resolution recognized by microcomputer 400, and converts the frequency of the output image signal to a resolution suitable of the LCD monitor by using a discrete-cosine transformation and an inverse discrete-cosine transformation, and then applies the resolution converted image to LCD panel 600 to be displayed.</p>
    <p num="23">The graphic controller 500 includes: a quantizer 510 for quantizing the digital image signal output from the analog-to-digital converter 300; a DCT unit 520 for dividing the data quantized by the quantizer 510 into blocks and converting it; resolution adjusting unit 530 for controlling the DCT coefficient for each block generated as a result of the conversion of the DCT unit 520 and adjusting it to the resolution provided by the LCD monitor; and an IDCT unit 540 for reversely converting the date input from the resolution adjusting unit 530 and restoring it to an original picture with a resolution corresponding to the resolution of the screen of the LCD panel 600.</p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 4 is a explanatory diagram representing DCT conversion and IDCT conversion adapted to the present invention.
      <br/>
      As shown in this drawing, when discrete-cosine transforming the first applied digital picture, the image is divided into 8 * 8 blocks and operation is performed according to an Equation 1,as shown in below.
      <br/>
      In addition to normal image division by 8 * 8 blocks, the image can also be divided by 4 * 4 blocks or 2 * 2 blocks.
      <br/>
      Equation 1:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="25">where, u, v=0, 1, 2, . . . N-1.</p>
    <p num="26">
      By performing the DCT as shown in Equation 1, the DCT coefficients for each 8 * 8 blocks are obtained.
      <br/>
      In this respect, the direct current (DC) component denotes an average value of the overall picture, and the alternating current (AC) components denote a variation of each picture.
      <br/>
      Likewise, after obtaining the DCT coefficients, when the image is restored by performing IDCT, there can be obtained an image which is almost the same as the original picture.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      As to the most spatial frequency distributions representing high definition of natural image, since a low frequency component is large while a high frequency component is small, the DCT utilizing such spatial frequency distribution is used to compress the image.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when the image is compressed by the DCT, compressibility is so excellent that the data to be transmitted is much decreased and the compressed image can be restored almost the same as the original image.
    </p>
    <p num="28">An operation of the apparatus for converting the resolution of the LCD monitor as constructed above in accordance with the present invention will now be described.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Assuming that the resolution of the image applied from the computer 90 is 640 * 480.
      <br/>
      First, R, G and B color signals of the predetermined image signal to be displayed on the screen of the LCD monitor are output and simultaneously the horizontal synchronous signal H and the vertical synchronous signal V are output from the computer 90.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The level of image signal supplied by the computer 90 is amplified by the signal amplifying and adjusting unit 100, the level of the input image signal input from the signal amplifying and adjusting unit 100 is varied by the clamp 200, to thereby adjust the brightness.
      <br/>
      The analog signal output from the clamp 200 is converted to a digital signal through the analog-to-digital converter 300 and is output to the graphic controller 500.
    </p>
    <p num="31">The horizontal synchronous signal H and the vertical synchronous signal V output from the computer 90 are detected, and separated if necessary, by the microcomputer 400; and the graphic display mode and the resolution of the input image are recognized by using the frequency of the detected horizontal synchronous signal H and vertical synchronous signal V. As the microcomputer 400 recognizes the resolution according to the graphic display mode, the separated horizontal synchronous signal H and the vertical synchronous signal V are output to graphic controller 500.</p>
    <p num="32">
      According to the resolution recognized by microcomputer 400, graphic controller 500 quantizes the image signal output from analog-to-digital converter 300 through quantizer 510.
      <br/>
      Thus quantized data is divided into blocks of 8 * 8 in number and then converted by DCT unit 520, thereby obtaining DCT coefficient corresponding to each block.
      <br/>
      As to the DCT coefficients obtained by the conversion in DCT unit 520, suitable values are applied for each of the coefficients so that they fit the resolution of 1024 * 768 provided by the LCD monitor through the resolution adjusting unit 530.
      <br/>
      The data output from resolution adjusting unit 530 is inversely converted by IDCT unit 540 so that a converted picture of 1024 * 768 is obtained from the original image of 640 * 480 which was initially applied and thus restored image is applied to LCD panel 600 to be displayed.
    </p>
    <p num="33">In this regard, the information of a digital picture is analyzed in the frequency area and the resolution of the applied image is converted, which, doubtless, also can be extensively applied to contour correction or image compression.</p>
    <p num="34">As so far described, the apparatus converts the resolution of an image according to the resolution of a LCD monitor of the present invention, when the resolution of the image input to the LCD monitor is lower than the resolution of the LCD monitor, utilizing the frequency of the input image, DCT and IDCT, unlike the known art where pixels and lines are forcefully inserted for conversion to a resolution of 1024 * 786, so that the image can be displayed on the LCD panel with remarkably improved picture quality.</p>
    <p num="35">Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as recited in the accompanying claims.</p>
