    <p num="4">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      FIGS. 10A and 10B are sectional views of a rod-shaped ultrasonic wave motor described in U.S. Ser. No. 340,469 as the prior art of the present invention.
      <br/>
      A vibration member 1 generates an oscillating vibration upon application of AC voltages to a piezoelectric member 3, and the surface particles of a sliding portion B make an elliptic motion.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a movable member 2 is in press-contact with the sliding portion B and receives a frictional driving force from the vibration member.
      <br/>
      At this time, a friction layer 1a on the vibration member side is an Ni-P-SiC composite galvanized layer, and is formed on the entire surface of the vibration member 1.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In this prior art, the function required of the friction layer is given by the composite galvanized layer.
      <br/>
      However, the galvanized layer must be formed on a portion that is not associated with the required function.
      <br/>
      When the galvanized layer itself can be uniformly and smoothly formed on the entire surface, this problem is concluded as only a wasteful treatment.
      <br/>
      However, a post-treatment is required after the galvanizing treatment due to the nonuniformity of the thickness, surface roughness, and warp of the galvanized layer.
      <br/>
      As a first example, since a sliding layer 1a' of the vibration member must effectively receive a minute displacement of the piezoelectric member, it must be finished to have a surface precision as high as that obtained by cutting or grinding.
      <br/>
      Thus, the sliding surface is subjected to lapping after the galvanizing treatment, in practice.
      <br/>
      The same applies to an actuator of a type in which a piezoelectric member is adhered to a vibration member.
      <br/>
      As a second example, since the resonance frequency of a vibration mode used for frictional driving must fall within a predetermined range, the galvanized portion must be removed in the post-treatment.
      <br/>
      More specifically, in the prior art shown in FIG. 10, the galvanized layer attached to a constricted portion 1d' of the vibration member 1 must be locally removed to adjust the resonance frequency to a predetermined value.
      <br/>
      This process is discussed in detail in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 5-300768, and a detailed description thereof will be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      On the other hand, some attempts have been made to utilize a resin, rubber, or the like as the friction layer.
      <br/>
      However, with this method, since the resin or rubber has a low rigidity, a molded member consisting of such a material cannot maintain a predetermined shape, and it becomes difficult to maintain high positional precision if such a member is coupled to the vibration member.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the molded member whose rigidity is increased by increasing its thickness is coupled to the vibration member, since the resin or rubber has large vibration attenuation, the energy loss of the motor becomes undesirably large.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The present invention has as its object to solve the above-mentioned conventional problems.
      <br/>
      As means for achieving the object of the present invention, a single conventional member is divided into two or more members, these members are separately manufactured in advance, and the members are coupled to obtain a member for a vibration member.
    </p>
    <p num="9">In other words, a functional portion required for a sliding friction layer, a portion required for magnifying a displacement of a sliding portion, and a structural portion required for a vibration member are separately formed in advance, and are then coupled to each other without disturbing the vibration performance of the vibration member.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="11">First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="12">
      FIG. 1 shows an ultrasonic wave motor as a vibration wave actuator serving as the presupposition of the first embodiment according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a longitudinal sectional view of the entire motor.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      A vibration member as a vibrator is constituted by sandwiching driving and sensor piezoelectric members (electro-mechanical or mechano-electrical energy conversion members) 3 and electrode plates 4 between upper and lower vibration member structural bodies 1 and 5, and then fastening them using a bolt 6.
      <br/>
      In order to electrically isolate the upper vibration member structural body 1 from the bolt 6, an insulating sheet 7 is inserted therebetween.
      <br/>
      The magnitude of a vibration displacement produced on a sliding surface 1b of the vibration member is adjusted by the diameter of a constricted portion 1d.
      <br/>
      A sliding surface 2b of a movable member 2 as a contact body is pressed against the sliding surface 1b by the expanding force of a coil spring 8.
      <br/>
      A displacement produced on the sliding surface 1b of the vibration member is transmitted to the movable member 2 via friction, and is output to an external portion via a gear 9.
      <br/>
      Note that the rotation of the gear 9 is transmitted to a gear X constituting a portion of a system.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      FIGS. 2A to 2H show the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2A shows an example wherein a sliding member 10-1 as a separate member is press-fitted on and coupled to the upper vibration member structural body 1.
      <br/>
      Conventionally, an Ni-P-SiC galvanized layer is formed on the entire surface of the upper vibration member structural body 1.
      <br/>
      However, in this embodiment, brass (JIS C3604) is directly used without any surface treatment.
      <br/>
      The sliding member 10-1 was manufactured by punching a precipitation hardening stainless steel plate into a ring shape by press working, and removing burrs, corner slopes, and the like by barrel finishing.
      <br/>
      Since such a shape can be easily manufactured by press working, the number of processes can be greatly reduced as compared to a working method such as cutting.
      <br/>
      The hardness of the stainless steel used was about 480 Hv (Vickers hardness), but could be increased to about 580 Hv (Vickers hardness) by performing an aging treatment of the stainless steel at a low temperature of 475 (degree)  C. In this manner, when a precipitation hardening material is used, it can be easily worked since it is relatively soft.
      <br/>
      In addition, since a hardening treatment for reducing the sliding wear amount is performed at a low temperature which causes almost no residual distortion, deformation and scaling are hard to occur.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Of course, martensitic stainless steel may be used, or austenitic stainless steel may be used after it is subjected to cold rolling to form a working-induced martensitic texture.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, austenitic stainless steel (JIS SUS316) with a high corrosion resistance may be used after its surface is subjected to a nitriding treatment.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the movable member is manufactured by hard-anodizing an aluminum alloy (JIS A5056H34).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      FIG. 2B shows an example wherein a projection having a trapezoidal section is formed on the end face of a sliding member.
      <br/>
      This sliding member 10-2 including the projection can be formed by cutting, sintering, press working, or the like.
      <br/>
      In the case of press working, the projection can be easily formed by pressing in the surface opposite to the projection.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Due to the presence of this projection, since the fragile anodized aluminum edge of the movable member side does not contact the sliding surface of the vibration member, the wear resistance can be improved.
      <br/>
      Since this projection is located outside the edge portion of the vibration member structural body 1, this sliding surface can be subjected to lapping (a treatment for pressing a rotating smooth disk against a sample to improve the flatness and surface roughness of the sample; since the disk surface contacts only the outermost surface of the sample, a recess portion cannot be subjected to lapping) after coupling.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The sliding member may be press-fitted on the upper vibration member structural body 1 or may be expansion- or shrinkage-fitted thereon.
      <br/>
      In addition, an adhesion force by an adhesive may also be used.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, coupling surfaces include a surface 1f parallel to the motor shaft and a surface 1e perpendicular to the motor shaft, and a gap 11-1 is formed between these surfaces so that the two surface do not cross each other.
      <br/>
      The coupling surface 1f serves to hold the sliding member 10-2 to be satisfactorily coaxial with the center of the motor shaft, and the coupling surface 1e serves to maintain high positional precision, in the motor shaft direction, of the sliding member 10-2.
      <br/>
      These two roles are common to the structure shown in FIG. 2A. In FIG. 2B, since the gap 11-1 is additionally formed, coupling (contact) on the coupling surface 1e is assured, and the positional precision, in the motor shaft direction, of the sliding member 10-2 is further improved.
      <br/>
      The coupling surface 1e may be located immediately below the trapezoidal portion.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2C shows an example wherein the outer circumferential side of a sliding member 10-3 is coupled to the vibration member structural body 1.
      <br/>
      The material of the sliding member includes ceramics such as alumina, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, SIALON, aluminum nitride, and the like; a material prepared by anodizing an aluminum alloy; inorganic materials such as graphite, glass, and the like; and cermets such as extra hard metals (carbide).
      <br/>
      Most of these materials are hard and can be good frictional members.
      <br/>
      In this case, since the breaking stress due to compression is relatively larger than the tensile stress, the outer circumferential surface side of the sliding member is used as one of the coupling surfaces.
      <br/>
      The sliding member consisting of any of the above-mentioned materials not only can provide a high frictional force but also can assure a high wear resistance.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the sliding member can satisfactorily serve as that for an ultrasonic wave motor.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the sliding member has small vibration attenuation unlike rubber or resin materials, it does not interfere with any vibration.
      <br/>
      However, such materials are not easy to work as compared to metals, and it is not practical to form the entire vibration member structural body using these materials.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, it suffices to work a material which is not easy to work into a simple ring shape.

      In order to assure the coupled state between the sliding member 10-5 and the vibration member structural body 1, a gap 11-2 is formed.

      In order to press-contact a coupling portion 1f against the sliding member 10-5, a groove 12 is formed in the vibration member structural body 1, so that a support portion 1g has a spring restoration force, thereby assuring the firmly coupled state.

      In FIG. 2F, a ring member whose sectional shape, cut along a plane including the center of the motor shaft, is an L shape, is press-fitted.
      <br/>
      The above-mentioned spring restoration force is provided to a sliding member 10-6 by forming grooves 10a in the sliding member 10-6 (see FIG. 2G).

      The sliding surface is defined by a portion near the ridge of the L-shaped section.
      <br/>
      Note that the sectional shape may be defined by a portion of an arc, a portion of a curve, a portion of a polygon, or a combination of a curve and a straight line in addition to the L shape.
      <br/>
      The objective of this shape is to improve the startability of the motor in addition to the effects described with reference to FIG. 2B. More specifically, since the sliding portion is defined by the ridge of a polygon or a portion of a curved surface, i.e., has a small width, the start performance of the motor can be improved.

      That is, in a high-humidity environment, the water content condenses into water in the narrow gap between the sliding surfaces of the movable member and the vibration member, and makes these members tightly contact each other.

      When the movable member 2 is divided into two members, as shown in FIG. 4C, an optimal sliding member can be selected without disturbing practicality upon working.

      <br/>

      In FIG. 5C, a sliding member 10-15 is coupled to the vibration member structural body 1 by flattening and caulking a portion 1k.
      <br/>
      When the material used for the vibration member structural body 1 has a high ductility, this coupling method becomes a simple but reliable method.
      <br/>
      In this example, the sliding member 10-15 consists of phosphor bronze, and its surface is subjected to Ni-P galvanizing.
      <br/>
      In this example, after the sliding member 10-15 is formed, a surface treatment or surface coating such as galvanizing is performed.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In an example shown in FIG. 5D, unlike in FIG. 5C, a sliding member 10-16 is prepared by punching a material, which is subjected to a surface treatment or surface coating beforehand, by press working.
      <br/>
      With this process, since a treatment need not be performed for each member, the number of processes of the surface treatment or surface coating can be greatly reduced.
      <br/>
      For example, a pure aluminum or aluminum alloy plate is formed into the shape of the sliding member 10-16 by press progressive working.
      <br/>
      In this case, a large number of members are not disconnected but are kept connected via beams.
      <br/>
      After this material is subjected to an anodizing treatment, the respective members are disconnected from the beams to obtain individual sliding members.
      <br/>
      As the surface treatment, in addition to the anodizing treatment for aluminum, an iron alloy, a copper alloy, or the like selected as the material of the sliding member may be subjected to galvanizing of Cr, Ni alloy, Co, or the like, or stainless steel may be subjected to a nitriding treatment.
      <br/>
      As surface coating, resin coating, spray coating, or the like may be used.
      <br/>
      In this example, a recess portion serves as a sliding surface with respect to the movable member, contrary to the example shown in FIG. 5C. This is to not only suppress the above-mentioned decentering but also to expect the following effect.
      <br/>
      For example, as in the example of performing resin coating or spray coating, the thickness of a recess portion of a film in a molten state immediately after coating becomes larger than that of a flat portion due to its surface tension, as shown in FIG. 5D. That is, the thickness of only a film portion used as the frictional sliding member increases, and the durability of the motor can be improved.

      In FIG. 5E, a sliding member has radial projections 10h formed at three positions by press working.
      <br/>
      Only these projections 10h contact the sliding portion of the movable member.
      <br/>
      Since there are three contact portions and they can define a plane, these projections can attain a uniform contact state with the sliding surface of the movable member without being subjected to lapping.
      <br/>
      The shape of each projection is not limited to a linear shape but may be a dot shape.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, each projection may form a certain angle with the radial direction of this member when it is formed into a linear shape.

      FIGS. 6A to 6C show the third embodiment.

      FIG. 6A shows an example wherein a flange member 2d for lowering the rigidity on the sliding surface is obliquely formed to achieve a deformation direction equivalent to that in FIG. 2F. In this example, the flange member 2d of the movable member consists of aging hardening stainless steel, and a sliding member 10-18 of the vibration member consists of an extra hard material.
      <br/>
      Stainless steel suffers a larger wear amount than the extra hard material.
      <br/>
      However, as the distal end of the flange member 2d is worn, the contact position of the sliding member (the ultra hard material) with the distal end of the flange member moves toward its outer circumferential surface, and both the materials are uniformly worn, thus improving the durability of the motor.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6B shows a structure wherein both the vibration member and the movable member have resiliency.
      <br/>
      Even when the distal end of the flange member 2d is considerably worn, the function as the motor can be maintained.
      <br/>
      In order to further improve the durability of the motor, the axial dimension of the flange member 2d is preferably increased.

      In this structure, a sliding member 10-19 of the vibration member preferably consists of a material having a higher wear resistance than that of the flange member 2d.

      FIG. 8 shows a ring-shaped ultrasonic wave motor as a basis of the fourth embodiment.
      <br/>
      The details such as the driving principle of this motor are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,831,305 and the like.
      <br/>
      In an ultrasonic wave motor of this type, a vibration member is constituted by adhering a piezoelectric member 3 to a vibration member structural body 1.
      <br/>
      A movable member 2 contacts the vibrator.
      <br/>
      A large number of grooves 1i are formed in the vibration member, and magnify the vibration displacement.
      <br/>
      Conventionally, since the grooves 1i must be formed by cutting or grinding, a large number of processes are required.
      <br/>
      In order to solve this problem, in the fourth embodiment, a plate 20-1 in which a plurality of holes 20d are formed by press working or etching, as shown in FIG. 9A, is press-molded, as shown in FIG. 9B, and is then firmly coupled to the vibration member structural body 1 by adhesion or welding.
      <br/>
      Since the vibration member has the above-mentioned structure, a bending vibration deformation produced in the vibration member structural body 1 can be reliably transmitted to the press-molded member, and the sliding member 20-1 can consist of a material which cannot be worked by cutting or grinding, thus greatly reducing the number of processes.

      FIGS. 11 and 12 respectively show the fifth and sixth embodiments.
      <br/>
      A substantially ring-shaped sliding member 10-21 is fitted in a vibration member structural body 1 at its inner circumferential surface (A) side, and is also fitted in the vibration member structural body 1 at its outer circumferential surface (B) side.
      <br/>
      The advantage of fitting at both the inner and outer circumferential surfaces will be explained below.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      When the sliding member consisting of a different material is fitted in the vibration member structural body for the purpose of preventing a wear of the vibration member, the vibration member structural body and the sliding member consist of different materials (thermal expansion coefficients).
      <br/>
      For this reason, due to a change in environment such as a change in temperature, humidity, and the like, the fitting state changes, and a gap may be formed between the sliding member and the vibration member structural body.
      <br/>
      In such a case, upon rotation of the motor, the sliding member may rotate together with the movable member, which is in press-contact with the sliding member, due to the gap and the influence of, e.g., a vibration.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 13A to 14B, for example, when the vibration member structural body 1 consists of brass (BS) and the sliding member 2 consists of stainless steel (JIS SUS440C), since the thermal expansion coefficient of brass is higher than that of stainless steel, a gap is undesirably formed between the vibration member structural body and the sliding member (FIGS. 13A and 14B) in a low-temperature (-20 (degree)  C.) environment in the case of fitting at only the inner diameter side and in a high-temperature (45 (degree)  C.) environment in the case of fitting at only the outer diameter side, and the sliding member 2 may be undesirably rotated.
    </p>
    <p num="41">In the cases of FIGS. 13B and 14A, the two members change in a direction to eliminate the gap.</p>
    <p num="42">
      For example, when a substantially ring-shaped sliding member which has an inner diameter of about 8.5 mm and consists of SUS440C is subjected to a temperature change from 45 (degree)  C. to -20 (degree)  C., it is calculated that a gap of about 4  MU m be formed between itself and a vibration member structural body consisting of a BS base material.
      <br/>
      Note that the sliding member may be fixed to the vibration member structural body by an adhesive.
      <br/>
      However, since the adhesive application position is in the vicinity of the contact portion between the vibration member and the movable member, the adhesion position and the adhesive amount must be strictly controlled, resulting in an increase in cost as a whole.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      As shown in FIG. 11, the substantially ring-shaped sliding member 10-21 is fitted in the vibration member structural body 1 at its inner circumferential surface (A) side, and is also fitted in the vibration member structural body 1 at its outer circumferential surface (B) side.
      <br/>
      With this structure, even when a gap is formed at the (A) side due to a change in environment, no gap is formed at the (B) side in this case (and vice versa).
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      More specifically, when the sliding member 10-21 is fitted so that both its inner and outer circumferential surfaces contact the vibration member structural body 1, these members change in a direction to eliminate a gap at one side even when the environment (temperature) changes.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the sliding member 10-21 can be prevented from rotating with respect to the vibration member structural body 1 without using any adhesive.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In FIG. 12, the fitting state of the sliding member to the vibration member structural body is reversed to that shown in FIG. 11, and the same effect as in FIG. 11 is obtained.

      Note that the ring-shaped sliding member in FIGS. 11 and 12 has an L-shaped section.
      <br/>
      However, the present invention is not limited to the L-shaped section as long as the sliding member 10-21 is fitted in the vibration member structural body at both its inner and outer circumferential surfaces.

    <p num="47">
      In this case, as in the fifth and sixth embodiments, in an environment for forming a gap at a portion (A), a portion (B) acts in a direction to be in tight contact with the vibration member structural body; in an environment for forming a gap at the portion (B), a portion (A) acts in a direction to be in tight contact with the vibration member structural body.

Therefore, even when the two members have a thermal expansion coefficient difference based on a change in temperature, the sliding member 20-3 is strongly coupled to the vibration member structural body 1, and can be prevented from rotating or disengaging from the vibration member structural body 1.
