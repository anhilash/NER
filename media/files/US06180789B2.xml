      The present invention relates to a method for preparing optically active enantiomers of ��4-(1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4-methyl-6-oxo-3-pyridazinyl)phenyl�hydrazono�propanedinitrile (I), particularly (-) enantiomer of (I).

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The racemic mixture of ��4-(1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4-methyl-6-oxo-3-pyridazinyl)phenyl�hydrazono�propanedinitrile (I) has been described earlier in the applicant's European Patent No. 38:3449 B1.
      <br/>
      It was shown that compound (I) is potent in the treatment of congestive heart failure and has significant calcium dependent binding to troponin.  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Optically active enantiomers of (I) have been earlier described in the applicant's European Patent No. 565546 B1. It was shown that the cardiotonic potency is predominantly due to the (-) enantiomer of (I).
      <br/>
      A method for preparing pure (-) enantiomer of (I) using optically pure (-) enantiomer of 6-(4-aminophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-methyl-3(2H)-pyridazinone (II) as an intermediate compound was also disclosed.  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The racemic compound (II) can be synthesized by methods known in the literature (J.
      <br/>
      Med. Chem., 17, 273-281 (1974)).
      <br/>
      The resolution of the racemic compound (II) has, however, been proved very difficult because the 4-amino group in the molecule is weakly basic.
      <br/>
      The salts of 6-(4-aminophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-methyl-3(2H)-pyridazinone with optically active acids hydrolyse on crystallization readily back to the compound (II) and to the resolving compound which interfere the resolution procedure or make it totally impossible.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The separation of the pure enantiomers of compound (II) on a chiral HPLC-column has been described in European patent application No. 208518. This method is, however, not applicable for industrial scale.
      <br/>
      An enantioselective seven step synthesis of (-)-6-(4-aminophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-methyl-3(2H)-pyridazinone starting from (+)-2-chloropropionic acid has also been described in the literature (J.
      <br/>
      Org. Chem., 56, 1963 (1991)).
      <br/>
      The total yield in this method is only 12% giving (-)-6-(4-aminophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-methyl-3(2H)-pyridazinone with an optical purity of 97.2%.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In the above mentioned European Patent No. 565546 B1 it was found that the racemic intermediate (II) can be resolved by treating (II) with L- or D-tartaric acid in excess in 2-propanol and recovering the diastereomeric crystalline salt.
      <br/>
      Optical purity of the product was further increased by dissolving the recovered basified product in dioxane.
      <br/>
      The racemic residue was crystallized from dioxane and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness yielding the desired pure enantiomer of the intermediate (II).
      <br/>
      The pure (-) enantiomer of (I) was prepared by treating (-) enantiomer of the intermediate (II) further with sodium nitrite and malononitrile in acidic conditions as described in the above mentioned European Patent No. 383449 B1.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Even if this process gives pure (-) enantiomer of (I), the necessity to use harmful dioxane limits its applicability in the large scale.
      <br/>
      Therefore there is a need for an improved process for preparing pure (-) enantiomer of (I).

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      It has now been found that substantially pure (-) enantiomer of (I) can be prepared more conveniently and without dioxane if the resolution is conducted in two different synthesis stages.
      <br/>
      The initial resolution step comprises resolving racemic intermediate (II) and the final resolution step comprises resolving the enantiomerically enriched end product (I).
      <br/>
      It was also found that the initial resolution step results in higher optical purity of intermediate (II) if ethyl acetate is used as solvent instead of 2-propanol.
      <br/>
      Furthermore it was found that the minor component in a partly enriched enantiomer mixture of end product (I) can be crystallized out from acetone.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      The term "optically substantially pure" means here optical purity over about 90%, preferably over 95%, and more preferably over 99%, expressed as the percent enantiomeric excess.
      <br/>
      The terms "resolve" and "resolution" are intended to compass the complete or partial separation of the two optical enantiomers.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      According to the present invention the racemic compound (II) is preferably resolved by reacting the racemic mixture of (II) with D- or L-tartaric acid in ethyl acetate solvent.
      <br/>
      Advantageously the ethyl acetate solvent contain from 0 to about 6 w-%, preferably from 2 to 4 w-%, more preferably about 3 w-%, of water.
      <br/>
      It is preferred to use D- or L-tartaric acid and compound (II) in about equimolar amounts.
      <br/>
      The diastereomeric salts of (-) 6-(4-aminophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-methyl-3(2H)-pyridazinone with D-tartaric acid or corresponding (+) 6-(4-aminophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-methyl-3(2H)-pyridazinone with L-tartaric acid crystallize from ethyl acetate in good yield.
      <br/>
      The crystalline diastereomeric salt can be filtered and the free base liberated by basifying the salt with e.g. potassium carbonate solution or ammonia.
      <br/>
      The mother liquid can be recovered after filtering and be further treated in order to recover the enantiomer which was not previously removed by precipitation.
      <br/>
      The treatment may comprise e.g. cooling the mother liquid and recovering the resulting crystalline diastereomeric salt.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Typically the product obtained by the above described method contains about 90 w-% of the desired enantiomer of (II).
      <br/>
      The purity of the product can be increased to about 96 w-% by recrystallization.
      <br/>
      Acetonitrile is the preferred recrystallization solvent.
      <br/>
      For example, the product which is enriched in (-) enantiomer is recrystallized by adding the product to acetonitrile solvent, refluxing the mixture and filtering precipitate.
      <br/>
      The filtrate is concentrated, if necessary, and cooled in order to crystallize the (-) enantiomer of (II).
    </p>
    <p num="19">By way of comparison it can be noted that the resolution method of EP 565546 B1 which comprises treating (II) with L- or D-tartaric acid in excess in 2-propanol yields a product containing less than 70 w-% of the desired enantiomer of (II) if the product is not further treated with dioxane.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Partial resolution of compound (II) can be obtained, as shown by the Examples, using other solvent systems than ethyl acetate.
      <br/>
      Such solvents include isopropanol, isobutanol, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate, acetone and acetonitrile.
      <br/>
      Also the use of other resolving acids than D- or L-tartaric acid can result in partial resolution of compound (II), e.g. benzoic acid or sulphuric acid.
      <br/>
      However, the method of using D- or L-tartaric acid in ethyl acetate or aqueous ethyl acetate solvent provides the highest optical purities for compound (II) according to the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The end product (-)-��4-(1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4-methyl-6-oxo-3-pyridazinyl)phenyl�hydrazono�propanedinitrile (I) is prepared from 6-(4-aminophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-methyl-3(2H)-pyridazinone intermediate (II) which is enriched in (-) enantiomer by allowing the intermediate to react with sodium nitrite and malononitrile in acidic conditions as described in EP 383449 B1.
      <br/>
      Compound (I) which is enriched in (-) enantiomer is then recovered.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      It has been found that the minor component in a partly enriched enantiomer mixture of compound (I) can be filtered out from acetone leaving the rest of the major component in solution.
      <br/>
      This allows recovering the substantially pure (-) enantiomer of (I) from the mother solution by crystallization.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Thus, in order to prepare substantially pure (-) enantiomer of (I) the previously recovered compound (I) which is enriched in (-) enantiomer is suspended in acetone solvent, which preferably contains up to 2 w-% of water.
      <br/>
      The mixture is refluxed and the precipitate is filtered.
      <br/>
      The filtrate is then concentrated, if necessary, and cooled to about 0-(-5) (degree)  C. The precipitated crystalline (-) enantiomer of (I) is recovered.
      <br/>
      The product contains typically more than 99 w-% of the desired (-) enantiomer of (I) and is therefore suitable for use as a medicament.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The enantiomeric purities of the products were determined by the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC,).
      <br/>
      The enantiomers of compound (II) were separated by using a cellulose-type chiral column (Chiralcel OJ 25 * 0.46 cm).
      <br/>
      The mobile phase consisted of ethanol.
      <br/>
      The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The enantiomers of compound (I) were separated by using a  BETA -cyclodextrin column (Cyclobond I Beta, 4.6 * 250 mm).
      <br/>
      The mobile phase consisted of 36% methanol in water buffered to pH 6.0 with 1% triethylammonium acetate.
      <br/>
      The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      It was furthermore discovered that the above described methods of preparing substantially pure (-) enantiomer of (I) yield a novel crystallographically pure polymorphic form of (-)-��4-(1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4-methyl-6-oxo-3-pyridazinyl)phenyl�hydrazono�propanedinitrile, herein designated, for convenience, as polymorphic form I. The important advantage of the polymorphic form I is its high dissolution rate in water.
      <br/>
      This makes the polymorphic form I especially useful in pharmaceutical preparations of (-)-��4-(1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4-methyl-6-oxo-3-pyridazinyl)phenyl�hydrazono�propanedinitrile.
    </p>
    <p num="26">It was also found that the crystallographical purity of the polymorphic form I can be, if necessary, improved by heating the obtained (-) enantiomer product at a temperature of at least about 70 (degree)  C. for a time period necessary for the formation of crystallographically pure polymorphic form I. The suitable temperature is typically within the range of 70-160 (degree)  C., preferably 80-130 (degree)  C. The time period is typically within the range of 1-48 h, preferably 4-24 h. This treatment may be part of the drying process of the product and may be carried out in vacuum.</p>
    <p num="27">
      The polymorphic form I of (-)-��4-(1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4-methyl-6-oxo-3-pyridazinyl)phenyl�hydrazono�propanedinitrile is characterized by the X-ray crystallography.
      <br/>
      The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the polymorphic form I in 3-33 2 THETA  (degree)  range is in FIG. 1 and the crystallographic data in Table 1.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The diffraction pattern was measured by the X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) equipment, Siemens D 500 (Siemens AG, Karlsruhe, Germany).
      <br/>
      A copper target X-ray (wavelength 0.1541 nm) tube was operated with the power of 40 kV * 40 mA.
      <br/>
      For X-ray powder diffraction analysis the samples were mounted by loosely pressing about 500 mg of the powder to the specific cylindrical sample stage which has a diameter of 20 mm and height of approximately 2 mm.
      <br/>
      Mathematical evaluation of diffraction patterns was performed with aid of Diffrac AT V3.1 software package.
      <br/>
      Main characteristics of the diffraction patterns as 2 THETA -values and relative peak intensities were produced as out-put data.
