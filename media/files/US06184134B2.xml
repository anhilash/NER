      An all dry, low temperature process, for complete removal of organics and inorganic residues after metal etch of a microelectronic device comprising: rinsing a microelectronic device having a metallization layer after metal etch with a solution of ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide; subjecting the rinsed metallization layer to a low temperature GaSonics cleaning by exposing photoresist residue surface of the metallization layer to a fluorine containing reactive gas to form volatile compounds in the presence of a radio frequency input followed by photoresist stripping in an oxygen plasma at low temperature; subjecting the low temperature GaSonics treated residue surface to a gaseous SO3 strip at low temperature to remove additional residue; and rinsing the SO3 stripped material with de-ionized water to remove any remaining resist and residue.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>

      Field of Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a method for an all-dry low temperature process for removal of inorganic, organic and polymer residues on the top surface and sidewalls of a semiconductor wafer after the metal etch.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In the semiconductor wafer manufacturing art, removal of photoresist is generally accomplished by using a combination of dry and wet processes.
      <br/>
      For example, a typical photoresist removal procedure comprises the use of an oxygen-plasma ashing followed by a wet chemical clean step using an organic solvent at high temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      During the ashing step the organic matrix of the photoresist is removed, thereby leaving metal-ion contaminates particles and un-ashable polymers behind.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a wet clean is generally needed to remove these leftover residues.
      <br/>
      The "wet clean" removal of these residues requires organic solvents and other hazardous, reactive chemicals such as concentrated sulfuric acid.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, in all to many instances, these residues still persist and remain present on the wafer surface or the etched features.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Accordingly, removal after metal etch has always been a significant challenge.
      <br/>
      Further, the high temperature ash resulting from oxygen plasma ashing causes oxidation of polymeric residues (especially inorganic residues) thereby making it more difficult to remove.
    </p>

      Del Puppo et al., Photoresist Removal Using Gaseous Sulfur Trioxide Cleaning Technology, 3677 (Pt. 2) Proc. SPIE-Int. Soc. Opt. Eng. At 1034-1045 (1999) disclose a process for photoresist removal using SO3 is disclosed.
      <br/>
      This non-plasma method uses anhydrous sulfur trioxide gas in a two-step process, during which, the substrate is first exposed to SO3 vapor at low temperatures &lt;150 (degree)  C. and then rinsed with de-ionized (DI) water.
      <br/>
      The removal of the modified photoresist takes place during the subsequent DI water rinse step.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      While the Del Puppo et al.
      <br/>
      SO3 process removes photoresist and polymer residues, as is confirmed in the disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 5,952,157, this method for removing a photoresist film using anhydrous SO3, more often than not, does not remove inorganic elements (see FIG. 9 and column 1, lines 34-50).
    </p>
    <p num="9">A method for removal of photoresist residue after dry metal etch without requiring excessive high temperatures or extensive re-work cycles is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,523. However, this method for removal of the surface layer of the residual photoresist mask pattern for metal subtractive etching employs fluorine-containing reactive gases to form volatile compounds with the surface layer, and subsequently uses conventional oxygen plasma stripping to complete resist residue removal, and is encumbered by the detriments of using conventional oxygen plasma stripping processes.</p>
    <p num="10">A process for polymer removal from top surfaces and side walls of a semiconductor wafer is disclosed in U.S. Pat.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="18">
      In semiconductor wafer manufacturing, residue and photoresist removal have always posed a problem.
      <br/>
      In addressing this problem, the traditional approach after metal etch is to affect resist strip followed by a wet chemical clean- and this is common to most back-in levels.
    </p>
    <p num="19">The problem is in part due to the fact that the high temperature oxygen plasma ashing followed by the wet chemical clean causes oxidation of polymeric and other residues (especially inorganic residues), and this oxidation makes it difficult to remove polymeric and inorganic residues.</p>
    <p num="20">Therefore, an all dry method that is free from the use of solvents from wet cleaning methods and capable of removing polymeric, organic and inorganic residues, and that avoids the high temperature ashing, but renders both organics and inorganic residues water soluble is the sought for solution in removal of photoresist and other residue after metal etch.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Most of the investigation in this field has been directed to the optimization of wet chemical clean process/chemistry to enhance yield and improve electromigration.
      <br/>
      However, despite these investigations and research, the problem of corrosion, mouse bits along a metal sidewall and residues still persists.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The fundamental problem is that metal etch is followed by in situ resist strip at high temperatures (up to 250 (degree)  C.) using down stream oxygen plasma.
      <br/>
      Although the in situ resist strip helps prevent corrosion of metal lines by virtue of residual chlorine ions remaining after reactive ion etching (RIE), the high temperature ashing remains a problem.
      <br/>
      It remains a problem because resist strip at high temperature causes inorganic residues (present in the resist or generated during the RIE process) to oxidize, thereby making it difficult to remove by most of the wet clean processes.
      <br/>
      In instances where these residues sometimes get removed from the side-wall and or bottom of metal lines, they are re-deposited on top of metal lines (metal rails), thereby causing shorts and other non-reliability issues.
    </p>
    <p num="23">While it has been well recognized among researches that high temperature ashing should be avoided, it is also a fact that a viable method to get rid of all inorganic as well as organic residues has not yet been achieved with or without the high temperature ashing followed by a wet chemical clean step.</p>
    <p num="24">The invention provides an all dry or non-solvent process sequence for cleaning residues (inclusive of polymeric, organic and inorganic) after metal etch of semiconductor wafers and other microelectronic devices.</p>
    <p num="25">The process sequence removes all organic as well inorganic residues by using an all dry method that eliminates the need of a wet chemical clean post resist strip.</p>
    <p num="26">The all dry process for cleaning residues/polymers after the metal etch is accomplished by rinsing the microelectronic device or integrated circuit containing photoresist residues with a solution of ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide in water (APM); subjecting the APM rinsed material to a low pressure microwave stripper performance enhancement platform (PEP) process at a low temperature of about 55 (degree)  C. using CF4 chemistry to replace chlorides by AlF, to prevent corrosion; subjecting the low temperature GaSonics PEP clean to a gas phase SO3 strip at about 40 (degree)  C.; and rinsing the device with de-ionized water.</p>
    <p num="27">
      In the Figures hereinafter referred to, metal layers have been deposited on a thick layer of a dielectric oxide.
      <br/>
      Prior to metal deposition vias or holes are etched into the dielectric at regular intervals.
      <br/>
      These vias are filled with Tungsten metal and polished to form metal studs for interconnecting adjacent layers of metals.
      <br/>
      Although the vias are not shown in the Figures, they are nevertheless placed strategically at regular intervals to form interconnects.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Referring now to the SEM micrograph of FIG. 1, there is shown a metal etched substrate with first level metal lines after an in situ metal etch subsequent to the APM rinse and prior to the GaSonics PEP (Performance Enhancement Platform) clean.</p>
    <p num="29">From FIG. 1, the polymers sticking from the side of the metal lines (metal rails can be seen).</p>
    <p num="30">
      In FIG. 2, some metal lines can still be seen after the GaSonics resist strip sequence for 35 seconds at a low temperature of 55 (degree)  C. followed by a high temperature of (250 (degree)  C.) bulk resist strip for 60 seconds in a second chamber on the same tool platform.
      <br/>
      It is apparent from FIG. 2 that the metal lines are more distinct and represent a greater extent of resist removal (as some polymers can still be seen sticking from the side of the metal lines even after employing multiple steps of resist strip and water clean) than is shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      FIG. 3 is a SEM picture resulting from the invention process sequence where high temperature strip is completely avoided.
      <br/>
      In this process the metal etch is followed by an in situ wet DI rinse.
      <br/>
      The in situ resist strip process is by passed.
      <br/>
      After the in situ wet DI rinse, the wafer is subjected to a gas phase SO3 strip process.
      <br/>
      In the gas phase SO3 strip process, the wafer is exposed to SO3 gas for 180 seconds at 40 (degree)  C. at a pressure of 80 Torr, followed by a standard DI rinse.
      <br/>
      There was no solvent clean (a completely dry process).
      <br/>
      Since metal corrosion is always an issue, after the SO3 strip and DI water rinse, the wafer was subjected to a corrosion environment by placing it in a sealed water box �standard corrosion test experiment� and left for 3 weeks.
      <br/>
      Samples of the wafer were observed under a scanning electron microscope �SEM�. 0.25-micrometer metal lines were observed for signs of corrosion.
      <br/>
      No metal corrosion was present.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As can be seen from FIG. 3, there is a clean surface of metal lines.
      <br/>
      Also, no metal rails were observed.
    </p>
    <p num="33">The invention process sequence is simpler than that of the prior art and more readily acceptable in a manufacturing environment since the hazards and cost involved in solvent processing (wet processing) is eliminated or polymer removal is accomplished without an added wet clean step.</p>
