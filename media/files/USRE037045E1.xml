      The compounds of the invention are useful as cardiovascular vasodilator or anti-hypertensive agents.
      <br/>
      The therapeutically useful compounds of the invention as well as similar 5-N and N-6 substituted adenosine 5-uronamides are prepared, in accordance with a novel process, from isopropylidene (or otherwise suitably blocked) inosine-5'-uronic acid.
      <br/>
      Isopropylideneinosine-5'-uronic acid is reacted with a suitable inorganic acid halide, such as thionyl chloride, to yield 6-halogeno-9-[2',3'-O-isopropylidene-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid halide]-9H-purine.
      <br/>
      This intermediate is reacted with an amine of the general formula R4R5NH to give a 6-halogeno substituted, substituted uronic acid amide of the formulawherein X is halogen.
      <br/>
      Reaction of the latter intermediate with an amine of the formula R1-NH2, and removal of the isopropylidene (or other) blocking groups yields the compounds of the invention.

    <p num="4">
      The present invention is directed to certain N-6 and 5'-N substituted carboxamidoadenosine derivatives which have beneficial cardiovascular and antihypertensive activity in mammals, including humans and domestic animals.
      <br/>
      The present invention is also directed to a process for making said compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="5">3. Brief Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="6">
      Adenosine has been known for a long time to possess certain cardiovascular activity and particularly coronary dilatory activity.
      <br/>
      In an effort to obtain adenosine analogs of greater potency, or longer duration of activity, or both, many analogs of this naturally occurring nucleoside have been synthesized and tested.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Moreover, numerous studies have been conducted in order to elucidate the biochemical mechanism of action of adenosine and its analogs, and several theories and hypotheses have been proposed regarding biochemical pathways and receptor sites.</p>
    <p num="8">
      For discussion of current theories regarding the foregoing, reference is made to the following articles and publications: Adenosine Receptors: Targets for Future Drugs, by John W. Daly, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 25, 197 (1982); Cardiovascular Effects of Nucleoside Analogs, by Herman H.

    <p num="9">
      In addition to the foregoing publications, German Offenlegungschrift Nos. 2133273, 2426682, 1795761, 1913818, 2007273, 2238923, 2060189, 2244328, 1814711, 2136624, South African Patent Application No. 677630 (filed on Dec. 20, 1967) and British Patent Specification No. 1,123,245 describe adenosine derivatives which have cardiovascular, coronary dilator or antilipolytic activities.
      <br/>
      Still more adenosine derivatives having beneficial cardiovascular activity are described in another application for U.S. Letters Patent of the present inventors, Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 601,435, filed on Apr. 18, 1984.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Still further, Published Japanese Patent Application Nos. 58-167599 and 58-167600 disclose adenosine 5'-carboxamide derivatives which have fibrinolysis accelerating activity. U.S. Pat. No. 4,029,334 discloses anti-hypertensive and anti-anginal adenosine 5'-carboxamide derivatives where the N6 amino group is unsubstituted. U.S. Pat. No. 4,167,565 discloses adenosine 5'-carboxamide derivatives which have substituents both in the N6 and 5'-carboxamido position, and which are useful as poisons for certain noxious animals, such as rodents and coyotes.</p>
    <p num="11">In the cardiovascular and anti-hypertensive field, however, the therapeutic utility of the natural nucleoside adenosine and many of its analogs is limited because the desired beneficial effect is often of relatively short duration.</p>
    <p num="12">
      More particularly, the short duration of the beneficial cardiovascular effects of adenosine and those of its analogs which have an unsubstituted hydroxyl group at C-5 of the ribofuranose moiety is usually attributed to rapid penetration into cells followed by enzymatic conversion into less active or impermeant metabolites.
      <br/>
      For example, adenosine deaminase converts adenosine into inosine, which is a weak cardiovascular agonist.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, phosphorylation, catalyzed by adenosine kinase, forms adenylic acid (5'-AMP).
      <br/>
      Ionization of the phosphate group under physiological conditions prevents the escape of 5'-AMP from the cells in which it is formed.
      <br/>
      Thus trapped, 5'-AMP cannot exert its cardiovascular actions, which are mediated by cell surface receptors, as is discussed below.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Some known adenosine analogs, however, cannot be phosphorylated in the 5' position because the 5' position is effectively blocked. 5'-N-Ethylcarboxamidoadenosine ï¿½NECAï¿½ (Compound 1 in General Formula 1) is an example of such an adenosine analog incapable of phosphorylation by adenosine kinase.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, this compound binds potently to certain adenosine receptor sites and exhibits substantial cardiovascular activity.
      <br/>
      Other examples of known derivatives of adenosine-5'-carboxamide, (Compound 2) and of adenosine-5'-carboxylic acid (Compound 9) are shown below in General Formulae 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      Generally speaking, in these compounds, the 5'-carboxylate or 5'-carboxamide group of the uronic acid moiety is substituted with lower alkyl or lower acyl groups.
      <br/>
      Some of the adenosine-5'-carboxamide derivatives shown in General Formula 1 are disclosed in Chemical Abstracts Volume 100, 68652c and 68653d (1984) and in the corresponding Published Japanese Patent Application Nos. 58-167599 and 58-167600.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The biological activity of adenosine-5'-carboxamide derivatives, such as NECA, is thought to be due to the activation of adenylate cyclase through cell surface "Ra " or "A2 " receptors.
      <br/>
      Structure-activity studies show that the Ra receptor recognizes the alkyl uronamide moiety of NECA and its congeners.
      <br/>
      A second type of cell surface adenosine receptor designated "Ri " or "A1 " inhibits the catalytic activity of adenylate cyclase.
      <br/>
      Adenosine analogs possessing certain N-6 alkyl or aralkyl substituents such as cyclohexyl or R-1-phenyl-2-propyl are selective agonists at Ri receptors.
      <br/>
      Many mammalian and human cells contain both Ra and Ri receptors; examples of exceptions are fat cells which contain Ri receptors only, and blood platelets and human placenta, in which Ra receptors predominate.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Currently available agonists are only selective, not absolutely specific, for Ra and Ri receptors.
      <br/>
      Because the two types of receptors coexist in many organs, including brain and heart, even a selective agonist will activate both to a certain degree.
      <br/>
      A goal of pharmaceutical chemistry is the development of agonists which are as nearly specific as possible because unselectivity can be a source of side effects.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The prior art makes no prediction about receptor selectivity of adenosine analogs which contain, in the same molecule, the recognition groups which confer specificity for Ra and Ri receptors.  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="17">
      Many of the known adenosine derivatives, including the above-noted N-6 substituted and the 5'-carboxamide derivatives are less than satisfactory as cardiovascular or antihypertensive drugs for animal and human use.
      <br/>
      This is either because of low activity, short duration of the desired activity, undue toxicity or undesirable side effects.
      <br/>
      Undesirable side effects of cardiovascularly active adenosine analogs often include cardiac depression.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In light of the foregoing, the pharmaceutical industry is still striving to obtain adenosine analogs having high cardiovascular and hypotensive potency coupled with other optimal physiological characteristics, such as relatively long duration of the desired activity, low toxicity and minimal side effects.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the present invention constitute a step in this direction.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">It is an object of the present invention to provide adenosine analogs which have potent and prolonged cardiovascular activity in mammals and humans, coupled with relatively low toxicity and minimal side effects.</p>
    <p num="20">It is another object of the present invention to provide adenosine analogs which have potent or prolonged anti-hypertensive activity in mammals and humans, coupled with relatively low toxicity and minimal side effects.</p>
    <p num="21">It is still another object of the present invention to provide a relatively efficient synthetic process for the preparation of the adenosine derivatives which meet the above-noted objectives.</p>
    <p num="22">The foregoing and other objects and advantages are attained by compounds of the General Formula 3, wherein R1 represents secondary alkyl; hydroxy, lower alkoxy or halogen substituted secondary alkyl; aralkyl; aralkyl substituted in the aromatic nucleus with hydroxy, halogen, lower alkoxy or lower alkyl groups; cycloalkyl; hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkyl or halogen substituted cycloalkyl; para-substituted phenyl; heteroaryl substituted alkyl; heteroaryl substituted alkyl substituted in the heteroaryl nucleus with hydroxy, halogen, lower alkoxy or lower alkyl groups; norbornyl, and hydroxy, alkyl or halogen substituted norbornyl groups.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The substituent R2 and R3 groups in the compounds of the present invention, as shown in General Formula 3, are hydrogen, or pharmacologically acceptable organic acyl groups, or inorganic acid radicals, such as NO2 groups, which esterify the hydroxyl groups of the ribofuranose moiety.
      <br/>
      The R2 and R3 groups are preferably of the type which are relatively readily hydrolyzed under physiological conditions.
      <br/>
      The R2 and R3 substituents need not be identical with one another.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Still further, in the compounds of General Formula 3, the substituent R4 is straight chain lower alkyl having 1-4 carbon atoms; hydroxy, lower alkoxy or halogen substituted straight chain lower alkyl having 1-4 carbon atoms; cyclopropyl; secondary alkyl having 3-6 carbon atoms; hydroxy, lower alkoxy or halogen substituted secondary alkyl having 3-6 carbon atoms; alkenyl having 3 to 6 carbon atoms; aralkyl having 1 to 4 carbons in the alkyl chain; aralkyl having 1 to 4 carbons in the alkyl chain and substituted in the aryl nucleus with hydroxy, halogen, lower alkoxy or lower alkyl groups; heteroarylalkyl having 1 to 4 carbons in the alkyl chain; and heteroarylalkyl having 1 to 4 carbons in the alkyl chain and substituted in the heteroaryl nucleus with hydroxy, halogen, lower alkoxy or lower alkyl groups.
      <br/>
      R5 is hydrogen, or straight chain lower alkyl having 1 to 4 carbons.  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The compounds of the present invention are resistant to enzymatic phosphorylation and to deamination by adenosine deaminase.
      <br/>
      The compounds exhibit significant cardiovascular activity.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In accordance with a novel process of the invention, the compounds of General Formula 3 are obtained from 2',3'-O-isopropylideneinosine-5'-uronic acid by treatment with a suitable inorganic acid halide, such as thionyl chloride, to yield the intermediate, 6-chloro-9-ï¿½2,3-O-isopropylidene- BETA -D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid chlorideï¿½-9H-purine.
      <br/>
      The intermediate, 6-chloro-9-ï¿½2,3-O-isopropylidene- BETA -D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid chlorideï¿½-9H-purine, (or the corresponding bromide, if, for example thionyl bromide is used instead of thionyl chloride) is usually not isolated in a pure state.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The acid chloride moiety of 6-chloro-9-ï¿½2,3-O-isopropylidene- BETA -D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid chlorideï¿½-9H-purine (or the acid bromide of the corresponding bromo- analog) is significantly more readily displaced by nucleophilic reagents than the halide group in the 6 position of the purine moiety.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in accordance with the process of the present invention, 6-chloro-9-ï¿½2,3-O-isopropylidene- BETA -D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid chlorideï¿½-9H purine is reacted with a first nucleophilic reagent having the formula R4,R5 -NH (General Formula 4) to yield an intermediate substituted carboxamide shown in General Formula 5, wherein the halide is retained in the 6position of the purine moiety.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The intermediate of General Formula 5 is subsequently reacted with a nucleophile having the formula R1 - NH2 (General Formula 6) and the isopropylidene blocking group is removed with acid to yield the compounds of the invention (General Formula 3), having free hydroxyl groups in the 2' and 3' positions of the ribofuranose moiety.
      <br/>
      Instead of the isopropylidene blocking group, other acid stable blocking groups can also be used to protect the 2'--OH and 3'--OH groups of the ribofuranose moiety during the step of treatment with the inorganic acid halide.
    </p>
    <p num="29">The groups R1, R4 and R5 in General Formulae 4-6 are defined the same as in General Formula 3.  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="30">
      Certain derivatives of 5'-carboxamidoadenosine wherein both the amino nitrogen (N-6) of the purine moiety and the amino nitrogen of the 5'-carboxamido moiety are substituted, have been found, in accordance with the present invention, to possess significant cardiovascular and/or anti-hypertensive activity.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the invention have the composition characterized by General Formula 3.
      <br/>
      The substituent R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 groups are defined above in the summary description of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="31">A preferred subclass of the compounds of the present invention consists of N-6 substituted derivatives of 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine shown in General Formula 7, wherein the R1 substituents of the N-6 amino nitrogen comprise: secondary alkyl; hydroxy, lower alkoxy or halogen substituted secondary alkyl; aralkyl; aralkyl substituted in the aromatic nucleus with hydroxy, halogen, lower alkoxy or lower alkyl groups; cycloalkyl; hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkyl or halogen substituted cycloalkyl; para-substituted phenyl; heteroaryl substituted alkyl; heteroaryl substituted alkyl substituted in the heteroaryl nucleus with hydroxy, halogen, lower alkoxy or lower alkyl groups.</p>
    <p num="32">

      <br/>
      Especially preferred in this regard, are those acyl groups which are relatively readily split off the ribofuranose moiety under physiological conditions.
      <br/>

    <heading>PROCESS FOR MAKING THE COMPOUNDS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="71">The compounds of the present invention are prepared in accordance with a novel process of the invention from a suitably blocked derivative of inosine-5'-uronic acid, such as 2',3'-O-isopropylideneinosine-5'-uronic acid (Compound 43). 2',3'-O-isopropylideneinosine-5'-uronic acid (Compound 43) is readily obtained from inosine by treatment with acetone to block the 2'- and 3'- hydroxy groups of the ribofuranose moiety, followed by oxidation with chromic acid, in accordance with the published procedure of R. R. Schmidt and H. J. Fritz, Chemische Berichte., 103, 1867 (1970).</p>
    <p num="72">
      2',3'-O-isopropylideneinosine-5'-uronic acid (Compound 43) is treated in accordance with the process of the present invention, with a suitable inorganic acid halide, such as thionyl chloride, to convert, in the same reaction step, the uronic acid moiety into a uronic acid halide and to introduce a halogen substitutent into the 6 position of the purine moiety.
      <br/>
      In this regard it is noted that the blocking groups of the 2' and 3' hydroxyl groups must be capable of withstanding the conditions of this reaction, which is advantageously conducted in neutral solvents, such as chloroform, in the presence of dimethylformamide or other dialkylamides.
      <br/>
      The isopropylidene blocking group serves well for this purpose.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, other ketal, acetal or even acyl blocking groups are also suitable.
      <br/>
      Instead of thionyl chloride other inorganic acid halides, such as thionyl bromide, may also be used.
      <br/>
      The product of the just described first step of the novel reaction sequence is 6-chloro-9-ï¿½2,3-O-isopropylidene- BETA -D-ribofuranosyl 5-uronic acid chlorideï¿½-9H-purine (Compound 44).

      6-chloro-9-ï¿½2,3-O-isopropylidene- BETA -D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid chlorideï¿½-9H-purine (Compound 44) is preferably not isolated in a pure state.
      <br/>
      Rather, it is reacted with an amine of the General Formula 4 to displace the halide of the uronic acid moiety and to provide compounds of the General Formula 5, wherein the halogen in the 6 position of the purine nucleus is retained.
      <br/>
      This selective displacement of the "acid chloride" group is readily conducted in neutral solvents, such as chloroform, preferably at low temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The intermediates of General Formula 5, may be isolated in a purified state.
      <br/>
      They are subsequently reacted with a nucleophilic amine of General Formula 6 in a suitable solvent such as ethyl alcohol, to displace the halogen substituent in the 6 position of the purine nucleus.
      <br/>
      The displacement reaction is preferably conducted in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as triethyl amine.
      <br/>
      The blocking groups of the 2' and 3' hydroxyls of the ribofuranose moiety are thereafter removed to provide the compounds of the invention (General Formula 3).

      Removal of the isopropylidene blocking groups is affected, for example, by heating with aqueous hydrochloric acid.

      These steps are illustrated in the continuation of Reaction Scheme 1.

      An alternative process for the preparation of at least some of the compounds of the present invention comprises the steps of oxidizing N-6 substituted adenosine derivatives which are suitably protected (for example by isopropylidene or benzyl groups) on the 2' and 3' hydroxyl groups.
      <br/>
      The step of oxidation is conducted in analogy to the procedure published by R. R. Schmidt and H. J. Fritz in Chemische Berichte, 103, 1867 (1970).
      <br/>
      The N-6 substituted adenosine derivatives can be obtained by reaction of 6-chloro- BETA -D-ribofuranosyl-9H-purine with the suitable amine.

    <heading>BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY AND PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES</heading>
    <p num="86">The cardiovascular and anti-hypertensive activities of the compounds of the present invention were determined in bioassays conducted on dogs and spontaneously hypertensive rats.</p>
    <p num="87">
      More particularly, in one type of assay in which the activity of the compounds of the present invention was determined, the compounds to be tested are infused intracoronarily into either open-chest anesthetized or conscious dogs.
      <br/>
      Adenosine has a demonstrable coronary dilator effect under these conditions.
      <br/>
      The concentration of the test compound in coronary plasma which causes half-maximal vasodilation is designated ED-50.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      More specifically, ED-50 is determined in the following manner.
      <br/>
      Late diastolic coronary conductance (LDCC) of the experimental dog is monitored through suitable instrumentation.
      <br/>
      Late diastolic coronary conductance is measured at maximum coronary vasodilation (peak reactive hyperemid), and is designated LDCCmax.
      <br/>
      Late diastolic coronary conductance is also measured at basal coronary vasodilation, and is designated LDCC0.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The difference between instantaneously measured late diastolic coronary conductance (LDCC) and basal late diastolic coronary conductance (LDCC0) is expressed as a fraction of the difference between maximum late diastolic coronary conductance (LDCCmax) and basal late diastolic coronary conductance (LDCC0).
      <br/>
      Thus, LDCC is defined by Equation I.  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="90">As the concentration of the test compound is varied, and the corresponding LDCC is obtained through measurements and the above-summarized calculations, data of an "LDCC versus concentration" function or plot are obtained.</p>
    <p num="91">ED-50 is derived from these data by log-logit transformation of the "LDCC versus concentration" plot; namely by solving the linear regression of logit (LDCC) on log (concentration) for LDCC=0.5.</p>
    <p num="92">
      When ED-50 of a tested compound is compared to ED-50 of adenosine in the same dog, as is set forth in EQUATION II, then the resulting molar potency ratio (mpr) provides good comparison of the cardiovascular activity of the tested compound with cardivascular activity of other compounds in the same or other experimental dogs.
      <br/>
      Thus, molar potency ratio (mpr) is a useful measure of the cardiovascular vasodilatory effect, and hence of the utility of the tested compounds.
      <br/>
      The greater the vasodilatory effect of a tested compound, the larger the corresponding molar potency ratio (mpr).  (Equation image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="93">For a more detailed description of the bioassay used for determining molar potency ratios, reference is made to an article written by Olsson et al., and titled "Coronary Vasoactivity of Adenosine in the Conscious Dog", Circulation Research, 45, 468 (1979).</p>

      <br/>
      Reduction in mean blood pressure by more than ten per cent (10%) indicates anti-hypertensive activity.

      An assay for the affinity of some of the compounds of the present invention for Ra receptors employs a modification of the radioligand displacement method described by Fox and Kurpis in The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Volume 258 pages 6952-55 (1983).
      <br/>
      Briefly, this method comprises the steps of incubating ï¿½3 Hï¿½NECA and the analogs to be tested, with human placenta membrane particles, a source of Ra receptors.
      <br/>
      The particles are then filtered, washed with a buffer to remove unbound ligand and then the amount of bound radioligand is measured.
      <br/>
      By varying the concentration of the competing analog one may estimate an index of binding affinity, IC-50, the concentration of which causes half-maximum displacement of ï¿½3 Hï¿½NECA.
      <br/>
      Using ï¿½3 Hï¿½NECA in this assay instead of ï¿½3 Hï¿½-2-chloroadenosine is a modification of the original method.
