    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The invention relates to providing network users with improved management of a communications service feature.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention relates to a method using an Internet or similar connection to provide network users with information about and control over a communications service feature.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Communications network providers such as AT&amp;T typically offer an array of communications service features.
      <br/>
      An example of such a communications service feature is call forwarding, which automatically routes an incoming telephone call to another station.
      <br/>
      Other examples of communications service features that can be offered are three way teleconferencing, call waiting, call transfer, access control, private numbering plans and customized billing options.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Currently, network users have only a limited ability to manage these communications service features.
      <br/>
      For example, in the public switched telephone network a user may use flash-hooks and Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) digits to initiate features such as conferencing or call transfer.
      <br/>
      Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) telephone sets can access similar functionality via pre-programmed feature buttons followed by the entry of DTMF digits.
      <br/>
      The management of the communications service feature is normally supplied by an intelligent key or private branch exchange (PBX) system on the user's premises.
      <br/>
      Management can also be supplied by a local exchange network's service such as Centrex.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A common characteristic of existing call control capabilities is the limited interface through which a user can manage communications service features.
      <br/>
      This limited interface often makes access to information about and control over a communications service feature difficult for a user.
      <br/>
      For example, users with ISDN telephones can typically only access a limited set of communications service features from their station set, such as three station conferencing and transfer to another station.
      <br/>
      The features that are provided are constrained by difficulty of defining a simple user interface.
    </p>
    <p num="5">In view of the foregoing, it can be appreciated that a substantial need exists for a method to provide network users with a simple interface to obtain information about and exercise control over a communications service feature.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The disadvantages of the art are alleviated to a great extent by a method using an Internet or similar connection to provide network users with information about and control over a communications service feature.
      <br/>
      This management connection between the network user's terminal or personal computer and the communications switch provides the network user with an improved way to manage a communications service feature.
    </p>
    <p num="7">With these and other advantages and features of the invention that will become hereinafter apparent, the nature of the invention may be more clearly understood by reference to the following detailed description of the invention, the appended claims and to the several drawings attached herein.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The present invention is directed to a method using an Internet or similar connection to provide network users with information about and control over a communications service feature.
      <br/>
      Referring now in detail to the drawings wherein like parts are designated by like reference numerals throughout, there is illustrated in FIG. 1 a block diagram including elements of a switched telephone network, a communications network suitable for practicing an embodiment of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The communications network 10 shown in FIG. 1 contains a local access provider network 18 in communication with three different subscriber locations 12, 14, 16.
      <br/>
      Local access provider network 18 includes three local access switches 20, 22, 24 and a call management server 26.
      <br/>
      The call management server 26 communicates with a user's terminal 36 or Personal Computer (PC) 38 and the feature control process 28 of a local access switch 20.
      <br/>
      Access to the call management server 26 can be provided with either a direct dial-up interface 30 or through an Internet service provider 32.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The general principles of the invention will be illustrated by describing the process by which a user at one subscriber location 12 can implement and control a three-way conference with users at the other two subscriber locations 14, 16.
      <br/>
      A call placed from telephone station 34 at subscriber location 12 is routed to subscriber location 14 through local access switches 20 and 22.
      <br/>
      The user at subscriber location 12 then implements a teleconference arrangement on local access switch 20 by communicating with the call management server 26 using either direct dial-up access 30 or Internet access from the user's terminal 36 or PC 38.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The call management server 26 can provide the user with a menu of features that can be activated during the call, such as three-way call conferencing.
      <br/>
      This menu can be associated with the caller's station ID or with a personal ID associated with the user.
      <br/>
      When the user requests three-way conferencing to subscriber location 16, the call management server 26 instructs the feature control process 28 to initiate a call to subscriber location 16.
      <br/>
      The call will be routed from local access switch 20 to subscriber location 16 through local access switch 24.
      <br/>
      When the call is answered, the feature control process 28 notifies the call management server 26 that the three-way conference has been successfully completed.
      <br/>
      At this point, a conference administration screen can be displayed to the user on either terminal 36 or PC 38.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      During a call, the user at subscriber location 12 can manage aspects of the teleconference such as muting one of the participants, or having a private conversation with one of the participants.
      <br/>
      These features can be implemented through the user's terminal 36 or PC 38.
      <br/>
      Upon receipt of the user's request, call management server 26 instructs local access switch 20, via the switch's control process 28, to implement the requested actions on the associated conference bridge.
      <br/>
      The feature control process 28 notifies the user that the operation is complete through the call management server 26.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The local access provider can also utilize an active call management session to notify the user of incoming calls, and let the user take action on these calls.
      <br/>
      For example, the local access provider could alert the user at subscriber location 12 that a call is incoming.
      <br/>
      The user at subscriber location 12 could then put an existing call on hold to answer the incoming call, transfer the incoming call to another station or bridge the call into the existing connection.
      <br/>
      All of these controls would be through the user's terminal 36 or PC 38, the call management server 26 and the feature control process 28.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 2 shows a preferred embodiment of the system described above.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, a station 210, such as a telephone, can communicate with the network through a switch 270.
      <br/>
      The switch 270 can be a No. 4 Electronic Switching System (4ESS) switch available from Lucent Technologies, Inc.
      <br/>
      The switch 270 can communicate with an adjunct service point that responds to requests for service processing, shown as intelligent peripheral 260.
      <br/>
      The switch 270 can also communicate with a facility that provides database and call processing procedures for special calls, such as a Service Control Point (SCP), shown as switch intelligence 280.
      <br/>
      The switch intelligence 280 performs the function of the feature control process 28 shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      A Dedicated Internet Server (DIS) 240 is depicted which communicates with a station terminal 220 associated with the station telephone 210, a user network administration terminal 230 and a service support system 250, such as the SMS that normally controls a SCP.
      <br/>
      The DIS 240 performs the function of the call management server 26 shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The name "dedicated Internet server" indicates that Internet style communications can be used to provide the capabilities described in detail below, but there are numerous other ways that these capabilities can be arranged.
      <br/>
      Any processor, for example, that communicates with the switch 270, service support system 250 and station terminal 220 could be used in place of the DIS 240.
      <br/>
      However, because a user may also wish to use a station terminal 220 for normal Internet access, the use of Internet technology may be especially convenient and straightforward.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Although each customer network can have its own dedicated DIS 240, the servers of many customer networks can share a single computer system which may also support other functions.
      <br/>
      The network provider can administer the details of a customer's communications service feature subscriptions in the DIS 240 assigned to the customer network.
      <br/>
      This could be in the form of a customer network database containing information about the network numbering plan, the number ranges assigned to the network, and the communications service features to which the customer subscribes.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The user network administration terminal 230 lets a customer access the customer network database.
      <br/>
      A customer can, for example, assign a specific telephone number to a physical location, associate names and features with each number, and enter change orders.
      <br/>
      This gives the customer limited control over the details of the customer's network and is similar to the arrangement used for Centrex service, with the exception that the DIS 240 encompasses the entire customer network.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The DIS 240 communicates through the service support system 250 with the switch intelligence 280, which in turn communicates with the switch 270 as described above.
      <br/>
      In this way, the DIS 240 distributes the necessary provisioning information through the appropriate service support systems 250 to the appropriate network elements.
      <br/>
      Although FIG. 2 shows a single service support system 250 feeding a single switch intelligence unit 280, it is possible to distribute these capabilities.
      <br/>
      This may be especially desirable in a large customer network.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Each of the switches 270 that support customer locations sends call detail record data to the DIS 240.
      <br/>
      These records let the DIS 240 provide a complete set of network management reports to the customer's Network Administrator.
      <br/>
      The call detail record data may be augmented or supplanted by information available from the switch intelligence 280 or other sources.
      <br/>
      In addition, the DIS 240 can generate a "home page" for each station 210 including a log of all traffic originating and terminating at that station 210.
      <br/>
      Each call can be identified by the calling or called party number and any special features used on the call.
      <br/>
      The home page can be enhanced with information from the DIS 240 data base, such as the identify of the calling or called party, and information about the status of communications service features, such as call forwarding.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In the arrangement shown in FIG. 2, call forwarding entries can be made and canceled at the station terminal 220 or at the user network administration terminal 230.
      <br/>
      The call forwarding command is stored in the DIS 240 and passed through the service support system 250 to the switch intelligence 80 for implementation.
      <br/>
      Changes to call forwarding entered remotely (through a station other than the user's station 210) will be recorded in switch intelligence and passed through the service support system 250 to the DIS 240 for recording and display on the stations's home page.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Information sent from the switch 270 to the DIS 240 includes information about call initiation as well as information about call termination.
      <br/>
      The DIS 240, consequently, contains a database of active calls for each station and it can interact directly with the switch intelligence 280 to manage existing calls, or to establish new calls, based on input from station terminal 220.
      <br/>
      For example, if a station 210 has multiple calls on hold, each of the calls can be shown on the home page together with the number of the calling/called station.
      <br/>
      The user can easily manage which call they would like to connect with next through the station terminal 220.
      <br/>
      The call can be selected, for example, by "double clicking" the desired call entry.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      This access through the station terminal 220 can be used to provide dynamic network based teleconferencing.
      <br/>
      The initiation of the activity using an existing telephone call is shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B. Upon receiving a command from a station terminal, the DIS (not shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B) accesses a database to identify the call that is to be included in the teleconference bridge, shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B as the intelligent peripheral 560.
      <br/>
      The identification can be in terms recognized by the switch 570 and the appropriate information will have been in the call detail record received at the initiation of the call.
      <br/>
      The DIS sends a command through the service support system (not shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B) to the switch intelligence 580.
      <br/>
      New functionality in the switch intelligence 580 and the switch 570 can allow the switch intelligence 580 to command the switch 570 to reconnect the existing call to an available intelligent peripheral 560, such as a conference bridge.
      <br/>
      The station terminal can also command that additional lines to specific station numbers be connected to the teleconference bridge, allowing an entire teleconference be managed through a station terminal.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring again to FIG. 2, the switch intelligence 280 can communicate with the intelligent peripheral 260 through standard Intelligent Peripheral signaling protocols, although new commands may be defined.
      <br/>
      This lets the switch intelligence 280 control the status of each connection to the intelligent peripheral 260, and, for example, order that calls be disconnected.
      <br/>
      The status of all the calls on the teleconference can be displayed on the home page, including a specific identification of each connection.
      <br/>
      The host is able to command the disconnection of a specific line, put a specific line or lines on mute or allow the lines to have "listen only" status.
      <br/>
      The status can be changed dynamically during the course of a teleconference under control of the station terminal 220.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      FIGS. 3 and 4 show two call management interface screens 300, 400.
      <br/>
      Feature activation request screen 300 includes key data fields 341, 342 which uniquely identify the user's location.
      <br/>
      The feature activation request screen 300 also includes call attribute data 361 through 372 associated with a number of different attributes or features available to the user.
      <br/>
      In the context of local calling features, these attributes may include active call controls such as call hold 361, call transfer 362, call forward/busy 363, call forward/no answer 364 and conferencing 365.
      <br/>
      The definition or activation of static features can also be displayed, such as, for example: call restrictions 366, call waiting 367, caller ID blocking 368, block calls from 369, block calls to 370, priority calls 371 or other communications service features 372 that may be applicable.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Conference controls screen 400 illustrates an active call management interface to the call management server 26, including key data field 410 which uniquely identifies the user's location and a list of other active stations 401.
      <br/>
      Active call management features associated with the call are also displayed, such as, for example: station muting 402, private conversations 403, drop station 404, add station 405, or other features 406 that could be applicable to the conference bridge.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Refer now to FIGS. 6 through 8 which show block flow diagrams of steps performed in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      Initially, at step 100 in FIG. 6, a call management session is initiated for the user.
      <br/>
      After the station ID and customer ID are validated at steps 102, 104 and 106, the allowed call management features are determined and displayed to the user at steps 108 and 110.
      <br/>
      The user input received at step 112 determines if an active call control, a static data change or session termination has been requested by the user at steps 114, 116 and 118 as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      If session termination was requested, the call management session is terminated at step 120.
      <br/>
      If a static data change was requested, the static data change is implemented and confirmed at steps 122 and 124 and the allowed call management features are displayed again.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      If an active call control has been requested, the active call party is determined and the active call control is implemented at steps 126 and 128.
      <br/>
      If detailed feature management options are not available at step 130, the allowed call management features are again displayed.
      <br/>
      If detailed feature management options are available at step 130, the detailed feature control options are displayed to the user at step 132, as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      User input is then accepted and feature controls are implemented at steps 134 and 136.
      <br/>
      The session is monitored at step 138 to see if further call control requests are made.
      <br/>
      At step 140, further call control requests are accepted and implemented.
      <br/>
      Finally, the call is terminated at step 142 when requested by the user.
