      The instant invention relates to a process for the warp-free pigmenting of polyolefins, which process comprises admixing coated pigment particles with a polyolefin, wherein said coated pigment particles are prepared by coating organic pigment particles with one or more films of a preformed polymer by adsorption thereon of from 1 to 10% by weight of the polymer, based on the pigment particles, at room temperature, the polymer being selected from the group consisting of polyvinylpyrrolidone homopolymers and copolymers.

    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a process for the warp-free pigmenting of polyolefins using organic pigments coated by polar polymers.</p>
    <p num="3">
      In the colouring of polyolefins, in particular polyethylene, using organic pigments, it is frequently observed that a number of mechanical properties of the coloured material changes with time; defects occur which are collectively known as warping phenomena.
      <br/>
      In large-volume injection-moulded parts, such as bottle crates, made from high density polyethylene, for example, deformation and shrinkage can be observed, sometimes resulting in cracking and usually rendering the articles unusable.
      <br/>
      Frequently, embrittlement of the material also sets in after a relatively short service life.
      <br/>
      These disadvantages relate to the majority of organic pigments, while inorganic pigments and a minority of organic pigments have a neutral behaviour.
      <br/>
      It is assumed that these disadvantages arise because the typical crysllisation behaviour of the polyolefins is disturbed by the presence of the pigments, since the latter can act as centres of nucleation.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Various methods have already been proposed for overcoming these disadvantages.
      <br/>
      These mostly relate to certain classes of pigments.
      <br/>
      For example, warp-free colouring of polyolefins is achieved, according to U.S. Pat. No. 4,233,206, by using organic pigments containing methylol groups which have been esterified by carboxylic acids (in particular copper phthalocyanines); according to JP Kokai 53/124 555, U.S. Pat. No. 4,107,133 and JP Kokai 53/143 646 by using an isoindolinone or copper phthalocyanine pigment which has been treated with a silane coupler; according to JP Kokai 53/132 048 by using an isoindolinone pigment with addition of a salicyloyl hydrazide; according to JP Kokai 57/73 029 by using a quinacridone, isoindolinone, azo or phthalocyanine pigment which is adsorbed onto inorganic material (for example silica gel) and then treated with a silane or titanium coupler, according to JP Kokai 57/159 831 by using an isoindolinone pigment which has been treated with a phenylenebistetrachlorobenzamide; and according to JP Kokai 58/23 840 by using a phthalocyanine pigment with addition of a halomethylcopper phthalocyanine which has been treated with an amine.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      According to JP Kokai 57/51 733 and 57/155 242, the warp properties of isoindolinone pigments can also be improved by recrystallising the pigment.
      <br/>
      However, as is generally known amongst those skilled in the art, the increase in mean particle size which this produces is at the cost of other important pigment properties, in particular the colour strength.
    </p>
    <p num="6">U.S. Pat. No. 4,049,615 describes a process for the warp-free colouring of polyolefins using an organic pigment, in particular a perylene, perinone, bisazo or isoindolinone pigment, coated with a melamine-formaldehyde resin.</p>
    <p num="7">
      These methods do not always meet the high demands of modern industry and, depending on the pigment, do not always give the desired result.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, no method is known which would allow diketopyrrolopyrrole pigments to be used for the warp-free pigmenting of polyolefins.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The coating of pigments with polar polymers is known per se.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,806,464 discloses pigments for example copper phthalocyanine, quinacridone, azo, thioindigo and flavanthrone pigments, whose particles are coated with a certain acrylic polymer composition which pigments, for compatibility reasons, are particularly suitable for colouring the acrylic finishes which are increasingly employed today in the automotive industry.
    </p>
    <p num="9">DE-A-2 200 322 discloses polyvinyl alcohol pigment compositions which are suitable, for example, as aquarelle colours.</p>
    <p num="10">U.S. Pat. No. 3,904,562 describes polyvinylpyrrolidone pigment compositions which have advantages in coating compositions with respect to heat resistance, bleeding and gloss.</p>
    <p num="11">Although the coating of pigments with polar polymers has already been disclosed, the effect of such pigments on the warping properties on colouring of polyolefins has hitherto not been recognised.</p>
    <p num="12">It has been found that virtually all organic pigments and in particular diketopyrrolopyrrole pigments are surprisingly suitable for the warp-free pigmenting of polyolefins if they are coated directly or indirectly with a film of a polar polymer.</p>
    <p num="13">The invention accordingly relates to a process for the warp-free pigmenting of polyolefins wherein an organic pigment is used whose particles are coated on the surface with one or more films of polar polymers.</p>
    <p num="14">Polar polymers which are suitable for the coating are selected, for example, from the group comprising linear or branched homopolymers or copolymers from the classes comprising the</p>
    <p num="15">
      acrylic polymers based on acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and/or alkyl esters thereof,
      <br/>
      polyvinyl alcohols,
      <br/>
      polyvinylpyrrolidones,
      <br/>
      cellulose derivatives and
      <br/>
      maleic anhydride-styrene copolymers.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The abovementioned polymers are employed, for example, in an amount of from 0.5 to 20% by weight, preferably from 1 to 10% by weight, based on the pigment.</p>
    <p num="17">The abovementioned acrylic polymers can, if desired, be modified by generally conventional methods by incorporating derivatives of the acids, for example amides, or by using further comonomers, such as styrene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, vinylphosphonates, vinyl propionate, vinyl chloride, itaconic acid, maleic acid and derivatives thereof or other  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated compounds (cf., for example, Ullmanns Encyclopadie der technischen Chemie �Ullmann's Encyclopaedia of Industrial Chemistry�, Volume 19, pp. 1 ff., in particular p. 7, 4th Edition).</p>
    <p num="18">
      Suitable alkyl esters of acrylic and methacrylic acids to be employed according to the invention are expediently the methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, hydroxymethyl and hydroxyethyl esters, it also being possible, in addition, for smaller amounts of long-chain alkyl esters to be present (long-chain alkyl is, for example, branched or unbranched octyl, nonyl, decyl, dodecyl, hexadecyl or octadecyl).
      <br/>
      Methyl esters are preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Of the polyvinyl alcohols which are of particular interest as the coating, the generally known polyvinyl alcohols, unmodified or modified by esters, ethers or acetal groups, and polyvinyl alcohol-containing copolymers, for example block copolymers with polyvinyl alcohol segments, are suitable.
      <br/>
      Preferred polyvinyl alcohols are those having a degree of hydrolysis of greater than 80%, in particular between 85 and 99.8%, and a degree of polymerisation of from 200 to 2500, in particular from 250 to 1800 (MW about 10,000-100,000).
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The polyvinylpyrrolidones may also be modified by using copolymers such as styrene, acrylonitrile, vinyl propionate, vinyl chloride and, in particular, vinyl acetate.
      <br/>
      Preferred polyvinylpyrrolidones are those having a molecular weight between 5000 and 500,000.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Preferred copolymers based on maleic anhydride/styrene are those having a maleic anhydride:styrene ratio of from 1:1 to 1:3.</p>
    <p num="22">Preferred cellulose derivatives are sodium carboxymethylcellulose, cellulose acetobutyrate, cellulose acetopropionate, ethylhydroxyethylcellulose and, in particular, hydroxyethylcellulose.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The coating of the pigment can in principle be carried out by two generally known methods: by adsorption of a preformed, soluble polymer or oligomer onto the pigment or by polymerisation of corresponding monomers in the presence of the pigment.
      <br/>
      The latter method can be employed, in particular, when acrylic polymers are used.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In the former case, the pigment to be treated is post-treated in aqueous suspension with the polar polymer with stirring.
      <br/>
      The starting material may be the dry pigment powder, a press cake or a suspension as obtained from the synthesis.
      <br/>
      The polymer may either be predissolved in water or added in solid form to the pigment suspension.
      <br/>
      If necessary, the suspension can be dispersed by conventional methods using a dispersion unit (for example a high-pressure homogeniser or a high-speed stirrer).
      <br/>
      This is usually not necessary since the polar polymers generally have very good wetting properties.
      <br/>
      The pigment content in the suspension can be varied within broad limits and may be up to 40% by weight.
      <br/>
      Suspensions containing from 5 to 20% by weight of pigment are expediently employed.
      <br/>
      The post-treatment of the pigment with the polar polymer can be carried out at room temperature, but if desired also up to an elevated temperature of about 80 (degree)  C. The stirring time varies between 5 minutes and 20 hours.
      <br/>
      In order to simplify filtration of the treated pigment, filtration aids, for example from 0.5 to 15% by weight of an aliphatic 1,2-dihydroxyl compound having 8 to 22 carbon atoms, in particular from 1 to 5% by weight of 1,2-dodecanediol, can be employed so long as they have no adverse effect on the use of the pigments according to the invention (in particular in polyethylene).
      <br/>
      Analogous additives (for example customary dispersants) can also be added in conventional amounts to improve the dispersibility of the product The polymer may also be precipitated onto the pigment by adding a precipitant (for example NaCl or Na2 SO4) or the pigment and polymer are ground together, for example in a ball or sand mill, in the presence of a sufficient amount of solvent to at least partially dissolve the polymer.
      <br/>
      It may also be expedient to crosslink the polymer by conventional methods.
      <br/>
      Examples of crosslinking agents which can be used here are boron-containing compounds (for example boric acid or sodium borate), metal compounds (for example zirconium propylate, aluminium salts), and bifunctional reactants (for example dicarboxylic acids and dicarboxylic acid chlorides).
    </p>
    <p num="25">In general, the coating methods are known and described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,532,662, 3,806,464, 3,876,603 and 3,904,562.</p>
    <p num="26">
      In the latter case, ie. polymerisation of monomers in the presence of a pigment, untreated pigment can be employed in accordance with known methods, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,133,893 and 3,897,586, or pretreated pigment can be employed to improve the adsorption of the polymer.
      <br/>
      Various pretreatment methods of this type are customary and well known amongst those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Some of these methods are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,544,500, 3,891,572, 4,608,401, 4,680,200 and 4,771,086.
      <br/>
      In analogy to a method described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,884,871, copolymerisable monomers (for example vinyl monomers containing polar groups, for example --COOH, --SO3 H, --NH2, --OH, --CONH2 etc) can also be adsorbed onto the pigment by pretreatment.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Preferred polar polymers for the process according to the invention are polyvinylpyrrolidones, cellulose derivatives, preferably hydroxyethylcellulose, and, in particular, polyvinyl alcohols.
      <br/>
      The coating is preferably in one layer.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Combinations of polar polymers can also be employed according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, a further and novel pigment coating which is advantageous for the warp-free colouring of polyolefins and which likewise forms the subject-matter of this invention comprises applying an acrylic polymer film on top of a polyvinyl alcohol film adsorbed onto the surface of the pigment particles.
      <br/>
      The preparation is carried out, for example, by adsorption of polyvinyl alcohol onto the pigment in an aqueous pigment dispersion with stirring for from 5 minutes to 4 hours at room temperature and subsequent free-radical-initiated emulsion polymerisation of the acrylic monomers and, if used, the comonomers in the presence of the pretreated pigment, again with stirring, for from 1 to 4 hours, but at temperatures between 60 and 100 (degree)  C., preferably between 70 and 90 (degree)  C., analogously to the abovementioned processes.
      <br/>
      The acrylic polymer is preferably employed here in amounts of from 1 to 5% by weight, and the polyvinyl alcohol in amounts of from 0.5 to 8%, based on the pigment.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Another novel pigment coating which is preferred for the warp-free colouring of polyolefins and represents a further subject-matter of the invention comprises applying the abovementioned acrylic polymer film on top of a silane film which essentially comprises a hydrolysed silane of the formula  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="30">in which R is methyl or ethyl and m is a number from 1 to 6, which has itself been adsorbed onto a film of hydrolysed zirconium acetylacetonate which coats the surface of the pigment particles.</p>
    <p num="31">
      The preparation is carried out, for example, as follows:
      <br/>
      adsorption of zirconium acetylacetonate onto the pigment dispersed in water or a lower alkyl alcohol (for example methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl or amyl alcohol) with stirring, generally for at least one hour at temperatures between 20 and 50 (degree)  C., and subsequent hydrolysis by increasing the pH to 8-9 by adding a base, for example sodium hydroxide solution, potassium hydroxide solution or ammonia, analogously to the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,472;
      <br/>
      application of the silane, possibly dissolved in a lower alkyl alcohol (for example as described above) with stirring for from 1 to 4 hours at from 50 to 100 (degree)  C., preferably 60 to 80 (degree)  C; and
      <br/>
      polymerisation of the acrylic monomers and, if used, the comonomers in the presence of the thus-pretreated pigment by the process described above.
    </p>
    <p num="32">The zirconium acetylacetonate is employed in amounts of from 1 to 5% by weight, preferably from 2 to 3% by weight, calculated as the oxide, and the silane is employed in amounts of from 1 to 10% by weight, preferably from 2 to 5% by weight, in each case based on the pigment.</p>
    <p num="33">Preference is given to the silane of the formula  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="34">
      In the abovementioned methods, the polymerisation of the unsaturated monomers is carried out by various conventional methods, for example in aqueous emulsion using persulfate as initiator.
      <br/>
      It is of course also possible to use other polymerisation processes (for example in solvents) and other widely used initiators, it being possible for the polymerisation to be initiated thermally or photochemically (cf., for example, Comprehensive Polymer Science (Pergamon Press), Vol. 3+4, or Ullmann, Vol. 19, pages 1-15).
    </p>
    <p num="35">Examples of pigments which are particularly suitable for the process according to the invention are those from the azo, diketopyrrolopyrrole, perylene, quinacridone, phthalocyanine, perinone, quinophthalone, isoindolinone, isoindoline, benzimidazolone, dioxazine, anthraquinone, thioindigo, methine, azomethine and metal complex series.</p>
    <p num="36">However, particularly important pigments are those from the azo, diketopyrrolopyrrole, perylene, quinacridone, phthalocyanine, isoindoline and isoindolinone series, preferably the diketopyrrolopyrroles and in particular 1,4-diketo-3,6-di(4-chlorophenyl)pyrrolo�3,4-c�pyrrole.</p>
    <p num="37">The great and surprising advantage of the process according to the invention is that polyolefins, in particular high density polyethylenes, can be coloured using high-fastness organic pigments which were hitherto unsuitable or at least less suitable for this purpose.</p>
    <p num="38">
      The effect on warping of polyolefins by a pigment is tested on an injection moulding in the form of a plate.
      <br/>
      After ageing for 72 hours at 100 (degree)  C., the dimensions of the plate (length and width) are measured and the warp  DELTA L (length) and  DELTA W (width) are determined in  (degree) /oo in accordance with the following equations:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="39">Pigments which have proven to be warp-free in practice are those in which the absolute values of  DELTA L and  DELTA W are less than 5; values less than 3 are particularly preferred.</p>
