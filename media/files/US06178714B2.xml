    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      As urban growth occurs over time, a situation often arises where major arterial routes, especially freeways, become the hub of an infrastructure such that the immediately surrounding land is seen as best suited for developments such as high rise office towers, apartments, shopping centers and other commercial uses.
      <br/>
      Special zoning is often established for these "preferred development districts".
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Urban planners recognize that the land use in a preferred development district is typically a mix, including many business that have been at the same location for years and that don't require the new infrastructure.
      <br/>
      Such businesses will be referred to as "land-and-one-story businesses", because their operation can typically be most economically conducted using land and one story buildings.
      <br/>
      Although at some point the business owners may realize the benefit from their land value appreciation, the overall land value appreciation in a preferred development district may actually do land-and-one-story business owners more harm than good, for the following reasons.
      <br/>
      First, it is often difficult to gain approval for improvements to property in a preferred development district.
      <br/>
      Because everything on a property will typically be leveled when a development project is undertaken, development authorities do not want to authorize nontransferable improvements because they will drive up the cost of property for developers, delaying preferred development.
      <br/>
      Second, land-and-one-story business owners are often faced with limited or no possibility of expansion at their current location, due both to the high cost of adjacent land, and due to restrictions placed on land use in preferred development districts.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      If a land-and-one-story business decides to relocate, the business may find that their current property is of low overall market value, for the following reasons.
      <br/>
      First, the constraints described above will be faced by any new owner.
      <br/>
      Second, many people are reluctant to locate a business on property that may be absorbed into a large development project at any time.
      <br/>
      Third, because the properties of many land-and-one-story businesses have odd, irregular buildings, often built for a specialized purpose, often with a variety of aesthetic, code and regulatory problems, and often with a high percentage of open land, the total rental income such properties can generate is often relatively low, even if rental income per square foot for uses such as warehouse is relatively high.
      <br/>
      Because redevelopment may not occur for a decade or more, low rental value will significantly depress the market value of a land-and-one-story property.
    </p>
    <heading>PURPOSES OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">One purpose of the building system of the present invention is to reduce the inherent conflict between urban planning authorities and land-and-one-story business owners, by comprising an integrated, modular system for building the basic structure of an inexpensive kind of temporary building that can significantly increase the rental value of land-and-one-story properties without adding significant unrecoverable costs that would delay preferred development.</p>
    <p num="5">A second purpose of the building system of the present invention is to comprise an integrated, modular system for building the basic structure of a building that is similar in appearance to conventional permanent concrete block and flat roof buildings, and that has fire resistance properties similar to permanent concrete buildings.</p>
    <p num="6">A third purpose of the building system of the present invention is to comprise an integrated, modular building system that can be built in cold climates without a significant unrecoverable investment in a deep foundation.</p>
    <p num="7">A fourth purpose of the building system of the present invention is to comprise an integrated, modular building system including engineering design components and architectural design components, for rendering specific buildings having a wide range of floor layout dimensions, such that a construction plan can be quickly prepared from modular elements for a specific building that will fit together with other buildings that are on a specific property, thus providing an increased square footage of rentable warehouse space.</p>
    <p num="8">A fifth purpose of the building system of the present invention is to comprise an integrated, modular building system for rendering specific temporary buildings such that if and when the buildings are later taken down, the same building can be erected elsewhere, or individual modules can be reused as parts of multiple other buildings of the present invention, or in other ways, so that most of the material cost of a building of the present invention is recovered if the building is taken down.</p>
    <p num="9">A sixth purpose of the building system of the present invention is to render buildings that, although temporary, can remain in service at a location for decades.</p>
    <p num="10">A seventh purpose of the building system of the present invention is to standardize a method of disassembling a building of the present invention, such that components are disassembled, staged, loaded and distributed efficiently from the disassembly site for reuse in the construction of other buildings of the present invention and/or for other uses.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">The present invention comprises an integrated, modular system for designing, building, and disassembling the basic structure of an inexpensive kind of temporary building that is similar in appearance to conventional permanent concrete block and flat roof buildings, substantially fireproof, can be erected quickly, can remain in service on a site for decades, and that can then be disassembled such that most of the components can be reused at a different location in the same building, in other buildings of the present invention, or separately.</p>
    <p num="12">
      The wall components of the system of a building of the present invention are of two main block types.
      <br/>
      The first type comprises a variation of either industry standard sized 75/8" * 75/8" * 155/8" two cavity concrete block, or similar blocks with dimensions 75/8" * 75/8" * 18".
      <br/>
      In addition to two cavities, each concrete block has one or more block assembly holes positioned such that when the blocks are stacked directly on top of one another without mortar, block assembly rods or block assembly columns, typically of steel and threaded at the top, are then run through the block assembly holes and into the foundation to form an assembly of stacked concrete blocks.
      <br/>
      The threaded sections at the top of the rods are used to secure roof modules.
      <br/>
      The second main type of wall block component comprises larger wall modules, typically of concrete, that can be hollow, or that can have an insulation core.
      <br/>
      These wall modules are also assembled using block assembly rods and/or block assembly columns that are free standing and that run the full height of the wall, through the inside of the wall modules and to the foundation.
      <br/>
      Such rods and/or columns can vertically support the weight of the roof independent of the wall block modules.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The wall components of the system of a building of the present invention include optional insulation panels that can be placed on either the inside or the outside of the building.
      <br/>
      These panels typically run the full height of the building, and comprise a layer of insulation board that is vapor sealed, an outer layer typically of finished veneer, and top and bottom flexible panel end sections.
      <br/>
      The bottom flexible panel end section is placed on the foundation and secured by the wall blocks that are placed subsequently.
      <br/>
      The top flexible panel end section is placed on the top of the wall blocks and is secured by the weight of the roof.
      <br/>
      The vapor sealed insulation board side interfaces with the wall blocks, and can be optionally spot glued to the wall blocks.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Wall components of the system of a building of the present invention are joined to roof components using plate modules placed at the top of the wall blocks.
      <br/>
      These plate modules include roof supporting sections of steel or a similar material, typically span multiple block sections, and have holes to insert the block assembly rods and/or block assembly columns used to assemble the wall blocks.
      <br/>
      There are two main kinds of plate modules.
      <br/>
      One has a flat top, and bears roof modules that slope very slightly down to a gutter.
      <br/>
      The other has a slight rise, to provide a slope to drain the roof.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Door, garage door, and window components of the system of a building of the present invention typically comprise a frame that is sized to fit in the exact area of an array of wall block components, a premanufactured door or window inside the frame, and a lintel sized with respect to the dimensions of wall block components and having holes for the block assembly rods and/or block assembly columns used to assemble the wall blocks.</p>
    <p num="16">
      Three alternative variations comprise the foundation component of the system of a building of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Each foundation variation typically comprises a level poured concrete base, and each is typically made using a pouring form top section having hollow tubes or solid rods spaced to accommodate the block assembly rods and/or block assembly columns that are placed to assemble the walls after the foundation has hardened.
    </p>
    <p num="17">The first foundation variation comprises pouring concrete directly into a shallow trench or form, or into a form on an existing paved surface, and then leveling.</p>
    <p num="18">
      For cold climates it is desirable to avoid the cost of building a deep foundation for a building that may soon be disassembled and moved.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a second alternative variation of the foundation system is used that comprises insulation panels on the ground.
      <br/>
      The foundation is first constructed identically to the first variation.
      <br/>
      Ground insulation panels are then secured to the walls at ground level by flexible end panels.
      <br/>
      Wall blocks are then placed on top of the ground insulation panel end panels.
      <br/>
      Ground insulation panels can be optionally pinned or weighted to the ground.
      <br/>
      Ground insulation panels can be used with or without the use of wall insulation panels.
    </p>
    <p num="19">A conventional deep foundation, below the frost line, can be used as a third alternative type of foundation for buildings of the present invention situated in cold climates.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Framing components of the system of a building of the present invention comprise the use of the wall block assemblies including block assembly rods and/or block assembly columns, together with optional major and minor pillars as vertical supporting structure.
      <br/>
      Framing components also comprise a horizontal structure of one or more optional major beams spanning supporting walls and optionally also spanning supporting pillars, spanning angle iron sections running under the roof modules the full length between opposite walls and secured to the wall block top plates, additional wall perimeter angle irons attached to wall block top plates and running along the inside perimeter of the building, plastic coated steel cable sections secured to roof modules and to the foundation, and vertical angle iron sections secured to both spanning angle irons and to the foundation .
      <br/>
      These framing components function to join the major components of a building of the present invention into a single structure.
      <br/>
      Major pillar components of the present invention are optionally used to support major spanning beams, have a square base approximately four feet on each side, and can be pinned to an existing paved surface or to the ground using rods of steel or similar material.
      <br/>
      Minor pillar components are typically used to support roof modules half way between their span, are typically placed underneath the join between two roof modules, and are typically bolted to a spanning angle iron.
      <br/>
      Minor pillar components can also be pinned to an existing paved surface or to the ground.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Floor components of the system of a building of the present invention are typically of one of two types.
      <br/>
      Some buildings are placed on already paved surfaces, and have no floor other than the pavement.
      <br/>
      Other buildings are on unpaved ground.
      <br/>
      These buildings have modular floor slabs of molded concrete, that can be optionally pinned to the unpaved ground.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Roof module components of the system of a building of the present invention comprise rectangular assemblies typically with a short roof module end of 3' in width and with a range of lengths such as 4', 6', 12', 16', 20' and the like.
      <br/>
      These roof modules are placed side by side with adjacent roof modules.
      <br/>
      The short roof module ends are attached to the threaded rod ends of the block assembly rods and/or block assembly columns that protrude through the flat wall top plates of supporting stacked block assemblies, and/or to a major spanning beam using bolts, and/or to a spanning angle iron using bolts.
      <br/>
      Roof modules comprise a base that is typically a section of ribbed steel decking, an optional layer of platform panel such as gypsumboard, typically 1/2 thick", a layer of insulating material in panel form, such as polyisocyanurate foam, typically 3" thick, and a layer of rubber membrane, typically of thickness 45 m to 60 m. When the roof modules are in place, rubber membrane sections are glued into place to join adjacent modules.
      <br/>
      To complete the roof, flashing is added at the top and sloped sides, and gutters are attached to the draining sides.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Building link components of the system of a building of the present invention comprise a connection between an existing building and an adjacent building of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This typically comprises a previously described garage door opening and lintel in a wall of a building of the present invention that is joined by a short section of wall blocks and wall assembly rods, typically also by a custom roof section, and sometimes by one or more additional custom side panels, to either an existing opening of an existing building, such as a garage door, or to a wall of an existing building, where a corresponding opening is to be cut.
      <br/>
      Building link components of the system of a building of the present invention can comprise a set of standard designs, but will often include a requirement to fabricate custom components for a specific building.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The system of a building of the present invention includes both standardized engineering parameters, and standardized architectural procedures for rendering blueprints of specific buildings of the present invention that are in some cases designed to fit together with pre-existing buildings.
      <br/>
      In addition, the system of a building of the present invention can comprise a disassembly plan, that details the order in which components of a building of the present invention will be disassembled, where specific components of a building that is being disassembled are to be sent to be used in construction of other buildings of the present invention or to be used in other ways, and where and when at the disassembly site specific components will be staged and loaded onto trucks.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="26">
      FIG. 1 illustrates an exploded view of a foundation section, two cement blocks, and block assembly rods of the system of a building of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The cement blocks are typically of two sizes.
      <br/>
      One size has dimensions 75/8" * 75/8" * 155/8", the U.S. industry standard, allowing in traditional construction for the use of mortar and a resulting final block spacing of 8" and 16" on the wall face.
      <br/>
      The use of this standard block size makes it easier to resell blocks used in a building of the present invention as standard blocks, if the building is later disassembled.
      <br/>
      The second size has dimensions 75/8" * 75/8" * 18".
      <br/>
      Because roof modules are built with ribbed steel decking having industry standards of a 3' width and 6" from rib to rib, using cement blocks 18" wide facilitates placement of a row of roof modules on a building wall of a building of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The foundation 1 of FIG. 1 is typically of poured concrete.
      <br/>
      The foundation concrete can be poured into a shallow trench, or into forms.
      <br/>
      It can be above or below the frost line depending on the requirements for a specific building.
      <br/>
      Holes 2, spaced according to the dimensions of the concrete blocks used, are formed in the foundation 1 of FIG. 1 when the foundation is poured.
      <br/>
      The holes 2 typically go all the way through the foundation and can go into the underlying ground.
      <br/>
      If the foundation is on pre-existing pavement, holes are typically drilled in the pavement.
      <br/>
      If the foundation is on ground, drilling into the ground is typically unnecessary.
      <br/>
      When the foundation 1 is in place, and the holes 2 have been drilled to ground if needed, block assembly rods 3 are placed in the holes.
      <br/>
      These block assembly rods 3 are typically made of steel, but can be of other material, including such material as PVC.
      <br/>
      Pre-cast concrete blocks 4, having pre-formed holes 5, are placed such that the block assembly rods 3 run through the pre-formed block holes 5 in the blocks 4 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In this way, a stack of pre-cast concrete blocks is assembled, that comprises a section of a wall of a building of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      As a stack of blocks is commenced, the assembly can begin with shorter block assembly rods, so that blocks are only lifted a maximum of 3' or 4' before being placed.
      <br/>
      When a stack reaches the top of the rods, one is removed and a longer rod is inserted, then the other shorter rod is removed and a longer rod is inserted.
      <br/>
      When a stack of blocks has reached full height, the final rods may optionally be sized to be driven a short distance of up to a few feet into the ground.
      <br/>
      The final block assembly rods have threaded heads that are used to bolt on roof modules.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      When concrete blocks with standard dimensions 75/8" * 75/8" * 155/8" are used, because the industry standard for ribbed steel decking used in roof modules is 3' wide with ribs spaced every 6", a liner block approximately 23/8" thick is required, to be placed between adjacent stacks of concrete blocks.
      <br/>
      Such a liner block section is shown as 7 in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Liner block sections are typically 2' or 3' high.
      <br/>
      The thickness and compressibility of the liner blocks and the spacing of the foundation holes is such that when the concrete blocks are in place, the liner blocks are secured by the concrete blocks.
      <br/>
      The use of the liner blocks results in the center of each concrete block being approximately 18" from the center of adjacent blocks in adjacent stacks.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Thus, by repeating the steps for the placement of block assembly rods, pre-formed concrete blocks, and liner blocks when required, a wall is assembled that is sized for subsequent placing of roof modules.</p>
    <p num="31">
      An alternative type of wall of the system of a building of the present invention is comprised of larger wall block sections, such as the section 11 illustrated in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      These larger wall block sections 11 can be of pre-cast solid concrete, or of hollow core concrete, or of concrete with a lightweight core such as of insulating material, or of other material.
      <br/>
      As with the concrete blocks, the larger wall block sections 11 are placed such that the block assembly rods 3 of FIG. 2 run through the pre-formed wall block holes 12 in the wall blocks 11 of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The design of larger wall blocks is such that the block dimensions and/or the number and spacing of the wall block holes 12 are determined with respect to the 3' width and 6" rib spacing of roof modules.
      <br/>
      The use of larger wall block sections permits designs of wall block sections with lower density, and improved insulating properties that may in some cases make additional insulation unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 3 illustrates a second alternative and enhanced kind of structure for the use of block assembly rods in the system of a building of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This enhanced block assembly rod, shown as 21 in FIG. 3, is typically of steel, and comprises a rod shaft 22 having a flat bottom 27, a top rod plate 26 that is typically of steel and is typically welded to the rod shaft 22, and a threaded top section 25.
      <br/>
      The enhanced block assembly rod 21 is used with a block assembly rod base 28, typically of steel, comprising a hollow tube structure 23 that is typically welded to a base plate 24.
      <br/>
      When the building foundation is formed, block assembly rod bases 28 are cast in the concrete, with the open hole of the tube structure top 29 of FIG. 3 typically even or slightly below the level foundation top.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 4 illustrates the use of this alternative and enhanced kind of structure for block assembly rods.
      <br/>
      Block assembly base plates 28 are embedded in the foundation concrete 1.
      <br/>
      Concrete blocks 4 or wall blocks 11 are placed on the foundation 1, with their preformed holes 5 or 12 aligned with the open holes 29 in the block assembly rod base plate tops.
      <br/>
      Enhanced block assembly rods 21 are then run through the concrete blocks 4 and/or wall blocks 11, such that the bottom 27 of each enhanced block assembly rod 21 rests on the base plate 24 of a block assembly rod base 28.
      <br/>
      At the top of each wall, top plate modules 41, having holes 42 that align with the enhanced block assembly rod threaded top sections 25, are placed so that they rest on the top block rod assembly plates 26.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the roof is later mounted on the top plate modules 41, the enhanced block assembly rods 21 function as thin load bearing pillars.
      <br/>
      The base plate 24 must be of sufficient area so that when base plates 24 are cast in the foundation 1 the base plates and foundation will bear the weight supported by the enhanced block assembly rods 21.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The enhanced block assembly rods 21 are inhibited from bending by the concrete blocks or wall blocks, but except for this bending prevention, the enhanced block assembly rods 21 can bear the weight of the roof independently of any vertical weight bearing function of the concrete blocks and or wall blocks.
      <br/>
      This permits the use of concrete blocks and/or wall blocks that can be made primarily with lightweight non-load-bearing material, including insulation.
      <br/>
      The light weight of such concrete blocks and/or wall blocks makes it more practical to transport buildings of the present invention considerable distances.
      <br/>
      In addition, through the use of enhanced block assembly rods and ultralight wall blocks comprising insulating material and/or structure, building designs for buildings of the present invention are facilitated that require no additional insulation.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      A third alternative and enhanced kind of structure can be used in place of block assembly rods in the system of a building of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This enhanced structure will be termed a block assembly column.
      <br/>
      A block assembly column is typically a hollow steel supporting column, similar to commercially available columns, enhanced with top and bottom sections similar to the enhanced block assembly rod of FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Such a block assembly column, shown as 51 in FIG. 5, is typically of steel, and comprises: a hollow steel column 52 that is welded to a flat bottom column plate 61, that is in turn welded to a solid steel rod section 62 having a flat bottom 57; a flat top column plate 56 that is typically of steel and is typically welded to the top of the column 52, and a threaded top section 55 that is typically welded to the top column plate 56.
      <br/>
      The block assembly column 51 is used with a block assembly column base 58, typically of steel.
      <br/>
      The block assembly column base 58 comprises a hollow tube structure 53 that is typically welded to a plate 54.
      <br/>
      When the building foundation is formed, block assembly column bases 58 are cast in the concrete, with the plate on top of the concrete foundation, and the open hole 59 of the tube structure 53 of FIG. 5 facing up.

    <p num="36">
      FIG. 6 illustrates the structure of a larger ultra-light wall block unit 71 of a design and composition suitable to be used with block assembly columns described above in the system of a building of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The ultra-light wall block unit 71 comprises an outer shell 72 about 1" thick of ultra-light concrete, an inner layer 73 about 3" thick of a light but rigid foam insulating material such as polyisocyanurate foam, hole liners 74 of material such as PVC, and holes 75 that are the inside of the hole liner 74 and that are sized to accommodate block assembly columns.
      <br/>
      Ultra-light wall block units function together with block assembly columns in a building of the present invention such that when the building is assembled, the columns rest on the foundation, and provide total vertical structural support for the roof of the building.
      <br/>
      The roof rests on steel top plate modules similar to those illustrated as 41 of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The weight of the roof is supported from the foundation via the columns, and the columns are inhibited from bending or falling both by the steel rod sections 62 of FIG. 5, and by the encasing structure of the walls.
      <br/>
      As the building assembly continues, additional framing and wall elements add supporting structure that further enhances the function of the wall blocks 71 in preventing the columns from bending or falling.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      FIG. 7 illustrates primary components of a roof module for the system of a building of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 7, a roof module is comprised of up to four main layers: a layer of ribbed steel decking 81, an optional layer of platform panel 82 that is typically 1/2" gypsumboard, a layer of insulation panel 83 that is typically 3" polyisocyanurate foam, and a layer of a rubber membrane 84.
      <br/>
      When the roof module is assembled, bolts 85 are inserted through bolt plates 86, the layer of insulation panel 83, the optional layer of platform panel 82, and the layer of steel decking 81.
      <br/>
      There are holes 87 in the layer of insulation panel 83, holes 88 in the layer of optional platform panel 82, and holes 89 in the layer of steel decking 81, all sized and spaced to accommodate arrays of bolts spaced such as to secure the layers together, and to give the resulting assembled panel module added stiffness deriving from the structural properties of the layers.
      <br/>
      The bolt plates 86 have recessed center sections 90 to accommodate the shape of the bolt head, resulting in a relatively smooth top surface of the bolt head and the bolt plate when the bolts are secured.
      <br/>
      The bolt plates 86 have center holes 91 to allow the bolt to be inserted, and as a base for the bottoms 92 of the bolt heads.
      <br/>
      When the roof modules are assembled, some or all of the bolt heads protrude below the lower ribs 93 of the ribbed steel decking 81, and through holes 96 in a spanning angle iron 94, a section of which is shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      These spanning angle irons 94 run the length of the roof, and are secured to other angle irons that are in turn secured to top plate sections around the inner perimeter of the roof.
      <br/>
      When the roof modules are bolted to these angle iron sections 94, this has the effect of both securing the roof module to the building, and indirectly to adjacent roof module sections that are also secured to the angle irons.
      <br/>
      Thus the roof module sections and the angle irons 94 are structurally an integrated load bearing unit.
      <br/>
      Although bolting, as shown in FIG. 7, is a preferred way of attaching roof modules to spanning angle irons, it should be understood that other means could be use to attach roof modules to spanning angle irons in the system of a building of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      FIG. 8 shows an assembled roof module 95, comprising the layers described with reference to the exploded view of FIG. 7: the layer of ribbed steel decking 81, an optional layer of platform panel 82, a layer of insulation panel 83, and a layer of a rubber membrane 84.
      <br/>
      Continuing to refer to FIG. 8, the exploded view illustrates how the short ends of assembled roof modules of the system of a building of the present invention are attached to walls.
      <br/>
      The bottom rib sections 93 of the steel decking layer 81 rest on the block top plate 42, and the block top plate in turn rests either on blocks, such as the concrete block 4 illustrated in FIG. 8, or wall blocks, or a combination thereof, and/or on top rod plate sections 26 of enhanced block assembly rods 21 of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Referring again to FIG. 8, for some of the block assembly rods 3, plastic coated steel cables 98, with a looped end 99 are inserted through a hole 100 in the bottom rib 93 and looped around the block assembly rods 3.
      <br/>
      The other end of each cable, also looped, is attached to a protruding bolt precast in the side of the foundation, illustrated as 6 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The steel cable is presized according to the height of the building, and is of a length such that it must typically be mechanically stretched to place the bottom loop on the protruding bolt 6 of FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="39">Referring again to FIG. 8, because the roof modules 95 are bolted to the block assembly rods 3 that run through the top plate holes 42, cement block holes 5, and/or wall block holes, and to the foundation, with the steel cables 98 in place, the roof modules, block plates, blocks, and foundation of the system of a building of the present invention all become effectively one assembly.</p>
    <p num="40">
      FIG. 9 illustrates an exploded view of adjacent top plates 41, a section of angle iron 101, and the top concrete blocks 4 of two adjacent stacks of concrete blocks of the system of a building of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Sections of angle iron 101 run the length of each wall, and thus run the entire inside perimeter of a building of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The inner flange 43 of each top plate section 41 has a bolt or a section of threaded rod 44 welded to it.
      <br/>
      The angle iron sections 101 have holes 103 that are spaced to align with a row of top plate sections 41.
      <br/>
      The angle iron sections 101 are bolted to the top plate flange sections 43 using the bolt or threaded rod sections 44.
      <br/>
      In this way the building is further structurally reinforced with respect to any vertical force vector acting on a wall.

      FIG. 10 illustrates a sloped wall top module 121 of the system of a building of the present invention.
      <br/>
      These sloped wall top modules can range in length from about 12' to about 24'. When roof modules 95 are put in place, they run parallel to the sloped wall top modules, as shown in FIG. 12. Referring to FIG. 10, the sloped roof top module 121 comprises a triangular shaped frame 122, having a base plate 123 typically of steel or a similar material, a slight rise section 124 of between about 8" and 18", also typically of steel, and a top section 125 also typically of steel.
      <br/>
      There are holes 126 along the entire length of the base 123 and top section 125, corresponding to the block assembly rod holes and/or block assembly column holes.
      <br/>
      The holes 126 in the top section 125 are large enough in diameter to allow a bolt to be placed on the threaded top of a block assembly rod or column, and then to bolt the base plate 123 securely to the block assembly rod or column.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Continuing to refer to FIG. 10, the sloped wall top module 121 has angle iron mountings 127, typically at one to three points, at which steel angle irons can be attached that run perpendicular to the ribs of the roof modules.
      <br/>
      A section of one such steel angle iron 94 is shown as ready to be put in place and attached to mounting 128 of the sloped wall top module 121 of FIG. 10. The sloped wall top module angle iron mountings 127 are typically welded to the base plate 123, and have holes 130 that are used together with the holes 131 in an angle iron 94 to bolt angle irons 94 to the mountings.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      FIG. 11 is a detail view of a mounting 127 on the base plate 123 of a section of a sloped wall top module 121, and an angle iron 94 ready to be attached to the mounting 127 of the system of a building of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The angle iron 94 is placed against the mounting 127, the holes 130 and 131 are aligned, the bolts 132 are inserted, and the angle iron 94 is thus secured to the mounting 127 and thereby to the sloped wall top module 121.
      <br/>
      Additional vertical angle irons 133 are also secured to the angle irons 94 using bolts that run through aligned holes 134 and 135 in the angle iron 133 and the spanning angle iron 94 respectively.
      <br/>
      The other end of the angle iron 133 is bolted to one of the bolts 6 embedded in the foundation 1 as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In this way, the roof modules, the sloped wall top module, the wall, the block assembly rods and/or columns, and the foundation are all functionally one structure.

      FIG. 12 is a view of two sloped wall top module sections 121, a roof module 95, a wall section 111, and primary framing elements of the system of a building of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The wall top modules are placed such that there is a slope to the roof from the joining point 144 of the two wall top modules, downward to both sides.
      <br/>
      The joining point 144 of the wall top modules 121 is recessed, allowing the placement of a major spanning beam 141, a section of which is illustrated in FIG. 12, such that the top 145 of the major spanning beam 141 is level with the sloped top plate sections 123 of the wall top module sections 121.
      <br/>
      The major spanning beam 141 is typically a steel I-beam, and spans the length of the building to the opposite wall.
    </p>
    <p num="45">Angle irons 94 are mounted to the mountings on the wall top module sections 121, as indicated in FIG. 12. The mounting of the angle irons 94 is not illustrated in FIG. 12, but was illustrated and detailed earlier with reference to FIG. 11. These angle irons span the length of the building to the opposite wall.</p>
    <p num="46">
      Both major supporting columns 143 and minor supporting columns 142 are used as framing elements in the system of a building of the present invention.

      These are detailed below with reference to other illustrations.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 12, major supporting columns 143 are typically located under a major spanning beam 141.
      <br/>
      Minor supporting columns 142 are typically located under spanning angle irons 94, but can in some cases also be located under major supporting beams instead of major columns 143.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      When the framing structure is in place, roof modules 95 of the system of the present invention are put in place.
      <br/>
      These roof modules 95 are secured to angle iron supports 94, as was described earlier and illustrated by FIG. 7, and one end of each roof module 95 is secured to the walls perpendicular to those with sloped wall top modules 121, as was described earlier and illustrated by FIG. 8.

      However, for some smaller buildings and/or sections of buildings of the present invention, both ends of roof modules 95 are secured to walls, and only one sloped wall top module 121 is used.
      <br/>
      When a major spanning beam is used, the spanning beam 141 has holes 151, that are spaced to correspond with holes 97 in bottom ribs 93 of the roof module 95.
      <br/>
      Bolts 152 are placed in holes 97 of the bottom ribs 93 of the roof module 95.
      <br/>
      The roof modules 95 are placed on the roof such that the holes 97 and 151 are aligned, and thus the bolts 152 drop through the holes 151 in the major spanning beam 141, nuts are placed, and the roof modules 95 are thus secured to the major spanning beam 141.

      The top part of the minor supporting pillar 142, from the hollow steel tube section(s) 159 up, can be placed in a hole 158 that is pre-cast in the concrete column section 152, or can be permanently embedded in the concrete column section 152.
      <br/>
      The top part of the minor supporting pillar 142, from the hollow steel tube section(s) 159 up, is commercially available in structures that typically are designed to support about 10,000 lbs.

      The foundation and wall insulation panels can be installed together, or separately.
      <br/>
      The wall insulation panels 172 can be installed on either the inside or the outside of the building.

      The side of the wall insulation panel 172 can be optionally spot glued with a suitable adhesive, following a standardized pattern of adhesive placement that will facilitate later removal.
      <br/>
      The wall insulation panel 172 is then pressed or braced firmly against the wall 171 to ensure a permanent adhesive bond.
