    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates generally to the field of water treatment, and more particularly to a machine and process for treating contaminated water.</p>
    <p num="2">
      In broad terms, the invention provides a waste treatment process wherein contaminated or waste water to be treated is routed directly past at least two electrodes of different polarity and composed of metals which can form multivalent salts and/or noble metals which will not be dissolved.
      <br/>
      These electrodes are mechanically cleaned on a continuous basis with a device that automatically travels the length and width of the electrodes making contact with the surface of the electrodes to remove any foreign build up on the electrodes.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In a typical electrolytic treatment process, multivalent electrode metal ions are released during electrolysis.
      <br/>
      The ions cause flocculation of the contaminates in the waste water to be treated.
      <br/>
      The floc, in turn, absorbs additional components or impurities present in the contaminated stream, thereby serving as a transport medium to remove the organic, inorganic and metal components from the water.
      <br/>
      The continuous production of ions for flocculation is maintained by the continuous cleaning of the electrodes to eliminate any build up on the electrodes and aids in a uniform electrode consumption.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The electrolytic process has been in existence for many years.
      <br/>
      In each case, the process equipment has been plagued with a continuous build up of foreign materials on the electrodes causing the electrolysis reaction to diminish or terminate completely and the result is uneven corrosion of the electrodes.
      <br/>
      Prior patents have attempted to illustrate the use of non-conductive pellets or balls in a fluidized bed to clean the electrodes.
      <br/>
      Liquid fluid beds with, for example, a 4 ft/sec.
      <br/>
      Fluidization velocity, are not adequate to remove the deposits from the electrodes.
      <br/>
      Other patents have indicated reversing the polarity of the electrodes frequently and increasing the velocity of the feed stream contributes to the cleaning of the electrodes.
      <br/>
      These inventions have met with limited success because this does not remove the non-conducting deposits on reversal of current and high velocity results in non-treatment of the water.
      <br/>
      After intermediate operating periods (approximately one week), the electrodes inevitably became coated.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      The primary advantage of the invention is to provide a wastewater treatment process for treating contaminated streams containing organic, inorganic and heavy metals.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="12">
      Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiments are provided herein.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood, however, that the present invention may be embodied in various forms.
      <br/>
      Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system, structure or manner.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Turning now to FIG. 1, there is shown a cut-away perspective view of a vertical flow purification apparatus 10.
      <br/>
      The contaminated feed or water moves upward as indicated by the flow arrow 12, between the anode 14 and the cathode 16 exiting at the top of the electrodes 24.
      <br/>
      The spacing of the electrodes is a function of the size of the cleaning device while maintaining the smallest gap possible to reduce power consumption.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The scraper blades 18 are attached to the scraper blade support arm 20 which in turn is attached to the scraper blade support arm shaft 22 which is connected to a mechanical assembly, as more fully described in connection with FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The scraper blades are moved across the electrodes at a predetermined rate to assure the cleaning of deposits accumulated during the purification process.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The scraper blades 18 are designed in such a way as to continue to open wider as the electrodes 24 diminish and the gap between the anode and the cathode becomes wider.
      <br/>
      The blade for the anode is insulated between the blade for the cathode to eliminate any shorting between the anode and the cathode during the cleaning process.
      <br/>
      Other blade arrangements may be feasible including plastics or other metals, blades and brush combination, chemical washing of electrodes, high pressure washing while operating intermittent withdrawal of an electrode for external cleaning on the way out or back or physical removal for external washing while the remaining electrodes function.
      <br/>
      The scraper blades do not have to be insulated if used when the electrodes are not energized.
      <br/>
      For example, if two sets of electrodes are used in series, in which one set of electrodes was de-energized for cleaning and the other set of electrodes continued to operate, the process could then be reversed to clean the other set of electrodes
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The electrodes are comprised of metals which form multivalent salts, for example, trivalent, or noble metals which conduct electricity but do not dissolve.
      <br/>
      A wide range of effective electrodes can be utilized such as aluminum, iron, or alloy of such metals, copper, chromium, graphite or carbon.
      <br/>
      The current flow to the electrodes can be reversed by reversing the direct current voltage.
      <br/>
      The polarity of each individual electrode is periodically changed within the range of 1 to 100 minutes, so that all electrolytic materials are equally consumed.
      <br/>
      This also achieves partial cleaning of the electrodes as claimed by other proposals.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The multivalent consumable electrodes can operate as the conventional positive electrode or by substituting the positive electrode with a noble metal electrode and the consumable electrode (aluminum, iron, copper, chrome, etc.) in the negative position.
      <br/>
      Solutions, suspensions and emulsions can be separated into particles and various liquid phases after flowing through the charged field.
      <br/>
      For example, in some cases if aluminum or iron is the anode electrode, the negative ions containing the consumable metal can have more affinity for the suspension than the positive ions and therefore are able to collect the flue and the particles more rapidly to facilitate the separation from the liquid phase.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      When the electrodes are attached to a direct current power source, the reaction of the waste treatment process can be controlled by varying the voltage of the electrodes as a function of the degree of contaminates in the waste water stream.
      <br/>
      Energy will be conserved when the feed stream is relatively low in contaminates.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Scraper blades constructed of stainless steel appears most effective in eliminating build up of undesirable material on the surface of the aluminum or other types of electrodes.
      <br/>
      The scrapper is designed to use the flex in the stainless sheet to apply pressure on the electrode surface and requires approximately 8 lb.
      <br/>
      Force per inch of scraper blade area to move the scraper blade.
      <br/>
      A scraper blade that was tested was constructed of 1/16" thick stainless plate.
      <br/>
      The electrodes were placed 0.5 inches apart in the electrolytic containment.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The selection of the electrode gap and scrapper blade design is an optimization of the cost of the scraper against the cost of power utilization required to pass the current through the water gap between the electrodes.
      <br/>
      Typically a 1/4" gap provides an economical power consumption.
      <br/>
      Less can restrict the water flow and larger gaps can increase the cost of power.
      <br/>
      The scraper blade, when utilized in the electrolysis chamber, will provide savings from better uniform utilization of electrode material.
      <br/>
      Half-inch spacing between electrodes may be justified in order to provide enough room for a scrapper blade with the ability to carry the force required for cleaning at an acceptable operating cost.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Another broad aspect of the present invention in the treatment process includes the measurement and control of the current supplied to the electrodes which indicates the degree of impurities in the waste water feed stream.
      <br/>
      This may be done by for example, measuring conductivity of the water and adjusting the current proportional to the flow rate and conductivity.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In another broad aspect of the present invention, the flocculated material produced from flowing water containing relatively no impurities through the equipment of the invention, produces a stable flocculating agent which can be stored or inventoried for very long periods.
      <br/>
      The floc material can be used alone or in conjunction with filter aids to remove trace quantities of impurities to adapt to applications where only small quantities of waste water are to be treated or power is not available.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Particular embodiments may be dependent on the economics to arrive at the best configuration.</p>
    <p num="24">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="25">
      Tests were performed in a vertical electrode assembly with 1/4" aluminum electrodes 5" wide and 16" length.
      <br/>
      A 2.25" scrapper blade was used to ream the face of each electrode every 15 minutes for 40 hours.
      <br/>
      During the testing period, no material build up was observed; no loss of current and no increase in voltage was required.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      FIG. 2 shows a flow chamber 25 with blade movement achieved by a drive motor 34 and a drive shaft 32.
      <br/>
      The overall dimensions of the chamber are governed by the area to carry the current and apply floc and the total number of different electrode pairs needed to clean a specific feed stream and rate of feed stream.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The process of treating water as shown in FIG. 2 shows the contaminated water entering the feed inlet 27 and moving upward through the electrode assembly as shown on FIG. 1 and then exiting the treated water outlet 29.
      <br/>
      The drive motor 34 controls the movement of the scraper blades support arm 30 which moves the scraper blades or other cleaning devices across the anode and the cathode such as brushes.
      <br/>
      The instrument connections 26 are used to monitor and control the process.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      A clean water treated water outlet 29 in FIG. 2 is connected to an external vessel (not shown on the drawing) where the remaining flocculation occurs.
      <br/>
      An instrument (not shown on the drawing) is installed on one side of the inlet conduit 27 upstream of its connection to the electrolytic containment.
      <br/>
      The instrument controls the power supply to the electrodes.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The electrodes, which typically are made of metals which form multivalent salts, release ions which combine with impurities, both organic and inorganic, to form hydrophobic floc.
      <br/>
      The flocculent, in turn, absorbs additional impurities, particularly organic colloidal particles, and carries them through the electrolytic chamber.
      <br/>
      The floc and absorbed impurities are removed through the discharge 29 shown in FIG. 2 of the electrolytic chamber and flow into a settling tank for the separation of the flocculated impurities.
      <br/>
      The hydrophobic matter is separated in the tank and removed by conventional methods.
      <br/>
      The flocculated impurities migrate to the top of the settling tank and are removed from the tank by various methods such as raising the liquid level in the tank to float the impurities off or by skimming the impurities off the top of the tank by a skimmer blade.
      <br/>
      The floated impurities are routed to any type of filter to remove the solids from the liquid.
      <br/>
      The settled impurity particles are removed from the settling tank by pumping the slurry type impurities to any type of filter to remove the solids from the liquid.
      <br/>
      Purified water is removed from the tank and is further treated through a filter not shown on the drawing.

      FIG. 3 shows a horizontal flow process with the blades oriented along the vertical plane with flow as shown in flow arrow 41 through chamber 51.
      <br/>
      The flange assembly 49 is designed to seal the cell and also provide easy access to the electrodes 44 and scraper blades 47.
      <br/>
      The motor 46 drives the vertical drive shaft 48 which in turn moves the scraper blade support 50 and support arm 45.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The horizontal feed inlet 52 provides contaminated raw material which moves past the electrodes 44 and exits from the treated water outlet 54.
      <br/>
      The spacing of the electrodes depends on the size of the cleaning device while maintaining the smallest gap possible to reduce power consumption.
      <br/>
      The scraper blades 47 are attached to the scraper blade support arm 45 which in turn is attached to the scraper blade support 50.
      <br/>
      The drive motor 4la controls the movement of the scraper blade support arm 45 and the scraper blade support 50.
      <br/>
      This mechanical assembly moves the blades across the electrodes at a predetermined rate to assure the cleaning of accumulated deposits during the purification process.
      <br/>
      The scraper blades are designed in such a way as to continue to open wider as the electrodes 44 diminish and the gap between the anode and the cathode becomes wider.
      <br/>
      The cleaning blade for the anode is insulated from the blade for cleaning the cathode to eliminate any shorting between the anode and the cathode during the cleaning process if the cleaning is performed when the electrodes are energized.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 2 further shows contaminated waste water flowing through the inlet conduit 27 to the electrolytic chamber.
      <br/>
      When the waste water passes the electrodes, the degree of conductivity in the waste water is determined.
      <br/>
      The conductivity adjusts the power supply to the electrodes.
      <br/>
      The waste water flows at the design rate of the unit.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The effectiveness of the electrodes 44 in FIG. 3 is ensured by the continuous cleaning of the electrodes by the mechanical cleaning device.
      <br/>
      The cleaning devices move between the electrodes in an even upward and downward motion cleaning the undesirable deposits from the entire surface of the electrode.
      <br/>
      The cleaning of the electrodes is necessary not only when high concentration of contaminated waste water is treated but also when relatively uncontaminated raw water is processed.
      <br/>
      Due to the cleaning motion of the devices, a thin film of non-conducting solids is continuously removed from the electrodes, which would otherwise deposit a coating on the electrodes and decrease the ion release.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In line instruments can be used to measure or sense the degree of contamination for example, conductivity in the wastewater.
      <br/>
      This conductivity instrument can be used to control the current supply to the electrodes.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Electrodes made of dissimilar materials can be utilized without departing from the scope of this invention.
      <br/>
      Such electrodes can use the battery effect to release ions without being energized from an outside source of energy.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The use of a noble electrode as an anode opposite a flocculating metal (e.g. Aluminum) electrode as the cathode can improve the flocculation process by creating negative Aluminum ion complexes.
      <br/>
      Some particulate does not respond as well to the positive ions but does coagulate with negative ions.
      <br/>
      Examples of negative and positive ion complexes are shown below::

    <p num="38">The following is an example illustrating that types of electrodes other than aluminum can be used to obtain the same results:</p>
    <p num="39">
      A graphite anode electrode was installed in an electrolysis containment 1/4" from an aluminum cathode electrode.
      <br/>
      After 2 hours and 45 minutes, the cathode electrode had lost 1.5 grams of aluminum.
      <br/>
      The theoretical loss was calculated at 1.58 grams verifying that the current efficiency with the aluminum as the cathode electrode was high in spite of forming negative ions.
    </p>
    <p num="40">A second example illustrates that Iron is preferred over all in acid pH ranges.</p>
    <p num="41">
      Similar results were obtained from testing a sample of saturated aluminum sulfate containing very fine particles of titanium dioxide.
      <br/>
      The sample could not be flocculated by utilizing conventional aluminum electrodes in the electrolysis process.
      <br/>
      A combination of an iron cathode electrode and a graphite anode electrode did produce the flocculation of the titanium dioxide and a clear liquid solution which required no filtration.

      Turning now to FIGS. 4 and 5, there is shown another preferred embodiment utilizing a rotary drum electrode and cleaning scrapers.
      <br/>
      The contaminated liquid enters through the flow inlet 74 and flows through the electrolytic treatment zone 64 between the rotary drum electrode 60 shown in FIG. 5 and the bottom electrode 62.
      <br/>
      The liquid leaving the electrolytic treatment zone 64 then exits through the flow outlet 76.
      <br/>
      The rotary drum electrode 60 rotates on the rotary drum electrode drive shaft 68 until the bottom electrode cleaning device 58 cleans the entire area of the bottom electrode 62 but stops before making contact with the rotary drum cleaning device 56.
      <br/>
      The rotary drum electrode 60 would then reverse directions and clean the bottom electrode 62 and continue in that cycle.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the rotation of the rotary drum electrode may be continuous in one direction by utilizing a cam to pick up the rotary drum electrode cleaning device 56 until the bottom electrode cleaning device 58 passes by the rotary drum electrode cleaning device 56 which may be in a fixed position and will continuously clean the rotary drum electrode 60 as it rotates around the bottom electrode 62.
      <br/>
      The rotary drum electrode drive motor 72 turns the rotary drum electrode drive shaft 68.
      <br/>
      The revolutions per minute can be adjusted to assure maximum cleaning of the electrodes.
      <br/>
      The rotary drum electrode 60 can be adjusted up or down to maintain the required clearance between the bottom electrode 62 and the rotary drum electrode 60 is consumed.
      <br/>
      The rotary drum drive shaft bearing 70 allows the rotary drum electrode 60 to spin freely and maintain the required gap in the electrolytic treatment zone.
