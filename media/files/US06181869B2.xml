      Data on multiple stories or scenes are recorded on a recording medium so as to reduce the physical distance moved by a pickup at playback time and to suppress breaks or disturbances in reproduced video.
      <br/>
      A multi-scene program having a plurality of optionally selectable branch stories B0, B1, B2, B3, etc., is recorded between a branch point X and a connection point Y.
      <br/>
      The preceding main story of a video program, made up of video, sound, text and the like, branches off at branch point X to the branch stories, and at connection point Y connects to the succeeding main story in the video program.
      <br/>
      The recorded state between the branch point X and the connection point Y is such that the branch stories are each divided into multiple cells and the cells of the respective branch stories are recorded time-division multiplexed.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to an information recording method useful in recording video, sound, subvideo, etc. on a recording medium, such as an optical disk or the like, and a recording medium and a reproducing apparatus used with the method.</p>
    <p num="3">
      In recent years, optical disks on which video, sound, subvideo, etc. are recorded have developed to record information at a high density and playback apparatuses have been developed to relieve the information recorded.
      <br/>
      In recording information, such as a movie, on an optical disk, it has been proposed to record story data for multiple stories that proceed simultaneously.
      <br/>
      For example, suppose brothers A and B pursue their separate courses, and life as they grow up one of them becomes a police officer (the first story), the other enters becomes a gangster (the second story), and after some time, they meet again and then get along together.
      <br/>
      This is the type of story data used for multiple stories that proceed simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In addition, in recording information, such as a movie on an optical disk, it has been proposed to record the same event is from multiple angles to produce simultaneously proceeding multi-angle scenes.
      <br/>
      For example, a multi-angle scene could have first scene of a ship crossing over the ocean viewed from land and a second scene of the land viewed from the ship at the same time.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A producer has options of showing viewers the first and second stories in combination, showing mainly the first story to viewers, or showing mainly the second story to viewers.
      <br/>
      However, in conventional movie production practices, one of the options must be chosen.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The same may be said of the first and second scenes.
      <br/>
      If viewers were able to choose freely between the first and second stories or the first and second scenes, the producer would have greater freedom in movie production.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In recent years, an optical disk and playback system has been developed in which multiple stories or multiple scenes that proceed simultaneously have been recorded in advance and viewers are allowed to choose from among them.</p>
    <p num="8">
      It is preferable that multiple stories or scenes be recorded on an optical disk in such a way that, at playback time, data will become convenient to handle.
      <br/>
      Suppose that story data on first and second stories are recorded serially.
      <br/>
      At playback time, only one of the stories is reproduced, it is required to jump to a storage area for the other.
      <br/>
      However, if the other story is short, the physical movement of the pickup will be small, causing no problem.
      <br/>
      If, however, the other story is length, the physical movement of the pickup increase.
      <br/>
      For this reason, a break or disturbance may occur during video playback.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">It is an object of the invention to provide an information storage medium on which multiple stories or multi-angle scenes are recorded in such a way as to decrease the physical movement of a pickup at playback time and to suppress any breaking or disturbance in the reproduced view, a recording method and a reproducing apparatus used with the storage medium.</p>
    <p num="10">To attain this object, this invention is, in recording onto a recording/recorded medium a video program that allows a main story to branch off into multiple branch scene and the branch scenes to connect to a succeeding main story, divides data on each of the branch scenes into multiple scene cells and arranging the scene cells of the respective branch scenes on a time-division multiplexing basis.</p>
    <p num="11">
      By recording in this arrangement, the cells of the same branch scene are picked up at playback time for data reproduction.
      <br/>
      Even in playing back any branch scene, the distance moved by the pickup is not great, thus suppressing breaks or disturbance in reproduced video.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">(Preferred Embodiments)</p>
    <p num="14">Hereinafter, the embodiments of the invention will be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 1 illustrates the flow of a video program on time axis for the purpose of describing an embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      This video program has a preceding main story (or scene) A, multiple branch stories B0 to B3, and a succeeding main story (or scene) C. The branch stories branch off at a point X which is the final position in the preceding main story A and join at a point Y of connection which is the initial point of the succeeding main story C. Here, the preceding main story, the branch stories and the succeeding main story in the video program are each divided into multiple scene cells.
      <br/>
      The cells of the branch story B0 are represented as B0-5, B0-4, . . . , B0-1, the cells of the branch story B1 as B1-2 and B1-1, the cells of the branch story B2 as B2-5, B2-4, . . . , and B2-1, and the cells of the branch story B3 as B3-5, B3-4, . . . , and B3-1.
    </p>
    <p num="16">One scene cell can be defined by various methods which will be described below.</p>
    <p num="17">
      For example, one scene cell may be defined with the physical length of a track on the recording medium taken as a unit, and any scene cell is set to be equal in length.
      <br/>
      Also, one scene cell may be defined with the length of time for playback taken as a unit, and any scene is set equal in playback time.
      <br/>
      When data is encoded, one scene cell may be defined as the amount of coding.
      <br/>
      Any scene cell is set equal in the amount of coding.
      <br/>
      In any definition, scene cells need not to be strictly set equal in length or amount, and it is required only that they be substantially equal to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      When there are multiple branch stories as described above which are recorded on a recording medium, each of the branch stories is arranged so that its scene cells will appear at the same rate relative to the sum of scene lengths of the branch stories.
      <br/>
      In the example of FIG. 1, there are four branch stories, and the 0-th branch story contains five scene cells, the first branch story contains two scene cells, and the second and third branch stories each have five scene cells.
      <br/>
      The sum of scene lengths is 17 cells.
      <br/>
      Thus, the 0-th, second and third branch stories are each arranged at a rate of 5/17, i.e., at a rate of one for about 3.5 cells.
      <br/>
      The 0-th branch story is arranged at a rate of 2/17, i.e., at a rate of one for 8.5 cells.
    </p>
    <p num="19">With such an arrangement, as shown by the recording arrangement of cells of FIG. 1, the jump interval when the first branch story is particularly played back becomes smaller than that which would be formed if the second branch story were arranged aggregated.</p>
    <p num="20">FIG. 2A, illustrates the pickup interval for the 0-th branch story (solid arrows), the pickup interval for the third branch story (broken arrows), and the pickup interval for the first branch story (dashed-and-dotted arrows) in the above-described arrangement pattern.</p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 2B, on the other hand, illustrates the pickup interval for the 0-th branch story (solid arrows), the pickup interval for the third branch story (broken arrows), and the pickup interval for the first branch story (dashed-and-dotted arrows) in the case where each branch story is arranged in sequence.
      <br/>
      With such an arrangement, the pickup interval becomes very long, increasing the risk of a break or disturbance during video playback.
      <br/>
      With an arrangement of the invention, however, such a pattern as shown in FIG. 2A can be obtained, in which the pickup interval is narrowed, thereby suppressing a break or disturbance in reproduced video.
    </p>
    <p num="22">Next, arranging scene cells after scene cells of each branch story have been determined will be described.</p>
    <p num="23">Suppose now that there is a video program that has multiple branch stories (including multi-angle scenes) as shown in FIG. 3A. Multi-angle scenes refer to simultaneously proceeding videos that are shot from different angles, such as a video of a conductor shot close-up in a concert hall and a video of the whole orchestra shot from the seats in the hall.</p>
    <p num="24">
      In FIG. 3A, A0 is a preceding main scene, B0 is a dummy branch scene, and B1 and B2 are branch stories having different contents.
      <br/>
      This video program is divided into scene cells as shown in FIG. 3B. Each scene cell is marked with data capacity and given a cell number.
      <br/>
      Each of point of division, which is indicated by a black dot, serves as the beginning point of a video frame.
      <br/>
      In this example, the data playback time is set equal for all scene cells.
      <br/>
      The data is variably compressed data.
      <br/>
      Thus, even if the playback time is the same for all scene cells, the data capacity is not necessarily the same for all scene cells.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 3B, although B0 is indicated by one black dot, it is a dummy story and supposed to have no actual data.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      When the scene cells are set in the above manner, a table L1 is set up, which indicates the cell number or numbers of a scene cell or cells to which each scene cell is connected as shown in FIG. 4A. That is, the scene cell number connected to the scene cell number A0-1 is A0-0 only.
      <br/>
      The cell number connected to the cell number A0-0 is B1-3 or B2-2 or C0-0, or C1-0.
      <br/>
      If each scene cell is associated in this way with a scene cell or cells to which it is connected, the table L1 shown in FIG. 4A can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="26">FIG. 4B is a cell-number table L2 set up to actually arrange each scene cell serially on a track of a recording medium on the basis of the information in the table of FIG. 4A.</p>
    <p num="27">Next, to actually arrange each scene cell serially on a track of a recording medium on the basis of the information in which a scene cell or cells to which each scene cell is connected i.e., to obtain an arrangement in table L2, the order of arrangement is determined by the following procedure.</p>
    <p num="28">FIG. 5 shows an algorithm for determining the order in which cell numbers are arranged.</p>
    <p num="29">
      First, the cell number and the capacity on the first row in table L1 is written into the first row in table L2 (steps S1 and S2).
      <br/>
      The cell number to which the cell is connected is also read.
      <br/>
      Next, a decision is made as to whether all the cell numbers to which the associated cell number of cell numbers to which no connection completion flag is attached in table L2 is connected lie within the maximum allowable jump range (Jmax) in the forward and backward directions with respect to its cell number position.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The maximum allowable jump range (Jmax) is a value that is determined by the response speed of a pickup used in playback apparatus and the capacity (reproducing time) of an output buffer which temporarily stores data to be output for playback.</p>
    <p num="31">
      With the relationship between the cell number A0-1 and the cell number A0-0 to which A0-1 is connected, the Jmax (20 Mb in this example) is met.
      <br/>
      Thus, a connection completion flag is attached to the row for A0-1 in table L2 (step S4).
      <br/>
      Next, from table L1 are read the cell number A0-0, its data capacity, and the cell numbers B1-3, B2-2, C0-0 and C1-0 to which A0-0 is connected (step S3).
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      A decision is made as to whether all the cell numbers to which the associated cell number, of cell numbers A0-0, B1-3, B2-2, C0-0 and C1-0 to which no connection completion flag is attached, is connected fall within the maximum allowable jump range (Jmax) in the forward and backward directions with respect to its cell number position.
      <br/>
      In this case, the distances between A0-0 and C0-0 and between A0-0 and C1-0 exceed Jmax, so that the procedure goes to step S6 via step S5.
    </p>
    <p num="33">Step S5 makes a decision as to whether the number of cell numbers to which no connection completion flag is attached is only one and the cell number or numbers to which that cell number is present or absent and is one for the final decision of the completion of arrangement processing.</p>
    <p num="34">
      Since the arrangement is not completed at the time the cell number A0-0 was read, the procedure goes to step S6.
      <br/>
      In step 56, use is made of the cell number A0-0 and the cell numbers B1-3, B2-2, C0-0 and C1-0 to which the cell number A0-0 is connected to make the following decision.
      <br/>
      That is, with the assumption that a scene cell number is represented by $m-n, one in which $ is minimal and is selected first.
      <br/>
      In this example, there are B and C and hence B is selected (in this example it is assumed that A&lt;B&lt;C).
      <br/>
      Further, a situation in which n is maximal and m is minimal is extracted.
      <br/>
      That is, that n is large means that the number of divisions is large, and that m is small means that the priority assigned to a branch story is high.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In the above example, as can be seen from FIG. 3B, the scene cell number following A0-0 is B1-3.
      <br/>
      Next, the cell number B1-2 to which the cell number B1-3 thus extracted is connected is provisionally arranged on the last row in table L2 (step S7).
      <br/>
      It is B1-2 that follows B1-3.
      <br/>
      Thus, cell arrangement is in the order of A0-0, B1-3, B2-2, C0-0, C1-0, and B1-2.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Next, with all of cells to which other cell numbers (B2-2, C0-0, C1-0) than the extracted cell number B1-3 which have not been connected yet are connected being provisionally arranged to follow, a decision is made as to whether the distances in amount of coding between the cell numbers which have not been connected yet and the cells to which they are connected are all below Jmax (20 Mb) (step S8).
      <br/>
      In this example, B2-1, D0-0, D1-0, D0-0 and D1-0 will be further arranged to follow B2-2, C0-0, C1-0 and B1-2.
      <br/>
      In this case, the distance (the amount of coding) between B2-2 and B2-1, the distance between C0-0 and D0-0 and the distance between C1-0 and D1-0 are all within Jmax.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is determined that the provisional arrangement is normal and the procedure then returns to step S3 via step S11.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In step S3, the previous provisional arrangement contains B1-3, B2-2, C0-0, C1-0, and B1-2 and they have each been attached with a connection completion flag as being normal.
      <br/>
      Thus, B2-1, D0-0, D1-0, D0-0 and D1-0 are present as ones to which no connection completion flag is attached.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Next, suppose that, following B2-1, D0-0, D1-0, D0-0 and D1-0, the cell numbers to which each of them is connected are arranged.
      <br/>
      That is, the cell numbers are arranged such that B2-1, D0-0, D1-0, D0-0, D1-0, B2-0, E0-0, E1-0, E0-0 and E1-0.
      <br/>
      In step S3, a decision is made as to whether all the cell numbers to which a cell number (one that has been attached with no connection completion flag) is connected lie within the maximum allowable jump range (Jmax) in the forward and backward directions with respect to that cell number.
      <br/>
      In this case, all the cell numbers are above Jmax and hence the procedure goes to step S6.
      <br/>
      In step S6, B2-1 is extracted, and in step S7, B2-0 is taken out and B2-1, D0-0, D1-0, D0-0, D1-0 and B2-0 are arranged on the last row.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Next, in step S8 again, with all of cells to which the other cell numbers (D0-0, D1-0, D0-0, D1-0, B2-0) than the extracted cell number B2-1, which have not been connected yet, are connected being provisionally arranged to follow, a decision is made as to whether the distances in amount of coding between the cell numbers which have not been connected yet and the cells to which they are connected are all below Jmax (20 Mb).
      <br/>
      That is, when E0-0, E1-0, E0-0, E1-0, C0-0 and C1-0 are arranged to follow (D0-0, D1-0, D0-0, D1-0, B2-0), a decision is made as to whether the distance between each of D0-0, D1-0 and B2-0 and the cell number to which it is connected falls below 20 Mb.
      <br/>
      In this example, the distance between B2-0 and C0-0 and the distance between C1-0 exceed 20.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In this case, therefore, the procedure goes to step S9, in which a decision is made as to whether the number of cell numbers that do not meet the conditions is two or more.
      <br/>
      When the number is two or more, it is assumed that an error has occurred.
      <br/>
      In this example, the number is one and the procedure goes to step S10.
    </p>
    <p num="41">In step S10, all the cells to which unconnected cells that have not been connected yet and that do not meet the conditions are arranged and then their cell number and coding amount are read (in this case, C0-0 and C1-0 are read).</p>
    <p num="42">
      A return is made from step S10 to step S6, in which a cell number is selected in accordance with the above-described principles.
      <br/>
      That is, the cell number $m-n is extracted in which $ is minimal, n is maximal, and m is minimal.
      <br/>
      The procedure then goes to steps S7 and S8.
    </p>
    <p num="43">As described above, according to the algorithm, each of the branch stories is divided by the amounts of coding that, for example, permit an equal playback time to be obtained and the order of arrangement is determined by the principles indicated in steps S3 and S6.</p>
    <p num="44">
      In FIG. 6 there are illustrated several playback examples in a disk on which a recording is made in accordance with an arrangement determined as described above.
      <br/>
      Scene cells are picked up in the order indicated by arrows.
    </p>
    <p num="45">The above example is one example and the invention can be implemented in various ways.</p>
    <p num="46">
      The dividing method shown in FIG. 3B can be modified in various ways.
      <br/>
      According to the above-described method of determining points of division, each of branch stories is divided into multiple scene cells by the amounts of coding that permit the playback time to be the same for all the cells of the branch stories, and the amounts of coding are referenced to make a decision of whether the distance over which the pickup makes a jump lies within the maximum jumping amount Jmax in accordance with the above-described algorithm.
    </p>
    <p num="47">However, in determining points of division, each branch story may be divided separately.</p>
    <p num="48">
      FIG. 7 shows an example in which there are three branch stories and each of the first, second and third stories is equally divided into three cells so that each cell will have an equal amount of coding.
      <br/>
      That is, as shown in FIG. 7A, the first branch story is separated into three cells, numbered B0-0, B0-1 and B0-2, each of an equal amount of coding (5 Mb), the second branch story is divided into three cells B1-0, B1-1 and B1-2 each of an equal amount of coding (7 Mb), and the third story is divided into three cells B2-0, B2-1 and B2-2 each of an equal amount of coding (6 Mb).
      <br/>
      The number of divisions is the same for each branch story, which is three in this example.
    </p>
    <p num="49">With such division, when, as shown in FIG. 7B, a set of cells B0-0, B1-0 and B2-0 is taken as scene cell block -0, a set of cells B0-1, B1-1 and B2-1 as scene cell block -1, and a set of cells B0-2, B1-2 and B2-2 as scene cell block -2, each scene cell block has an equal amount of coding.</p>
    <p num="50">The amount of coding (the amount of data) being equal means that the jumping distance is the same for playback of each of the branch streams B0, B1, and B2.</p>
    <p num="51">
      In the above example, division is made by an equal amount of coding.
      <br/>
      However, each branch may be divided by an equal playback time.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      FIG. 8 shows an example in which there are three branch stories and each of the first, second and third stories is equally divided into three cells so that each cell will have an equal playback time.
      <br/>
      That is, as shown in FIG. 8A, the first branch story is separated into cells numbered B0-0, B0-1, B0-2, and B0-3 each of an equal playback time, the second branch story is divided into cells B1-0, B1-1, B1-2 and B1-3 each of an equal playback time, and the third story is divided into cells B2-0, B2-1, B2-2 and B2-3 each of an equal playback time.
    </p>
    <p num="53">In this case as well, as shown in FIG. 8B, scene cell blocks -0 to -3 can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="54">
      In the above examples, the cell arrangement method for multiple stories was described.
      <br/>
      The same method can be applied to the arrangement of multi-angle scenes.
      <br/>
      When one wants to watch pictures shot from a different angle from the middle, for example, when it is desired to watch pictures of the whole orchestra shot from seats in the concert hall in the middle of watching pictures of the conductor only shot in close-up, he or she can watch freely pictures shot from different angles if multi-angle pictures are recorded.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      FIG. 9A shows multi-angle picture information.
      <br/>
      When a first angle scene D0-0 to D0-3 and a second angle scene D1-0 to D1-3 exist as an information source, scene cell blocks -0 to -3 are formed and arranged as shown in FIG. 9B by way of example.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      FIG. 10 shows an example of a source when one of multiple stories ends in an extremely short time.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10B shows the case where each of the branch stories is divided by a predetermined number (4) into cells.
    </p>
    <p num="57">Even if, when one of the branch stories is extremely short as described above, the cells of the story B0 and the cells of the other stories are simply multiplexed together, the jump distance may become long when a transition is made from playback of the B0 story to playback of the next C0 story, failing to satisfy the conditions.</p>
    <p num="58">
      To solve this problem, such a method as shown in FIG. 11A is used.
      <br/>
      First, as shown in FIG. 11A, a part of the succeeding main story C0 is added to each of the branch stories B0, B1 and B2, and the point of connection is shifted backwards.
      <br/>
      The branch stories are then taken as B0(E), B1(E), and B2(E) as shown in FIG. 11B. Each of the branch stories B0(E), B1(E) and B2(E) is divided into cells, which are numbered as shown in FIG. 11C. The method of subsequent arrangement is the same as the procedure described previously.
      <br/>
      In this example, each branch story is divided into five cells.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      FIG. 12 shows the state in which cell blocks -0, -1, . . . are prepared and arranged, each block containing one cell selected from each branch story.
      <br/>
      These scene cell blocks each contain an error correcting code.
      <br/>
      In this example, the scene cell blocks have the same amount of coding.
      <br/>
      With compressed data by the MPEG2 system in general, division is made so that non-compressed video data, i.e., I-picture or intra-frame compressed data or data expandable without the use of other frame compressed data, is contained at the beginning of cells.
      <br/>
      This is because, in view of the compression system, in the absence of non-compressed video data in the leading cell, succeeding compressed video data cannot be reproduced.
    </p>
    <p num="60">Reference will be made to FIGS. 13A to 13C to explain exemplary division of multiple stories mathematically in the case where they are recorded divided.</p>
    <p num="61">
      As shown in FIG. 13A, suppose that a video program, composed of video, sound, text, etc., contains optionally selectable multiple branch stories B0, B1 and B2 between a point X of branch from a preceding main story A and a point Y of connection to a succeeding main story C. Suppose that the recorded states between the point X of branch and the point Y of connection on a recording medium are arranged as shown in FIG. 13B. Suppose that the branch story B0 is played back as shown in FIG. 13C. Then, the playback apparatus must jump from one cell to another for playback.
      <br/>
      Actually, the pickup will perform processing while reading data and validating the read data.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Suppose here that each branch story is divided into m cells.
      <br/>
      Then, the playback interval (jump distance) of the story that is the shortest as a whole, B0 in this example, will be the longest.
      <br/>
      Thus, consideration is given to the shortest story.
    </p>
    <p num="63">If the whole capacity of B0 is taken as V0, then the capacity of one cell in B0 will be V0/m.</p>
    <p num="64">
      Next, the playback time Tp for B0-0 is given by
      <br/>
      Tp=(V0/m)/Pr
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      and the read time Tr for B0-0 is given by
      <br/>
      Tr=(V0/m)/Rr
    </p>
    <p num="66">where Pr is the maximum code playback rate per unit time of the playback apparatus and Rr is the read rate of the playback apparatus.</p>
    <p num="67">At the time of playback of B0, the amount of coding Vj over which a jump is to be made is represent by  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="68">where i represent story numbers and M represents the number of stories.</p>
    <p num="69">The jump time Tjp at the time of playback of B0 is represented by  (Equation image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="70">where Jp is the amount of coding over which the playback apparatus can jump.</p>
    <p num="71">When it is made a condition that the jump time required for jump to the next cell is shorter than the playback time, i.e., Tp-Tr&gt;Tjp, the following expression can be obtained  (Equation image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="72">The number of divisions is set in accordance with expression (1).</p>
    <p num="73">
      The points of division for obtaining the cells should be determined according to the format of data so that no disturbance will occur in reproduced data.
      <br/>
      Thus, there is no need of dividing strictly by rote so as to meet the above condition only.
      <br/>
      For example, in a video program in which compressed video data, compressed sound data and compressed subvideo data are time-division multiplexed, time division points should be made cell division points.
      <br/>
      The cells contain compressed video data, compressed sound data, and compressed subvideo data.
      <br/>
      Further, in the case of coded video data compressed by the MPEG2 system, the data is preferably divided in units of a group of pictures (GOP) having a playback time of the order of 0.4 to 0.5 seconds.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The invention is not restricted to the above description and can be implemented and modified in various ways.
      <br/>
      The above description is one of the basic principles of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      If each cell has its identification number and the next cell's identification number appended, it becomes convenient to handle at playback time.
      <br/>
      To handle the cells, management information in which the order in which the cells are played back has been set up is utilized in the control unit of the playback apparatus.
      <br/>
      To increase data reliability, each cell may contain an error correcting code that permits correction processing to be concluded in it.
      <br/>
      In the examples of FIGS. 7 and 8 in which the cells of the respective branch scenes are time-division multiplexed, the first to n-th scene cell blocks are arranged in sequence and each scene cell block is made up by cells from different branch scenes.
      <br/>
      In this case, each scene cell block may contain an error correcting code that is in concluded in it.
    </p>
    <p num="76">In the invention, the division of each branch scene into cells and the arrangement of the cells of the respective branch scenes on a time-division multiplexing basis can be described roughly as follows.</p>
    <p num="77">
      That is, the cells are divided and then arranged time-division multiplexed so as to meet the condition that Tp&gt;Ts where Tp is the actual playback time required for the reproduction circuit to play back a video unreproduced portion of a reproduce cell read by the pickup of the playback apparatus and Ts is the read time required for the pickup to search for and read the next cell succeeding that reproduce cell.
      <br/>
      In this case, the playback time by the playback circuit of the playback apparatus is determined by the capacity of a buffer memory for storing reproduced signals, the amount of data multiplied by the compression rate, and the read clock frequency, and the read time is determined as a parameter consisting mainly of the response speed of the pickup.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      In the optical disk, multiple branch scenes between the point of branch and the point of connection are recorded in the form such that each of the branch scenes is divided into cells each corresponding to a predetermined video playback time and cells that are to be played back successively are placed within a distance corresponding to a predetermined amount of coding.
      <br/>
      Suppose here that, in the playback apparatus, the time required to seek the distance corresponding to the predetermined amount of coding is Ts, the amount of read data per unit time is Rr, and the maximum amount of coding per unit time dissipated for video playback is Pr.
      <br/>
      Then, the time Ts and the time Tc required for the playback apparatus to decode one cell by means of a decoder and provide a video reproduced output are related by
      <br/>
      Tc-�(Tc * Pr)/Rr�&gt;Ts

    <p num="79">FIG. 14 shows an arrangement of the playback apparatus for playing back the above-described information recording medium (optical disk).</p>
    <p num="80">
      A disk 100 is placed on a turntable 101 driven by a motor 102 to rotate.
      <br/>
      In playback mode, information recorded on the disk 100 is picked up by a pickup unit 103.
      <br/>
      The pickup unit 103 is subject to movement control and tracking control by a pickup driver 104.
      <br/>
      An output of the pickup unit 103 is entered into a demodulator 201 for demodulation.
      <br/>
      The demodulated data is entered into an error correcting unit 202 for error correction and then into a demultiplexer 203 through a butter memory 220.
      <br/>
      The demultiplexer 203 separately derives video information, caption and text information, sound information, control information, etc.
      <br/>
      That is, caption and character information (subpicture), sound information and the like are recorded on the disk 100 to correspond with video information.
      <br/>
      In this case, as caption and character information and sound information, a choice can be made from various languages under the control of a system controller 204.

      <br/>
      The subpicture separated by the demultiplexer 203 is entered into a subpicture processor 207 where it is decoded into a caption and character video.
      <br/>
      A video signal decoded by the picture decoder 206 is entered into an adder 208 where it is added to the caption and character video (subpicture).

      The adder output is applied to an output terminal 209.

      The sound information selected and separated by the demultiplexer 203 is entered into an audio decoder 211 where it is demodulated and then applied to an output terminal 212.
      <br/>
      In addition to the audio decoder 211, the audio processing unit includes an audio decoder 213, which can reproduce voice in another language and apply it to an output terminal 214.

      <br/>
      When the buffer memory 220 overflows with data in normal continuous playback, the system controller 204 performs kickback processing.

      The system controller of the playback system makes a reference to the program chain information in the video manager to thereby acquire cell playback information.
      <br/>
      By referring to the cell attribute information, whether interleaved unit blocks for multiple angles have been recorded is recognized.
      <br/>
      When the interleaved unit blocks have been recorded, seemless playback information and seemless angle information in the NV_PACK are acquired and stored in the buffer memory in the middle of playback.
      <br/>
      When angle switching information is entered by the user, the seemless angle information is referenced to whereby the playback of interleaved units for the angle specified by the user is started.
      <br/>
      Then, reference is made to the seemless cell playback information contained in the acquired NV_PAC to recognize the interleaved unit to be played back next.
      <br/>
      By referencing to the cell playback information, a decision can be made as to whether it is the end of a cell that is currently played back.
      <br/>
      To play back the next cell, reference is made to the next cell playback information in the cell playback information table to determine the starting address of the first VOBU of the next cell (or interleaved unit).

    <p num="179">
      The system controller 204 of the playback apparatus shown in FIG. 14 is equipped with means for processing various items of management information, program chains, navigation packs, etc., as described above and processing operation inputs from the remote control operating unit 205.
      <br/>
      Thus, detecting means for detecting cell attribute information, cell playback sequence information and branch scene switching information (angle information and the like) are provided.
      <br/>
      And reference is made to information stored in the detecting means in response to an operation input to thereby determine an interleaved unit stream to be played back.
      <br/>
      In this case, by controlling the tracking controller in the pickup unit 103 and the timing of reading of data by the error correcting unit 202, kickback and jump processing is implemented.
