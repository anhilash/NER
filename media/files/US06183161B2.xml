    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The invention is a portable manually maneuverable painting unit or machine for painting stripes on pavements such as roads, streets and parking lots.
      <br/>
      The paint in such operation is preferably heated particularly because of viscosity problems in painting during cold weather.
      <br/>
      During cold weather the viscosity of the paint becomes abnormally high, making it in most instances difficult or impossible to paint the stripes desired.
      <br/>
      By heating the paint, striping can be accomplished during weather conditions which otherwise would prohibit striping operations.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Whereas larger units, such as truck units, utilize hot water heating units for heating the paint, such hot water heating units are of such bulky size and weight as to make incorporation in portable units impractical.
      <br/>
      Propane heating units have been known to be used for such purposes but such heating units are also too large to classified as portable manually operable units as proposed.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      According to the present invention, by use of the hot exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine driving a pressure producing unit, such as a compressor or paint pump in the system, the paint is heated to a lower viscosity appropriate for painting stripes on pavements.
      <br/>
      Because of the heat, lowered viscosity, the amount of solvent or thinning agent necessary to provide the low viscosity can be reduced to a minimum, which in turn reduces the drying time as well as possible danger of toxicity from solvents.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the hot paint in hitting a usually lower temperature pavement is cooled quickly further reducing the drying time and adding to the durability of the applied stripes.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      When air is used to assist spraying the paint at the nozzle, the exhaust gas from the engine can be used to heat both the paint and the air used to spray the paint.
      <br/>
      Whereas in airless spray systems, the paint alone is all that requires heating.
    </p>
    <p num="6">In the use of the term "paint" for striping, it is contemplated that the term apply as well to other materials such as thermoplastic resins in fluid form also capable of being applied as stripes with the apparatus of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="7">
      The exhaust gas from an engine such as from even the smallest Honda engine, in driving the compressor or pump of striping unit, has been found to perform excellently in heating paint directly in a heat exchanger.
      <br/>
      The heat exchanger can be in the form of a simple cylindrical container through which tubing conveys the paint where it receives heat of the gas of the engine exhaust to heat the paint.
      <br/>
      The tubing conveying the paint is usually made of metal such as copper, steel or an alloy metal, and may be shaped, for example, in the form of a coil or in U-shape or merely passed straight through the exchanger.
      <br/>
      When the striping is done with an air gun, to assure that the paint is not cooled before it strikes the pavement, the air can be passed through the same heat exchanger as that used to heat the paint, or possibly another heat exchanger.
      <br/>
      In this regard, heating the air assists in retention of the flowability of the paint for the striping operation.
      <br/>
      If the air is heated in a separate heat exchanger, a muffler type exchanger can be provided which also receives its heat from the exhaust of the compressor engine.
    </p>
    <p num="8">An object of the invention is to provide a small portable striping unit readily and efficiently operable manually independent of temperature conditions.</p>
    <p num="9">Another closely related object is to provide a lightweight road and parking lot striping machine manually maneuverable by a single person.</p>
    <p num="10">A feature of the invention is that by heating the paint, the amount of solvent necessary to maintain the desired fluidity can be reduced, which in turn results in quicker drying of the paint with greater durability.</p>
    <p num="11">Another feature is that by use of the hot exhaust of an engine to heat the paint and the air at the striping gun or nozzle, the seasons of the year can be reduced as a variable in determining when striping operations are to be conducted.</p>
    <p num="12">A further feature of the invention is the ecological advantage which it provides by use of a lesser amount of solvent necessary to maintain the desired paint fluidity.</p>

    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      Turning to the drawings in greater detail, FIG. 1 illustrates schematically the general arrangement of components on a manually maneuverable lightweight striper of the invention.
      <br/>
      The assembly is mounted on a carriage 11 having rear wheels 14 and a front wheels 15 and a carriage handle 12 to allow manual movement by linear and turning action.
      <br/>
      A paint tank 20 is mounted over the larger rear wheels 14.
      <br/>
      The paint from the tank 20 is fed through a connecting tube 29 to a heat exchanger 21.
      <br/>
      It passes through a heat receiving passage of the heat exchanger 21 to a paint pump 25 which in turn supplies the striping paint to the paint gun 26 and its striping nozzle 27 from which the striping fluid is deposited onto a pavement.
      <br/>
      The paint pump 25 is driven by an internal combustion engine 23 which emits hot exhaust gases to an exhaust chamber 24.
      <br/>
      To maintain the fluidity of the paint as it passes through the system and is emitted by the paint gun 26, the hot exhaust gas of the engine 23 is introduced to the heat exchanger 21 in enveloping relationship about the tube through which the paint if fed.
      <br/>
      The paint is thus heated in the heat exchanger and fed to the pump 25 for release from the striping nozzle 27.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 2 illustrates in block diagram form how the striper components are connected to effect supply of heated paint for emission from the paint gun 26.
      <br/>
      The paint is drawn from the paint tank or reservoir 20 and through a tube in the form of a coil 28 in the heat exchanger 21 by the negative pressure action of the paint pump 25 which supplies hot paint to the paint gun 26.
      <br/>
      Power for driving the pump 25 comes from the engine 23 which is connected thereto.
      <br/>
      Hot gases of the engine 23 are supplied from the manifold 24 of the engine to the heat exchanger.
      <br/>
      The hot gases fill the heat exchanger and effect the heating of the coil 28 and the paint passing therethrough.
      <br/>
      The spent gases of the heat exchanger are released from an outlet to 22.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      FIG. 3 illustrates in similar schematic form an arrangement for supply of paint to an air assisted nozzle 37 where the hot paint as well as air are correspondingly heated by engine exhaust gases.
      <br/>
      Hot exhaust gas from engine 33 is supplied from its muffler 34 to a heat exchanger 31 which fills the exchanger.
      <br/>
      The exchanger is provided with an outlet 32 for release of spent gas.
      <br/>
      The engine 33 drives an air compressor 35 which supplies air pressure to the paint in the tank 30.
      <br/>
      The paint flows through a coiled tubing 38 which provides a passageway for the paint through the heat of the exchanger 31.
      <br/>
      The air compressor 35 also supplies air in a separate path 37 through the heat exchanger for release as hot air under pressure at the paint gun 36 to further establish the fluidity of the paint as it is released from the nozzle 36.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In view of the foregoing, it will be understood that many variations of the invention can be provided within the broad scope of principles embodied herein.
      <br/>
      Thus, while particular preferred embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such modifications which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.
