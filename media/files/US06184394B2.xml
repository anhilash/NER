    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention pertains to the preparation of 3-furoate esters and to certain novel intermediate compounds.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention pertains to a two-step process wherein a 4-acyl-2,3-dihydrofuran is converted to a 2-alkoxy-3-acyl-3-halotetrahydrofuran which then is contacted with an alkoxide to produce an alkyl 3-furoate.
      <br/>
      The 2-alkoxy-3-acyl-3-halotetrahydrofuran intermediates are novel compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Unlike 2-furoic acid and its esters which are derived from inexpensive furfural, 3-furoic acid and its esters have been, in the past, difficult and expensive to synthesize in any amount.
      <br/>
      Preparation of 3-substituted furans from furan itself requires multiple steps because the 2-position of furan is more activated toward aromatic substitution reactions.
      <br/>
      Although several literature references describe methods to produce 3-substituted furans, many contain comments on the difficulty of synthesizing such compounds.
      <br/>
      For example, S. P. Tanis states in Tetrahedron Letters, 23, 3115-3118 (1982): "Although many methods have been reported for the synthesis of 3-substituted furans they generally require many steps, relatively inaccessible starting materials, or proceed in low overall yields."
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Most literature processes for the preparation of 3-furoic acid or ester involve the decarboxylation of furandicarboxylic acids. T. Reichstein, et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 15, 268-273 (1932); 16, 276-281 (1933), reported the preparation of 3-furoic acid from either furan-2,3-dicarboxylic acid, furan-3,4-dicarboxylic acid or furan-2,4-dicarboxylic acid.
      <br/>
      These dicarboxylic acids are obtained in low yield via several intermediate steps.
      <br/>
      See also D. Dare, et al., J. Chem. Soc., Perkin I, 1130-1134 (1973); M. Boyd, et al., Synthesis, 545-546 (1971); L. W. Deady, et al., Synthesis, 571 (1972).
      <br/>
      In a simplification of Reichstein's process, E. Sherman, et al. decarboxylated furantetracarboxylic acid to give 3-furoic acid (J.
      <br/>
      Am. Chem. Soc., 72, 2195-2199 (1950)).
      <br/>
      Gilman, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 55, 2903-2909 (1933) reported the decarboxylation of 2,4-furandicarboxylic acid to 3-furoic acid which was converted to ethyl 3-furoate via 3-furoyl chloride.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      3-Bromofuran can be converted into 3-furoic acid by reaction with butyl lithium to give 3-lithiofuran followed by reaction with carbon dioxide (Y.
      <br/>
      Fukuyama, et al., Synthesis, 443-444 (1974); I. Fleming, et al., Synthesis, 898 (1985)) or by electrocarboxylation (O.
      <br/>
      Sock, et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 26, 1509-1512 (1985)).
      <br/>
      These methods, however, are expensive and difficult to adapt to commercial scale operation.
      <br/>
      Additionally, 3-bromofuran is prohibitively expensive for use as a starting material.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Other processes for preparing 3-furoic acid and esters thereof include (1) the rhodium-catalyzed reaction of alkyl formyldiazoacetate with vinyl ethers (E.
      <br/>
      Wenkert, et al., J. Organic Chem., 55, 4975-4976 (1990)); (2) Diels Alder reactions of oxazoles with propiolic acid or ester (S. R. Ohlsen, et al., J. Chem. Soc. (C), 1632-1633 (1971); G. Ya. Kondrat'eva, et al., Proc. of the Academy of Sciences, USSR (Chem.), 200, 862-864 (1971)); and (3) oxidative addition of ethyl formylacetate with vinyl acetate (E.
      <br/>
      Baciocchi, et al., Synthetic Communications, 18, 1841-1846 (1988)).
      <br/>
      These processes suffer from the use of expensive and/or hazardous starting materials and low yields.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      F. Effenberger, et al., Chem. Ber., 115, 2766-2782 (1982) and M. Hojo, et al., Synthesis, 1016-1017 (1986) describe the trichloroacetylation and trifluoroacetylation of 2,3-dihydrofuran to produce 2,3-dihydro-4-trichloroacetylfuran and 2,3-dihydro-4-trifluoroacetylfuran in good yield.
      <br/>
      These trihalomethylketone intermediates can be hydrolyzed to yield 2,3-dihydro-4-furoic acid (M.
      <br/>
      Hojo, et al., Synthesis, 1016-1017 (1986); N. Zanatta, et al., J. Heterocyclic Chem., 34, 509-513 (1997)). P.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The starting material for the process of the present invention is a 4-acyl-2,3-dihydrofuran of formula (II).
      <br/>
      Compounds (II) wherein R2 is a perhaloalkyl group can be prepared according to known procedures such as those described by F. Effenberger, et al., Chem. Ber., 115, 2766-2782 (1982) and M. Hojo, et al., Synthesis, 1016-1017 (1986).
      <br/>
      The perhaloalkyl group may have up to about 4 carbon atoms and the halo substitutents may be selected from chloro, bromo, iodo and fluoro.
      <br/>
      The perhaloalkyl group which R2 may represent most preferably is trichloromethyl.
      <br/>
      It may be possible to form the perhaloalkyl group during the first step of the process of my invention wherein the starting material is contacted with a halogenating agent.
      <br/>
      For example, 4-(dichloroacetyl)-2,3-dihydrofuran may be converted by a brominating agent to a 2-alkoxy-3-bromo-3-(bromo-dichloroacetyl) tetrahydrofuran intermediate compound.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The trihaloacetyl group (--C(O)CX3) is useful in organic synthesis because it behaves much as an carboxylic acid chloride, i.e., it may be hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid in what is known as the "haloform reaction" (R. C. Fuson, B. A. Bull, Chem.
      <br/>
      Rev., 15, 275(1934)) or converted to an ester by base-catalyzed reaction with an alkanol.
      <br/>
      A trihalomethane (haloform) is the by-product of this reaction.
      <br/>
      Normally in the haloform reaction a methyl ketone is halogenated under basic conditions resulting in formation of an intermediate trihalomethyl ketone which hydrolyzes to a carboxylic acid and a trihalomethane.
      <br/>
      The hydrolysis reaction is known where the attached halogens are fluorine, chlorine, bromine and/or iodine.
      <br/>
      It is not necessary that all three halogens of the trihalomethyl ketone be the same.
      <br/>
      Perhaloalkanoyl groups containing more than 2 carbon atoms similarly are useful in the haloform reaction.
      <br/>
      A convenient and high yield process to prepare these starting materials is via the acylation of 2,3-dihydrofuran.
      <br/>
      For example, as already discussed, 2,3-dihydro-4-trichloroacetylfuran �Compound (II), R2.dbd.CCl3 � is produced in high yield and selectivity by the reaction of trichloroacetyl chloride with 2,3-dihydrofuran in the presence of pyridine as an acid scavenger.
      <br/>
      The reaction also may be performed with trichloroacetic anhydride although trichloroacetyl chloride is preferred.
      <br/>
      Other acid scavengers may be employed, e.g., alkyl-substituted pyridines and trialkylamines, but pyridine is preferred.
      <br/>
      It is not necessary that all halogens of the perhaloalkanoyl group be the same.
      <br/>
      For example 2,3-dihydro-4-(bromodichloroacetyl)furan may be used as well. 2,3-Dihydro-4-trichloroacetylfuran is the preferred starting material of the process of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Alternatively, the corresponding ester �Compound (II), R2.dbd.alkoxy� may be employed as the starting material.
      <br/>
      The alkoxy may have up to about 8 carbon atoms, preferably up to about 4 carbon atoms and preferably, the alkoxy group is methoxy or ethoxy.
      <br/>
      Such ester starting materials may be obtained from the analogous 2,3-dihydro-4-(perhalo-alkanoyl)furans according to known procedures.
    </p>
    <p num="15">In the first step of the process of this invention, a compound having the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="16">is contacted with a halogenating agent in the presence of an alkanol to obtain an intermediate compound having the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="17">
      wherein R2 is perhaloalkyl or alkoxy; R3 is alkyl; and X is halogen.
      <br/>
      The halogenating agent may be a chlorinating agent or, preferably, a brominating agent.
      <br/>
      Examples of such halogenating agents include bromine, N-bromosuccinimide, 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, chlorine, 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin and N-chlorosuccinimide.
      <br/>
      The amount of halogenating agent employed should be sufficient to convert essentially all of Compound (II) to Compound (III).
      <br/>
      Thus, at least one mole of bromine and N-bromosuccinimide and at least 0.5 mole of 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin normally is used per mole of Compound (II).
      <br/>
      A slight excess, e.g., up to about 10 mole percent excess, of the halogenating agent may be used.
      <br/>
      The halogenating agent preferably is a brominating agent, especially 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin.
      <br/>
      When bromine or chlorine is used as the halogenating agent, an acid scavenger is needed to consume by-product hydrogen bromide or hydrogen chloride.
      <br/>
      Examples of such acid scavengers include sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In step (1), the halogenation is carried out in the presence of an alkanol which forms the alkoxy group represented by -OR3.
      <br/>
      The alkanol (and the alkoxy group derived therefrom) may have up to about 8 carbon atoms but preferably is a primary alkanol have up to 4 carbon atoms and, most preferably, is methanol or ethanol.
      <br/>
      The amount of alkanol employed normally is at least one mole alkanol per mole of starting material (II) and may be in the range of about 1.1 to 10 moles per mole of starting material (II).
      <br/>
      An inert auxiliary solvent may be used, but is not required, in the halogenation of step (1).
      <br/>
      Examples of such inert solvents include aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g., hexane, heptane, decane, toluene and the isomers of xylene; and halogenated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane, perchloroethylene, chlorobenzene and the various isomers of dichlorobenzene.
      <br/>
      The optional hydrocarbon and halogenated hydrocarbon solvents preferably contain from 6 to 12 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      The optional auxiliary solvent must also be inert to the strong base of step (2) if it is not removed first.
      <br/>
      The preferred mode is halogenate in an alkanol without an inert auxiliary solvent.
      <br/>
      Since water causes side reactions, step (1) normally is carried out under substantially anhydrous conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Step (1) of my novel process may be carried out at temperatures in the range of about -20 to 60 (degree)  C., preferably at temperatures in the range of about 0 to 20 (degree)  C. Pressure is not an important feature of the present process and thus various total pressures, e.g., pressures moderately above or below ambient pressure, may be used.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The second step of the present process of this invention involves the base-mediated conversion of intermediate compound (III) to alkyl furoate (I).
      <br/>
      Step (2) includes contacting intermediate compound (III) with a strong base in the presence of a solvent.
      <br/>
      Examples of such strong bases include alkoxides of the alkali metals and strongly basic amines such as 1,8-diazabicyclo�5.4.0�undec-7-ene and 1,5-diazabicyclo�4.3.0�non-5-ene.
      <br/>
      The strong base preferably is an alkali metal alkoxides such as alkoxides having the formula M--O--R4 wherein M is an alkali metal, preferably sodium or potassium, most preferably, sodium, and R4 is an alkyl group have up to about 8 carbon atoms, preferably up to about 4 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      The alkali alkoxide most preferably is sodium methoxide or ethoxide.
      <br/>
      The amount of bases used typically is at least 1 mole or equivalent, preferably 1.2 to 3 moles or equivalents, of base per mole of intermediate compound (III) present.
      <br/>
      If the process is carried out without isolating intermediate compound (III), the reaction mixture have intermediate compound (III) also normally contains residues of halogenating agents which react with and thus consume some base.
      <br/>
      Consequently, when the process is operated without isolating intermediate compound (III), e.g., in a single reactor, the amount of base preferably is about 2 to 4 moles or equivalents base per mole of intermediate compound (III) present.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The second step of my novel process is carried out in the presence of a solvent.
      <br/>
      Examples of the solvents which may be used in step (2) include the alkanols, the aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and the halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons described above.
      <br/>
      When R2 of intermediate Compound (III) is perhaloalkyl, step (2) is carried out in the presence of a alkoxy-providing compound which will effect conversion of the perhaloalkyl group to an alkoxy group.
      <br/>
      The alkoxy-providing compound may be an alkali metal alkoxide which is utilized as the bases in step (2).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the alkoxy-providing compound may be an alkanol such as one of the alkanols which may be used in the first step of the process, i.e., an alkanol have up to about 8 carbon atoms, preferably a primary alkanol have up to 4 carbon atoms and, most preferably, methanol or ethanol.
      <br/>
      The alkyl group represented by R', therefore, may contain up to about 8 carbon atoms, preferably up to about 4 carbon atoms, most preferably methyl or ethyl.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Step (2) may be carried out at in the temperature in the range of about 25 to 100 (degree)  C., preferably at temperatures in the range of about 50 to 80 (degree)  C. As in the case of step (1), pressure is not an important feature of the second step of the present process and thus various total pressures, e.g., pressures moderately above or below ambient pressure, may be used, for example, to achieve a reaction temperature of the atmospheric boiling point of the reaction mixture.
      <br/>
      Also, as is the case for the first step, water cause side reactions, therefore step (2) is also normally carried out under substantially anhydrous conditions.

      <br/>
      The exothermic reaction raised the pot temperature to about 70 (degree)  C. and solvent began to distill (58 to 64 (degree)  C head temperature).

      The addition was performed over about four hours while simultaneously stripping off solvent (chloroform and methanol).
