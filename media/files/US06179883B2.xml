  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to novel 2-imino-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole derivatives, to a process for their preparation, to their use in dyeing keratin fibres such as the hair and to dyeing processes using them.</p>
    <p num="2">It has already been proposed in the past to dye the hair using, as couplers, certain monohydroxy-indoles or monoaminoindolines, in particular in French patent FR-A-2 008 797. U.S. Pat. No. 4,013,404 describes the use of mono- or diaminoindolines or monohydroxy-indolines as oxidation bases or as couplers in the oxidation dyeing of the hair.</p>
    <p num="3">Dyes of the indole family, in particular 5,6-dihydroxyindole, and their use for dyeing keratin fibres such as human hair are moreover known, in particular from French patents FR-A-1,133,594 and FR-A-1,166,172.</p>
    <p num="4">
      The inventors have discovered novel monoalkoxy, mono- or dihydroxy 2-imino-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole derivatives which can have noteworthy dyeing properties towards keratin fibres such as the hair.
      <br/>
      These compounds are readily oxidized in alkaline medium and may be used in hair dyeing possibly without using an oxidizing agent, which makes it possible to obtain a varied range of more or less intense shades.
    </p>
    <p num="5">The subject of the invention is novel 2-imino-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole derivatives as well as the addition salts thereof with an acid, of formula (I) or (II) which will be defined below.</p>
    <p num="6">Another subject of the invention is the use of these compounds in the dyeing of keratin fibres.</p>
    <p num="7">The subject of the invention is dye compositions intended for dyeing keratin fibres, and in particular human hair, containing at least one 2-imino-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole derivative of formula (I) or (II) defined below.</p>
    <p num="8">The subject of the invention is also dyeing processes using these compounds.</p>
    <p num="9">Other subjects of the invention will become apparent on reading the description and the examples which follow.</p>

      The first step is preferably either a chemical reduction in the presence of an organic solvent using metals such as zinc or tin, or a selective hydrogenation using a catalyst such as palladium or platinum.
      <br/>
      The solvents used are preferably ethers and more particularly tetrahydrofuran (THF).
      <br/>
      The reaction temperature ranges preferably from 25 (degree)  C. to the reflux temperature of the solvent and more particularly from 25 to 40 (degree)  C.

    <p num="26">
      The second step is preferably a cyclization reaction in acidic medium in the presence of an organic solvent.
      <br/>
      Acetic acid is preferably used.
      <br/>
      The reaction temperature is that of reflux of the solvent.
      <br/>
      The final product of formula (IA) or (IIA) is preferably isolated in the form of an addition salt with an acid.
      <br/>
      It is obtained by precipitation of the reaction medium in acidic medium.
