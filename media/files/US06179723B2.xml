    <p num="1">This application is related to U.S. Design Patent No. 368,949 issued Apr. 6, 1996, and claims the benefit U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/043,543, filed Apr. 14, 1997, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Golf is a sport of skill and technique in which small changes to one's swing can make large differences in the effectiveness of the swing.
      <br/>
      An important part of the golf swing is its timing and tempo.
      <br/>
      Metronomes have been used to help the golfer time his or her swing to help create a smoother swing.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      A golf club-like golf swing training aid includes a metronome at the end of a golf club shaft.

      FIG. 1 is an overall view of a golf swing training aid made according to the invention;
      <br/>
      FIG. 1A is a cross-sectional view taken along line 1A--1A of FIG. 2;
      <br/>
      FIG. 1B is a partial cross-sectional view showing the opposed brush and mat of FIG. 1;
      <br/>
      FIGS. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are various views of one embodiment of the training aid of FIG. 1; and
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 is an overall view similar to FIG. 1 but also showing a center-of-swing indicator.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="5">
      FIG. 1 shows a golfer 2 using a golf swing training aid 4 mounted the end of a club shaft 6 by a mounting tube 8.
      <br/>
      The training aid 4 includes a generally U-shaped body 10 having the club shaft 6 mounted to and extending upwardly from one end through the mounting tube 8 and an electronic metronome 12 connected to the other end.
      <br/>
      The base 14 of the body 10 has a lower surface 16 with a tee slot 18, see FIG. 1A, to which a brush 20 having downwardly extending bristles 22 can be removably mounted.
      <br/>
      This permits the brush to be easily replaced when worn out or when a different type, length or stiffness of bristles are desired.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 1 and in FIG. 7, the training aid 4 is used in conjunction with a mat 24, typically of the same material as the brush; see FIG. 1B. One such material which can be used is sold by Monsanto for use as doormats and in the teeing areas at driving ranges.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In use, the mat 24 is placed in an area where there is enough room for a full swing.
      <br/>
      The metronome 12 is set to a desired tempo.
      <br/>
      The metronome 12 is preferably of a conventional type which can have the frequency of the beeps per minute adjusted to the desired rate, such as with buttons 25; see FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      While swing tempo for different people will be different, a beginning swing tempo of 50 beeps per minute is often appropriate.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The training aid 4, which acts as a golf club head, is placed at about the center of the mat 24.
      <br/>
      The mat 24 may have a center-of-swing indicator 26 as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      The golfer assumes a proper and comfortable stance and hand grip on the club shaft 6.
      <br/>
      With the metronome 12 continuously beating, the golfer 2 begins taking short swings no higher than the knees, so that the bristles 22 will brush the mat 24 at the exact same time as the metronome beeps.
      <br/>
      This is done in a continuous pendulum type motion back and forth.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Once the golfer 2 feels comfortable with the short swing matching the tempo of the metronome 12, the golfer 2 extends the swing to hip (half swing) level.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, a full swing motion can be used.
      <br/>
      The golfer 2 will notice that to continue the set tempo of the metronome 12, the golfer 2 will need to increase the club head speed as the arc length increases.
      <br/>
      If the golfer 2 has difficulty keeping in time with the tempo of the metronome 12, the metronome 12 should be set at a slower tempo.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      If the golfer 2 is at a correct tempo, the brushing sound of the club head should effectively muffle the beep of the metronome.
      <br/>
      The golfer 2 thus obtains both a visual and a tactile feedback of a proper swing action to train and condition physical memory reaction.
      <br/>
      Doing so should create a physical memory to aid in the proper swing in playing golf.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      It is believed that the use of the metronome 12 mounted to the body 10 of the training aid 4 provides advantages over a metronome 12 mounted elsewhere.
      <br/>
      The sound emanates from the same position as the club head so that the audio and visual concentration is directed to the same position.
      <br/>
      Also, using bristles 22 has an additional advantage over the use, for example, a rubber or other flexible tee to indicate the striking of the ball.
      <br/>
      Rather than getting just a spike type of sound feedback, as occurs when a solid tee is struck, the engagement of the bristles 22 provides more of a continuously varying sound spectrum.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      As an alternative to mounting the metronome 12 to the body of the training aid 4, the metronome 12 could be positioned in alignment with the tee area of the mat, that is where a tee would be placed if a golf ball were being struck with a regular club head.
      <br/>
      In some situations it may be desirable to mount the metronome 12 to the club shaft 6.
      <br/>
      Also, the training aid 4 could be used as is to actually strike a ball for putting practice.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Modification and variation can be made to the preferred embodiment without departing from the subject of the invention as defined by the following claims.
      <br/>
      For example, the metronome 12 preferably emits a beep or other periodic sound.
      <br/>
      It could also produce a visual indication, such as a flash of light, instead of or in addition to the periodic sound.
      <br/>
      In appropriate cases the bristles or bristle-like material could be carried by the mat in addition to or instead of by the training aid 4.
