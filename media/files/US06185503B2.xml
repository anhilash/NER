      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a navigation system that is capable of reporting traffic control information and traffic jam information transmitted from the outside of the vehicle to the driver by voice.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Navigation systems that display traffic information sent through an FM multiplex broadcast wave, a light beacon or a radio wave beacon on a display screen using graphics or text are known.
      <br/>
      Also known are navigation systems which, by setting a route from the current vehicle position to a destination, provide course guidance along the course at guide points such as intersections.
      <br/>
      In such navigation systems, if there is, for instance, a location where lane traffic control is being implemented, an access ramp is closed or the traffic is jammed on the route that has been set, it is desirable to report that information promptly by voice to the driver.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">It is an object of the present invention to provide a navigation system that reports on traffic control points and traffic jam locations on a route by voice.</p>
    <p num="7">
      A navigation system according to the present invention comprises a means for route setting that sets a route to a destination, a position detection device that detects a current position, a reception device that receives traffic information from outside and a reporting device that, when the traffic information received by the reception device indicates that there are a plurality of locations which may constitute a hindrance to traveling on the route that has been set, calculates the distances from the current position detected by the detection device to the locations that may constitute a hindrance and then issues a voice report on the nearest one.
      <br/>
      A location that may constitute a hindrance refers to a location where the traffic is jammed or a traffic control point.
      <br/>
      The length of the traffic jam may be reported in addition to the distance to the traffic jam location.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      When there are a plurality of traffic jam locations or traffic control points, a voice report may be issued on all of them.
      <br/>
      Only traffic jam locations or traffic control points that are within a specific distance from the current position may be reported.
      <br/>
      When the reception device has received information on a traffic jam location for the first time, it is desirable to report on the distance to the traffic jam location regardless of the distance from the current position to the traffic jam location.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In addition, a navigation system according to the present invention comprises a means for route setting that sets a route to a destination, a position detection device that detects a current position, a reception device that receives traffic information from outside, a reporting device that, when the traffic information received by the reception device indicates that there is a traffic jam location on the route that has been set, calculates the distance from the current position detected by the detection device to the traffic jam location and issues a voice report, a means for prohibition that prohibits operation of the reporting device after the reporting device issues a report on the traffic jam location once until a specific change from the state that has been reported occurs.
      <br/>
      The specific change in this context refers to an instance of the distance from the current position to the tail end of the traffic jam location has been equal to or greater than a first specific value in a previous report becoming reduced to less than the first specific value.
      <br/>
      However, even when the distance to the tail end of a traffic jam location is reduced to less than the first specific value, it is desirable to prohibit another report on a traffic jam location if the difference between the previously reported distance to a traffic jam location and the newly received distance to a traffic jam location is smaller than a second specific value.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In the navigation system according to the present invention, a means for distance calculation that calculates the traveling distance starting from a point at which the reporting device reports a traffic jam location may be further provided to prohibit operation of the reporting device until the traveling distance thus calculated is equal to or greater than a specific value.
      <br/>
      In addition, in the navigation system according to the present invention, a means for time calculation that calculates the length of time elapsing from a point at which the reporting device reports a traffic jam location may be further provided to prohibit operation of the reporting device until the length of time elapsing thus calculated is equal to or greater than a specific length of time.
    </p>
    <p num="11">A navigation system according to the present invention further comprises a means for route setting that sets a route to a destination, a position detection device that detects a current position, a reception device that receives traffic information from outside and a reporting device that, when the traffic information received by the reception device indicates that a traffic control point and a traffic jam location are present on the route that has been set, does not issue a voice report on a traffic jam location that is situated beyond the traffic control point, but calculates the distance from the current position to a traffic jam location preceding the traffic control point and issues a voice report.</p>
    <p num="12">A navigation system according to the present invention further comprises a means for route setting that sets a route to a destination, a position detection device that detects a current position, a reception device that receives traffic information from outside and a reporting device that, when the traffic information received by the reception device indicates that a traffic control point and a traffic jam location are present on the route that has been set, calculates the distance from the current position detected by the detection device to the traffic control point and the distance from the current position to the traffic jam location and issues successive voice reports.</p>
    <p num="13">A navigation system according to the present invention further comprises a means for route setting that sets a route to a destination, a position detection device that detects a current position, a reception device that receives traffic information from outside and a reporting device that, when the traffic information received by the reception device indicates that there is a traffic jam location on the route that has been set, if the current position detected by the detection device is within the traffic jam location, calculates the distance from the current position to the front end of the traffic jam location and issues a voice report.</p>
    <p num="14">A navigation system according to the present invention further comprises a means for route setting that sets a route to a destination and course guidance to be provided at guide points, a position detection device that detects a current position, a reception device that receives traffic information from outside, an operating member that is operated in order to implement voice course guidance and a reporting device that issues the course guidance when the operating member is operated and following the course guidance thus issued, if the traffic information received by the reception device indicates that there is a traffic jam location on the route that has been set, calculates the distance from the current position detected by the detection device to the traffic jam location and issues a voice report.</p>
    <p num="15">A navigation system according to the present invention further comprises a means for route setting that sets a route to a destination, a position detection device that detects a current position, a reception device that receives traffic information from outside and a reporting device that, when the traffic information received by the reception device indicates that there is a traffic jam location on the route that has been set, calculates the distance from the current position detected by the detection device to the traffic jam location and issues a voice report, and once a voice report on a first traffic jam location has been issued, if a second traffic jam location occurs at a point preceding the first traffic jam location distanced by a specific distance or more from the tail end of the first traffic jam location, issues a voice report on the distance from the current position to the second traffic jam location.</p>
    <p num="16">According to the present invention, since, when a traffic jam location or a traffic control point is present on a recommended route, the information on the traffic jam location or the traffic control point, which is constituted of text and graphic data (the information on distance from the current position, for instance) is output by voice, the driver can ascertain the traffic jam location or the traffic control point on the recommended route without having to look at the display screen.</p>
    <p num="17">In addition, according to the present invention, an advantage is achieved in that a traffic jam location is reported to the driver well before the vehicle comes upon it, allowing ample time for the driver to deliberate upon whether or not it is preferable to make a detour and to choose a detour route well in advance.</p>

      <br/>
      In the RAM, data for planar road map drawing data, image data for display at a display 5a and various types of data tables for displaying and outputting by voice received traffic information are stored.
      <br/>
      The data for map drawing are created based upon 2-dimensional road map data that are read out from the CD ROM 2b and the image data are created from data for planar map drawing and graphic data representing various types of traffic information.
      <br/>
      The image data are read out as necessary and displayed on the display 5a.
      <br/>
      In addition, the data tables are created based upon received traffic information.
      <br/>
      Reference number 4a indicates an input device provided with various switches and reference number 4b indicates a signal processing circuit that processes switch signals from the input switches 4a.
      <br/>
      The input device 4a is provided with a voice request switch and other various switches.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that the display 5a is connected to and controlled by a display circuit 5b and that various types of touch panel switches are arranged on the display screen of the display 5a.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Reference number 6 indicates an FM multiplex receiver that receives traffic information through FM multiplex broadcast waves (hereafter referred to as VICS information).
      <br/>
      The VICS information explained in this specification includes traffic jam information and traffic control information.
      <br/>
      The traffic jam information is classified into four types, i.e., jammed (traffic jam data classification 3), congested (2), no jam or congestion with traffic flowing smoothly (traffic jam data classification 1) and unknown (traffic jam data classification 0), and these traffic states, i.e., jammed, congested, and flowing smoothly are respectively displayed in red, yellow and green with a road divided into lanes going in both directions.
      <br/>
      The traffic control information includes road block information (traffic control data classification 1), ramp closure information on access ramps of a highway (traffic control data classification 2) and no traffic control (traffic control data classification 0).
      <br/>
      It may include lane traffic control information as well.
      <br/>
      Such VICS information is constituted of the distance from link start points to the tail end of a traffic jam, the distance from the link start point to the front end of the traffic jam, the traffic jam data classification, the distance from the link start point to a traffic control point, the traffic control data classification and the like in correspondence to mesh numbers and link numbers that constitute a road map data.
    </p>
    <p num="22">Reference number 7a indicates a speaker for issuing a voice report of the distance to the traffic jam location and the distance to the traffic control point, whereas reference number 7b indicates a voice synthesizing circuit and an amplifier.</p>
    <p num="23">
      FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate the road map data.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, a road R1 intersects two roads R2 and R3.
      <br/>
      The intersection of the road R1 and the road R2 is referred to as a node N1 and the intersection of the road R1 and the road R3 is referred to as a node N2, with the section having the nodes N1 and N2 as its start point and end point respectively referred to as a link 1.
      <br/>
      Interpolation points A1-A3 are provided between the node N1 and the node N2.
      <br/>
      The nodes N1 and N2 and the interpolation points A1-A3 respectively are provided with coordinate position data (X2, Y2)-(X6, Y6), distance data on the distances between the individual points, link length data and the like.
      <br/>
      A road map is divided into a plurality of areas and each divided area is defined by an inherent mesh number.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the road R1 inside a divided map area defined by a specific mesh number (533946, for instance) is constituted of 100 links, the road R1 is defined as shown in FIG. 3, by link numbers 1-100, the number of points of nodes and interpolation points constituting each link and the X, Y coordinates of each point.
      <br/>
      In other words, FIG. 3 shows a road data table for one mesh.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that link numbers and node numbers are assigned in each mesh area from 1-a specific number.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 4 shows a recommended route RR having a start point and an end point set within the same mesh indicated by bold lines with both traffic jam locations and traffic control points as received by the FM multiplex receiver 6.
      <br/>
      The figure shows a situation in which the recommended route RR is set in the order of link numbers 9, 10, 106, 105, 3 and 4 with traffic jam locations present at link numbers 10 and 3, a congested location present at link number 105 and a smooth traffic flow location present at link number 4.
      <br/>
      It also shows that there is a road block at link number 3.
      <br/>
      There are traffic jam locations and traffic control points at links that are not on the recommended route.
      <br/>
      The individual tables, which are to be explained below, are prepared based upon this illustrated example.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      FIGS. 11-19 are flowcharts illustrating various types of processing performed by the computer 3, and the operation of this embodiment is explained in reference to these flowcharts.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that the computer 3 executes the program illustrated by the flowcharts in FIGS. 11-19 when the key is operated to the ignition ON position.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      FIG. 11 is a flowchart of the processing in which a recommended route is set in conformance to an input destination.
      <br/>
      In step S1, the recommended route from the current position to the destination is calculated and set.
      <br/>
      The destination is set by the operator via the input device 4 and the recommended route is set automatically through calculations employing a method in the known art such as the Dykstra method.
      <br/>
      In this processing, the position detected by the current position detection device can be used as the current position.
      <br/>
      Or, with candidates for a recommended route stored in memory in advance in a ROM or the like, one of these may be selected as a recommended route.
      <br/>
      In step S2, data of the recommended route are stored in a specific area of the RAM in the computer 3 and a recommended route data table is created.
      <br/>
      In step S3, data on course guidance at guide points on the recommended route are stored in RAM at the computer 3 and a guide point table is created.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      FIG. 5 shows an example of a recommended route data table.
      <br/>
      The recommended route data table is basically constituted with mesh numbers and link numbers stored sequentially, starting from the current position toward the destination.
      <br/>
      For instance, in FIG. 5, the recommended route is indicated by link number 9, link number 10, link number 106 . . . link number 4 within one mesh area.
      <br/>
      In correspondence to the individual link numbers, data on the distance from the link start point to the tail end of a traffic jam location, data on the distance from the link start point to the front end of a traffic jam location, the traffic jam data classification, the distance from the start point to the traffic control point and the traffic control data classification are stored.

      FIG. 6 shows an example of a guide point table.
      <br/>
      The guide point table is constituted of data on the distance from start point of the recommended route to guide points and data on directions for providing course guidance at each guide point.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      FIG. 12 is a flowchart illustrating the traffic information reception processing.
      <br/>
      First, the traffic information data received by the FM multiplex broadcast receiver 6 are explained.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 shows an example of the traffic jam information provision table, and in correspondence to the individual link numbers combined with a mesh number, the distance from link start points to the tail end of the traffic jam location, the distance from a link start point to the front end of the traffic jam location and the traffic jam data classification are stored.
      <br/>
      In addition, the number of sets of data is also stored.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      FIG. 8 shows an example of the traffic control information provision table, and in correspondence to the individual link numbers in combination with a mesh number, the distance from link start points to the traffic control point and the traffic control data classification are stored.

      In addition, the number of sets of data is also stored.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In reference to FIG. 12, if it is decided in step S11, that a recommended route has been set, the operation proceeds to step S12, in which a decision is made as to whether or not the traffic information that has been received includes traffic jam information.

      If an affirmative decision is made in step S12, the traffic jam information is stored in the recommended route data table in step S13.
      <br/>
      Step S13 is to be explained later in further detail in reference to FIG. 13. In step S14, a decision is made as to whether or not the received traffic information includes traffic control information.

      If an affirmative decision is made in step S14, the traffic control information is stored in the recommended route data table in step S15.
      <br/>
      Step S15 is to be explained later in further detail in reference to FIG. 14. It is to be noted that if a recommended route has not been set, a negative decision is made in step S11, whereas if no traffic jam information is present, a negative decision is made in step S12 and if no traffic control information is present, a negative decision is made in step S15.

      The difference from the processing shown in FIGS. 17A and 17B are that the decision making performed in steps S367-370 for preventing voice output that may be irritating is omitted.
      <br/>
      In other words, voice output is performed in conformance to the decisions made in regard to the voice output conditions performed in steps S361-366, whereas if the conditions are not satisfied, no voice output is performed.

      In that regard, the invention may be performed by a general purpose computer or processor programmed to perform the described functions.
      <br/>
      Of course, the invention may be performed using a combination of the programmed processor and custom hardware components.
      <br/>
      The programs for performing the system functions are storable on a computer readable medium.
