      The amino acids are abbreviated in accordance with customary nomenclature (e.g., Schroder, Lubke, The Peptides, Volume I, New York 1965, pages XXII-XXIII; Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie (Methods of Organic Chemistry), Volume XV/1 and 2, Stuttgart 1974).
      <br/>
      The amino acid D-Asp is the D-form of aspartic acid.

      The term amino acid-protective groups is to be understood to mean suitable groups which protect the functional groups of the side chains of the amino acid radicals (see, e.g., T. W. Greene, P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Ed., John Wiley and Sons, New York 1991).
      <br/>
      Often utilized amino acid-protective groups are, for example, t-butyloxy-carbonyl (BOC), 9-fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl (Fmoc), benzyloxy-carbonyl (Z), 2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)prop-2-yloxycarbonyl (Ddz), methyl, t-butyl, trityl and S-t-butyl, and t-butylamino-carbonyl.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The present invention furthermore relates to processes for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) which proceed according to the following reaction equations (equations 1 to 4):</p>
    <p num="17">Process A  (Chemical Structure image '9' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="18">
      Compounds of type IV are obtained by reacting o-, m- or p-substituted imines of type 11 with ketone III.
      <br/>
      The reaction can be carried out, e.g., by mixing the two compounds in bulk without a solvent and then heating, or with a suitable solvent, such as ethanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF), toluene, diglyme or tetradecane, at temperatures of from 20 (degree)  C. to 150 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The keto compounds of type IV are reduced to hydroxy compounds of type V with NaBH4 or another suitable reducing agent in a suitable solvent, e.g., methanol, THF or THF/water, at temperatures between -30 (degree)  C. and +40 (degree)  C. Two isomer mixtures (racemates) are usually obtained as the main product in the reduction.
      <br/>
      The various racemates can be separated from one another by fractional crystallization or silica gel chromatography.
      <br/>
      The nitro group in compounds of type V can be reduced by known processes, e.g., catalytic hydrogenation with Pd or Pd-on-charcoal and H2 in methanol.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The racemic compounds of type VI thus obtained can be separated further into their enantiomers.
      <br/>
      The racemate splitting of VI into enantiomers of type VII can be carried out by chromatography over chiral column material or by processes known from the literature using optically active auxiliary reagents (J.
      <br/>
      Org. Chem. 44, 1979, 4891).  (Chemical Structure image '10' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In accordance with equation 2, the aromatic amines of type VI or VII (as a racemate or as a pure enantiomer) can be reacted with an amino acid by known standard peptide coupling processes to give derivatives VIII.
      <br/>
      A suitable process is coupling with TOTU and triethylamine in DMF.
      <br/>
      Literature examples are illustrated in, e.g., G. Breipohl, W. Konig EP 0460446, W. Konig, G. Breipohl, P. Pokorny, and M. Birkner, in E. Giralt and D. Andreu (Eds.) Peptides 1990, Escom, Leiden, 1991, 143-145.
      <br/>
      The radicals AA1 and AA2 have the meanings given according to formula (I).
      <br/>
      The amino function of the amino acid is provided with a protective group such as Fmoc, and the carboxylic acid is unprotected.
    </p>
    <p num="22">In amino acids with side chain functional groups, the functional groups are protected accordingly, either temporarily during the synthesis, or throughout the synthesis of the compounds according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="23">
      To arrive at derivative VIII, the protective group of the amino function is split off.
      <br/>
      In the case of Fmoc, this is accomplished in a mixture of DMF and piperidine.
      <br/>
      Dipeptide conjugates IX are obtained if, starting from compounds of type VIII, the reaction sequence (a) coupling of an amino acid and (b) deprotection is repeated.  (Chemical Structure image '11' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Bile acid derivatives of type X can be prepared from 3-amino-bile acid esters by linking with alkyl- or aryidicarboxylic acids or derivatives thereof, such as succinic anhydride, by known processes, see EP 0614908 and EP 0489423.
      <br/>
      The compounds X are reacted with amino compounds of type VI, VII, VIII or IX by standard peptide coupling processes.
      <br/>
      After the coupling reaction, the compounds of type XI are obtained by hydrolysis of the alkyl ester function of the bile acid moiety.  (Chemical Structure image '12' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The amino compounds of type VI, VII, VIII or IX can be reached with the carboxylic acid function of bile acids.
      <br/>
      Known peptide coupling processes are likewise used here, for example, coupling in the presence of TOTU and triethylamine, or with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, hydroxybenzotriazole and triethylamine in THF.
      <br/>
      The compounds of type XII can be obtained by this process.

    <p num="26">
      Because of their higher solubility in water compared with the starting or base compounds, pharmaceutically tolerated salts are particularly suitable for medical applications.
      <br/>
      These salts must have a pharmaceutically tolerated anion or cation.
      <br/>
      Suitable pharmaceutically tolerated acid addition salts of the compounds within the scope of the present invention include salts of inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric, sulfonic, and sulfuric acid, and of organic acids, such as acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glycolic, isothionic, lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, succinic, p-toluenesulfonic, tartaric, and trifluoroacetic acid.
      <br/>
      The chlorine salt is particularly useful for medical purposes.
      <br/>
      Suitable pharmaceutically tolerated basic salts are ammonium salts, alkali metal salts, e.g., sodium and potassium salts, and alkaline earth metal salts, e.g., magnesium and calcium salts.
    </p>
    <p num="27">Salts with a non-pharmaceutically tolerated anion are also included in the scope of the present invention as beneficial intermediate products for the preparation or purification of pharmaceutically tolerated salts and/or for use in non-therapeutic applications such as in vitro applications.</p>
    <p num="28">The term "physiologically functional derivative" designates any physiologically tolerated derivative of a compound of formula (I) according to the present invention, for example, an ester, which, on administration to a mammal, such as, for example, humans, is capable of forming (directly or indirectly) a compound of formula (I) or an active metabolite thereof.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Physiologically functional derivatives also include prodrugs of the compounds according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to a compound according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      These prodrugs may or may not be active themselves.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The compounds according to the invention can also be in various polymorphous forms, e.g., in amorphous and crystalline polymorphous forms.
      <br/>
      All the polymorphous forms of the compounds according to the present invention are included in the scope of the present invention and are a further aspect of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="31">All references to "compound(s) according to formula (I)" in the following relate to compound(s) of the formula (I) as described above, and to their salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives as described herein.</p>
    <p num="32">
      The amount of a compound according to formula (I) which is necessary to achieve the desired biological effect depends on a number of factors, such as the specific compounds chosen, the intended use, the mode of administration and the clinical condition of the patient.
      <br/>
      In general, the daily dose is in the range from 0.3 mg to 100 mg, typically from 3 mg to 50 mg, per day per kilogram of body weight, e.g., 3-10 mg/kg/day.
      <br/>
      An intravenous dose can be in the range from 0.3 mg to 1.0 mg/kg, which can suitably be administered as an infusion of 10 ng to 100 ng per kilogram per minute.
      <br/>
      Suitable infusion solutions for this purpose can comprise from 0.1 ng to 10 mg, typically from 1 ng to 10 mg per milliliter.
      <br/>
      Individual doses can comprise from 1 mg to 10 g of the active compound.
      <br/>
      Ampoules for injections can thus contain from 1 mg to 100 mg, and individual dose formulations for oral administration, such as tablets or capsules, can contain from 1.0 to 1000 mg, typically from 10 to 600 mg.
      <br/>
      In the case of pharmaceutically tolerated salts, the above weight data relate to the weight of the benzothiazepine ion derived from the salt.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      For prophylaxis or treatment of the above conditions, a compound according to formula (I) can be used directly, but is normally utilized in the form of a pharmaceutical composition with a tolerated excipient.
      <br/>
      The excipient must, of course, be tolerated in the sense that it is compatible with the other constituents of the composition and is not harmful to the health of the patient.

      Biological testing of the compounds of the present invention was carried out by determining the inhibition of �3 H�-taurocholate uptake in brush border membrane vesicles of the ileum of rabbits.
      <br/>
      The inhibition test was carried out as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="46">

      Preparation of brush border membrane vesicles from the ileum of rabbits
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Preparation of brush border membrane vesicles from the intestinal cells of the small intestine was carried out by the so-called Mg2+ precipitation method.
      <br/>
      Male New Zealand rabbits (2 to 2.5 kg of body weight) were sacrificed by intravenous injection of 0.5 ml of T61.RTM., an aqueous solution of 2.5 mg of tetracaine HCl, 100 mg of embutramide and 25 mg of mebezonium iodide.
      <br/>
      The small intestine was removed and rinsed with ice-cold physiological saline solution.
      <br/>
      The terminal 7/10 of the small intestine (measured in the oral-rectal direction, i.e., the terminal ileum, which contains the active Na+ -dependent bile acid transportation system) was used for preparation of the brush border membrane vesicles.
      <br/>
      The intestines were frozen at -80 (degree)  C. in plastic bags under nitrogen.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      For preparation of the membrane vesicles, the frozen intestines were thawed at 30 (degree)  C. in a water-bath.
      <br/>
      The mucosa was scraped off and suspended in 60 ml of ice-cold 12 mM TRIS/HCl buffer (pH 7.1)/300 mM mannitol, 5 mM EGTA/10 mg/l of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/1 mg/l of trypsin inhibitor from soybeans (32 U/mg)/0.5 mg/l of trypsin inhibitor from the bovine lung (193 U/mg)/5 mg/l of bacitracin.
      <br/>
      After dilution to 300 ml with ice-cold distilled water, the mixture was homogenized with an Ultraturrax (18-rod, IKA Werk Staufen, Germany) at 75% of the maximum for 3 minutes, while cooling with ice.
      <br/>
      After addition of 3 ml of 1 M MgCl2 solution (final concentration 10 mM), the mixture was left to stand at 0 (degree)  C. for exactly 1 minute.
      <br/>
      By addition of Mg2+, the cell membranes aggregated, and precipitated with the exception of the brush border membranes.
      <br/>
      After centrifugation at 3000 *  g (5000 rpm, SS-34 rotor) for 15 minutes, the precipitate was discarded and the supernatant, which contained the brush border membrane, was centrifuged at 48,000 *  g (20,000 rpm, SS-34 rotor) for 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      The supernatant was discarded and the precipitate was rehomogenized in 60 ml of 12 mM TRIS/HCl buffer (pH 7.1)/60 mM mannitol, 5 mM EGTA with a Potter Elvejhem homogenizer (Braun, Melsungen, 900 rpm, 10 strokes).
      <br/>
      After addition of 0.1 ml of 1 M MgCl2 solution and an incubation time of 15 minutes at 0 (degree)  C., the mixture was centrifuged again at 3000 *  g for 15 minutes.
      <br/>
      The supernatant was then centrifuged again at 48,000 *  g (20,000 rpm, SS-34 rotor) for 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      The precipitate was taken up in 30 ml of 10 mM TRIS/HEPES buffer (pH 7.4)/300 mM mannitol and resuspended homogeneously by 20 strokes in a Potter Elvejhem homogenizer at 1000 rpm.
      <br/>
      After centrifugation at 48,000 *  g (20,000 rpm, SS-34 rotor) for 30 minutes, the precipitate was taken up in 0.5 to 2 ml of TRIS/HEPES buffer (pH 7.4)/280 mM mannitol (final concentration 20 mg/ml) and resuspended with the aid of a tuberculin syringe with a 27-gauge needle.
      <br/>
      The vesicles were either used directly for transportation studies after the preparation or stored at -196 (degree)  C. in 4 mg portions in liquid nitrogen.
    </p>
    <p num="49">2. Inhibition of the Na+ -dependent �3 H�taurocholate uptake in brush border membrane vesicles of the ileum</p>
    <p num="50">
      The uptake of substrates in the brush border membrane vesicles described above was determined by means of the so-called membrane filtration technique. 10  MU l of the vesicle suspension (100  MU g of protein) were pipetted as drops onto the wall of a polystyrene incubation tube (11 * 70 mm), which contained the incubation medium with the corresponding ligands (90  MU l).
      <br/>
      The incubation medium comprised 0.75  MU l=0.75  MU Ci �3 H(G)�-taurocholate (specific activity: 2.1 Ci/mmol)/0.5  MU l of 10 mM taurocholate/8.75  MU l of sodium transportation buffer (10 mM TRIS/HEPES (pH 7.4)/100 mM mannitol/100 mM NaCl) (Na-T-B) or 8.75  MU l of potassium transportation buffer (10 mM TRIS/HEPES (pH 7.4)/100 mM mannitol/100 mM KCl) (K-T-B) and 80  MU l of the inhibitor solution in question, dissolved in Na-T buffer or K-T buffer, depending on the experiment.
      <br/>
      The incubation medium was filtered through a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane filter (SYHV LO 4NS, 0.45  MU m, 4 mm .O slashed., Millipore, Eschborn, Germany).
      <br/>
      The transportation measurement was started by mixing the vesicles with the incubation medium.
      <br/>
      The concentration of taurocholate in the incubation batch was 50  MU M. After the desired incubation time (usually 1 minute), the transportation was stopped by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold stopping solution (10 mM TRIS/HEPES (pH 7.4)/150 mM KCl).
      <br/>
      The mixture formed was immediately filtered off with suction under a vacuum of from 25 to 35 mbar over a membrane filter of cellulose nitrate (ME 25, 0.45  MU m, 25 mm diameter, Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Dassell, Germany).
      <br/>
      The filter was rinsed with 5 ml of ice-cold stopping solution.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      To measure the uptake of the radioactively labeled taurocholate, the membrane filter was dissolved with 4 ml of the scintillator Quickszint 361 (Zinsser Analytik GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany) and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation measurement in a TriCarb 2500 measuring apparatus (Canberra Packard GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany).
      <br/>
      The values measured were obtained as dpm (decompositions per minute) after calibration of the apparatus with the aid of standard samples and after correction of any chemiluminescence present.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The control values in each case were determined in Na-T-B and K-T-B.
      <br/>
      The difference between the uptake in Na-T-B and K-T-B gave the Na+ -dependent transportation content.
      <br/>
      The concentration of inhibitor at which the Na+ -dependent transportation content was inhibited by 50%, compared to the control value, was designated the IC50 Na+.

    <p num="53">
      The pharmacological data comprise a test series in which the interaction of the compounds according to the invention with the intestinal bile acid transportation system in the terminal small intestine was investigated.
