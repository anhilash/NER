    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to elastomer surfaces and a process for providing an elastomer surface, and in preferred embodiments, a fluoroelastomer, hydrofluoroelastomer or VITON.RTM. hydrofluoroelastomer surface, on a supporting substrate.
      <br/>
      The resulting surfaces are useful as surfaces for components in electrostatographic processes, especially xerographic processes, including digital, image on image and contact electrostatic printing applications.
      <br/>
      The elastomer surfaces are useful as coatings for fuser members including donor members, pressure members, fuser or fixing members, toner transfer members, and like members.
      <br/>
      In embodiments, the present invention allows for a decrease in the number of steps normally necessary for preparing a coated fuser member, which decreases the unit manufacturing cost and decreases the time necessary for preparation of the fuser member.
      <br/>
      In general, with the present process, instead of coating an adhesive on a fuser member followed by coating a fluoroelastomer topcoat thereon, an adhesive or primer is mixed with the fluoroelastomer material and the adhesive/fluoroelastomer mixture is coated on the fuser member.
      <br/>
      The resulting elastomer coating has increased adhesion to the fuser member, resulting in a decrease in delamination of the elastomer layer, which in turn, results in longer fuser life.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      In a typical electrostatographic reproducing apparatus, a light image of an original to be copied is recorded in the form of an electrostatic latent image upon a photosensitive member and the latent image is subsequently rendered visible by the application of electroscopic thermoplastic resin particles which are commonly referred to as toner.
      <br/>
      The visible toner image is then in a loose powdered form and can be easily disturbed or destroyed.
      <br/>
      The toner image is usually fixed or fused upon a support which may be the photosensitive member itself or other support sheet such as plain paper.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      To fuse electroscopic toner material onto a support surface permanently by heat, it is usually necessary to elevate the temperature of the toner material to a point at which the constituents of the toner material coalesce and become tacky.
      <br/>
      This heating causes the toner to flow to some extent into the fibers or pores of the support member.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, as the toner material cools, solidification of the toner material causes the toner material to be firmly bonded to the support.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Typically, the thermoplastic resin particles are fused to the substrate by heating to a temperature of between about 90 (degree)  C. to about 200 (degree)  C. or higher depending upon the softening range of the particular resin used in the toner.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Several approaches to thermal fusing of electroscopic toner images have been described.
      <br/>
      These methods include providing the application of heat and pressure substantially concurrently by various means, a roll pair maintained in pressure contact, a belt member in pressure contact with a roll, and the like.
      <br/>
      Heat may be applied by heating one or both of the rolls, plate members or belt members.
      <br/>
      The fusing of the toner particles takes place when the proper combination of heat, pressure and contact time is provided.
      <br/>
      The balancing of these parameters to bring about the fusing of the toner particles is well known in the art, and can be adjusted to suit particular machines or process conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It is important in the fusing process that no offset of the toner particles from the support to the fuser member takes place during normal operations.
      <br/>
      Toner particles offset onto the fuser member may subsequently transfer to other parts of the machine or onto the support in subsequent copying cycles, thus increasing the ba background or interfering with the material being copied there.
      <br/>
      The referred to "hot offset" occurs when the temperature of the toner is increased to a point where the toner particles liquefy and a splitting of the molten toner takes place during the fusing operation with a portion remaining on the fuser member.
      <br/>
      The hot offset temperature or degradation of the hot offset temperature is a measure of the release property of the fuser roll, and accordingly it is desired to provide a fusing surface which has a low surface energy to provide the necessary release.
      <br/>
      To ensure and maintain good release properties of the fuser roll, it has become customary to apply release agents to the fuser roll during the fusing operation.
      <br/>
      Typically, these materials are applied as thin films of, for example, silicone oils to prevent toner offset.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Particularly preferred fusing systems are comprised of a heated cylindrical fuser roll having a fusing surface which is backed by a cylindrical pressure roll forming a fusing nip therebetween.
      <br/>
      A release agent donor roll is also provided to deliver release agent to the fuser roll.
      <br/>
      While the physical and performance characteristics of each of these rolls, and particularly of their functional surfaces are not precisely the same depending on the various characteristics of the fusing system desired, the same classes of materials are typically used for one or more of the rolls in a fusing system in an electrostatographic printing system.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="25">
      Referring to FIG. 1, in a typical electrostatographic reproducing apparatus, a light image of an original to be copied is recorded in the form of an electrostatic latent image upon a photosensitive member and the latent image is subsequently rendered visible by the application of electroscopic thermoplastic resin particles which are commonly referred to as toner.
      <br/>
      Specifically, photoreceptor 10 is charged on its surface by means of a charger 12 to which a voltage has been supplied from power supply 11.
      <br/>
      The photoreceptor is then imagewise exposed to light from an optical system or an image input apparatus 13, such as a laser and light emitting diode, to form an electrostatic latent image thereon.
      <br/>
      Generally, the electrostatic latent image is developed by bringing a developer mixture from developer station 14 into contact therewith.
      <br/>
      Development can be effected by use of a magnetic brush, powder cloud, or other known development process.
      <br/>
      A dry developer mixture usually comprises carrier granules having toner particles adhering triboelectrically thereto.
      <br/>
      Toner particles are attracted from the carrier granules to the latent image forming a toner powder image thereon.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a liquid developer material may be employed, which includes a liquid carrier having toner particles dispersed therein.
      <br/>
      The liquid developer material is advanced into contact with the electrostatic latent image and the toner particles are deposited thereon in image configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      After the toner particles have been deposited on the photoconductive surface, in image configuration, they are transferred to a copy sheet 16 by transfer means 15, which can be pressure transfer or electrostatic transfer.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the developed image can be transferred to an intermediate transfer member and subsequently transferred to a copy sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      After the transfer of the developed image is completed, copy sheet 16 advances to fusing station 19, depicted in FIG. 1 as fuser roll 20 and pressure roll 21, wherein the developed image is fused to copy sheet 16 by passing copy sheet 16 between the fusing and pressure members, thereby forming a permanent image.
      <br/>
      Photoreceptor 10, subsequent to transfer, advances to cleaning station 17, wherein any toner left on photoreceptor 10 is cleaned therefrom.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      FIG. 2 represents a preferred embodiment of the invention and includes a substrate 1 which may be a belt, film, sheet, roller, or like substrate member, and may comprise a plastic, metal, fabric or the like.

      <br/>
      Examples of heat absorbent coatings suitable for use herein include graphite commercially available coatings.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Optionally provided on the substrate is an intermediate layer 3.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the layer comprises a silicone rubber material, and preferably a high temperature silicone rubber.

      In one embodiment, a silicone rubber layer is applied to the substrate with primer, and is cured for up to 15 minutes and at 120 (degree)  to 180 (degree)  C. to provide a complete cure without a significant post cure operation.
      <br/>
      This curing operation should be substantially complete to prevent debonding of the silicone elastomer from the core when it is removed from the mold.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the surface of the silicone elastomer is sanded to remove the mold release agent and it is wiped clean with a solvent such as isopropyl alcohol to remove all debris, or cleaned using compressed or ionized air such as that provided by an "air knife" system.
      <br/>
      The intermediate layer can also be prepared from fluoroelastomers like VITON GF.RTM., wherein a typical composition is prepared, for example, by adding 30 parts per 100 parts of VITON GF.RTM. carbon black like REGAL N991.RTM., followed by rubber milling in a Banbury Mixer and thereafter, injection molded onto a metal core.

      The present invention greatly reduces the cost and time associated with providing an elastomer surface on a supporting substrate.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the present invention dispenses with the additional timing associated with coating the primer or adhesive layers prior to coating the elastomer layers thereto.
      <br/>
      In addition, the base coat and topcoat layers have increased adhesion which ensures a longer functional life of the fuser member.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the preferred embodiment wherein the topcoat elastomer layer is carbon free, provides improved release properties of the fuser member and higher level of gloss to the final copy or print quality.

      The following Table 2 contains the peel strength data for two additional rolls.
      <br/>
      Roll 3 is a roll manufactured by UV treating the roller, coating the roller with an adhesive (Toray Dow Corning DY9-051), coating the adhesive with a fluoroelastomer basecoat (Daikin Industries F969), followed by coating with a fluoroelastomer topcoat (Daikin Industries F960).
      <br/>
      Roll 4 is a roll which underwent UV treatment prior to coating with an adhesive/basecoat composition in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      The adhesive/basecoat composition was prepared by mixing from about 58 to about 60 weight percent methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) solvent, from about 25 to about 27 weight percent fluoroelastomer compound (Dyneon FE 5840Q supplied by Avon Technical Products Ltd. as AA969), from about 16 to about 18 weight percent DC6060 adhesive (supplied by Dow Corning).
      <br/>
      The topcoat was prepared by mixing from about 72 to about 76 weight percent MiBK solvent with from about 24 to about 28 weight percent fluoroelastomer compound (Dyneon FE 5830Q supplied by Avon Technical Products Ltd. as AA960).
      <br/>
      Both basecoat and topcoat layers were coated on the roller to a thickness of from about 12 to about 18 mm.
