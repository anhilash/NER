    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention is in the area of improved photopolymerizable compositions that can be processed to produce a relief image (e.g., an imaged photoresist pattern or an imaged proofing or flexographic printing plate pattern) having improved sidewall geometry and development latitude.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Photopolymerizable compositions are used to form a photoresist (or resist) layer on a substrate, such as copper-clad glass epoxy, to allow subsequent selective processing of the substrate, such as selective etching or electroplating.
      <br/>
      Photopolymerizable compositions are also used to form a permanent solder mask layer on an imaged substrate to protect the underlying circuit lines from solder exposure during the later step of soldering in printed circuit board (PCB) manufacture.
      <br/>
      The use of photoresists and solder masks for manufacture of printed circuit boards (PCBs) is described in Photoresist--Materials and Processes, by William S. DeForest, McGraw-Hill, 1975, in Printed Circuits Handbook, edited by Clyde F. Coombs, Jr., McGraw-Hill, 1988 (3rd Edition), and in Handbook of Printed Circuit Manufacturing by Raymond H. Clark, Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1985.
      <br/>
      Photopolymerizable resist materials are known, for example, from U.S. Pat. No. 3,469,982 which describes a film resist with a sandwich structure in the form of a photopolymerizable layer between a cover sheet and a temporary support.
      <br/>
      Photoresist and solder mask products that have substantially all of the solvent for coating removed are known as dry films.
      <br/>
      The use of photopolymerizable proofing films for off-press proofing in the printing industry is described in Principles of Color Proofing, by Michael H. Bruno, GAMA Communications (Salem, N.H.), 1986. The use of flexographic photopolymer films for use in production of flexographic printing plates is described in Flexography--Principles and Practices, Fourth Edition, Foundation of Flexographic Technical Association, (Ronkonkoma, N.Y.), 1992.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      As the technology level of printed circuit boards increases towards finer lines/spaces, the demands placed on the photoresist materials used to produce such boards becomes greater.
      <br/>
      This in turn places a greater burden on the resist formulator to accommodate improved performance, without a decrease in production level or an increase in manufacturing cost of the photoresist product.
      <br/>
      Similiar considerations apply for use of photopolymerizable compositions in proofing and flexographic printing.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      For use in the manufacture of printed circuit boards (PCBs) having fine lines/spaces, it is critical that the photoresist used possess properties such that, upon imaging, the exposed and developed photoresist affords resist patterns having good sidewall geometry (i.e., sidewalls are smooth, planar and form an angle of 90 (degree)  with respect to the substrate surface, and are free of imperfections such as mousebites, gouges, foot(s), etc.).
      <br/>
      Photoresists that afford good sidewall geometry will perform better in printed circuit board manufacture than otherwise comparable photoresists that do not afford good sidewall geometry.
      <br/>
      Photoresists that do afford good sidewall geometry normally exhibit higher resolution, are useful in production of finer line/space PCBs, and give fewer defects and higher yields in printed circuit board manufacture than do otherwise comparable photoresists that do not afford good sidewall geometry.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Photopolymerizable compositions somewhat related to those of this invention are disclosed in 1) Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. HEI 7�1995�-333846 and in 2) Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. HEI 4�1992�-153275.
      <br/>
      The former (-1) discloses photopolymerizable compositions containing a binder system containing two polymeric binder components and does not include any compositions with a single binder component.
      <br/>
      The latter (-2) discloses electrodeposition compositions that are made dispersible in aqueous media by neutralization or partial neutralization of the acid functionality of the binder with a basic compound.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      While compositions containing two or more binder components, such as those disclosed in Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. HEI 7�1995�-333846, can be useful as photoresists for some applications, they often do have limitations associated with their use, particularly in high resolution applications required to make state of the art PCBs having fine lines and spaces.
      <br/>
      Particularly, when the two or more binders differ substantially in their properties, such as molecular weight, acid number, etc., then the two or more binders are not fully compatible with each other or the others, and the binders in this event can and often do partially or substantially separate into separate phase domains when the binders are present in the photopolymerizable compositions(s).
      <br/>
      When such phase separation does occur, it can result in development defects, such as for example, certain domains being more easily washed out during development processing and resulting in an imaged resist having defective sidewalls where there are gouges or mousebites present in the resist sidewall.
      <br/>
      Such imperfections are highly detrimental toward achieving fine lines/spaces in PCB manufacture with resists having such multiple binders.
    </p>
    <p num="8">There is a continuing need for effective photopolymerizable compostitions having inherent propensities for affording imaged resists having good sidewall geometry and low defect levels, particularly for applications involving generation of imaged photopolymer patterns (e.g., imaged resists) having fine lines/spaces.</p>

    <p num="45">
      Any of the support films known for use as such for a photoresist coating can be used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      The temporary support film, which preferably has a high degree of dimensional stability to temperature changes, may be chosen from a wide variety of polyamides, polyolefins, polyesters, vinyl polymers, and cellulose esters, and may have a thickness of from about 6 to 200 microns.

      In conventional photoresist elements it is necessary or at least highly desirable to protect the photosensitive layer by a removable cover film (cover sheet) in order to prevent blocking when it is stored in a roll form.

      The protective cover film is removed prior to lamination of the photoimagable element to a substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The protective cover film may be selected from the same group of high polymer films described for the temporary support film, supra, and may have the same wide range of thicknesses; however, it is preferable to use a cover sheet that has lower adhesion to the photopolymer (e.g., resist) layer relative to the adhesion of the photopolymer to the support (e.g., polyester layer).

    <p num="55">Photoresist Element Application</p>
    <p num="56">
      In a preferred embodiment, the process of the invention is an imaging process to make resist images on a copper clad substrate to enable subsequent processing steps in the fabrication of printed circuits to occur, such as etching or plating, or a permanent coating to make solder resistant images on a printed circuit board.
      <br/>
      The type of printed circuit manufactured can be single sided, double sided or of multiple layers.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      For the primary imaging process, the photopolymerizable resist coating layer is applied as a liquid or a preformed dry film from a multi-ply, transfer element using a lamination process similar to that described in Celeste, U.S. Pat. No. 3,469,982. The multi-ply, photoresist coating element comprises, in order, a temporary support film, e.g., polyethylene teraphthalate, a photoimageable resist coating, and preferably a removable cover sheet, e.g., polyethylene or polypropylene.
      <br/>
      The photopolymerizable coating layers of this invention are present in range of total thickness from 10 to 100 microns (0.4 to 4 mils) when used over copper clad substrates.
      <br/>
      If the cover sheet is present, it is first removed and the uncovered surface of the resist coating is laminated to the pre-cleaned copper clad surface of the substrate using heat and/or pressure, e.g., with a conventional hot-roll laminator.
      <br/>
      Although the laminate is typically imagewise exposed to actinic radiation through the temporary support film, in some instances, the support film may be removed before imaging to improve resolution and other such properties.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The applied photoimageable resist is then imagewise exposed to actinic radiation to harden or insolubilize exposed areas.
      <br/>
      Any unexposed areas are then completely removed typically with an aqueous 0.85% sodium carbonate developer solution at 30 (degree)  C. which selectively dissolves, strips or otherwise disperses the unexposed areas within two minutes without adversely affecting the integrity or adhesion of the exposed areas.
      <br/>
      The developed resist image on the substrate is then exposed to further processing steps in the fabrication of the circuit, such as electrolytic acid copper plating or a copper etching process.
      <br/>
      Once the exposed photoresist has performed its function, the resist is then removed from the circuit board generally by an aqueous hydroxide based stripping solution, which may contain organic amines or solvents to improve strip speed or to minimize metal attack or staining.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Development rate of a photoresist is dependent upon the thickness of the photoresist.
      <br/>
      Thinner resists have faster development rates.
      <br/>
      Suitable acid comonomer(s) levels of binder(s) in thinner resists for good development characteristics are lower than are the levels in thicker resists that are otherwise comparable.
      <br/>
      As one non-limiting illustrative example, a resist having a thickness of 0.75 mil or less can have an acid comonomer(s) level from about 10% to about 25%, while a corresponding resist having a thickness of 1-1.2 mils can have an acid comonomer(s) level from about 15% to about 30%.

    <heading>DEFINITIONS</heading>
    <p num="60">Good Sidewall Geometry</p>
    <p num="61">A good sidewall of an exposed and developed photoresist is one which by visual inspection (a) exhibits substantially no imperfections, i.e. gouges, pits, or mousebites on the wall of the resist or the surface of the resist, (b) exhibits substantially no attack or swelling by the developer solution, especially at the upper edge of the resist and on the walls of the image, (c) has a planar sidewall that lies in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the substrate surface, (d) has substantially no undercutting of the resist at the substrate surface (negative foot), (e) has substantially no growth, especially irregularly, of the base of the resist into areas intended to be free of resist (positive foot), and (f) exhibits these features over a wide range of exposure and development conditions.</p>
    <p num="62">Poor Sidewall Geometry</p>
    <p num="63">Sidewalls which exhibit one or more defects described above.</p>
    <p num="64">Time-to-Clean</p>
    <p num="65">The time, in seconds, required for the developer solution to fully wash away, dissolve or disperse unexposed photoresist from the surface of the copper laminate.</p>
    <p num="66">Breakpoint</p>
    <p num="67">
      The percentage of distance into a conveyorized spray developer where the unexposed photoresist washes away, dissolves or disperses from the surface of the copper laminate.
      <br/>
      For example, a 25% breakpoint is one where the unexposed resist is removed 25% of the way through the developer chamber.
      <br/>
      The imaged areas of the photoresist are in the developer chamber for 4x the time-to-clean.
      <br/>
      A 75% breakpoint is 75% of the way into the developer chamber.
      <br/>
      The imaged areas of the photoresist are in the developer only 1.5x the time-to-clean.
    </p>
    <p num="68">Development Latitude</p>
    <p num="69">
      The ability of a resist to reproduce good sidewalls under a variety of exposure and development conditions, including low exposure energy/low percent breakpoint.
      <br/>
      A resist having good and poor development latitudes will have relatively high and relatively low abilities respectively to reproduce good sidewalls under a variety of exposure and development conditions.

      A given sample for SEM analysis was obtained from 100 micron line/space pairs on developed panels.
    </p>
    <p num="94">SEM used was a model SR5OA SEM unit made by ISI ABT (now known as Topcon), Paramus, N.J.</p>
    <p num="95">Micrographs were obtained for each sample at 500 *  magnification.</p>
    <p num="96">Micrographs were rated visually for quality of the imaged photoresist sidewall geometry using the semiquantitative SEM rating scale given below.</p>
    <p num="97">
      SEM Rating Scale
      <br/>
      Three sections of resist sidewall were rated--top edge of resist, middle of resist (sidewall), base of resist (at resist/copper interface on a given panel).
    </p>
    <p num="98">Rating scale +2 (best) to -2 (worst) for each section of resist; all are based on visual observations of the micrographs.</p>
    <p num="99">Top edge of resist</p>
    <p num="100">
      +2 means no swelling of the line edge.
      <br/>
      -2 means very heavy swelling with a pronounced nose.
      <br/>
      In the worst case, the nose is very wavy with a serrated appearance.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      Middle of resist
      <br/>
      +2 means smooth sidewall with no visible attack or swelling.
      <br/>
      -2 means heavy attack with appearance of gouges or mousebites (i.e. resist portions missing) in the resist.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      Base of resist
      <br/>
      +2 means no gouges or mousebites with little or no positive or negative foot.
      <br/>
      -2 means pronounced positive foot or negative foot with the appearance of mousebites and gouges.
    </p>
    <p num="103">The larger the positive rating, the better the quality of the imaged resist and the higher the propensity for the imaged resist to afford well formed, defect free lines/spaces in PCB manufacture.</p>
    <p num="104">
      Ideally for the best case, a resist should have a perfectly planar sidewall that lies in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the substrate surface (copper laminate).
      <br/>
      This is the +2 case.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      Sum R=numerical sum of the 3 individual ratings for top, middle, and bottom of the resist sidewall.
      <br/>
      These values are given in the tables of the examples.
      <br/>
      The estimated error in "Sum R" value is  &lt;= 0.9 at 99% confidence level.
