      A color filter manufacturing method colors each of many filter elements partitioned off by many frames formed on a transparent substrate by discharging an ink colored in a predetermined color into each of the frames.
      <br/>
      In coloring each of the filter elements, a discharging start position of an ink discharged into the frame partitioning off each of the filter elements is changed to color the filter element while changing an amount by which the ink overlaps the frame.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for manufacturing a color filter by forming and arranging a large number of colored filter elements on a transparent substrate, the color filter, a display apparatus, an apparatus having the display apparatus, and a method of equalizing the colored states of areas.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      With recent advances in personal computers, especially portable personal computers, the demand tends to arise for liquid crystal displays, especially color liquid crystal displays.
      <br/>
      However, in order to further popularize the use of liquid crystal displays, a reduction in cost must be achieved.
      <br/>
      Especially, it is required to reduce the cost of a color filter which occupies a large proportion of the total cost.
      <br/>
      Various methods have been tried to satisfy the required characteristics of color filters while meeting the above requirements.
      <br/>
      However, any method capable of satisfying all the requirements has not been established.
      <br/>
      The respective methods will be described below.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The first method is a dyeing method, which is the most popular method.
      <br/>
      In the dyeing method, a water-soluble polymer material as a dyeable material is coated on a glass substrate, and the coating is patterned into a desired shape by a photolithography process.
      <br/>
      The obtained pattern is dipped in a dye bath to obtain a colored pattern.
      <br/>
      This process is repeated three times to form R, G, and B color filter layers.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The second method is a pigment dispersion method, which is currently replacing the dyeing method.
      <br/>
      In this method, a pigment-dispersed photosensitive resin layer is formed on a substrate and patterned into a single-color pattern.
      <br/>
      This process is repeated three times to obtain R, G, and B color filter layers.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The third method is an electrodeposition method.
      <br/>
      In this method, a transparent electrode is patterned on a substrate, and the resultant structure is dipped in an electrodeposition coating fluid containing a pigment, a resin, an electrolyte, and the like to be colored in the first color by electrodeposition.
      <br/>
      This process is repeated three times to form R, G, and B color filter layers.
      <br/>
      Finally, these layers are calcined.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The fourth method is a print method.
      <br/>
      In this method, a pigment is dispersed in a thermosetting resin, a print operation is performed three times to form R, G, and B coatings separately, and the resins are thermoset, thereby forming colored layers.
      <br/>
      In either of the above methods, a protective layer is generally formed on the colored layers.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The point common to these methods is that the same process must be repeated three times to obtain layers colored in three colors, i.e., R, G, and B. This causes an increase in cost.
      <br/>
      In addition, as the number of processes increases, the yield decreases.
      <br/>
      In the electrodeposition method, limitations are imposed on pattern shapes which can be formed.
      <br/>
      For this reason, with the existing techniques, this method cannot be applied to TFTs.
      <br/>
      In the print method, a pattern with a fine pitch cannot be formed because of poor resolution and poor evenness.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In order to eliminate these drawbacks, methods of manufacturing color filters by an ink-jet system are disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 59-75205, 63-235901, and 1-217320.
      <br/>
      In these methods, coloring solutions containing coloring agents of three colors, i.e., R (red), G (green), and B (blue), are sprayed on a transparent substrate by an ink-jet system, and the respective coloring solutions are dried to form colored image portions.
      <br/>
      In such an ink-jet system, R, G, and B filter elements (pixels) can be formed at once, allowing great simplification of the manufacturing process and a great reduction in cost.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In the above conventional manufacturing methods based on the ink-jet system, however, it is difficult to discharge a required amount of ink for one filter element (one pixel) at once and uniformly spread the ink on the entire surface of each opening portion of a black matrix for partitioning off each filter element.
      <br/>
      In addition, each discharged ink dot has an almost circular shape, and a plurality of ink dots must be discharged onto each rectangular opening portion of the black matrix.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is difficult to uniformly spread the ink on the entire surface of each opening portion of the black matrix by using a method of uniformly discharging an ink.
      <br/>
      Color omissions occur sometimes at peripheral portions of an opening portion.
      <br/>
      A color omission is a serious defect for a color filter, and causes a great deterioration in image quality.
      <br/>
      If a considerably larger dot is formed on an opening portion of a black matrix in order to prevent such an inconvenience, the dot may mix with a dot of another color in an adjacent opening portion.
      <br/>
      In order to solve this problem, various proposals associated an improvement in the properties of inks and reception layers have been made.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The experiment conducted by the present applicant shows that the behavior of inks after impact greatly varies depending on the characteristics of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) inks and the like.
      <br/>
      That is, only with an improvement in the properties of inks and reception layers, it is difficult to manufacture a color filter without color irregularity by using an ink-jet system.
      <br/>
      As described above, an ink discharging method and discharging amount are important factors in manufacturing a color filter.

      The filter elements 10a of the respective colors are formed on the light-shielding grating 10b.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      In manufacturing the color filter 10, chromium is deposited on the glass substrate 12 by sputtering, and the resultant film is formed into a matrix pattern by photolithography.
      <br/>
      This pattern is the light-shielding grating 10b.
      <br/>
      A layer 14 to be dyed is formed on the light-shielding grating 10b.
      <br/>
      The layer 14 consists of a cellulose, an acrylic resin, gelatin, or the like and absorbs a fluid.
      <br/>
      Droplets (to be referred to as an ink hereinafter) containing a coloring material (dye) are sprayed on the filter element formation regions of the layer 14 by a recording head of the ink-jet system.
      <br/>
      With this process, the layer 14 is colored to form the color filter elements 10a.
      <br/>
      Note that a pigment or ultraviolet-curing ink may be used instead of a dye.
      <br/>
      When a pigment or ultraviolet-curing ink is to be used, the layer 14 may not be required.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      A protective layer is formed, as needed.
      <br/>
      As the protective layer, for example, a layer consisting of a resin material of a photo-setting, thermosetting, or photo-setting/thermosetting type, or an inorganic film formed by vapor deposition, sputtering, or the like can be used.
      <br/>
      Such a layer can be used as long as it exhibits transparency upon formation of a color filter and can withstand the subsequent processes, e.g., an ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) formation process and an aligning film formation process.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      In general, a color liquid crystal panel is formed by joining the color filter substrate 12 to a counter substrate 54 and sealing a liquid crystal compound 52 therebetween.
      <br/>
      TFTs (Thin Film Transistors) (not shown) and transparent pixel electrodes 53 are formed on the inner surface of one substrate 54 of the liquid crystal panel in a matrix form.
      <br/>
      The color filter 10 is placed on the inner surface of the other substrate 12 such that the R, G, and B coloring materials are positioned to oppose the pixel electrodes.
      <br/>
      A transparent counter electrode (common electrode) 50 is formed on the entire surface of the color filter 10.
      <br/>
      The light-shielding grating 10b is generally formed on the color filter substrate 12 side (see FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      However, in a BM (Black Matrix) on-array type liquid crystal panel, such a grating is formed on the TFT substrate side opposing the color filter substrate (see FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Aligning films 51 are formed within the planes of the two substrates.
      <br/>
      By performing a rubbing process for the aligning films 51, the liquid crystal molecules can be aligned in a predetermined direction.
      <br/>
      Polarizing plates 55 are bonded to the outer surface of the respective glass substrates.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal compound 52 is filled in the gap (about 2 to 5  MU m) between these glass substrates.
      <br/>
      As a blacklight, a combination of a fluorescent lamp (not shown) and a scattering plate (not shown) is generally used.
      <br/>
      A display operation is performed by causing the liquid crystal compound to serve as an optical shutter for changing the transmittance for light emitted from the backlight.

    <p num="128">FIG. 8 shows the structure of an ink-jet head IJH for spraying ink on the layer 14 in the color filter described above.</p>
    <p num="129">
      Referring to FIG. 8, the ink-jet head IJH mainly comprises a heater board 104 as a board on which a plurality of heaters 102 for heating an ink are formed, and a ceiling plate 106 mounted on the heater board 104.
      <br/>
      A plurality of discharging openings 108 are formed in the ceiling plate 106.
      <br/>
      Tunnel-like fluid passages 110 communicating with the discharging openings 108 are formed therebehind.
      <br/>
      The respective fluid passages 110 are isolated from the adjacent fluid passages via partition walls 112.
      <br/>
      The respective fluid passages 110 are commonly connected to one ink chamber 114 at the rear side of the fluid passages.
      <br/>
      An ink is supplied to the ink chamber 114 via an ink inlet 116.
      <br/>
      This ink is supplied from the ink chamber 114 to each fluid passage 110.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      The heater board 104 and the ceiling plate 106 are positioned such that the position of each heater 10 coincides with that of a corresponding fluid passage 110, and are assembled into the state shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      Although FIG. 8 shows only two heaters 102, the heater 102 is arranged in correspondence with each fluid passage 110.
      <br/>
      When a predetermined driving signal is supplied to the heater 102 in the assembled state shown in FIG. 8, an ink above the heater 102 is boiled to produce a bubble, and the ink is pushed and discharged from the discharging opening 108 upon volume expansion of the ink.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the size of a bubble can be adjusted by controlling a driving pulse applied to the heater 102, e.g., controlling the magnitude of power.
      <br/>
      That is, the volume of the ink discharged from each discharging opening can be arbitrarily controlled.
    </p>
    <p num="131">FIG. 9 is a timing chart for explaining a method of controlling the amount of ink discharged by changing power supplied to each heater in this manner.</p>
    <p num="132">
      In this embodiment, two types of constant-voltage pulses are applied to each heater 102 to adjust the amount of ink discharged.
      <br/>
      The two pulses are a preheat pulse and a main heat pulse (to be simply referred to as a heat pulse hereinafter).
      <br/>
      The preheat pulse is a pulse for heating an ink to a predetermined temperature before the ink is actually discharged.
      <br/>
      The pulse width of this pulse is set to be smaller than a minimum pulse width t5 required to discharge the ink.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the ink is not discharged by this preheat pulse.
      <br/>
      The preheat pulse is applied to each heater 102 to increase the initial temperature of the ink to a predetermined temperature in advance so as to always make the amount of ink discharged constant when a constant heat pulse is applied to the heater 102 afterward.
      <br/>
      In contrast to this, the temperature of the ink may be adjusted in advance by adjusting the width of a preheat pulse.
      <br/>
      In this case, for the same heat pulse, the amount of ink discharged can be changed.
      <br/>
      In addition, by heating ink before application of a heat pulse, the start time required to discharge the ink upon application of the heat pulse can be shortened to improve the responsibility.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      The heat pulse is a pulse for actually discharging the ink.
      <br/>
      The pulse width of the heat pulse is set to be larger than the minimum pulse width t5 required to discharge the ink.
      <br/>
      Energy generated by each heater 102 is proportional to the width (application time) of a heat pulse.
      <br/>
      Therefore, variations in the characteristics of the heaters 102 can be adjusted by adjusting the width of each heat pulse.
    </p>
    <p num="134">Note that the amount of ink discharged can also be adjusted by adjusting the interval between a preheat pulse and a heat pulse to control the dispersed state of heat upon application of the preheat pulse.</p>
    <p num="135">
      As is apparent from the above description, the amount of ink discharged can be controlled both by adjusting the application time of a preheat pulse and by adjusting the interval between application of a preheat pulse and that of a heat pulse.
      <br/>
      Therefore, by adjusting the application time of a preheat pulse or the interval between application of a preheat pulse and that of a heat pulse as needed, the amount of ink discharged or the responsibility of discharging of the ink with respect to an applied pulse can be arbitrarily adjusted.
    </p>
    <p num="136">Such adjustment of the amount of ink discharged will be described in detail next.</p>
    <p num="137">
      Assume that an ink is discharged in different amounts from discharging openings (nozzles) 108a, 108b, and 108c upon application of the same voltage pulse, as shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      More specifically, assume that when a voltage having a predetermined pulse width is applied at a predetermined temperature, the amount of ink discharged from the nozzle 108a is 36 pl (pico-liters); the amount of ink discharged from the nozzle 108b, 40 pl; and the amount of ink discharged from the nozzle 108c, 40 pl, and the resistance of heaters 102a and 102b corresponding to the nozzles 108a and 108b is 200  OMEGA , and the resistance of a heater 102c corresponding to the nozzle 108c is 210  OMEGA .
      <br/>
      Assume that the amounts of ink discharged from the nozzles 108a, 108b, and 108c are to be adjusted to 40 pl.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      The widths of a preheat pulse and a heat pulse may be adjusted to adjust the amounts of ink discharged from the nozzles 108a, 108b, and 108c to the same amount.
      <br/>
      Various combinations of the widths of preheat pulses and heat pulses are conceivable.
      <br/>
      In this case, the amounts of energy generated by heat pulses are made equal for the three nozzles, and the amounts of ink discharged are adjusted by adjusting the widths of preheat pulses.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      Since the heaters 102a and 102b for the nozzles 108a and 108b have the same resistance, i.e., 200  OMEGA , the amounts of energy generated by heat pulses can be made equal by applying voltage pulses having the same width to the heaters 102a and 102b.
      <br/>
      In this case, the width of each voltage pulse is set to be t3 which is larger than the width t5.
      <br/>
      An ink is discharged in different amounts, i.e., 36 pl and 40 pl, from the nozzles 108a and 108b upon application of identical heat pulses.
      <br/>
      In order to increase the amount of ink discharged from the nozzle 108a, a preheat pulse having a width t2 larger than a width t1 of a preheat pulse applied to the heater 102b is applied to the heater 102a.
      <br/>
      With this operation, the amounts of ink discharged from the heaters 108a and 108b can be adjusted to 40 pl.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      The heater 102c for the nozzle 108c has a resistance of 210  OMEGA , which is higher than the resistance of the two remaining heaters 102a and 102b.
      <br/>
      For this reason, in order to cause the heater 102c to generate the same amount of energy as that generated by the two remaining heaters, the width of a heat pulse must be set to be larger than that of the above heat pulse.
      <br/>
      In this case, therefore, the width of the heat pulse is set to be t4 which is larger than the width t3.
      <br/>
      Since the amounts of ink discharged from the nozzles 108b and 108c upon application of a predetermined pulse are the same, the width of a preheat pulse required is equal to that of a preheat pulse applied to the heater 102b.
      <br/>
      That is, a preheat pulse having the width t1 is applied to the heater 102c.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      In the above manner, the same amount of ink can be discharged from the nozzles 108a, 108b, and 108c which discharge an ink in different amounts upon application of a predetermined pulse.
      <br/>
      In addition, the amounts of ink discharged may be intentionally made to differ from each other.
      <br/>
      Note that preheat pulses are used to reduce variations in the discharging operation of each nozzle.
    </p>
    <p num="142">Another method of controlling the amount of ink discharged from each nozzle will be described next.</p>
    <p num="143">FIG. 22 shows a structure in which two or more heaters are disposed for one nozzle, and the amount of ink discharged is continuously changed by continuously shifting the phases of voltage pulses applied to the respective heaters.</p>
    <p num="144">
      FIG. 22 shows the arrangement of heaters and electrodes per nozzle.
      <br/>
      An ink-jet head can be formed by using this pattern instead of the heaters 102 in FIG. 8.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      This arrangement includes electrodes 202, 203a, and 203b for independently supplying power to each of two heaters 201a and 201b per nozzle.
      <br/>
      FIG. 23 is a schematic sectional view showing a state in which a bubble is produced by applying voltage pulses to the heaters 201a and 201b of the ink-jet head having the heater/electrode pattern in FIG. 22 while shifting the phases of the pulses.
      <br/>
      The heaters 201a and 201b produce bubbles upon evaporation of an ink at different timings.
      <br/>
      For this reason, when these bubbles are observed at a certain timing, bubbles of different sizes are seen, as shown in FIG. 23.
    </p>
    <p num="146">Note that the electrodes 202 and 203 are not shown in FIG. 23.</p>
    <p num="147">
      Referring to FIG. 23, a passage 209 to be filled with an ink is formed by using a heater board 212 and a ceiling plate 213.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the heater board 212 is obtained by forming a heat-storage layer 205 on a substrate 204 made of a glass material or the like, and mounting heaters and electrodes on the heat-storage layer 205 according to the pattern shown in FIG. 22. A groove having a predetermined width is formed in the ceiling plate 213 to define the passage 209.
      <br/>
      The heater board 212 is joined to the ceiling plate 213 such that the groove covers the heaters and the electrodes.
      <br/>
      A nozzle 207 is formed at an end of the passage 209.
      <br/>
      A heat application portion  DELTA 1 is a passage portion including a heat generating surface of a heater 201.
      <br/>
      The heater 201 generates heat at the heat application portion  DELTA 1 in accordance with an input voltage pulse to cause an abrupt change in the state of the ink at the heat application portion  DELTA 1, i.e., evaporation of the ink, so as to produce a bubble.
      <br/>
      As a result, an ink 208 is discharged from the nozzle 207.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 24A to 24D schematically show the relationship between the timings of voltage pulses input to the heaters 201a and 201b, the volume of a bubble, and the amount of ink discharged.

    <p num="159">
      In this embodiment, an ink is discharged from the orifices of the ink-jet head IJH by the ink-jet system, and the filter elements 10a of the color filter 10 are colored with ink dots.
      <br/>
      As the ink-jet system, a system based on heat energy or a system based on mechanical energy may be used.
      <br/>
      Either of the systems will do.
      <br/>
      An ink to be used is not specifically limited as long as it can be used for an ink-jet operation.
      <br/>
      As coloring agents for the ink, agents suitable for the transmission spectra required for R, G, and B filter elements are properly selected from various dyes and pigments.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      Ink dots may be directly formed on the glass substrate 12 having the light-shielding grating 10b and the transparent portions (the portions enclosed with the light-shielding grating 10b, i.e., the filter elements).
      <br/>
      However, as described above, the transparent layer 14 to be dyed is preferably formed on the glass substrate 12.
      <br/>
      As a material for the layer 14, acrylic resin, epoxy resin, imido resin, or a cellulose derivative such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose is preferably used.
      <br/>
      As a method of forming the layer 14, spin coating, roller coating, bar coating, spraying, dipping, or the like can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="161">Although the thickness of the layer 14 to be dyed differs depending on the type and composition of an ink to be used for pattern formation, the amount of ink discharged, a method of using the ink, and the like, the thickness is preferably about 0.1 to 50  MU m.</p>
    <p num="162">
      A problem posed in this case is that the characteristics of coloring agents for R, G, and B inks greatly vary depending on the characteristics of the layer 14 to be dyed, the shape of the light-shielding grating 10b (see FIG. 20), the maximum process temperature in the manufacturing process, manufacturers, and the type of a substrate.
      <br/>
      As described above, in the ink-jet system, the discharging positions and the amounts of inks discharged greatly influence white omission and color mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="163">The operation of this embodiment which is to be performed to solve the above problem will be sequentially described with reference to FIGS. 12 to 19. Referring to FIGS. 12 to 19, each white circle indicates the state of an ink several seconds after the impact of the ink.</p>
    <p num="164">
      When a plurality of ink dots are discharged at equal intervals as shown in FIG. 12, large white omissions appear at peripheral portions as shown in FIG. 13. In addition, the succeeding ink dots are attracted/absorbed by the preceding ink dots, resulting in the shape shown in FIG. 13. When ink dots are discharged in the shape shown in FIG. 14 in such a manner that the intervals between dots B and C, and dots C and D in FIG. 12 are increased, and the intervals between dots D and E, and dots E and F are decreased, the ink pattern expands in the shape shown in FIG. 15. If the amount of ink discharged is increased at the dot C as shown in FIG. 16, the ink pattern expands in the shape shown in FIG. 17. Although the shape in FIG. 17 is better, white omissions appear at the corner portions.
      <br/>
      When the discharging start position of the dot A is slightly shifted, and a dot b is added after the dot B, the ink pattern expands in a considerably good shape, and a color filter having no white omission can be formed, as shown in FIG. 19.
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      As is apparent, the above phenomenon is just an example, and various phenomena may occur depending on the shape of the light-shielding grating 10b, the properties of inks, and the properties of the layer 14 to be dyed.
      <br/>
      If, for example, light-shielding gratings like those shown in FIGS. 20A to 20C are used, color filters can be properly colored by using discharging patterns like those shown in FIGS. 21A to 21C.
      <br/>
      These ink discharging patterns are controlled by the discharging control unit 40 in FIG. 11.
    </p>
    <p num="166">In the above embodiment, an ink is discharged onto each filter element by using one of the patterns shown in FIGS. 12 to 21C. However, the present invention can be applied to cases wherein a plurality of filter elements arranged in the scanning direction of the ink-jet head are continuously colored, as shown in FIGS. 27 and 28.</p>
    <p num="167">
      In the cases in FIGS. 27 and 28, an ink is also continuously discharged onto light-shielding grating portions serving as partitions for the respective filter elements in the scanning direction of the ink-jet head to continuously color the filter elements as one line from the start to the end of one scanning operation.
      <br/>
      Even if one row of filter elements extending in the scanning direction is continuously colored in this manner, since a user of a liquid crystal display apparatus or the like sees the color filters from the reverse side to the colored surfaces, the respective filter elements of the color filter look reliably partitioned off by the light-shielding grating.
      <br/>
      That is, no problem is posed in practice.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      When a row of filter elements in the scanning direction is to be continuously colored as shown in FIG. 27, this row is considered as one filter element.
      <br/>
      In this case, similar to the pattern in FIG. 18, ink dots are discharged such that some ink dots overlap the light-shielding grating 10b at the early stage of a scanning operation, and ink dots are densely sprayed at the last stage of the scanning operation.
      <br/>
      With this operation, white omissions at the early and last stages of the scanning operation can be prevented.
      <br/>
      If each filter element has a protruding portion 10f as shown in FIG. 28, the amount of ink discharged is increased at this portion to form a large ink dot like the one indicated by the hatching in FIG. 28. With this operation, a white omission as indicated by the portion 10f in FIG. 29 can be prevented, and hence a high-quality color filter can be manufactured.
      <br/>
      In this case as well, if the intervals between ink dots are decreased at the last stage of the scanning operation, a white omission at the last stage of the scanning operation can be prevented at the same time.
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      In practice, a manufacturing line for color filters must cope with various types of-color filters with various sizes and types of substrates.
      <br/>
      In this case, manufacturing lines may be arranged for every type of color filters, and manufacturing processes may be set by using fixed discharging methods.
      <br/>
      However, such a manufacturing method is not practical.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      In manufacturing various types of high-performance color filters, various stages on a manufacturing line are inevitably replaced.
      <br/>
      In this case, various types of color filters are difficult to manufacture by a manufacturing method without the discharging control unit 40 for setting discharging conditions as in this embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="171">
      As described above, by using the color filter manufacturing method and apparatus of this embodiment, optimal ink dot discharging methods for the shapes of various light-shielding plates, the properties of inks, and the properties of layers to be dyed can be set.
      <br/>
      This allows the manufacture of an inexpensive, reliable color filter capable of obtaining a clear image without color irregularity.
    </p>
    <p num="172">In addition, a flexible manufacturing line for manufacturing plurality of types of color filters can be easily set.</p>
    <p num="173">Various changes and modifications of the above embodiments can be made without departing the scope and spirit of the invention.</p>
    <p num="174">
      For example, as the ink-jet head, a so-called piezoelectric type head using mechanical energy converters such as piezoelectric elements may be used.
      <br/>
      In this case, the volume of the ink discharged can be easily adjusted by adjusting the applied voltage of a driving pulse.
      <br/>
      When a bipolar driving operation is to be performed, the ink volume can be adjusted by adjusting both or either of bipolar driving pulses.
    </p>
    <p num="175">The present invention can be applied to a single-color filter and a filter of a type having a plurality of single-color filters of different colors stacked on each other.</p>
    <p num="176">
      According to the above description, the present invention is applied to the print apparatus of the system, among various ink-jet recording systems, which has a means (e.g., an electricity-to-heat converter or laser light) for generating heat energy as energy used to discharge an ink, and changes the state of an ink by using the heat energy.
      <br/>
      According to this system, a high-density, high-resolution recording operation can be realized.
    </p>
    <p num="177">
      As for the typical structure and principle, it is preferable that the basic structure disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,723,129 or 4,740,796 is employed.
      <br/>
      The aforesaid method can be adapted to both a so-called on-demand type apparatus and a continuous type apparatus.
      <br/>
      In particular, a satisfactory effect can be obtained when the on-demand type apparatus is employed because of the structure arranged in such a manner that one or more drive signals, which rapidly raise the temperature of an electricity-to-heat converter disposed to face a sheet or a fluid passage which holds the fluid (ink) to a level higher than levels at which film boiling takes place are applied to the electricity-to-heat converter in accordance with recording information so as to generate heat energy in the electricity-to-heat converter and to cause the heat effecting surface of the recording head to take place film boiling so that bubbles can be formed in the fluid (ink) to correspond to the one or more drive signals.
      <br/>
      The enlargement/contraction of the bubble will cause the fluid (ink) to be discharged through a discharging opening so that one or more droplets are formed.
      <br/>
      If a pulse shape drive signal is employed, the bubble can be enlarged/contracted immediately and properly, causing a further preferred effect to be obtained because the fluid (ink) can be discharged while revealing excellent responsibility.
    </p>
    <p num="178">
      It is preferable that a pulse drive signal disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,463,359 or 4,345,262 is employed.
      <br/>
      If conditions disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,313,124 which is an invention relating to the temperature rising ratio at the heat effecting surface are employed, a satisfactory recording result can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="179">
      As an alternative to the structure (linear fluid passage or perpendicular fluid passage) of the recording head disclosed in each of the aforesaid inventions and having an arrangement that discharge ports, fluid passages and electricity-to-heat converters are combined, a structure having an arrangement that the heat effecting surface is disposed in a bent region and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,558,333 or 4,459,600 may be employed.
      <br/>
      In addition, the following structures may be employed: a structure having an arrangement that a common slit is formed to serve as a discharge section of a plurality of electricity-to-heat converters and disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 59-123670; and a structure disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 59-138461 in which an opening for absorbing pressure waves of heat energy is disposed to correspond to the discharge section.
    </p>
    <p num="180">Furthermore, as a recording head of the full line type having a length corresponding to the maximum width of a recording medium which can be recorded by the recording apparatus, either the construction which satisfies its length by a combination of a plurality of recording heads as disclosed in the above specifications or the construction as a single full line type recording head which has integrally been formed can be used.</p>
    <p num="181">In addition, the invention is effective for a recording head of the freely exchangeable chip type which enables electrical connection to the recording apparatus main body or supply of ink from the main device by being mounted onto the apparatus main body, or for the case by use of a recording head of the cartridge type provided integrally on the recording head itself.</p>
    <p num="182">
      It is preferred to additionally employ the recording head restoring means and the auxiliary means provided as the component of the present invention because the effect of the present invention can be further stabled.
      <br/>
      Specifically, it is preferable to employ a recording head capping means, a cleaning means, a pressurizing or suction means, an electricity-to-heat converter, an another heating element or a sub-heating means constituted by combining them and a sub-emitting mode in which an emitting is performed independently from the recording emitting in order to stably perform the recording operation.
    </p>
    <p num="183">Although a fluid ink is employed in the aforesaid embodiment of the present invention, an ink which is solidified at the room temperature or lower and as well as softened at the room temperature, an ink in the form of a fluid at the room temperature, or an ink which is formed into a fluid when the recording signal is supplied may be employed because the aforesaid ink-jet method is ordinarily arranged in such a manner that the temperature of ink is controlled in a range from 30 (degree)  C. or higher to 70 (degree)  C. or lower so as to make the viscosity of the ink to be included in a stable discharge range.</p>
    <p num="184">
      Furthermore, an ink which is solidified when it is caused to stand, and liquified when heat energy is supplied in accordance with a recording signal can be adapted to the present invention to positively prevent a temperature rise caused by heat energy by utilizing the temperature rise as energy of state transition from the solid state to the liquid state or to prevent ink evaporation.
      <br/>
      In any case, an ink which is liquified when heat energy is supplied in accordance with a recording signal so as to be discharged in the form of fluid ink, or an ink which is liquified only after heat energy is supplied, e.g., an ink which starts to solidify when it reaches a recording medium, can be adapted to the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the aforesaid case, the ink may be of a type which is held as fluid or solid material in a recess of a porous sheet or a through hole at a position to face the electricity-to-heat converter as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 54-56847 or Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 60-71260. It is the most preferred way for the ink to be adapted to the aforesaid film boiling method.
    </p>
    <p num="185">
      As has been described above, according to the present invention, the discharging start position of an ink discharged into a frame partitioning off each filter element is changed to change the amount by which this ink overlap the frame.
      <br/>
      With this operation, white omissions at the corners of each frame owing to variations in materials for inks and substrates of the respective lots can be reduced as compared with the case wherein coloring is started at a predetermined position in each frame.
    </p>
    <p num="186">When a plurality of inks are to be shifted/discharged into each frame partitioning off a filter element with the droplets overlapping each other, a white omission at one side of the filter element can be prevented by decreasing the intervals between inks discharged in an overlapping state at the last stage of the coloring process.</p>
    <p num="187">In addition, when a plurality of inks are to be shifted/discharged into each frame partitioning off a filter element with the droplets overlapping each other, variations in nozzles for discharging inks can be corrected by changing the number of inks to be discharged in an overlapping state, thereby preventing density irregularity in coloring filter elements.</p>
    <p num="188">Furthermore, when a plurality of inks are to be shifted/discharged into each frame partitioning off a filter element with the droplets overlapping each other, white omissions and the like of each filter element can be prevented by partially increasing the amount of ink discharged onto a portion where irregularity tends to occur.</p>
    <p num="189">
      The present invention is not limited to the above embodiments and various changes and modifications can be made within the spirit and scope of the present invention.
