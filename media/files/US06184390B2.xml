      <br/>
      A catalyst for the bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins comprising a noble metal compound and a phosphine chalcogenide of the following formula (1):wherein each of R1, R2 and R3 is, independently, an alkyl group or an aryl group each of which may have a substituent, and A is a Group 16 element of the Periodic Table; and R1, R2 or R3 may be combined, directly or through a bridging group, with one another where the groups to be combined may be attached either to an identical phosphorus atom or to different phosphorus atoms.
      <br/>
      Element A includes oxygen, sulfur and selenium atoms.
      <br/>
      The noble metal compound includes palladium(II) halides and other palladium compounds.
      <br/>
      The catalyst may further include a copper(I) halide or other copper compound as a co-catalyst.
      <br/>
      The use of this catalyst can provide the bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins with efficiency.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to catalysts used for the bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins, to novel phosphine chalcogenides which are useful as ligands of the catalysts, to processes for the bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins using the catalysts, and to methods for production of succinate derivatives.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">Processes for the alkoxycarbonylation of olefins have been proposed in (1) J. Am. Chem. Soc., 98, 1806(1976); (2) J. Mol. Cat. A: Chemical 111, L3-L6(1996); (3) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans., 1031(1993); (4) J. Org. Chem., 57, 4189(1992), and satisfactory results have been achieved by these processes.</p>
    <p num="6">
      For the bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins, processes have been reported in documents (5) J. Org. Chem., 37, 2034(1972),; (6) J. Am. Chem. Soc., 98, 1806(1976); (7) Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 64, 3600(1991); (8) Tetrahedron Lett., 28, 325(1987); (9) J. Am. Chem. Soc., 98, 1810(1976); (10) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 32, 1719(1993); and (11) Organometallics, 11, 1975(1992).
      <br/>
      These processes are, however, respectively disadvantageous: The processes in the documents (5) and (6) are low in yield, the process in the document (7) gives a mixture of a monoalkoxycarbonylated compound and a bisalkoxycarbonylated compound, the process in the document (8) requires the addition of tetramethylurea or propylene oxide and ethyl ortho-acetate, the process in the document (9) should be conducted under high pressure conditions (3 atm), processes in the documents (10) and (11) accompany oligomerization.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In a document (12) Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 69, 735(1996) is disclosed the use of an optically active bisoxazoline as a ligand in the bisalkoxycarbonylation to obtain an optically active substance.
      <br/>
      This process requires a long time for the reaction and is low in reactivity.
