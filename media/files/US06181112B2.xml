    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates generally to electrical generators, and more particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus and method for limiting the peak voltage output of an electrical generator.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Within various electrical generation devices, and particularly within variable frequency (VF) electrical generators and generator control unit (GCU) systems, high voltage can occur when the stationary exciter field current is commanded to a maximum level.
      <br/>
      Such a situation may occur when, for example, the point-of-regulation (POR) sensing fails, and the GCU commands full field current.
      <br/>
      The maximum voltage amplitude appearing at the terminals of a synchronous generator during full field excitation is a function of the saturation characteristics of the generator, the magnitude of the stationary field current, and the speed of rotation or electrical generation frequency.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Modern generators operating in, for example, the 400 Hertz (Hz) frequency range are designed to limit the maximum voltage which appears at the terminals of the generator by carefully selecting the operating point on the B-H curve of iron used in the generator.
      <br/>
      With such careful selection of the B-H operating point, if a full field current event occurs, the machine saturates to produce a maximum output voltage of approximately 150-160 V line-to-neutral (1-n).
      <br/>
      This maximum value is well below the typical maximum specification value of 180 V 1-n.
      <br/>
      This type of peak voltage limiting, however, is a function of the physical characteristics, construction and materials, of the generator itself and the speed or frequency at which it is operated.
      <br/>
      This type of voltage limit may be simply explained as the generator has a maximum available magnetic flux.
      <br/>
      The voltage output is proportional to this flux and to operating speed.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Many generators are required to operate over widely varying rotational input speeds, for example, as high as 2:1 maximum-to-minimum operating speed.
      <br/>
      In such cases, since the maximum voltage would change with rotation speed or frequency of the generator, at two times speed the maximum voltage may be 300-320 V 1-n or more.
      <br/>
      This requires the load equipment be designed to tolerate these higher voltages, which is likely to add to the cost of the equipment and potentially effect the reliability of the equipment.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      More traditional approaches have been to provide a "voltage clamp" at the output of the generator that is activated when the voltage exceeds a value, say 170 V 1-n.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a very fast responding exciter current controller may be used.
      <br/>
      Both of these approaches suffer from fault tolerance.
      <br/>
      Neither system is required to perform until a voltage is too high.
      <br/>
      An undetected passive failure disabling the exciter current peak voltage controller or the voltage clamp may result in a high voltage condition at the terminals of the generator.
      <br/>
      This is a very undesirable condition.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It has been known in the art to use compensating coils in generators to perform functions other than peak voltage regulation.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,871,960 describes an exciter having two excitation coils each with an associated voltage regulator.
      <br/>
      The primary coil and associated circuit regulates the generator voltage with a current inversely proportional to speed.
      <br/>
      The other coil and associated circuit compensates for load and speed fluctuations.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In U.S. Pat. No. 4,885,526 a scheme is described to compensate for the effect of armature reactance on the flux distribution within the machine.
      <br/>
      This concept supposedly improves the efficiency of the machine if the compensating circuit uses mostly reactive power.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,292 an auxiliary field winding is utilized to provide trim flux along with steady-state flux generated by the main field to accommodate load changes in a superconductive generator.</p>
    <p num="9">Thus, a need remains for an improved apparatus and method for peak voltage limiting in generator applications that is both cost-effective and reliable.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="18">
      The many advantages and features of the present invention will be apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of a generator incorporating a peak voltage limiting circuit in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention; and
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is graph illustrating auxiliary winding current as a function of generator speed.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="19">
      With reference to FIG. 1, a generator 10 includes an exciter field magnetic structure 12, a rotor assembly 14 and an armature assembly 16.
      <br/>
      Exciter field magnetic structure 12 includes an exciter field coil 18 which is coupled to a controlled exciter field current source as is very well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Rotor 14 includes rotor coils 20 coupled through rectifier assembly 22 to field coil 24, also as is known in the art.
      <br/>
      Rotor 14 is further coupled to a prime mover (not shown), which in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention may provide rotational mechanical energy to rotor 14 with a range of rotational speed up to and potentially in excess of 2:1 maximum-to-minimum speed.
      <br/>
      Armature 16 includes armature coils 26 in which, during operation of generator 10, output current is induced and coupled to terminals 28.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Generator 10 further includes a peak voltage limiting circuit 11.
      <br/>
      Peak voltage limiting circuit 11 includes coupled in association with the exciter field magnetic structure 12, an auxiliary winding 30.
      <br/>
      Auxiliary winding 30 is coupled to a variable current source 32 which is responsive to a control signal on line 34 from control signal source 36.
      <br/>
      Control signal source 36 is coupled to receive as an input at least one operating characteristic of generator 10.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, control signal source 36 is coupled to an output of a rotor rotational speed sensor or receives generator speed or frequency information from a generator control unit (GCU) (not depicted).
      <br/>
      Control signal source 36 may be implemented as standalone circuit element, as a microprocessor operating under a control program or as part of the GCU.
      <br/>
      Variable current source 32 may be any suitable current source capable of providing a variable current output responsive to a control signal.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Responsive to the rotational speed of rotor 14, control signal source 36 provides a control signal to variable current source 32, which preferably provides an auxiliary winding current (I*) in accordance with the curve illustrated in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Observed in FIG. 2 is that at low generator speed, i.e., low rotor speed, no current is provided to winding 30.
      <br/>
      As generator speed increases, current I* flows in winding 30, which in accordance with a preferred embodiment, increases linearly with generator speed to a maximum value.
      <br/>
      Of course it will be appreciated that the generator speed where current I* is initiated as well as its characteristic curve with generator speed may be modified for virtually any generator application and does not have to be linear.
      <br/>
      The curve may be further modified based upon various other operating characteristics of generator 10 such as frequency of generation.
      <br/>
      It will be further appreciated that when the generator is not supplied exciter field current, current may not be supplied to winding 30.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The effect of current I* flowing in winding 30 is to move the quiescent flux bias point of the exciter field magnetic structure as a function of generator speed.
      <br/>
      The result is that the maximum current that may be induced in rotor field coil 24 is capped, which in turn caps the maximum terminal voltage, i.e., output voltage, of the generator.
      <br/>
      More particularly, as current I* increases in winding 30, generator 10 saturates independent of generator speed thus capping the output voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A preferred implementation of the present invention is for aircraft applications where the utilization equipment is typically designed for a peak operating voltage of approximately 180 V 1-n.
      <br/>
      The generator speed may vary by as much as 2:1 which, without peak voltage limiting, could result in maximum voltages exceeding the design capability of the utilization equipment.
      <br/>
      Current I* is therefore chosen to limit generator output voltage at about 170 V 1-n.
      <br/>
      Thus, the design of the utilization equipment need not be changed to accommodate higher peak voltage values, and the existing utilization equipment is further protected from over voltage conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      With reference once again to FIG. 1, a current sensor 40 is preferably utilized to monitor current I* flowing in winding 30.
      <br/>
      Since current is always flowing in winding 30 when the generator speed exceeds a lower value, monitoring the current flow in winding 30 within a tolerance value of the desired curve (e.g., FIG. 2) provides an indication of the proper operation of the peak voltage limiting circuit 11.
      <br/>
      The output of current sensor 40 is coupled to control signal source 36, which is further operable to compare the actual current in winding 30 to the desired current.
      <br/>
      In a fault condition, control signal source 36 may provide a signal to the GCU and/or take other appropriate measures.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the output of current sensor 40 may be coupled directly to the GCU so that upon detection of a fault condition appropriate measures may be taken, such as de-exciting the generator field.
      <br/>
      In this manner, a fault in peak voltage limiting circuit 11 is determined upon occurrence of the fault and prior to a fault in generator 10 requiring proper operation of peak voltage limiting circuit 11.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In a method according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an auxiliary winding is provided in association with the exciter field magnetic structure.
      <br/>
      Current is selectively applied to the auxiliary winding in order move the quiescent flux point of the exciter field magnetic structure in order to limit a peak voltage output of the generator.
      <br/>
      The current is preferably applied as a function of the generator speed, and the applied current is preferably monitored to ensure proper operation of the peak voltage control system.
      <br/>
      Responsive to detecting an applied current outside a tolerance window of a desired applied current, the generator is deactivated, e.g., the exciter field is de-energized, or otherwise placed into a fault operating mode.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The present invention has been described in terms of several preferred embodiments intended to illustrate its many advantages and features.
      <br/>
      The preferred embodiments described herein should in no way be taken as limiting of its many potential applications.
      <br/>
      To determine the true and fair scope of the present invention reference is made to the subjoined claims.
