      A board game has two teams of a plurality of game pieces whereby, on successive turns, a player may add a game piece, move a game piece, or enhance the movement direction capabilities of a game piece.
      <br/>
      The object of the game is to occupy designated opponent's territories on the game board or to capture all of the opponent's game pieces so that none remain on the game board.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to board games and, more particularly, to a board game that has selectively dynamic game pieces which change functional characteristics during play.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Various board games exist in which movable playing pieces representing opposing players are moved in accordance with prescribed directions, distances and sequences.
      <br/>
      In some games, such as Chinese checkers for example, all game pieces have the same movement characteristics in terms of distance and direction.
      <br/>
      Other games, such as chess or standard checkers, involve game pieces having specific movement characteristics and capturing capabilities that vary among different game pieces.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In the aforementioned games, however, the dynamic quality of each game piece is limited.
      <br/>
      As a result, the degree to which a player can strategically surprise his opponent is limited in the sense that in checkers, for example, once a game piece is enhanced it will not be changed again.
      <br/>
      When a checker game piece is crowned, its movement characteristics will remain the same for the rest of the game.
      <br/>
      In chess, aside from well executed strategy, the only element of surprise is the recovery of a captured game piece.
      <br/>
      Recovery of a captured game piece in chess is fairly predictable in terms of guessing which captured game piece an opponent will choose to recover, and when such recovery will occur if at all.
      <br/>
      In neither chess nor checkers, does a game piece have optional modes of movement beyond a few degrees of variation in direction.
    </p>
    <heading>OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">It is an object of the present invention to provide a board game having game pieces that are selectively dynamic with respect to movement direction and distance, and degrees thereof.</p>
    <p num="5">It is another object of the present invention to provide a board game in which game pieces are physically altered to indicate particular movement characteristics of the particular game piece.</p>
    <p num="6">These objects and other inherent advantages of the present invention are described herein.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="8">
      A game board (10) according to the present invention is shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The game board (10) preferably comprises a plurality of small squares (12) arranged in an 11 * 11 configuration.
      <br/>
      It is possible to configure the board with a different number of squares, such as 9 * 9, or with a pattern of multi-sided shapes other than squares.
      <br/>
      The material used to construct the game board (10) may be any suitable construction material having sufficient rigidity to support game pieces in a generally flat plane.
      <br/>
      If desired, the board may alternatively be made from a vinyl sheet, or similar flexible material, and laid on a flat surface.
      <br/>
      Each square (12) of the game board (10) has directional indicia (14), as shown in FIG. 2, to provide a reference for aligning game piece directional indicia as described below.
      <br/>
      The directional indicia (14) may comprise a pair of dots or similar markings.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the directional indicia (14) are protrusions or rod tips, as shown in FIG. 3, that are designed to engage mating structures on the individual game pieces for positive retention.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, the game pieces (16) may each comprise a generally flat, square body.
      <br/>
      A series of holes (18, 20) are formed on the vertical wall of each game piece (16) and extend toward the center of the game piece (16).
      <br/>
      The holes (18, 20) are spaced apart at approximately 45 degrees from each other, for a total of eight holes.
      <br/>
      Four holes (18) occupy flat faces of the generally square configuration, and the other four holes (20) occupy corner sections of the generally square configuration.
      <br/>
      If desired, the game pieces (16) may be octagonal, round, or of some other shape that enables placement of multiple, evenly spaced holes around the game piece.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      As illustrated in FIG. 6, each game piece (16) may be fitted with a plurality of up to eight prongs (22) as shown.
      <br/>
      Each prong (22) may be inserted into one of the holes (18, 20) in accordance with rules of play, as described in the forthcoming example.
      <br/>
      The lengths of the prongs (22) and the holes (18, 20) may be sized so that a game piece (16) carrying eight prongs (22) may occupy a game board square (12) in a manner in which the square (12) is essentially fully occupied yet the prongs (22) do not extend into adjacent squares.
      <br/>
      The prongs (22) may be attached to the game pieces in a variety of ways, such as press-fitted into a corresponding hole.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, for example, the prongs may be snapped into place using snap-retaining means, or they may be attached by magnetic force.
      <br/>
      One or more prongs (22) may be specially marked or color-coded to signify a special function prong such as, for example, a single prong that enables a game piece to have omni-directional capability.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Directional indicia (24) may be included on the top surface of each game piece (16) for visual indication of directional orientation.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the game piece directional indicia are in the form of a pair of protrusions (24) on the top surface of each game piece (16).
      <br/>
      A pair of corresponding holes (not shown) are on the bottom surface of each game piece (16) to engage either the game board directional indicia (14) or the game piece directional indicia (24) of another game piece when game pieces (16) are stacked on top of one another.
      <br/>
      The directional indicia may be of any suitable marking or type that enables visual detection of an orientation direction.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In another embodiment, according to FIGS. 7-9, a game piece (200) of generally square configuration has a plurality of snap-fit members (202).
      <br/>
      The snap-fit members (202) are adapted to engage snap-fit openings (204) on prongs (206).
      <br/>
      The corner faces (208) of each game piece (200) are set at a distance from the center of the game piece (200) that is greater than the distance from the center to the side face (210) so that prongs (206) of equal length may be used and the perimeter formed by the prong tips (212) forms a generally square shape that fits within a game board square.
      <br/>
      Such game piece and prong configurations may be made from molded plastic or other suitable materials.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The game board (10) and game pieces (16) may be played in games according to a variety of rules in which teams and game piece movement characteristics are defined.
      <br/>
      A game according to a preferred embodiment is described herein.
      <br/>
      In a two-player game according to the present invention, each player starts with a plurality of game pieces that comprise his or her team.
      <br/>
      A visual identifier or a different color is used to visually distinguish game pieces from a particular team.
      <br/>
      Each player starts with nine game pieces (16) and thirty prongs (22).
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The game board (10) has six designated starting squares (26, 28).
      <br/>
      Three starting squares (26) correspond to the first player and the other three starting squares (28) correspond to the second player.
      <br/>
      The game board (10) is configured so that the starting squares (26, 28) are spaced, symmetrically, on opposing sides (30, 32).
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, using the bottom left square (12) of FIG. 1 as a coordinate of �0,0�, the first player's starting squares are located at coordinates �3,9�, �6,8� and �9,9�. The second player's starting squares are located at coordinates �3,3�, �6,4� and �9,3�. To start a game, each player puts one game piece (12) on each of his three starting squares (26, 28).
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      On successive turns, each player chooses to either enhance a game piece (16) or to move a game piece (16).
      <br/>
      A game piece (16) is enhanced by adding a prong (22) to one of the holes (18, 20).
      <br/>
      A player may only add one prong (22) or move a game piece (16) one square per turn.
      <br/>
      The direction of movement is limited to one adjacent square in the direction in which a prong (22) inserted in the game piece (16) corresponds.
      <br/>
      Thus, at the start of a game, when the game pieces (12) have no prongs (22), a player's turn is limited to adding at least the first prong (22) to a piece (12) before it can be moved.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      After a player moves a game piece (12) off of a starting square (26, 28) he may introduce another game piece (12) into the game by placing it on the starting square (26, 28).
      <br/>
      On successive turns he may add prongs (22) or move the game piece (16) in accordance with the rules for moving a game piece (16) as previously described.
    </p>
    <p num="17">The object of the game is to either occupy all of the opponent's starting squares (26, 28) simultaneously, or to eliminate all of the opponent's game pieces in the manner described below.</p>
    <p num="18">
      A player can eliminate an opponent's game pieces (12) and attached prongs (22) by "jumping" the game piece in a manner similar to that in checkers.
      <br/>
      A jump is executable when a player's game piece (16) occupies a square adjacent to an opponent's game piece and there is an oppositely positioned square that is vacant.
      <br/>
      Provided that a prong (22) is present that establishes a permissible direction of movement for a game piece (16), that game piece (16) can jump an opposing piece by moving in the permissible direction.
      <br/>
      A game piece (16) may make multiple jumps over game pieces (16) that are separated by one vacant square so long as the necessary prongs (22) are present for direction enablement.
      <br/>
      As the opponent's game pieces (16) are jumped, they are "captured" and removed from the game board (10), along with any prongs (22) attached.
      <br/>
      A player may jump his own game pieces but they remain on the board.
      <br/>
      A game piece cannot be jumped more than once in one executable move.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      If a player's game piece lands on an opponent's starting square (26, 28), he may recover captured pieces and enter them back in the game.
      <br/>
      Multiple game pieces from the same team may occupy a single square (12) simultaneously.
      <br/>
      In that instance, the pieces are stacked vertically and each game piece occupying the square is moveable according to its prong-designated direction on one turn.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the stack is movable in compound fashion on one turn, where prongs establish direction and as the stack moves a piece is dropped off with each square moved.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Optionally, the rules of play may include means for each player to designate one or more game board squares as having special characteristics such as, for example, a non-capture designation which permits game pieces to reside on the square with immunity from being captured.
      <br/>
      Or, such a square may be designated to limit damage from a "jump" to something less than capture.
      <br/>
      For example, a jump may cause a game piece residing in the square to lose one or more prongs, yet the game piece will remain on the game board, un-captured.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The present invention game described herein may be implemented on personal computers or on a host server for a network.
      <br/>
      The game may be set up to allow player versus player, or player versus computer.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      For player versus player computer games, a local computer residing in the presence of the actual players may host the game.
      <br/>
      A single personal computer may be loaded with the software to run the game entirely, including channeling input signals from both players.

      <br/>
      An audio output interface is optional.
      <br/>
      Conventional graphic display drivers (106) and soundcards (108) are used.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      A graphical display device (110) in the form of a conventional PC-compatible display monitor is interfaced with the personal computer (102) for displaying the game board (112) and various game or player status information (114).
      <br/>
      Optionally, a set of audio speakers (116) may be implemented to deliver pre-preprogrammed audio signals.
      <br/>
      Player input devices (118, 120), in the form of keyboards or joysticks, are interfaced with the personal computer (102) for delivering player input signals.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the software could provide for a single input device to be used for both players whereby alternate turns correspond to each respective player.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In use, the program for running the game is executed on the personal computer (102) and the game board (112) is displayed.
      <br/>
      Players take turns using the input devices (118, 120) to add, move or enhance game pieces until a winner is declared in accordance with rules of play such as those described above.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Alternatively, the software (104) may include a program that enables a single player to play against the computer (102).
      <br/>
      The features are essentially the same as those described with respect to FIG. 10, except that additional algorithms exist to enable the program to determine the computer's moves based on pre-programmed, strategic sequences.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Referring to FIG. 11, a game system (200) according to the present invention allows two players to play from separate, conventional personal computers (202, 204).
      <br/>
      The two computers (202, 204) are linked by conventional means such as a cable (206) and each includes essentially the same features as the system (100) described with respect to FIG. 10. Additional algorithms and interfaces are included in each computer (202, 204) for receiving player move input signals from the other computer and for delivering data to the other computer.
      <br/>
      Each computer display (208, 210) includes a game board (212, 214) and information display (216, 218).
      <br/>
      Player input devices (220, 222) and optional audio output devices (224, 226) are provided.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 12, wherein a Web-based game system (300) for implementing a board game as previously described for player versus player or player versus computer play.
      <br/>
      The system (300) comprises a Web-server (302) that hosts the main software containing a game program essentially similar to those described with respect to FIG. 10 and FIG. 11. A plurality of remotely located computers, such a first personal computer (304) and a second personal computer (306), are loaded with appropriate software to access and run the software on the Web-server (302) to play a game.
      <br/>
      The remote computers (304, 306) are linked to the Web-server (302) via the Internet.
      <br/>
      By using conventional programming techniques and tools, such as JAVA (TM), a player at a remote computer (304) may interface with the Web-server (302) and play a game against a remote computer or against another player at another remote computer (306).
      <br/>
      Using conventional programming techniques, the associated software for player versus player or player versus computer may be implemented in user-optional format.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In the player versus player mode, players at remote computers (304, 306) alternately take turns sending signals indicative of moves and the Web-server (302) runs the associated software to determine the permissibility of the moves, to determine the consequence of the move, and to display the board and game pieces in real-time.
      <br/>
      In a similar manner, the Web-server interacts with one remote computer for player-versus computer play.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The aforedescribed dynamic features of the game board and game pieces of the present invention enable players to selectively and strategically vary the number of game pieces on the game board and the movement capabilities of the game pieces.
      <br/>
      This permits an additional degree of strategy not found in other board games.
