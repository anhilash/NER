    <p num="5">
      Generally, the analog switching system is a manual switching system installed in a rural network area which is not provided with means for utilizing the main network installed in an urban area.
      <br/>
      The analog switching system employs the long distance subscriber line signal handled by the rural network, and provides the long distance subscribers with calling service by making a connection with a central exchange which is installed in the urban area typically located over a few hundred kilometers from the analog switching system.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Typically, such analog switching systems require an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter, such as a PCM30-4 (A/D converter) in order to achieve a system which is harmonious with a digital switching system.
      <br/>
      However, since such systems are typically designed according to the signaling system known as R1, R2/CAS, such a system may not be employed in a rural network system as generally described above, and as described in more detail below.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there has been a requirement for a signal conversion system to process a 2-wire long-distance subscriber line signal so as to match the digital switching system with the analog switching system typically employed in a rural network system.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Thus, there is a need in the art to provide a signal matching system which matches a digital switching system with an analog switching system using a 2-wire long-distance subscriber line signal.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="13">
      Referring to FIG. 1 illustrating the construction of the analog 2-wire long distance subscriber line network, the hook-off signal initiated by a subscriber of the analog switching system 10 is transmitted to the transmission input/output device (TIO) 12 of the manual switching station, which converts the hook-off signal into a seizure signal transferred through amplifiers 14, 16 to the input/output transmission device 18 of the analog switching station.
      <br/>
      The amplifiers 14, 16 serve to amplify the signals according to the distance to be traversed.
      <br/>
      The analog switching transmission input/output device 18 converts the seizure signal into the corresponding hook-off signal transferred to the central exchange 20, which transmits the dial tone through the occupied line to the analog switching transmission input/output device 18.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Then, the analog switching transmission input/output transmission device 18 converts the dial tone into a corresponding seizure acknowledgment signal (Seizure Ack) which is transferred through the amplifiers 14, 16 to the manual switching transmission input/output device 12, which in turn converts the seizure acknowledgment signal into a dial tone which is transferred to the calling subscriber of the manual switching system 10.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the calling subscriber dials the desired number, and that digital data is delivered through the manual switching, transmission input/output device 12 and the analog switching transmission input/output device 18 to the central exchange (ATC), 20. The ATC 20 analyzes the digital data so as to connect the calling subscriber with the receiving subscriber.
      <br/>
      If the receiving subscriber is free, the ATC 20 transfers the ring-back tone to the analog switching transmission input/output device 18, which in tum converts the ring-back tone into the receiving subscriber's free-state signal which is transferred through the amplifiers 14, 16 to the manual switching transmission input/output device 12.
      <br/>
      Finally, the manual switching transmission input/output device 12 converts the receiving subscriber's free-state signal into a ring-back tone signal which is transferred to the calling subscriber, thus forming the communication path.
      <br/>
      This is a typical rural network switching system which is much used in the rural networks of Russia.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The analog switching system requires a PCM 30-4 A/D converter in order to achieve a system which cooperates with the digital switching system.
      <br/>
      However, since such system is designed according to the well-known signaling system R1, R2/CAS, it may not be employed in the rural network system shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Hence, there has been required a signaling conversion system to process the 2-wire long distance subscriber line signal so as to match the digital switching system with the analog switching system typically used in the rural network system.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Referring to FIG. 2, there is provided a long signal control processor 100, which converts the E1 signal of the digital switching system into a line/register signal required by the analog switching system so as to match with the 2-wire long distance subscriber line signal, and which analyzes the received line/register signal.
      <br/>
      CDTI102 converts the line register signal into a 4-wire E1 digital signal when the subscriber of the digital switching system 110 calls the 2-wire long distance subscriber line.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The first PCM equipment 104 in PCM stage 112 consists of a PCM-30-4 and converts the line/register 4-wire digital signal of the CDTI 102 into the 4-wire analog signal transferred to the 4-wire/2-wire converter 106, and the analog signal ofthe analog switching system into the digital signal transferred to the digital switching system 110.
      <br/>
      The second PCM equipment 106 converts the analog 4-wire signal into the 2-wire signal transferred to the manual switching station input/output transmission device 12, and the 2-wire signal of the manual switching station input/output transmission device 12 into the 4-wire signal transferred to the first PCM equipment 104.
      <br/>
      The manual switching station input/output transmission device 12 converts the hook-off signal into a seizure signal transferred through the amplifiers 14a and 16a to the analog switching station input/output transmission device 18, which in turn converts the seizure signal into the hook-off signal transferred to the central exchange 20.
      <br/>
      The exchange 20 transfers the dial tone to the corresponding occupied line and to the analog switching station input/output transmission device 18.
      <br/>
      In addition, the exchange 20 analyzes the dial digital signal to connect with the receiving subscriber.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The matching operation is described specifically with reference to FIGS. 2 to 6 as follows:</p>
    <p num="19">
      Firstly, describing the case that the subscriber of the digital switching system 110 calls the subscriber of the long distance subscriber line signal switching system in reference to FIG. 3, the digital switching system 110 maintains a "0" signal as shown by interval B of FIG. 4, and converts the hook-off signal generated by the subscriber CG of the digital switching system 110 into a seizure signal applied to the first PCM equipment 104, which in turn converts the seizure signal into the digital signal transferred to the second PCM equipment 106.
      <br/>
      The second PCM equipment 106 converts the digital seizure signal into a 2-wire hook-off signal transferred to the manual switching station input/output transmission device 12, which in turn converts the hook-off signal into a seizure signal transferred through the amplifiers 14a and 16a to the analog switching station input/output transmission device 18.
      <br/>
      In this case, the amplifiers 14a and 16a amplify the signal according to the transmission distance.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The analog switching station input/output transmission device 18 converts the seizure signal into the hook-off signal transferred to the central exchange 20 installed in the urban area.
      <br/>
      The exchange 20 transmits the dial tone through the corresponding occupied line to the analog switching station input/output transmission device 18, which in turn converts the dial tone into the seizure acknowledgment signal Seizure Ack transferred through the amplifiers 14a and 16a to the manual switching station input/output transmission device 12.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The manual switching station input/output transmission device 12 converts the seizure acknowledgment signal into the dial tone transferred through the second PCM equipment 106 and the first PCM equipment 104 to the digital switching system 110, which in turn transfers the dial tone to the calling subscriber.
      <br/>
      Then, the call subscriber dials the desired number, from which the digital switching system 110 transfers the dial pulses as shown by interval C of FIG. 4 to the first and second PCM equipments 104 and 106, which transfer the dialed digital data through the manual switching station transmission input/output device 12 to the analog switching station input/output transmission device 18 to the ATC 20.
      <br/>
      The ATC 20 analyzes the digital signal to connect the calling subscriber CG with the receiving subscriber CD.
      <br/>
      In this case, the digital switching system 110 maintains "0" as shown by interval D of FIG. 4, recognizing the communication state.
      <br/>
      Finishing the communication, the digital switching system 110 maintains "1" as shown by interval E of FIG. 4, recognizing the idle state.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the subscriber of the digital switching system 110 calls the analog switching system, the digital switching system 110 always recognizes the states of the first and second PCM equipments 104 and 106 consisting of PCM-30-4 as "1".
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Secondly, referring to FIG. 5, describing the case that the subscriber of the long distance subscriber line signal switching system (exchange 20) calls the subscriber of the digital switching system 110, the exchange 20 transfers the dialed ring signal from the subscriber CD of the exchange 20 to the corresponding occupied line and the ring-back tone to the calling subscriber CD.
      <br/>
      The ring signal is transferred to the analog switching station input/output transmission device 18, which in turn delivers the ring signal through the amplifiers 14a and 16a to the manual switching station input/output transmission device 12.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The manual switching station input/output transmission device 12 applies the ring signal to the second PCM equipment 106.
      <br/>
      Then, the first and second PCM equipments 104 and 106, respectively, convert the ring signal into a digital ring signal whose value is "0" for 1.5 seconds and "1" for 4 seconds as shown in FIG. 6, and transfers it to the digital switching system 110, which in turn converts the digital ring signal into the ring signal sound of 25 Hz transferred to the receiving subscriber CG.
      <br/>
      In response to the ring signal sound, if the receiving subscriber CG picks up the transmitter/receiver off the hook, the digital switching system 110 transfers the answering signal (ANSWER AIG) to the first PCM equipment 104.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The first and second PCM equipments 104 and 106, respectively, convert the answering signal into the hook-off signal transferred to the manual switching station input/output transmission device 12, which in turn converts the hook-off signal into the seizure signal transferred through the amplifiers 14a and 16a to the analog switching station input/output transmission device 18.
      <br/>
      The analog switching station input/output transmission device 18 converts the seizure signal into a hook-off signal transferred to the central exchange 20, which in turn connects the calling subscriber CD with the receiving subscriber CG of the digital switching system 110.
      <br/>
      Receiving the hook-off signal, the digital switching system 110 maintains "0" state as shown in FIG. 6, and then takes on a "1" state after recognizing the connection of the communication line through the first PCM equipment 104.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Thus, the PCM-30-4 A/D converter is effectively employed to match the signal of the digital switching system with that of the 2-wire long distance subscriber line signal analog switching system, so that the cost of developing the signal converter, as well as additional equipment, can be avoided.</p>
