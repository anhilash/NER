      A mixer for particulate materials, such as soil, dirt, sand, concrete, lime, fertilizers, aggregate, and water, hitched to a skid steer motor vehicle has a bucket for accommodating the particulate materials.
      <br/>
      A pair of augers having opposite spiral flights located within the bucket are driven by a hydraulic fluid operated motor to mix the particulate materials.
      <br/>
      The operator of the vehicle controls the hydraulic motor to reverse the rotational direction of the augers to control the mixing of the particulate materials.
      <br/>
      A door mounted on the side wall of the bucket is movable with a hydraulic cylinder to an open position to allow the particulate materials to be discharged from the bucket.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The invention is in the field of attachments for motor vehicles and tractors for mixing and transporting particulate materials.
      <br/>
      The attachment is a bucket hitchable to a skid steer motor vehicle.
      <br/>
      Augers mounted on the bucket are driven with a hydraulic motor to mix particulate materials in the bucket.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Front end tractor loaders and skid steer vehicles use bucket attachments for digging and loading materials and transporting the materials to a selected location.
      <br/>
      The vehicles have lift and tilt structures that control movements of the buckets and allow the buckets to be tilted forwardly to dump materials out of the bucket. C. M. Fisher in U.S. Pat. No. 3,598,266 and J. E. Zimmerman in U.S. Pat. No. 4,068,711 disclose buckets mounted on the lift arms of tractors for accommodating concrete and pouring concrete into a mold or a small area.
      <br/>
      The concrete in the buckets is not mixed in the buckets.
      <br/>
      Ready mix concrete or concrete from a concrete mixer must be placed in the buckets which are only used to transport and dump the concrete in selected locations.
      <br/>
      Concrete mixers have been developed to be mounted on tractors which transport mixed concrete to the work site. R. M. Bolt in U.S. Pat. No. 2,815,195 and F. Falardeau in U.S. Pat. No. 4,268,174 disclose concrete mixers having drum-type housings or buckets and concrete mixing blades and augers rotatably mounted on single shafts which are rotatably mounted on the end walls of the buckets.
      <br/>
      Two or more laterally spaced augers are not used to mix concrete in the bucket.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      The invention is an apparatus for mixing particulate materials and moving the mixed materials to a selected discharge location.
      <br/>
      The apparatus accommodates different types of materials, including but not limited to soil, dirt, sand, organic materials, aggregates, concrete, water, lime, fertilizers, and animal feeds.
      <br/>
      The apparatus has a bucket hitched to a skid steer vehicle.
      <br/>
      A pair of transverse augers rotatably mounted on the bucket have opposite spiral flights that reverse the movement of the particulate materials to facilitate efficient mixing of the materials.
      <br/>
      A hydraulic fluid operated motor drives a sprocket and chain power transmission to concurrently rotate the augers which mix the materials in the bucket.
      <br/>
      A side wall of the bucket adjacent an end of an auger has an opening which allows the auger to discharge the mixed materials from the bucket.
      <br/>
      A door movably mounted on the side wall of the bucket selectively opens and closes the opening to control the discharge of material from the bucket.
      <br/>
      A hydraulic cylinder connected to the door operates to open and close the door.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The material mixer of the invention, indicated generally at 10 in FIG. 1, is connected to a skid steer motor vehicle 11.
      <br/>
      Mixer 10 is used to mix soils, sands, aggregates, concrete and water, and like particulate materials and discharge or dump the mixed materials to selected locations.
      <br/>
      Vehicle 11 is used to supply hydraulic fluid under pressure to operate the mixer and transport the mixer including the materials to a material discharge location.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Vehicle 11 is a conventional skid steer tractor having lift arms 12 and 13 and a tilt control cylinder 14 connected to a hitch 16.

      Other types of vehicles, such as track tractors can be used to carry and operate mixer 10.
      <br/>
      Hitch 16 connects mixer 10 to vehicle 11 and allows the operator to utilize lift arms 12 and 13 and tilt control cylinder 14 to raise, lower and tilt mixer 10.
