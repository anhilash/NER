    <p num="5">The present invention also relates to a process for preparing these aqueous coating compositions and to their use as a clearcoat or as a topcoat and to their use for coating plastics.</p>
    <p num="6">
      For ecological and economic reasons, the paint industry is seeking to replace the amount of organic solvents used in paints as far as possible by water.
      <br/>
      Aqueous coating compositions are already in use not only in the area of automotive line coating but also in the area of automotive repair finishes.
      <br/>
      In the area of plastic coating, too, it is increasingly desirable to use aqueous systems, not only in the area of primers but also in the area of topcoats.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Topcoats are understood to mean paints which are used for producing the uppermost paint coat.
      <br/>
      The uppermost paint coat can be a single-coat or multicoat system, in particular a two-coat system.
      <br/>
      Two-coat topcoats consist of a pigmented basecoat layer and a clearcoat layer applied on top of the basecoat layer, which clearcoat layer is unpigmented or pigmented only with transparent pigments.
      <br/>
      Nowadays two-coat paints are produced by the wet-in-wet method in which a pigmented basecoat is precoated and the resulting basecoat layer, without being subjected to a baking step, is overcoated with a clearcoat, and basecoat layer and clearcoat layer are then jointly cured.
      <br/>
      This method is very advantageous in terms of economics, but it makes high demands on the basecoat and the clearcoat.
      <br/>
      The clearcoat applied on top of the not yet cured basecoat must not dissolve the basecoat layer on the surface or interfere in any other way since this would lead to paints having poor appearance.
      <br/>
      This is in particular true of paints in which basecoats containing effect pigments (for example metallic pigments, in particular aluminum flakes, or nacreous pigments) are used.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In the area of plastic coating an additional requirement is that the resulting coatings should have high flexibility while exhibiting high moisture resistance (for example low permeability).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the coatings should have good appearance.
      <br/>
      This means that the coatings exhibit, for example, high gloss and that the coating compositions show good flow properties.
      <br/>
      Furthermore the coatings should possess good adhesion.
      <br/>
      In addition, component (I) of the coating composition should have a long shelf life.
    </p>
    <p num="9">In the area of plastic coating, an additional requirement is that the coating compositions used can be cured at low temperatures (in general below 100 (degree)  C.) and give films having the desired properties even when cured at these low temperatures.</p>
    <p num="10">
      DE-A-4,421,823 discloses aqueous polyurethane coating compositions consisting of at least three components where the component (I) contains at least one binder dissolved in organic solvent, which binder is selected from the group consisting of polyester resins, polyurethane resins, polyacrylate resins and, if desired, of further binders; component (II) contains at least one uncapped polyisocyanate as crosslinking agent; and component (III) is essentially free of binder and contains water.
      <br/>
      The coating compositions are prepared by mixing the three components a short time before applying the coating compositions.
      <br/>
      These coating compositions are used, in particular, in the area of automotive repair finishes.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      However, these coating compositions disclosed in DE-A-4,421,823 have the disadvantage that their preparation is quite expensive since three different components have to be stored and mixed with one another a short time before applying the coating compositions.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, this coating composition contains a binder component which has been predissolved in an organic solvent, this solvent being also present in the coating composition prepared from the three components.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Furthermore, DE-A-4,326,670 discloses aqueous two-component polyurethane coating compositions based on an aqueous dispersion of at least one binder having a number-average molecular weight of 1000 to 100,000 and containing groups which are reactive towards isocyanate groups, calculated on the basis of an OH number of 20 to 250 and an acid number of 10 to 100, the acid functions of which are at least in part neutralized, and of a polyisocyanate as crosslinking agent.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable binders include polyacrylate resins, polyester resins, polyurethane resins or (meth)acrylated polyester resins or (meth)acrylated polyurethane resins.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      DE-A-4,326,670 does not describe the use of a mixture of at least one polyester and at least one polyurethane resin and of at least one polyacrylate resin or an acrylated polyester and/or an acrylated polyurethane as binder.
      <br/>
      The coating compositions disclosed in DE-A-4,326,670 have the disadvantage that their shelf life is not sufficiently long.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide aqueous two-component polyurethane coating compositions which are suitable for coating plastic substrates, in particular in the area of the production of topcoats.
      <br/>
      The resulting coatings should have, in particular, high elasticity while exhibiting high moisture resistance (for example low permeability).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the coating compositions should meet the requirements usually demanded of coating compositions which are used for coating plastic substrates.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the coating compositions should, for example, also give coatings having good appearance (good gloss, good flow properties, and the like) and good adhesion.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, component (I) of the coating composition should have a long shelf life.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Finally, the coating compositions should be curable at low temperatures (in general below 100 (degree)  C.) and should give films having the desired properties even when cured at these low temperatures.</p>
    <p num="16">Surprisingly, this object is achieved by means of the coating compositions of the type mentioned at the beginning, wherein the mixing ratio of the polyester resin (A1) to the polyurethane resin (A2) is between 95 parts by weight of polyester resin: 5 parts by weight of polyurethane resin and 5 parts by weight of polyester resin: 95 parts by weight of polyurethane resin.</p>
    <p num="17">The present invention also provides a process for preparing these coating compositions and relates to the use of the coating compositions as topcoat or clearcoat and to their use for coating plastics.</p>
    <p num="18">It is surprising and was not foreseeable that the use of a mixture of at least one polyacrylate resin and/or acrylated polyester and/or acrylated polyurethane resin and at least one polyester resin and at least one polyurethane resin as binder would result in aqueous two-component polyurethane coating compositions which give coatings which, not only with respect to flexibility but also simultaneously with respect to moisture resistance, have improved properties compared with coatings prepared by using at least one polyacrylate resin and/or acrylated polyester and/or acrylated polyurethane resin and either at least one polyester resin or at least one polyurethane resin.</p>
    <p num="19">
      An additional advantage is that the coating compositions according to the invention result in coatings having good appearance and good adhesion.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, component (I) of the coating composition exhibits a long shelf life, and the coating compositions show good application performance.
      <br/>
      Finally, the coating compositions are curable at low temperatures (in general below 100 (degree)  C.) and lead to films having the desired properties even when cured at these low temperatures.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="20">Below, first the individual components of the coating compositions according to the invention are described in more detail.</p>

      <br/>
      It is preferred to use branched polyesters.

      <br/>
      The esterifiable derivatives of the abovementioned polycarboxylic acids, such as, for example, mono- or polyesters thereof with aliphatic alcohols having 1 to 4 carbon atoms or hydroxyalcohols having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, are also suitable.

      <br/>
      The polyether diols usually have a molecular weight Mn of 400 to 3000.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Furthermore, the diols used can also be aromatic or alkylaromatic diols, such as, for example, 2-alkyl-2-phenylpropane-1,3-diol, bisphenol derivatives having ether functionality, and the like.</p>
    <p num="31">
      Further suitable diols include esters of hydroxycarboxylic acids with diols where the abovementioned diols can be used as the diol.
      <br/>
      Examples of hydroxycarboxylic acids are hydroxypivalic acid or dimethylolpropanoic acid.

      <br/>
      Polyols having at least 3 OH groups can be used on their own or as a mixture.

      If desired, the triols can be used together with monohydric alcohols, such as, for example, butanol, octanol, lauryl alcohol, cyclohexanol, tert-butylcyclohexanol, ethoxylated and propoxylated phenols.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Suitable components (p4) for preparing the polyesters (A1) are in particular compounds containing a group which is capable of reacting with the functional groups of the polyester.
      <br/>
      Their modifying components (p4) used can be diepoxide compounds, if desired also monoepoxide compounds.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable components (p4) are described in DE-A-4,024,204 on page 4, lines 4 to 9.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Suitable components (p4) for preparing the polyesters (A1) include compounds which also contain, in addition to a group which is capable of reacting with the functional groups of the polyester (A1), a tertiary amino group, for example monoisocyanates containing at least one tertiary amino group or mercapto compounds containing at least one tertiary amino group.
      <br/>
      For details, see DE-A-4,024,204, page 4, lines 10 to 49.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Polyesters (A1) are prepared by the known esterification methods, such as described, for example, in DE-A-4,024,204, page 4, lines 50 to 65.</p>
    <p num="36">
      This reaction is usually carried out at temperatures of between 180 and 280 (degree)  C., if desired in the presence of a suitable esterification catalyst, such as, for example, lithium octoate, dibutyltin oxide, dibutyltin dilaurate, para-toluenesulfonic acid, and the like.
      <br/>
      The preparation of the polyesters (A1) is usually carried out in the presence of small amounts of a suitable solvent which is used as entrainer.
      <br/>
      Examples of the entrainer used are aromatic hydrocarbons, such as, in particular, xylene and (cyclo)aliphatic hydrocarbons, for example cyclohexane.
      <br/>
      However, another alternative is to prepare the polyesters in the absence of solvents (solvent-free reaction)
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Particularly preferably, the components (A1) used are polyesters which have been prepared by a two-step process by first preparing a hydroxyl-containing polyester having an OH number of from 100 to 400 mg of KOH/g, preferably of from 150 to 350 mg of KOH/g, and an acid number of less than 10 mg of KOH/g and a number-average molecular weight Mn of from 500 to 2000 Dalton which is then reacted in a second step with carboxylic anhydrides to give the desired polyester (A1).
      <br/>
      The amount of carboxylic anhydrides is selected such that the polyester obtained has the desired acid number.
      <br/>
      Suitable acid anhydrides are those which are usually used for this reaction, such as, for example, hexahydrophthalic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, pyromellitic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, camphoric anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, succinic anhydride and mixtures of these and/or other anhydrides and, in particular, anhydrides of aromatic polycarboxylic acids, such as trimellitic anhydride.
    </p>
    <p num="38">Apart from being reacted with carboxylic anhydrides, the acid groups can furthermore also be incorporated in the polyester by using dimethylolpropionic acid and the like.</p>
    <p num="39">
      The polyurethane resins (A2) used for preparing the coating compositions according to the invention include any polyurethane resins (A2) which contain water-soluble or water-dispersible hydroxyl groups and acid groups which can be converted into the corresponding acid anion groups and have an OH number of from 20 to 200 mg of KOH/g, preferably of from 80 to 180 mg of KOH/g, and an acid number of from 5 to 150 mg of KOH/g, in each case relative to the solid resin.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the polyurethane resins used are those having a number-average molecular weight Mn of between 1000 and 30,000 Dalton, preferably of between 1000 and 15,000 Dalton, and particularly preferably of between 1000 and 7500 Dalton, in each case measured against a polystyrene standard.
    </p>
    <p num="40">Suitable polyurethane resins are described, for example, in the following publications: EP-A-355,433, DE-A-3,545,618, DE-A-3,813,866, DE-A-3,210,051, DE-A-2,624,442, DE-A-3,739,332, U.S. Pat.

    <p num="41">The polyurethane resins which can be used in component (I) are those which are preparable by reacting isocyanato-containing prepolymers with compounds which are capable of reacting with isocyanate groups.</p>
    <p num="42">
      The isocyanato-containing prepolymers can be prepared by reacting polyols having a hydroxyl number of from 10 to 1800, preferably from 50 to 1200, mg of KOH/g with excess polyisocyanates at temperatures of up to 150 (degree)  C., preferably 50 to 130 (degree)  C., in organic solvents which are incapable of reacting with isocyanates.
      <br/>
      The equivalent ratio of NCO to OH groups is between 2.0:1.0 and &gt;1.0:1.0, preferably between 1.4:1 and 1.1:1.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The polyols used for preparing the prepolymer can be of low molecular weight and/or of high molecular weight and contain inert anionic groups or groups capable of forming anions or cationic groups or groups which are capable of forming cations.
      <br/>
      The additional use of low-molecular-weight polyols having a molecular weight of from 60 to 400 Dalton for preparing the isocyanato-containing prepolymers is also possible.
      <br/>
      The amounts of polyols used can be up to 30% by weight, preferably about 2 to 20% by weight, relative to the total amount of polyol components.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      To obtain an NCO prepolymer of high flexibility, a large amount of a predominantly linear polyol having a preferred OH number of from 30 to 150 mg of KOH/g should be added.
      <br/>
      Up to 970 by weight of the total amount of polyol can consist of saturated and unsaturated polyesters and/or polyethers having a number-average molecular weight Mn of from 400 to 5000 Dalton.
      <br/>
      The polyether diols selected should not introduce excessive amounts of ether groups since otherwise the polymers formed will be subject to swelling in water.
      <br/>
      Polyester diols are prepared by esterifying organic dicarboxylic acids or anhydrides thereof with organic diols or are derived from a hydroxycarboxylic acid or from a lactone.
      <br/>
      Branched polyester polyols can be prepared by using small amounts of polyols or polycarboxylic acids having a relatively high number of hydroxyl or carboxyl groups.

      The NCO prepolymer contains at least about 0.5% by weight of isocyanate groups, preferably at least 1% by weight of NCO, relative to solids.
