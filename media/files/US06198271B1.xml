    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to sensors suitable for locating objects positioned behind or within a volume of material, and in particular to a wall-stud sensor.</p>
    <p num="3">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,464,622, issued Aug. 7, 1984, discloses an electronic sensor for locating objects, such as wall studs, positioned behind wall surfaces.
      <br/>
      That sensor detects the edges of studs by measuring changes in the capacitance of a wall due to the presence or absence of a stud as the sensor is moved along the wall surface.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      That sensor includes capacitive plates, or elements, connected to circuits that detect changes in the capacitance of those elements.
      <br/>
      As the sensor is moved along a wall, any such capacitive changes are presumably due to changes in the dielectric constant of the wall; increased capacitance is generally associated with the presence of a wall stud.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      While this sensor works well to locate the edges of studs within most walls, experience has shown that its performance could be improved in several respects.
      <br/>
      For example, the precision with which that sensor locates a given stud edge depends upon various extraneous factors that affect wall capacitance, such as the thickness of the wall covering material, the dielectric constant of the wall covering material and the stud, the ambient humidity, and the temperature of the electronics within the sensor.
      <br/>
      Variances in some of these factors are compensated for by calibrating the sensor prior to each use by placing the sensor against the wall covering material at a place behind which there is presumed to be no stud.
      <br/>
      However, such calibration does not completely compensate for such variances.
      <br/>
      For example, changes in the thickness of wall covering thickness change the perceived location of stud edges.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the calibration may be erroneous if there is a stud adjacent or partially adjacent the sensor during calibration.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there is a need for a sensor that is easier to calibrate and less sensitive to variations in extraneous parameters that affect wall capacitance, particularly various wall thicknesses.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention is directed to an easily calibrated sensor that is relatively insensitive to variations in extraneous factors that affect wall capacitance.
      <br/>
      The sensor includes a comparison circuit connected to each of three capacitive elements.
      <br/>
      As the sensor is moved along a wall, the comparison circuit monitors the relative charge time of three capacitive elements, the charge times providing an indication of the relative capacitances of the three capacitive elements.
      <br/>
      As the sensor is moved along a wall, changes in the relative capacitances of the three elements will occur in the presence of a hidden stud as a result of changes in the dielectric constant of the wall.
      <br/>
      The comparison circuit uses differences in the measured relative capacitances of the first, second, and third capacitive elements to locate the stud.
      <br/>
      Finally, the sensor includes an intuitive "window" display that simplifies the task of locating a stud by providing a user with an image of the hidden stud as the sensor is moved over the stud.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a sensor 10 that may be used to locate a stud 12 behind a wall covering 14.
      <br/>
      To locate stud 12, sensor 10 is moved along wall covering 14 until sensor 10 provides an indication of wall stud 12.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Sensor 10 includes right, center, and left capacitive elements 16, 18, and 20, respectively.
      <br/>
      Capacitive elements 16, 18, and 20 are connected via respective lines VR, VC and VL to a comparison circuit 22 and an excitation source 24.
      <br/>
      In operation, excitation source 24 provides electrical charge to each of elements 16, 18, and 20, enabling comparison circuit 22 to compare the relative capacitive values of capacitive elements 16, 18, and 20.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the present invention, the relative capacitive values are used to determine the location and placement of stud 12 behind wall covering 14.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      It is known in the art that the presence of a dielectric increase capacitance by a factor k, so that the capacitance C of a capacitive element in the presence of a dielectric is expressed as:
      <br/>
      C=kCo  �1�
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      where CO is the capacitance of the element in the absence of a dielectric (e.g., adjacent a vacuum).
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a graph of capacitance (vertical axis) versus position (horizontal axis) for the capacitance values CR, CC and CL corresponding to the right capacitive element 16, the center capacitive element 18, and the left capacitive element 20, respectively.
      <br/>
      The arrow of FIG. 2 indicates that in use stud sensor 10 is moved by the user left to right over wall covering 14.
      <br/>
      The capacitive levels shown are taken with respect to a center line 22 of stud sensor 10.
      <br/>
      As stud sensor 10 is moved left to right, capacitive element 16 first encounters stud 12.
      <br/>
      Because stud 12 acts as a dielectric, capacitive value CR of capacitive element 16 increases as sensor 10 approaches stud 12, the maximum value of the capacitance CR occurring when capacitive element 16 is directly over stud 12.
      <br/>
      Subsequent to capacitive element 16 passing over stud 12, capacitive element 18 and, in turn, capacitive element 20 similarly pass over stud 12.
      <br/>
      Consequently, as shown in FIG. 2, the rise and fall of the capacitance values CR, CC and CL occur at different positions.
      <br/>
      As explained below, sensor 10 uses the relative magnitudes of capacitances CR, CC, and CL as sensor 10 is moved over stud 12 to determine the placement of stud 12.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      FIG. 3A is a block diagram of a portion of sensor 10, and in conjunction with FIG. 3B illustrates how the relative capacitance CC of capacitive element 18 is compared to capacitance CL of capacitive element 20 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3A, excitation source 24 includes an output terminal EXC that is connected to line VL via a resistor R1 and to line VC via a resistor R2.
      <br/>
      Comparison circuit 22 includes a pair of Schmitt triggers 30 and 32.
      <br/>
      Schmitt trigger 30 is connected via a line MVC to the clock terminal of a D flip-flop 34.
      <br/>
      Schmitt trigger 32 is connected via a line MVL to the D-input of flip-flop 34.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The output terminal Q of flip-flop 34 is connected to a control circuit 36 via a line DEC_L (for decrement left DAC).
      <br/>
      Control circuit 36 includes a first nine-line bus CNT_L coupled to the input terminals of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 38 and a second nine-line bus  DELTA CNT_L.
      <br/>
      DAC 38 has an output terminal connected to line VL via a resistor R3.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Note that DAC 38 is designated DAC_L, the first nine-line bus CNT_L, and the second nine-line bus  DELTA CNT_L.
      <br/>
      The common "_L" indicates that these components are associated with Left capacitive element 16.
      <br/>
      This labelling convention is used herein when referring to other components associated with the right (_R), center (_C), and left (_L) capacitive elements 16, 18, and 20, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      FIG. 3B is a timing diagram illustrating the operation of sensor 10 in two circumstances.
      <br/>
      In the first, depicted in the left side of FIG. 3B, the dielectric constants kc and kl of the materials adjacent is elements 18 and 20, respectively, are equal (e.g., when there is no stud adjacent either of elements 18 or 20).
      <br/>
      In the second circumstance, depicted in the right side of FIG. 3B, the dielectric constant kc of center element 18 is greater than the dielectric constant kl of left element 20 (e.g., when stud 12 is adjacent center element 18 only).
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Excitation source 24 outputs a periodic binary signal on line EXC that switches from a logic 0 (e.g., zero volts, or ground potential) to a logic 1 (e.g., five volts).
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the signal on line EXC is a 16 KHz signal having a duty cycle of 1/16.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Each time the signal on line EXC goes high, the voltage levels on lines VC and VL increase at a rate determined by the resistances of resistors R1 and R2 and the capacitances CC and CL of elements 18 and 20, respectively.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment of FIG. 3A, resistors R1 and R2 are equal, as are the areas of capacitive elements 18 and 20.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the voltage levels on lines VC and VL increase at the same rate in the absence of any difference between dielectric constants kc and kl.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, resistors R1 and R2 (and a similar resistor, not shown, corresponding to capacitive element 16) are each 220 K OMEGA , and each of capacitive elements 16, 18, and 20 have a length L of two inches, a width W of 0.66 inches, and are spaced apart a distance d of 0.01 inches.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As capacitive elements 18 and 20 charge, the respective voltages on lines VC and VL increase.
      <br/>
      Then, when the voltages on lines VC and VL exceed the threshold voltage Vth of Schmitt triggers 30 and 32, respectively, Schmitt triggers 30 and 32 output a logic one on their respective output lines MVC and MVL.
      <br/>
      Because dielectric constants kc and kl are equal, the outputs of Schmitt triggers 30 and 32 should go to logic one at virtually the same instant in time, as indicated by arrows 40 and 42.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Flip-flop 34 is a conventional positive-edge-triggered flip-flop 34.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the logic level on the D input (line MVL) is a logic one on the rising edge of clock terminal (line MVC), then output terminal Q of flip-flop 34 will go to a logic one.
      <br/>
      If, on the other hand, the input signal on the D input is a logic zero on the rising edge of the signal on line MVC, then output terminal Q will output a logic zero.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Because the signals on lines MVC and MVL are approximately coincident in the foregoing example, the output level on terminal Q of flip-flop 34 will be either a logic one or a logic zero.
      <br/>
      Further, over the course of many excitation cycles on line EXC, the output level on terminal Q of flip-flop 34 will be a logic one approximately 50% of the time.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Control circuit 36 averages the signal on line DEC_L over a number of excitation pulses (e.g., 64 cycles in one embodiment) to reduce the effects of noise.
      <br/>
      In the case described above in which the average count on line DEC is 0.5, control 36 maintains a relatively constant output count on bus CNT_L.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the resting (i.e. unexcited) voltage level on line VL is approximately constant.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, if the number of logic ones counted over 64 cycles is less than or equal to 28, than the average count is set to a logic zero; if the number of logic ones is greater than 28 and less than 36, the average count is left unchanged from the last cycle; and if the number of logic ones is greater than or equal to 36, than the average count is set to a logic one.

      So long as dielectric constants kc and kl remain equal, so too will capacitances CC and CL of respective elements 18 and 20.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, comparison circuit 22 will remain balanced as discussed above so that the count on bus CNT_L will remain approximately constant.
      <br/>
      The count required to maintain coincident rising edges for the signals on lines MVC and MVL is stored in control circuit 36 as a calibration count CAL_L.

      FIG. 3B depicts the circumstance in which the dielectric constant kc of center element 18 is greater than the dielectric constant kl of left element 20 (e.g., when stud 12 is adjacent center element 18).
      <br/>
      Because stud 12 increases the dielectric constant kc adjacent capacitive element 18, the capacitance CC of element 18 increases.
      <br/>
      As a result, the time required to charge capacitive element 18 to a level sufficient to raise the voltage on line VC above threshold voltage Vth of Schmitt trigger 30 increases.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The increased charge time of capacitance CC delays the time at which Schmitt trigger 30 is triggered (identified by arrow 44) to a time later than the time at which Schmitt trigger 32 is triggered (identified by arrow 46).
      <br/>
      Further, because the voltage on line MVC, which clocks flip-flop 34, transitions while the signal on line MVL is a logic one, the output signal on line DEC_L will necessarily be a logic one, as indicated by arrow 48.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The line DEC_L is so-called because a logic one on line DEC_L instructs control circuit 36 to decrement the count on bus CNT_L.
      <br/>
      By so doing, the output level of DAC 38 (and therefore the voltage on line VL) is decreased, as indicated by arrow 50.
      <br/>
      By decreasing the voltage on line VL the time required to ramp the voltage on line VL up to the threshold voltage Vth of Schmitt trigger 32 increases.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the next time excitation source 24 outputs a logic one on line EXC the signal on line MVL will transition to a logic one at a time closer to the transition on line MVC.
      <br/>
      This feedback will continue over a number of excitation-source cycles until the transitions on lines MVC and MVL are nearly coincident.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      If stud 12 were located adjacent the left capacitive element 20, the output voltage on line VL would require a longer time period to reach the threshold voltage Vth then would the voltage on line VC .
      <br/>
      Consequently, the rising edge of the signal on line MVC would occur before a logic one was present on the D terminal of flip-flop 34, and the output signal on line DEC_L would be a logic zero.
      <br/>
      A logic zero on line DEC_L causes control circuit 36 to increase the count on line CNT_L, thereby increasing the voltage level on line VL.
      <br/>
      An increased base voltage on line VL causes the signal on line VL to reach the threshold voltage Vth sooner than in the previous cycle.
      <br/>
      This feedback cycle continues until the voltage on lines VL and VC simultaneously reach the threshold voltage Vth.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the count on bus CNT_L required to provide coincidence between the transitions on lines MVC and MVL is established quickly using a conventional successive-approximation routine.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The above-described feedback continuously operates to maintain coincident rising edges for the signals on lines MVC and MVL.
      <br/>
      This condition may be referred to as "equilibrium." To maintain circuit 22 in equilibrium, the count supplied to DAC 38 on bus CNT_L must change to compensate for any change in the relative capacitances CC and CL of capacitive elements 18 and 20.
      <br/>
      Thus, the count on line CNT_L provides an indication of the relative capacitances CC and CL of capacitive elements 18 and 20.
      <br/>
      In particular, the calibration count CAL_L required to balance circuit 22 when capacitances CC and CL are equal is subtracted from the count on bus CNT_L required to balance circuit 22 when capacitances CC and CL are not equal.
      <br/>
      The resulting difference between the left calibration count CAL_L and the count on bus CNT_L is expressed digitally on bus  DELTA CNT_L (i.e.,  DELTA CNT_L=CNT_L-CAL_L).
      <br/>
      For example, if the calibration count CAL_L were 56 and a difference in dielectric constants kl and kc required 100 DAC steps on bus CNT_L to compensate for the difference, the binary data present on bus  DELTA CNT_L would represent 100-56=44 DAC steps.

      The circuit of FIG. 3A compares the relative capacitances CC and CL of capacitive elements 18 and 20 to maintain the left and center capacitive elements 20 and 18 in equilibrium.
      <br/>
      Other circuitry within comparison circuit 22 compares the respective capacitances CR and CC of right capacitive element 16 and center capacitive element 18 to similarly maintain the right and center capacitive elements 16 and 18 in equilibrium.
      <br/>
      Because each of right and left elements 16 and 20 are in equilibrium with center element 18, right and left elements 16 and 20 are also in equilibrium with respect to one another.
      <br/>
      This aspect of the invention is described in more detail with reference to FIG. 5.

      FIG. 4 graphically represents the number of DAC steps (vertical axis) required to maintain equilibrium between capacitive elements 16, 18, and 20 of FIG. 1 as sensor 10 is moved from 4 inches to the left of stud 12 (i.e., -4) to 3 inches to the right of stud 12 (i.e., 3).
      <br/>
      The line  DELTA CNT_R indicates the number of DAC steps required to maintain right capacitive element 16 in equilibrium with center capacitive element 18, while the line  DELTA CNT_L represents the amount of DAC steps required to maintain equilibrium between center capacitive element 18 and left capacitive element 20.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Beginning at -4, representative of when the center of stud sensor 10 is located 4 inches to the left of stud 12, each of lines  DELTA CNT_R and  DELTA CNT_L shows that the right and left capacitive elements 16 and 20 require zero DAC steps to achieve equilibrium.
      <br/>
      The zero DAC steps of the vertical axis in FIG. 4 is not an absolute value of zero.
      <br/>
      Instead, DAC 38 (and a similar DAC for right capacitive element 16) has provided the non-zero calibration count CAL_L on bus CNT during a calibration step: the DAC steps of FIG. 4 represent the number of steps above and below the respective calibration points for the right and left elements 16 and 20.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Referring to line  DELTA CNT_R, FIG. 4 shows that as the right capacitive element 16 approaches stud 12 the number of DAC steps required to maintain equilibrium increases.
      <br/>
      This requisite increase is due to the increased capacitance CR of capacitive element 16.
      <br/>
      At the same time, because capacitive element 18 (the center element) is also approaching stud 12, line  DELTA CNT_L shows that DAC 38 associated with left capacitive element 20 is decreasing.
      <br/>
      This decrease is not due to a decrease in the capacitance CL of left capacitive element 20, but is instead due primarily to an increase in capacitance CC of capacitive element 18.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Also shown in FIG. 4 is a line L+R (short for  DELTA CNT_R+ DELTA CNT_L) representing the sum of the DAC steps for the left and right capacitive elements 20 and 16, respectively.
      <br/>
      Interestingly, when the center capacitive element 18 is centered about an edge 54 of stud 12,  DELTA CNT_R and  DELTA CNT_L are equal in magnitude and opposite in polarity; consequently, the sum L+R is equal to zero when the center of sensor 10 is located above edge 54.
      <br/>
      The sum L+R is similarly equal to zero when the center of sensor 10 is located directly over edge 56.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      A fourth line of FIG. 4 depicts the ratio (L-R)/(L+R).
      <br/>
      Because the denominator L+R is equal to zero at each of edges 54 and 56 where L+R equals zero of stud 12, the ratio (L-R)/(L+R) is infinite at edges 54 and 56 where L+R equals zero.
      <br/>
      It has been found that this ratio is useful in identifying the presence of stud edges.
      <br/>
      Using the ratio (L-R)/(L+R) is advantageous because the ratio cancels out some dielectric variations.
      <br/>
      For example, changes in humidity or wall covering material can affect the left, center, and right capacitances CL, CC, and CR and will therefore affect the values of L and R; however, such changes will not affect the ratio (L-R)/(L+R).
      <br/>
      Consequently, sensor 10 may be calibrated whenever the dielectric constants kr, kc, and kl of the respective right, center, and left capacitive elements 16, 18, and 20 are equal, such as in air.
      <br/>
      This is preferable to prior art sensors that must be calibrated against each wall over which the sensor is scanned to compensate for variations in wall capacitance.

      However, separating the center capacitive element 18 into a pair of equally sized elements 18A and 18B, each having an area one half that of either element 16 or 20, moves the point at which the sum L+R is equal to zero.

      In one embodiment, the zero cross of line L+R is offset by a distance of approximately three-eighths of an inch.
      <br/>
      It has been found that this distance is consistent despite changes in capacitive variables such as humidity, wall thickness, or stud material.
      <br/>
      Hence, the offset is easily accounted for by adjusting the way the information of FIG. 6 is displayed.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the offset on either side of stud 12 results in a wider range over which the ratio (R-L)/(R+L) produces useful information.

      A sensor including circuit 80 functions substantially the same as sensor 60 of FIG. 5.

      <br/>
      This may be advantageous in some embodiments because transistor 84 is more easily integrated than are resistors R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5.

      In addition, the rate of change of the voltage on capacitive element 16 (dV/dt) is a constant in circuit 80 as compared with the configuration of sensor 60.

      Maintaining the charge rate constant renders a sensor less sensitive to shifts in the switching threshold of the Schmitt triggers.

      FIG. 12 is a flow chart illustrating the operation of microcontroller 66 in conjunction with the remaining circuitry of sensor 60.
      <br/>
      When sensor 60 is powered up (step 110), microcontroller 66 automatically performs a calibration sequence (step 120).
      <br/>
      During the calibration sequence, an operator holds sensor 60 in a position such that dielectric constants kr, kc, and kl of the respective right, center, and left capacitive elements 16, 18, and 20 are equal for a calibration period.
      <br/>
      For example, sensor may be held away from any wall or structure so that an air dielectric is provided for each of capacitive elements 16, 18, or 20.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the calibration period is approximately one second.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      During the calibration period, microcontroller 66 first sets each DAC 38,62 at half scale by writing the value 80 hex into each DAC 38,62.
      <br/>
      Next, microcontroller 66 cycles each DAC in a conventional successive-approximation routine starting with the most-significant bit.
      <br/>
      The nine-bit results for each DAC are then stored (step 124) as respective right and left calibration values CAL_R and CAL_L in registers within microcontroller 66.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Once sensor 60 is calibrated, the operator moves sensor 60 along a wall.
      <br/>
      Referring back to FIG. 11, as sensor 60 approaches stud 12,  DELTA CNT_R decreases.
      <br/>
      Microcontroller 66 monitors the value of L+R and, as long as L+R is less than four DAC counts (step 130) and  DELTA CNT_L&lt; DELTA CNT_R (step 150), provides a display corresponding to the value  DELTA CNT_R.
      <br/>
      To select a unique display pattern, the value  DELTA CNT_R is converted to a signal driving display 68, wherein each DAC count selects a different one of the twenty-eight possible display patterns.
      <br/>
      For example, when the absolute value of  DELTA CNT_R is one DAC count, display 68 illuminates the right-most one of elements 92, and when the absolute value of  DELTA CNT_R is two, display 68 illuminates the right-most two of elements 92.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      As sensor 60 is moved rightward, the value L+R eventually exceeds four DAC steps (see line 102 of FIG. 11).
      <br/>
      When L+R is greater than or equal to four DAC steps, microcontroller 66 used the value (L-R)/3 to select the appropriate display pattern.
      <br/>
      Finally, as sensor 60 is moved further to the right, the value of L+R will once again go below four DAC counts.
      <br/>
      This time, however, because  DELTA CNL_L is greater than  DELTA CNL_R, microcontroller 66 uses the value  DELTA CNL_L to select the appropriate display pattern (step 160).
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The values  DELTA CNT_R,  DELTA CNT_R, (L-R)/3, and  DELTA CNT_L are selected to control display 68 because they were empirically found to provide smooth transitions from one display pattern to the next as display 68 is passed over stud 12.
      <br/>
      Different sensors will require different treatment.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that one of ordinary skill in the art could program microcontroller 66 to provide appropriate display signals to display 68 in response to the aforementioned output signals.
