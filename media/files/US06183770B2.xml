  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to a carrier patch for the delivery of agents to the skin, a method of producing the carrier patch and a method for the use of the carrier patch.
      <br/>
      In particular, the invention is concerned with a carrier patch having an agent to be delivered to the skin, a method of applying the agent to the patch in a manner which is minimally deleterious to the agent, and a method of delivering agents to the skin using such a carrier patch.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Delivery of agents to the skin for local skin treatment may be desirable to improve the health and appearance of the skin.
      <br/>
      Skin conditions such as dry or oily skin, blemishes, abrasions, cuts or rashes, for example, require localized skin treatment to remedy the affected area and to prevent further skin damage.
      <br/>
      If skin conditions are not treated, further skin irritation may occur resulting in infections or damage to the skin.
      <br/>
      Thus, treatment of skin conditions improves the health and appearance of the skin.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Further, the skin may provide an ideal system for the delivery of agents to be active systemically.
      <br/>
      Although the skin is thought to provide the body with a protective covering, a number of agents are absorbable through the skin, and since the skin is a highly vascularized organ, the agents also penetrate into the circulating blood supply for distribution throughout the body, ultimately reaching the targets the agent is intended to affect.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Previously described methods for using patches for the local delivery of agents to the skin or systemic delivery via the skin employ a combination of the agent to be delivered with an adhesive used both to anchor the patch to the skin and as the medium by which the agent is delivered to the skin.
      <br/>
      However, the combination of the agent with the adhesive is disadvantageous for reasons including that some agents cannot be solubilized in the adhesive, the agent and adhesive when combined can each impair the effectiveness of the other, and the agent when combined with the adhesive can be heat inactivated by the thermal, chemical or mechanical actions used to cure adhesives.
      <br/>
      Thus, the combination of agent and adhesive prior to or during adhesive preparation for many agents would require a high concentration of the agent to be used in the combination such that an effective dose would remain after adhesive treatment has been completed.
      <br/>
      For some agents this is impracticable.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It is known to form sampler devices for cosmetics, wherein the device includes one or more plys.
      <br/>
      This is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,161,688 (Muchin) which is incorporated by reference herein.
    </p>
    <p num="6">There is a need to provide a carrier patch for the delivery of agents to the skin which minimizes the disadvantages of known systems.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The invention provides a carrier patch which has advantages over known systems for delivering agents to the skin.
      <br/>
      There is also provided a method for producing the patch and a method for delivering agents to the skin utilizing the carrier patch.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      According to the invention, there is provided a carrier patch for delivering agents to the skin.
      <br/>
      The carrier patch has a surface area for adhering to the skin and comprises a pad, having an upper and lower surface area, and an adhesive adhered on the lower surface area of the pad.
      <br/>
      A primary agent for delivery to the skin is applied to the patch in a manner such that the deleterious effects of the adhesive on the agent are minimized.
      <br/>
      Preferably no treatment of the adhesive is necessary after applying the agent.
    </p>
    <p num="9">In some embodiments, the agent is applied directly to discrete areas of the patch pad or adhesive.</p>
    <p num="10">
      In other embodiments, the patch includes one or more liners, secured to the pad lower surface by the adhesive.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment, the adhesive is used to carry the primary agent to the skin.
      <br/>
      Further, the primary agent can be applied to the adhesive in discrete locations.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Preferably, the primary agent is applied to the adhesive through apertures which are formed in a first liner, and further the first liner is selectively removable from the adhesive after applying the agent to the adhesive.
      <br/>
      The apertures in the liner effectively form a mask through which the agent is applied to the adhesive in discrete locations where the adhesive is exposed.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In some embodiments, the primary agent is applied to the lower surface of the adhesive.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the agent is applied to the upper surface of the adhesive.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In alternative embodiments, apertures can be formed through any portion of or the entirety of the depth of the patch material.
      <br/>
      The apertures can contain the primary agent to be delivered to the skin.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, where the pad contains apertures, the pad remains in place after applying the primary agent to the apertures.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the primary agent can be applied to a surface of the pad, without forming apertures in the pad.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In some embodiments, the primary agent is applied to the patch without the use of a first liner.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments, the patch can also include a cover, secured to the pad surface to seal the pad with the agent material adhered to the adhesive.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In yet other forms of the invention the patch can be embossed such that there are indentations for receiving the agent.
      <br/>
      The adhesive may exist at only discrete locations of the patch and may be of a nature that it is at the discrete locations that the agent is applied to the patch.
      <br/>
      In such situations the use of a liner as a mask may be optional.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The primary agent to be delivered to the skin is preferably therapeutic and may be a single agent or may consist of a combination of agents applied to the patch singly or as a mixture.
      <br/>
      The pad is a substrate which is preferably flexible.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The adhesive is any substance which holds the patch in contact with the skin.
      <br/>
      Preferably the adhesive is a polymeric adhesive composition, and more preferably a pressure sensitive adhesive.
      <br/>
      Further, the adhesive is selected to have a desired property of not interfering with the action of or the delivery of the agent to the skin and has the desired property of not requiring treatment which could be deleterious to the primary agent after the primary agent is applied.
      <br/>
      In such embodiments the adhesive is effectively cured and/or in its effective operational state or condition prior to applying the agent to the patch.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In some embodiments, the patch is further active in the removal of keratotic plugs from the pores of skin.
      <br/>
      Keratotic plugs are dead epidermal cells combined with sebaceous matter and dirt which form within skin pores, and result in conspicuously enlarged and/or darkened pores.
      <br/>
      If keratotic plugs are not periodically removed from the skin, not only do pores enlarge and darken, but further skin irritation may occur resulting in reddening blemishes or bacterial infections of the skin.
    </p>
    <p num="19">In some embodiments, the patch can contain a cosmetic composition, which may conceal the underlying skin condition.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The patch may be made in a variety of shapes.
      <br/>
      At least one of and preferably both of the pad and adhesive composition may be substantially transparent or clear, a flesh-like color or shade so as to effectively blend with the skin of wearer, or translucent.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the pad is effectively colored or rendered ornate or patterned on its surface.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The invention also provides a method for the use of the carrier patch to deliver agents to the skin.
      <br/>
      The method generally comprises obtaining a carrier patch, removing the liner to expose a surface of adhesive with agent to the skin, applying the patch with the adhesive and agent to the skin with the lower surface of the pad adhering to the skin through the adhesive, and subsequently removing the patch from the skin.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The invention also provides a method for producing the patch which generally comprises providing a material comprising a pad and an adhesive, the adhesive being in an effective operational state.
      <br/>
      Apertures are formed in relation to the patch thereby forming a mask effect such that discrete areas of adhesive are exposed and a primary agent is applied to the patch to adhere to the exposed adhesive.
      <br/>
      Excess primary agent is removed from the surface of the patch, and the patch, with adhered adhesive can be further processed or prepared for subsequent use.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="25">
      A carrier patch 11 delivers an agent 5 upon application of the patch 11 to the skin 1 of a user (FIG. 1a).
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1a there is shown a pad 9 without apertures, and adhered to the underside of the pad 9 is an adhesive 7 to which is adhered at discrete locations the agent 5.
      <br/>
      The agent 5 had been applied to the adhesive 7 through a mask technique as described further below, and at a time when any further treatment, if any, of the adhesive 7 was of a nature that it would not deleteriously affect the efficacy of the agent 5.
      <br/>
      The mask technique and pad 9 without apertures 113 is a particularly preferred technique for creating the invented patch.
      <br/>
      This embodiment is further illustrated in FIG. 2a.
    </p>
    <heading>CARRIER PATCH PAD</heading>
    <p num="26">The patch 11 includes a pad 9 having an upper surface area 12 and a lower surface area 13 and a peripheral edge 15; an adhesive 7 on the lower surface area 13 of the pad 9, and an agent 5 for delivery to the skin 1 of a user or patient.</p>
    <p num="27">
      The pad material which is useful for this invention is not particularly limited as long as it can provide a suitable substrate for the adhesive and is sufficiently strong to withstand removal from the skin, having been secured to the skin by adhesive.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments, the pad should provide a suitable substrate for the formation of apertures therein.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The pad 9 defines a depth 17, and the adhesive 7 defines a depth 19 (FIG. 1d).
      <br/>
      In some alternative embodiments, apertures 113 can be provided in the patch 11.
      <br/>
      These apertures 113 can be formed through a portion of or the entirety of the depth 17 of the pad and/or the depth 19 of the adhesive.
      <br/>
      The apertures 113 can contain the agent 5 to be delivered to the skin.
      <br/>
      Different cross-sections for the apertures 113 are possible in any one or more areas of the patch 11.
      <br/>
      Exemplary cross-sections are shown in FIG. 1e. Any one patch 11 would preferably have the same cross-sectioned shape of aperture 113 throughout.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Alternatively, the pad 9 and/or adhesive 7 may be of a material which is embossed, punched or otherwise configured to form a cavity therein, without the need to make a hole or aperture through the pad 9 and/or adhesive 7.</p>
    <p num="30">
      In some embodiments, the patch can include a cover 117, secured to the pad upper surface to seal the pad with the agent material (FIG. 4c).
      <br/>
      The cover may be formed of a clear plastic material, such as mylar, for example.
      <br/>
      Further, the cover may be adhered to the pad upper surface by an adhesive layer 8.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2d a portion of the cover 117 is broken away so that the adhesive layer 8 between the pad 9 and the cover 117 is shown.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The pad material is preferably flexible from the viewpoint of comfort.
      <br/>
      The flexibility is achievable by elasticity in any one or all axes of the material.
      <br/>
      Examples of flexible materials include, but are not limited to cotton cloth, rayon cloth, tetron cloth, nylon cloth or plastic foam.
      <br/>
      The pad material is preferably pliable to accommodate skin contours, when applied to areas of skin having alterations in surface angles (for example around the nostril skin area).
      <br/>
      The pad is preferably non-stretchable, namely non-elastic, in the planar axis of the material.

      The depth of the apertures 113 can extend through any portion or the entirety of the pad 9, adhesive 7 and/or liner 61 (FIG. 1d).
      <br/>
      Examples of the depth to which the aperture can extend include, but are not limited to, the liner only (when present), the adhesive only, the pad only, the liner and the adhesive, the adhesive and pad, or all of the liner, adhesive and pad.

    <p num="79">
      Where the agent is applied to the lower side 25 of the patch 11, a first liner 61 may be used on the adhesive 7.

      The apertures 113 can extend into the adhesive 7 and/or pad 9 (FIGS. 5b and 5c).
      <br/>
      After the agent 5 is applied to the apertures 113, the first liner 61 is removed and a second liner 63 can be applied to cover the adhesive 7 and agent 5 until the patch 11 is to be applied to the skin 1.
      <br/>
      Where the agent 5 is applied to the upper side 23 of the patch 11, the agent 5 can be added to the apertures 113, and a cover 117 added to the upper surface 12 of the pad 9, so as to seal the pad with the agent.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      The three dimensional shape of the apertures 113 in the pad 9 and/or adhesive 7 is not particularly limited as long as it can provide a suitable reservoir for the agent 5 to be delivered to the skin 1.

      Examples of the three-dimensional shapes the apertures can be include, but are not limited to, cylindrical, conical, pyramidal, spherical or cubical (FIG. 1c), as shown in the depth of the pad 9 for example.
      <br/>
      Further, apertures can be isolated shapes, or may be continuous in the form of channels, running parallel, or anti-parallel in the planar direction of the patch materials.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      The density of the discrete applications of the agent 5 to the patch is not particularly limited as long as the remaining patch materials are suitably effective in adhering to the skin 1 and suitably strong to withstand the removal of the patch from the skin having been attached to the skin by the adhesive.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments, the agent 5 can be located on about 100% of the surface area of the patch 11.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the density of discrete applications of agent 5 to the patch 11 is less than about 75% of the surface area of the patch 11.

    <heading>LINER</heading>
    <p num="84">
      In some embodiments, the patch 11 includes a liner 61 to aid in the application of the agent 5 to the patch to the adhesive 7 prior to use.

    <p num="85">
      The liner 61 is shown with apertures 113 through which the agent 5 is applied to the adhesive 7.
      <br/>
      There can also be a liner 62 without apertures used to protect the adhesive 8 prior to use.
      <br/>
      A liner 63 without apertures can be applied to the adhesive containing agent 5 after application of the agent 5 and subsequent removal of the liner 61.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      The liners 61, 62 and/or 63 are also preferably designed to facilitate removal of the liner from the pad by a user or during manufacture.
      <br/>
      Preferably the composition of the liner is such that any agent contained on the pad has a greater affinity for the patch adhesive and/or pad than the liner.
    </p>
    <p num="87">Examples of suitable liner materials include, but are not limited to bleached Kraft-Glassine paper, silicone coated on both sides, mylar or polyethylene.</p>
    <p num="88">
      The liner 61 is preferably designed to withstand the formation of apertures therein for the formation of a mask.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the liner is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      The approximate thickness can vary between the range of, but is not limited to about 1 mm to about 20 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The liner can be of the same dimensions as the pad, or may be of different dimensions than the pad to facilitate removal of the liner from the pad.
      <br/>
      Where the liner is of different dimensions as the pad, the liner can be larger in any one or all planar dimensions than the pad (FIG. 2b).
      <br/>
      Further, either where the liners are of the same dimensions or different dimensions as the pad, the liners 61, 62 and/or 63 can have lines of weakness, such as scores or perforations 95, so as to facilitate removal of the liner from the pad (FIG. 2c).
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      The liner 61, 62 and/or 63 may have dimples 215 formed therein by a mechanical process which changes the conformation of the liner material such that cavities are formed in the liner which extend out of the plane 213 of the remainder of the liner material (FIG. 9).
      <br/>
      Dimples 215 in the liner may be beneficial in minimizing or preventing surface contact between selected regions of the adhesive 7 or adhesive having agent 5 applied.
      <br/>
      By minimizing the surface contact between the agent and the liner, when the liner is removed from the patch, agent is more likely to remain adhered to the patch than to adhere to the liner.

      Adhered to the upper surface of the pad 9 is a cover material 117 and adhesive layer 8.
      <br/>
      On the lower surface there is an adhesive layer 7 and a first liner 61 covering the adhesive 7.
      <br/>
      Apertures 113 are punched through the patch material using a suitable punch or other die cutting tool well known in the art (FIG. 6b).
      <br/>
      The first liner 61 is then removed and discarded, leaving the adhesive 7 on the lower surface of the pad 9.
      <br/>
      A second liner 62 is affixed to the pad lower surface, so as to cover the apertures 113, thereby creating a plurality of retaining cavities for the agent 5.
      <br/>
      This embodiment results in no adhesive on the portion of the second liner 62 which covers the apertures (FIG. 6c).

      This embodiment results in an adhesive 7 on the portion of the second liner 62 which covers the apertures (FIG. 6d).
      <br/>
      In lieu of the step of forming apertures through the patch material and the application of the first liner 61, the pad 9 can be made of an embossable material which is embossed to form the retaining cavity.
      <br/>
      An agent 5 can then be placed on the upper surface of the patch material and a knife edge or squeegee-like tool 161 used to scrape or squeegee the primary agent across the upper surface causing the primary agent to be deposited in the apertures.
      <br/>
      Other means for depositing the agent 5 in the apertures 113 may be used without departing from the invention.
      <br/>
      Once the agent 5 has been deposited into the apertures 113, the first liner 61, along with any residue on the first liner, is removed from the upper surface of the pad 9.
      <br/>
      Thus, the first liner 61 acts as a mask or protector for the remainder of the upper surface of the pad to prevent the primary agent from coming in contact with the pad or adhesive layers when the agent 5 is being squeegeed across the top surface to deposit the agent 5 in the apertures 113 (FIG. 6e).
