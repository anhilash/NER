    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a composition comprising at least one olefin copolymer, which is soluble or dispersible in a fatty phase, and which is useful, in particular, for the cosmetic, dermatological, pharmaceutical and hygiene fields.
      <br/>
      More especially, the invention relates to a composition for the care and/or make-up of the skin, both of the human face and of the human body, the mucous membranes such as the lips and the inside of the lower eyelids, or the superficial body growths such as the eyelashes, eyebrows, nails and hair.
    </p>
    <p num="3">The composition of the invention as a product can be provided, in particular, in the form of a stick or a dish, such as lipsticks or lip balms, cast foundations, products for combating rings under the eyes, eyeshadows or face powders, in the form of a paste or cream which is more or less fluid such as liquid foundations, liquid lipsticks, eyeliners, make-up for the body, sun protection or skin coloring compositions, or mascaras, or in the form of free or compacted powders.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Background</p>
    <p num="5">
      Products for the make up or care of the skin or lips of human beings, such as foundations or lipsticks, generally comprise fatty phases such as waxes and oils, pigments and/or fillers and, optionally, additives, such as cosmetic or dermatological active principles.
      <br/>
      They can also comprise so-called &lt;&lt;pasty&gt;&gt; products, which have a supple consistency, which make it possible to prepare colored or colorless pastes which can be applied with a brush.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The use of waxes in formulations presents certain disadvantages.
      <br/>
      In particular, the degree of crystallinity of these waxes is difficult to control and the crystallites present are large in size.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the use of such waxes in compositions for application to keratinous substances such as the skin, lips and superficial body growths, in particular in cosmetic compositions, results in the applied compositions, and consequently the film applied, becoming matte in appearance.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      To overcome this problem, attempts have been made to use conventional polyolefins in place of waxes in cosmetic formulations.
      <br/>
      Here again, however, the degree of crystallinity is too high and is difficult to control.
      <br/>
      In addition, the size and the morphology of the crystallites, predominantly of spherulite type, are harmful to the production of compositions having the desired cosmetic properties, in particular of gloss.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Patent Application JP 65809 (assigned to the Company Shiseido), describes lipstick compositions comprising a siloxysilicate resin (with a three-dimensional network), a volatile silicone oil with a cyclic silicone chain and pulverulent fillers.
      <br/>
      Likewise, JP 62-61911, assigned to the Company Noevier, discloses lipstick, eyeliner and foundation compositions comprising one or more hydrocarbon-comprising waxes.
      <br/>
      WO 97/17362, assigned to Revlon, also discloses semimatte cosmetic compositions comprising a volatile solvent and an organosiloxane polymer emulsifier comprising at least one hydrophilic radical or portion and at least one lipophilic radical or portion.
    </p>
    <p num="9">These compositions have the disadvantage of leaving on the lips, after evaporation of the silicone oils, a film which becomes uncomfortable over time, i.e. a feeling of dryness and of tautness is experienced, dissuading some women from using this type of lipstick.</p>
    <p num="10">
      WO 96/36323, assigned to Procter &amp; Gamble, discloses mascara compositions of the water-in-oil emulsion type, which exhibit good hold and which exhibit resistance to water.
      <br/>
      These compositions comprise, inter alia, a water-insoluble polymer, generally known as a latex, in combination with a surfactant of the alkyl- or alkoxydimethicone copolyol type, hydrocarbon-comprising oils, pigments and fillers, as well as waxes.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      WO-A-96/10642, assigned to Revlon, discloses a glossy cosmetic composition comprising a polymer, which is an adhesive at room temperature, a volatile solvent, a non-volatile oil and a particulate dry material.
      <br/>
      The adhesive polymers are selected from polymers having a vinyl, methacrylic or acrylic backbone and pendant siloxane and fluorinated groups, polymers having a vinyl, methacrylic or acrylic backbone and pendant siloxane groups, and block or grafted vinylsilicone copolymers.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In addition, EP 0 497 144 and FR 2,357,244 disclose compositions comprising a styrene-ethylene-propylene block copolymer in combination with waxes, light or volatile oils and pigments.
      <br/>
      These compositions exhibit the disadvantage of not being very comfortable, of having indifferent cosmetic properties and of being difficult to formulate.
    </p>
    <p num="13">The need, therefore, remains for a composition which does not exhibit the above disadvantages and which has a more or less glossy appearance, depending on the wish of the consumer, which does not dry, over time, the skin or the lips on which it is applied and which does not cause discomfort.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">Accordingly, one object of the invention is to provide at least one olefin copolymer of controlled and moderate crystallization, which is soluble or dispersible in a fatty phase, in a cosmetic, dermatological, pharmaceutical or hygienic composition and, more pleasantly, a physiologically acceptable composition, which makes it possible to obtain a film of very good hold which is resistant to water while being very pleasant to apply and to wear throughout the day.</p>
    <p num="15">Another object of the invention is to provide such a polyolefin containing composition which, upon application, is supple, flexible and non-sticky.</p>
    <p num="16">Briefly, this object and other objects of the present invention as hereinafter will become more readily apparent can be attained by a composition for application to keratinous substances, comprising a liquid fatty phase and an effective amount of at least one copolymer which is soluble or dispersible in the liquid fatty phase which is selected from crystalline olefin copolymers having a degree of crystallinity of at most 50%.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="17">
      The present crystalline olefin copolymers having controlled and moderate crystallization exhibit crystallites having a specific size and specific morphology.

      They comprise few or no crystallites of the spherulite type with large dimensions but, in contrast, mainly crystallites of lamellar or the fringed micelle type with small dimensions.
      <br/>
      The crystallites preferably have a dimension of 1  MU m or less, preferably less than 500 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The present invention is, therefore, directed to a composition for application to keratinous substances comprising a liquid fatty phase, which comprises an effective amount and in particular at least 2% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the composition, of at least one crystalline olefin copolymer having a degree of crystallinity at most equal to 50% which is soluble or dispersible in the liquid fatty phase.</p>
    <p num="19">
      This composition is in particular a cosmetic, dermatological, hygiene or pharmaceutical composition.
      <br/>
      It, therefore, comprises ingredients which are compatible with the skin, mucous membranes and superficial body growths and more especially keratinous fibers.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      This composition preferably comprises, in addition, at least one coloring material.

      Another subject-matter of the invention is a composition which is provided in the form of a cast product and which comprises at least one cosmetic, dermatological, hygienic or pharmaceutical liquid fatty phase and optionally at least one wax which is solid at room temperature, characterized in that it additionally comprises an effective amount and better still at least 2% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the composition, of at least one crystalline olefin copolymer having a degree of crystallinity at most equal to 50% which is soluble or dispersible in the liquid fatty phase.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The present composition can additionally comprise ingredients which are compatible with the skin, mucous membranes and superficial body growths and more especially keratinous fibers, in particular at least one coloring material.</p>
    <p num="22">
      The olefin copolymer is present in an amount which is particularly effective in or is sufficient for producing a film with good hold and/or which is glossy and/or which is resistant to water.
      <br/>
      The crystalline olefin copolymer or copolymers of the invention can be any olefin copolymer, namely a copolymer comprising solely olefin units, having a controlled and moderate crystalline nature, that is to say a degree of crystallinity at most equal to 50%, preferably of 5-40% and most preferably 10-35%.
    </p>
    <p num="23">These copolymers are generally elastomers and can be synthesized by any known process, particularly by radical initiated polymerization, by Ziegler-Natta catalysis or by metallocene catalysis, preferably by metallocene catalysis.</p>
    <p num="24">The copolymers of the invention are solids (waxes or pastes) at room temperature (25 (degree)  C.).</p>
    <p num="25">The copolymerization can be carried out in bulk, in solution or in dispersion.</p>
    <p num="26">The crystalline olefin copolymers which are suitable in the present invention have a melting point of less than 150 (degree)  C., preferably  &lt;= 110 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="27">The crystalline olefin copolymers of the invention preferably have a weight-average molecular weight Mw of  &gt;= 30000, more preferably  &gt;= 40000 and a polydispersity index Mw/Mn &lt;= 3.5, more preferably  &lt;= 2.5, where Mn is the number average molecular weight.</p>
    <p num="28">The degree of crystallinity of the copolymers is determined, as is well-known, by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or by X-ray diffraction, for low degrees of crystallinity.</p>
    <p num="29">
      The preferred olefin copolymers of the invention include the olefin copolymers obtained by metallocene catalysis.
      <br/>
      Metallocene catalysis allows control of the copolymer properties relating to crystallinity, polymer chain length and distribution homogeneity of the units in the polymer chains.
      <br/>
      This catalysis allows polymer chains of dense compositions and almost the same lengths to be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      This synthetic route makes possible very good control of the molecular weights of the copolymers and results in polymers of low polydispersity (Polydispersity index &lt;= 2).
      <br/>
      It makes possible very good control of the incorporation of the comonomer in the polymer chains, which are very similar in chemical composition.
      <br/>
      For this reason, a very good control of the crystallinity is obtained, that is to say of the degree of crystallinity, of its reproducibility and of the nature and size of the crystallites formed.
    </p>
    <p num="31">For further details with regard to the advantages of this synthesis by metallocene catalysis, reference is made to the articles: Emerging Technologies in Polymer Science and Engineering, M. P. Zamora et al., Plastics Engineering, May 97, pages 75-79, and Classification of Homogeneous Ethylene-Octene Copolymers Based on Comonomer Content, S. Bensason et al., Journal of Polymer Science, Part B: Polymer Physics, Vol. 34, 130-1315 (1996).</p>
    <p num="32">In the olefin copolymers of the present invention, the crystalline structure varies according to the level of amorphous comonomer in the copolymer.</p>
    <p num="33">Thus, in the case of ethylene/octene copolymers, as described in the article by S. Bensason mentioned above, when the octene content increases, the following changes occur:</p>
    <p num="34">
      for a content of octene &lt;= 2.5 mol. %, a change to well-marked crystalline structures with the presence of spherulites, structures of lamellar type known as Type IV, and copolymers then exhibiting degrees of crystallinity of greater than 50%, occur;
      <br/>
      for octene contents of the order of 3 mol. %, a change to structures which are still highly crystalline and lamellar but with smaller spherulites (structure of Type III) and copolymers having a degree of crystallinity of 38-50%, occur;
      <br/>
      then, for octene contents of 5-6 mol. %, a change to less crystalline structures with very few spherulites and a mixture of structures as lamellae with "fringed micelles" (structure of Type II) and copolymers having a degree of crystallinity of 28-38%, occur;
      <br/>
      and, finally, for octene contents of 8-14 mol. %, a change to even more weakly crystalline structures which no longer comprise spherulites or lamellae but solely &lt;&lt;fringed micelles&gt;&gt; (structure of Type I) and copolymers having a degree of crystallinity of 10-28%, occur.
    </p>
    <p num="35">The copolymers recommended for the present invention are those having structures of Types I and II.</p>
    <p num="36">The excessively crystalline copolymers with a structure of Type IV are not suitable for the present invention.</p>
    <p num="37">The copolymer can be selected according to its properties and according to the subsequent application desired for the composition.</p>
    <p num="38">Thus, the polymer may or may not be able to form a film.</p>
    <p num="39">Another aspect of the invention is a composition as defined above comprising a volatile liquid fatty phase and comprising at least one active principle selected from cosmetic, dermatological, hygienic or pharmaceutically active principles.</p>
    <p num="40">The phrase "volatile fatty phase" is understood to mean any non-aqueous medium which can be evaporated from the skin or lips in less than one hour.</p>
    <p num="41">
      The volatile fatty phase comprises, in particular, oils or solvents having a non-zero vapor pressure at room temperature (20-25 (degree)  C.) and atmospheric pressure, ranging from 10-3 to 300 mm of Hg.
      <br/>
      Oil is understood to mean any non-aqueous substance which is liquid at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="42">Another aspect of the invention is the use, in or for the manufacture of a composition in the form of a cast product comprising at least one cosmetic, dermatological, hygienic or pharmaceutical liquid fatty phase and at least one wax, in particular one which is solid at room temperature, of a crystalline olefin copolymer having a degree of crystallinity at most equal to 50% and which is soluble or dispersible in the liquid fatty phase, which copolymer is present in an effective amount and in particular at least 2% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the composition, in order to prepare a film with good hold and/or which is glossy and/or which is resistant to water and/or to decrease, indeed eliminate, the transfer of the film deposited on the mucous membranes such as the lips, and/or on the skin.</p>
    <p num="43">Another aspect of the invention is the use, in or for the manufacture of a composition for application to keratinous substances comprising a liquid fatty phase and at least one ingredient selected from cosmetic, dermatological, hygienic and pharmaceutical active principles, coloring materials and their mixtures, of at least one crystalline olefin copolymer having a degree of crystallinity at most equal to 50% and which is soluble or dispersible in the liquid fatty phase, which copolymer is present, in particular, in an effective amount and, in particular, in an amount of at least 2% by weight with respect to the total weight of the composition, for producing a film having good hold and/or which is glossy and/or which is resistant to water deposited on the skin and/or mucous membranes such as the lips.</p>
    <p num="44">Still another aspect of the invention is a process for the cosmetic care of or for making up the lips or the skin which consists in applying, to the lips or the skin respectively, a cosmetic composition as defined above.</p>
    <p num="45">The copolymer can be dissolved in the fatty phase of the composition by heating the composition above the melting point of the copolymer.</p>
    <p num="46">The copolymer is advantageously provided in the form of particles which are dispersed and stabilized at the surface by at least one stabilizing agent.</p>
    <p num="47">
      One advantage of the use of a dispersion of particles in the composition of the invention is that the particles remain in the form of individual particles, without forming agglomerates, in the fatty phase, which would not be the case with inorganic particles of nanometric size.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of the copolymer dispersion is the possibility of obtaining very fluid compositions (on the order of 130 centipoise), even in the presence of a high level of copolymer.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Furthermore, it has been found that the compositions of the invention exhibit the quality of spreading over and of adhering to the skin, semi-mucous membranes or mucous membranes which are particularly advantageous, as well as are smooth and pleasant to the touch.
      <br/>
      These compositions additionally have the advantage of being easy to remove, in particular, with a conventional make-up removal milk.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      A first class of crystalline olefin copolymers which can be used in the compositions of the invention is  ALPHA -olefin copolymers, in particular of C2 -C16  ALPHA -olefins, preferably C2 -C12  ALPHA -olefins.
      <br/>
      These copolymers have, in general, a density (d) at room temperature (20-25 (degree)  C.) of 0.86 &lt;= d &lt;= 0.91, preferably 0.86 &lt;= d &lt;= 0.905. These copolymers are preferably bi- or terpolymers and very particularly bipolymers.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Suitable bipolymers for incorporation into the compositions of the invention include bipolymers of ethylene and a C4 -C16, preferably C4 -C12  ALPHA -olefin and bipolymers of propylene and a C4 -C16, preferably C4 -C12  ALPHA -olefin.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the  ALPHA -olefin is selected from the group of 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, 1-undecene, 1-dodecene, 3,5,5-trimethyl-1-hexene, 3-methyl-1-pentene and 4-methyl-1-pentene.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Of these monomers 1-butene and 1-octene are particularly preferred.
      <br/>
      The level of  ALPHA -olefin in the bipolymer generally ranges from 2-40 mol. %, preferably 3-30 mol. %, more preferably from 4-20 mol. %.
    </p>
    <p num="52">The recommended ethylene-octene bipolymers are plastomers which have an octene content of 5.2-6.2 mol. % and a degree of crystallinity of 28-38% and elastomers which have an octene content of 8-14 mol. % and a degree of crystallinity of 10-28%.</p>
    <p num="53">These bipolymers are synthesized by metallocene catalysis, and are sold by the Dow Chemical Company under the tradenames Affinity.RTM. (plastomers) and Engage.RTM. (elastomers).</p>
    <p num="54">Ethylene-butene bipolymers are sold by the Exxon Company under the tradename Exact Resins.RTM..</p>
    <p num="55">
      Suitable terpolymers for use in the invention include terpolymers of ethylene, propylene and C4 -C16,  ALPHA -olefins preferably C4 -C12  ALPHA -olefins.
      <br/>
      In these terpolymers, the contents of C4 -C16  ALPHA -olefin monomers are as shown above and the preferred  ALPHA -olefins are butene, hexene and octene.
    </p>
    <p num="56">Other suitable copolymers include those  ALPHA -olefin copolymers those disclosed in EP 081787.</p>
    <p num="57">A second class of olefin copolymers, which is suitable for compositions of the invention, includes the copolymers of ethylene, of propylene or of a cycloolefin, in particular the bipolymers.</p>
    <p num="58">The cycloolefin content in the copolymers is generally less than 20 mol. %.</p>
    <p num="59">Suitable cycloolefins which can be used include cyclobutene, cyclohexene, cyclooctadiene, norbornene, dimethanooctahydronaphthalene (DMON), ethylidenenorbornene, vinylnorbornene and 4-vinylcyclohexene.</p>
    <p num="60">
      The recommended copolymers of this class are the copolymers of ethylene and of norbornene.
      <br/>
      The norbornene content in these copolymers is generally less than 18 mol. %, in order to exhibit the required crystalline nature, and these copolymers are synthesized by metallocene catalysis.
    </p>
    <p num="61">Suitable ethylene/norbornene copolymers are sold by Mitsui Petrochemical or Mitsui Sekka under the tradename Apel.RTM. and by Hoechst-Celanese under the tradename Topas.RTM..</p>
    <p num="62">Other recommended ethylene/cycloolefin copolymers are the ethylene/cyclobutene and ethylene/cyclohexene bipolymers having a low cycloolefin content, generally less than 20 mol. %.</p>
    <p num="63">
      A third class of suitable olefin copolymers is composed of olefin copolymers of controlled tacticity, that is, copolymers comprising units of different tacticity.
      <br/>
      Suitable such copolymers of controlled tacticity include isotactic propylene/atactic propylene and syndiotactic propylene/atactic propylene copolymers.
      <br/>
      The iso- or syndiotactic units or blocks confer a crystalline nature on the copolymers, while the amorphous atactic units or blocks prevent an excessively high crystallinity of the copolymers and regulate the degree of crystallinity as well as the morphology and the size of the crystallites of the copolymers.
    </p>
    <p num="64">The content of iso- or syndiotactic units, which are the units which confer the crystalline nature to the copolymer is, therefore, predetermined in order to obtain the required percentage of crystallinity ( &lt;= 50%) in the copolymer.</p>
    <p num="65">The content of tactic units generally ranges from 10-80 mol. %. However, the content of tactic units preferably is less than 30 mol. %.</p>
    <p num="66">These copolymers are synthesized by metallocene catalysis.</p>
    <p num="67">A fourth class of suitable olefin copolymers is composed of copolymers of monoolefins and of monomers with (an) ethylenic bond(s), other than the monoolefins, such as dienes, for example, ethylene/butadiene, propylene/butadiene, ethylene/isoprene and propylene/isoprene bipolymers and ethylene/propylene/diene terpolymers, also obtained by metallocene synthesis.</p>
    <p num="68">The content of monomer units with (an) ethylenic bond(s), such as dienes, in the copolymer of controlled crystallization generally ranges from 3-20 mol. %.</p>
    <p num="69">
      In order to improve the crystallinity of the copolymer, it is possible optionally to add, to the composition of the invention, additives which hinder crystallization and promote the formation of small crystals.
      <br/>
      These additives, although used in a small amount, constitute numerous small germination sites uniformly distributed in the bulk of the material.
      <br/>
      These additives are typically crystals of an organic or inorganic substance.
    </p>
    <p num="70">In the case of an organic additive which has to crystallize, the latter must have a melting point higher than the melting region of the copolymer and should preferably form small crystals.</p>
    <p num="71">
      At a temperature greater than its melting point, this substance is preferably soluble in the mixture of the liquid fatty phase and of molten polymer.
      <br/>
      Thus, during cooling, the additive, initially dissolved, recrystallizes in the form of numerous small crystals well-distributed in the mixture and then the polymer recrystallizes, giving small crystalline domains because of the presence of the crystals of additives.
      <br/>
      This is a conventional technique for the recrystallization of polymers.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      It is also possible to adjust the degree of crystallization and the size and the morphology of the olefin copolymers of the invention by mixing a first olefin copolymer of the invention with a second crystalline polymer or copolymer partly compatible with the first olefin copolymer.
      <br/>
      The second polymer or copolymer can be an olefin copolymer of the invention, but with a different degree of crystallinity from that of the first copolymer, including a higher degree of crystallinity than the degree of crystallinity of the olefin copolymers of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="73">The second crystallizable polymer can also be a polymer which is different in nature, for example, a copolyethylene/vinyl acetate obtained by radical copolymerization or even a crystallizable polyethylene such as those commonly used in the cosmetics field.</p>
    <p num="74">For further details with regard to this method of adjustment of the degree of crystallinity, reference is made to the articles entitled: Elastomeric Blends of Homogeneous Ethylene-octane Copolymers, S. Bensason et al., Polymer, Vol. 38, No. 15, 1997, pages 3913-19, and Blends of Homogeneous Ethylene/octene Copolymers, S. Bensason et al., Polymer, Vol. 38, No. 14, 1997, pages 3513-20.</p>
    <p num="75">The liquid fatty phase in which the copolymer is dispersed can be composed of any cosmetically or dermatologically acceptable oil, normally a physiologically acceptable oil, selected in particular from carbon-comprising, hydrocarbon-comprising, fluorinated and/or silicone oils of mineral, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, alone or as a mixture, in so far as they form a homogeneous and stable mixture and in so far as they are compatible with the use envisaged.</p>

      These volatile oils are favorable for the preparation of films having total transfer free properties being obtained.

      After evaporation of these oils, a supple and non-sticky film-forming deposit is obtained on the skin or mucous membranes which follows the movement of the skin or lips respectively on which the composition is applied.
