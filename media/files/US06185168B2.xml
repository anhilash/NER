      <br/>
      A linearly polarized light beam emitted from a coherent light source reaches a polarizing phase plate and is thereby divided into a primary beam and a subsidiary beam having a polarized light component perpendicular to the polarized light component of the primary beam and a double-humped pattern, in which the center position coincides with the center position of the primary beam and the principal portion is equal in size to the principal portion of the primary beam.
      <br/>
      The primary beam and the subsidiary beam are focused onto an information storage surface of an optical disk and reflected therefrom, so that they are separated again through polarization separation and individually detected by first to third optical detectors.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a super-resolution optical head apparatus for optically reading information from an information storage surface with a light beam focused thereon.
      <br/>
      More particularly, it relates to a super-resolution optical head apparatus applicable to an optical head apparatus for optical disks, a bar-code scanner, and an image scanner.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The super-resolution optical head apparatus mentioned above comprises: a focusing means for focusing a coherent beam onto a fine spot on the information storage surface; and a photoelectric converting means for detecting the intensity of the beam reflected from the information storage surface.
      <br/>
      The above super-resolution optical head apparatus is equipped with various arrangements that have been devised to obtain a fine focal spot equivalent to or smaller than the diffraction limited.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      FIG. 20(a) is a schematic view showing the structure of a conventional image-forming optical system using an annular diaphragm, which is well-known as a super-resolution optical system, as a double diffraction optical system.
      <br/>
      Such a super-resolution optical system using the annular diaphragm or a phase plate has found applications in optical head apparatus, which are reported in the following documents:

    <p num="7">
      As shown in FIG. 20, a coherent beam emitted from a coherent light source 50 is turned into parallel-beams upon passing through a collimator lens (a first Fourier transform lens) 51.
      <br/>
      The resulting parallel beams are then allowed to pass through apertures 52a and 52b (slits in one dimension) of an annular diaphragm 52 and converged by an objective lens (a second Fourier transform lens) 53 so as to form an image, thereby providing a super-resolution spot having the intensity distribution I(X), which is shown in FIG. 20 as the power spectrum of the transmittance of the foregoing annular diaphragm 52.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The above document (1) discloses an optical head which forms such a super-resolution spot in one dimension and uses only the main lobe thereof obtained by means of knife-edges constituting a slit.
      <br/>
      The above document (2) discloses a system which uses a plurality of phase distributions and a specified amplitude distribution as the annular diaphragm in order to form a super-resolution spot in two dimensions, thereby suppressing the side lobes on both sides of the main lobe shown in FIG. 20(b).
      <br/>
      In the system, the conditions for designing the annular diaphragm are optimized to suppress the side lobes.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      However, the system for suppressing the side lobes by means of the annular diaphragm is not free from a reduction in intensity of the focused beam.
      <br/>
      In the case where the peak intensity of the focused beam is reduced to about 50% to 15%, e.g., if the half bandwidth of the main lobe is reduced to 85% of the diffraction limited, the intensity of the side lobe becomes about 7% of the peak intensity of the main lobe.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      As described above, if the aperture through which light is incident upon the objective lens is formed into a slit or an annularity, there can be achieved super resolution smaller than the diffraction limited with the side lobes suppressed to a certain extent.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, there arise the following problems: (1) since the quantity of light reaching an image forming plane is reduced significantly, the quantity of light in the main lobe is also reduced disadvantageously; (2) moreover, since the aperture for shielding the side lobes is provided a higher accuracy is required in adjusting the optical path, while the reliability of the apparatus is lowered because the components of the optical system deteriorate with the passage of time or for other reasons; and (3) furthermore, the half bandwidth of the beam is reduced to about 90% to 80% at most.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to provide a super-resolution optical head apparatus with extremely high performance wherein a simple optical system prevents a significant reduction in the quantity of light and the beam width of the diffraction limited can be reduced to about 70%.</p>
    <p num="12">
      To attain the above object, in a first super-resolution optical head apparatus of the present invention, a primary beam having a peak intensity in the center thereof and a subsidiary beam having peak intensities at least on both sides of the center thereof, both having equal-sized principal portions, are incoherently superimposed upon each other and focused onto an information storage surface and the light beam reflected from the information storage surface is separated into the primary beam and the subsidiary beam such that the light intensities thereof are differentially detected, thereby implementing a super-resolution optical system.
      <br/>
      Here it mean by "super resolution that the spatial frequency response of optical scanning system is increased.
      <br/>
      It will become apparent that the cross-talk cancelling effect of the present invention is also greatly appreciated.
    </p>
    <p num="13">The first super-resolution optical head apparatus comprises: a first coherent light source for emitting a first coherent beam serving as a primary beam; a second coherent light source for emitting a second coherent beam which has either a plane of polarization perpendicular (orthogonal) to a plane of polarization of the first coherent beam or a wavelength different from a wavelength of the first coherent beam; a phase plate for receiving the second coherent beam and emitting a subsidiary beam which has an intensity distribution in which peak values are placed at least on both sides of a center thereof on a plane perpendicular to an optical axis and a principal portion thereof is equal in size to a principal portion of the primary beam; a focusing means for superimposing the primary beam emitted from the first coherent light source and the subsidiary beam emitted from the phase plate upon each other and focusing them onto an information storage surface having an optical information storage carrier; a control means for controlling the focusing means such that a light beam composed of the primary beam and the subsidiary beam being superimposed upon each other performs focusing and tracking with respect to the optical information storage carrier of the information storage surface; a light separating means for receiving the light beam reflected from the information storage surface, separating the light beam into the primary beam and the subsidiary beam through polarization separation or wavelength separation, and emitting them; an optical detecting means for individually detecting an intensity of the primary beam and an intensity of the subsidiary beam and outputting a light intensity signal; and a calculating means for calculating, based on the light intensity signal outputted from the optical detecting means, a super-resolution scanning signal and outputting it.</p>
    <p num="14">
      With the first super-resolution optical-head apparatus, the primary beam has the normal Airy-disc pattern or has a peak intensity on the optical axis.
      <br/>
      On the focal plane, the principal portion of the subsidiary beam connected with a dipped profile or a trough has a beam size equal to about 70% of that of the primary beam.
      <br/>
      The subsidiary beam has a principal portion equal, or almost equal, in size to that of the primary beam and has a double-humped intensity distribution with peak values placed at least on both sides of the center thereof.
      <br/>
      The subsidiary beam having the double-humped intensity distribution can easily be generated by means of a stepped phase plate which imparts a relative phase difference varying from 0 to  PI  with the wavelength of the light transmitted thereby.
      <br/>
      By irradiating the phase plate with the subsidiary beam having substantially the same intensity distribution as the primary beam, substantially the same intensity distribution as provided in the peripheral portion of the primary beam can be provided in the peripheral portion of the double-humped beam.
      <br/>
      Such waveform shaping for a beam can be performed by optimizing the diameter of an aperture through which the primary and subsidiary beams pass.
      <br/>
      Slight difference in the sizes of the respective principal portions may slightly deteriorate the cross-talk cancelling effect of the present invention, which, however is a matter of designing the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The primary beam and subsidiary beam are incoherently superimposed upon each other and focused onto the information storage surface.
      <br/>
      The plane to be scanned, which is the information storage surface, is scanned with a light beam obtained by incoherently superimposing the primary beam and subsidiary beam upon each other, while the primary beam forms a beam profile having the Airy-disc pattern or having a peak intensity in the center thereof.
      <br/>
      The light beam obtained by superimposing the primary beam and subsidiary beam on the information storage surface is reflected by the information storage surface and then separated into the primary and subsidiary beams again by utilizing the fact that they have planes of polarization perpendicular to each other or wavelengths different from each other, so that the intensities thereof are detected individually.
      <br/>
      The detected light; intensities are differentially calculated, so that an output signal equivalently scanned as a difference in intensity distribution between the primary beam and the subsidiary beam is obtained.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a super-resolution optical signal can surely be obtained with ease.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Consequently, with the first super-resolution optical head apparatus, the resolving power of the optical system surpasses the diffraction limited of the objective lens in use, thereby equivalently implementing about 70% of the beam width.</p>
    <p num="17">A second super-resolution optical head apparatus according to the present invention implements a super-resolution optical system by using a holographic optical element in place of the phase plate of the first super-resolution optical head apparatus.</p>
    <p num="18">The second super-resolution optical head apparatus according to the present invention comprises: a first coherent light source for emitting a first coherent beam serving as a primary beam; a second coherent light source for emitting a second coherent beam which has either a plane of polarization perpendicular to a plane of polarization of the first coherent beam or a wavelength different from a wavelength of the first coherent beam: a holographic optical element for receiving the second coherent beam and emitting a subsidiary beam which has an intensity distribution in which peak values are placed at least on both sides of a center thereof on a plane perpendicular to an optical axis and a principal portion thereof is equal in size to a principal portion of the primary beam; a focusing means for superimposing the primary beam emitted from the first coherent light source and the subsidiary beam emitted from the holographic optical element upon each other and focusing them onto an information storage surface having an optical information storage carrier; a control means for controlling the focusing means such that a light beam composed of the primary beam and the subsidiary beam being superimposed upon each other performs focusing and tracking with respect to the optical information storage carrier of the information storage surface; a light separating means for receiving the light beam reflected from the information storage surface, separating the light beam into the primary beam and the subsidiary beam through polarization separation or wavelength separation, and emitting them; an optical detecting means for individually detecting an intensity of the primary beam and an intensity of the subsidiary beam and outputting a light intensity signal; and a calculating means for calculating, based on the light intensity signal outputted from the optical detecting means, a super-resolution scanning signal and outputting it.</p>
    <p num="19">
      In the second super-resolution optical head apparatus, the primary beam has the normal Airy-disc pattern or has a peak intensity on the optical axis.
      <br/>
      On the information storage surface, the principal portion of the subsidiary beam reproduced from the holographic optical element has a beam size equal to the half bandwidth of the primary beam.
      <br/>
      Peak intensities are formed at least on both sides of the center of the subsidiary beam.
      <br/>
      The primary beam and subsidiary beam are incoherently superimposed upon each other and focused onto the information storage surface.
      <br/>
      The light beam obtained by superimposing the primary beam and subsidiary beam on the information storage surface is reflected thereby and separated into the primary beam and subsidiary beam through polarization or wavelength separation so that the intensities thereof are detected individually.
      <br/>
      The detected light intensities are differentially calculated, so that an output signal equivalently scanned as a difference in intensity distribution between the primary beam and the subsidiary beam is obtained.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a super-resolution optical signal can surely be obtained with ease.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      With the second super-resolution optical head apparatus, the subsidiary beam can be generated by the holographic optical element functioning as a phase plate.
      <br/>
      Even though complicated procedures are required in the process of fabricating a phase plate, the apparatus needs the provision of only one phase plate, so that the holographic optical elements can be manufactured on an industrial scale and used.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, it is also possible to use a technique of computer-generated hologram whereby a phase plate is designed on a computer without actually being fabricated, so that flexibility in designing and fabrication is enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="21">In the first or second super-resolution optical head apparatus, the phase plate is preferably divided into N (N is an integer equal to or more than 2) regions around a center thereof, the N regions imparting a relative phase difference advancing stepwise in the sequence of 0, 2 PI /N, (2 PI /N) * 2, (2 PI /N) * 3, . . . , and (2 PI /N) * (N-1) to the second coherent beam emitted from the second coherent light source, and preferably emits, as the subsidiary beam, the second coherent beam passing through the N regions.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Thus, by using the polarizing phase plate symmetrical with respect to the axis, the light beam obtained by superimposing the primary beam and the subsidiary beam, which has peek intensities around the center thereof and which is coaxial with the primary beam, is focused on the information storage surface.
      <br/>
      The light beam reflected from the information storage surface is subjected to polarization separation into the primary beam and subsidiary beam so that the intensities thereof can be detected individually.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a super-resolution optical signal equivalent to the signal obtained in the case of using a circular beam thinner than the diffraction limited can be provided steadily.
      <br/>
      As a result, the super-resolution optical system, which is equivalent in performance to the super-resolution optical scanning system symmetrical with respect to the axis, can be implemented easily and stably with much advantage.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In the first or second super-resolution optical head apparatus, the phase plate is preferably provided integrally with the second coherent light source, the phase plate being in a position close to the second coherent light source with a spacing interposed therebetween or in direct contact with the second coherent light source.
      <br/>
      With the arrangement, the subsidiary beam can be provided steadily with the simple structure, so that the super-resolution optical signal, which is simple as well as compact, can be obtained with steadiness.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In the first or second super-resolution optical head apparatus, the first and second coherent light sources are preferably composed of a pair of linearly polarized laser beams disposed so as to have their planes of polarization perpendicular to each other.
      <br/>
      The pair of linearly polarized laser beams having their planes of polarization perpendicular to each other are incoherent to each other, so that the primary and subsidiary beams can have planes of polarization perpendicular to each other by simply establishing a specified positional relationship between the light emitting surfaces of the pair of linearly polarized laser beams, thereby easily implementing the super-resolution optical head apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In the first, or second super-resolution optical head apparatus, the light separating means is preferably composed of a substrate having a uniaxially anisotropic refractive index and a polarizing holographic optical element or a polarizing diffraction grating formed on the substrate, the light separating means being a polarization separating means for separating the light beam into the primary beam and the subsidiary beam through polarization separation.
      <br/>
      Since the holographic optical element or polarizing diffraction grating changes a majority of the energy component of one of the polarized primary and subsidiary beams into a  +- first-order diffracted beam, while transmitting the other of the polarized primary and subsidiary beams as a zero-order diffracted beam, the light intensities of the primary and subsidiary beams can be detected by spatially separating the two beams with reliability.
      <br/>
      As a result, a more compact super-resolution optical system can be implemented at lower cost than in the case where a polarizing beam splitter is used.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In the first or second super-resolution optical head apparatus, the light separating means is preferably composed of a multilayer dielectric filter, the light separating means being a wavelength separating means for separating the light beam into the primary beam and the subsidiary beam through wavelength separation.
      <br/>
      Since the multilayer dielectric filter functions as a narrow bandpass filter, two wavelengths having a small difference therebetween can efficiently be separated from each other and detected due to the transmittance characteristic of the narrow-band pass filter and to the reflectance characteristic opposite to the transmittance characteristic, so that the primary and subsidiary beams having different wavelengths can be separated from each other through wavelength separation and the intensities thereof can be detected with reliability.

      With the fifth super-resolution optical head apparatus, the primary beam and subsidiary beam having their planes of polarization perpendicular (orthogonal) to each other can be obtained from the coherent beam emitted from the single coherent light source.
      <br/>
      The principal portions of the primary beam and subsidiary beam are substantially equal in size to each other.
      <br/>
      The primary beam has a peak intensity on the optical axis thereof, while the subsidiary beam has peak intensities on both sides of the center thereof.
      <br/>
      In an outward trip, the primary beam and subsidiary beam are incoherently superimposed upon each other and focused onto the information storage surface.
      <br/>
      The light beam obtained by superimposing the primary and subsidiary beams on the information storage surface is reflected therefrom and diffracted, in a return trip, by a holographic optical element off the optical axis and then separated by the polarization separating means through polarization separation, so that their intensities are detected individually.
      <br/>
      By differentially calculating the respective detected intensities, an output signal scanned equivalently as an output signal scanned as a difference in intensity distribution between the primary beam and the subsidiary beam can be obtained, so that the super-resolution signal can easily be obtained with reliability.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In the fifth super-resolution optical head apparatus, since the single coherent light source and the optical detector are provided on the same plane, it can easily be assembled and adjusted, while exhibiting excellent stability to secular changes in the optical configuration, temperature changes, and mechanical changes.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since the focusing means is formed integrally with the holographic optical element, the super-resolution optical head apparatus can be implemented by a compact and simple optical system.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="43">(First Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="44">FIG. 1 schematically shows the structure of a super-resolution optical head apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="45">
      As shown in FIG. 1, a light beam is emitted from a coherent light source 100 composed of a semiconductor laser.
      <br/>
      After sequentially passing through a collimator lens 101, an aperture 102, and a condenser lens 103, the light beam illuminates a polarizing phase plate 104 and is divided thereby into a primary beam and a subsidiary beam having their planes of polarization perpendicular (orthogonal) to each other.
      <br/>
      After sequentially passing through a collimator lens 105 and an aperture 106, the resulting primary beam and subsidiary beam are reflected by a mirror 107 and have their directions changed by a beam splitter 108, so that they are focused onto an information storage surface 110a of an optical disk 110, in which information is stored in the form of pits, by an objective lens 109.
      <br/>
      The primary beam and subsidiary beam reflected from the information storage surface 110a are turned into parallel beams again by the objective lens 109 and travel in straight lines through the beam splitter 108.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the primary beam 130 is diffracted by a polarizing holographic optical element 111, which will be described later, and focused by a condenser lens 112 so as to reach a first optical detector 113a and a third optical detector 113c.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the subsidiary beam 131 is also focused by the condenser lens 112 so as to reach a second optical detector 113b.
      <br/>
      The first to third optical detectors 113a to 113c constitute an integrated optical detecting unit 113, the structure of which will be described later in greater detail.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Electric signals outputted from the first and third optical detectors are synthesized and then amplified by a first amplifier 115, while an electric signal outputted from the second optical detector 113b is amplified by a second amplifier 116.
      <br/>
      Output signals from the first and second amplifiers 115 and 116 are calculated by a differential calculator 117.
    </p>
    <p num="47">In FIG. 1, a reference numeral 118 designates an electromagnetic driving means (a voice-coil-type actuator); 119 designates a calculating means for calculating a focusing error signal and a tracking error signal; and 120 designates a driving unit for driving the electromagnetic driving means 118 in response to an output signal from the calculating means 119.</p>
    <p num="48">The first embodiment is characterized by the structure of a beam-shaping optical-system unit 121, which enables easy and stable formation of the subsidiary beam equal in size to the primary beam and having an intensity distribution substantially equal to the primary beam in the peripheral portion, except in the central portion.</p>
    <p num="49">An effect peculiar to the first embodiment is as follows: since the primary beam and subsidiary beam are formed from the light beam emitted from the single coherent light source 100, the intensity of the primary beam is equal to that of the subsidiary beam on the periphery of the main lobe, in contrast to the case where the primary beam and subsidiary beam are formed by means of separate semiconductor lasers and separate optical systems, so that a stable scanning optical system free from the displacements of the optical axes can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="50">
      Normally, the semiconductor laser composing the coherent light source 100 is a commercially available light source, which emits a linearly polarized beam in a single transverse mode.
      <br/>
      In the first embodiment, the plane of polarization is set at an angle of about 45 (degree)  with respect to the paper face.
      <br/>
      With the setting, components obtained by multiplying the amplitude of linearly polarized light by sin 45 (degree)  exist as polarized light components in the direction parallel to the paper face and in the direction perpendicular to the paper face.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the crystal axis of the polarizing phase plate 104 (see FIG. 11(e)) is set such that the Z-Y plane thereof coincides with the paper face, thereby forming the primary beam (ordinary ray) 130 and the subsidiary beam (extraordinary ray) 131.
      <br/>
      In the first embodiment, the polarizing phase plate 140 can be composed of a plate having phase regions, which will be described later with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10. The first embodiment generally provides a two-dimensional super-resolution optical head apparatus which is remarkably stable.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In the first embodiment, even when the aperture 102 is slightly reduced in size so that the beam size on the polarizing phase plate 104 surpasses 1.5 times the beam size of the diffraction limited of the objective lens 109, the effect of the first embodiment is not particularly changed.
      <br/>
      This is because, as is clear from the principle of the present invention, the main lobes of the primary beam and subsidiary beam have the same profile except in the central portion and, even if a slight difference exists therebetween, the intensity of the primary beam and that of the subsidiary beam are offset by differential detection.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      FIGS. 2(a) and 2(b) are for diagrammatically illustrating the intensity distributions of the primary beam 130 and of the subsidiary beam 131 on the information storage surface in the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2(a), an XS -axis is provided across the polarizing phase plate 104 for the purpose of illustrating the principle of super-resolution of the present invention by using a simple one-dimensional model.
      <br/>
      Here, it is assumed that the primary beam 130 is also incident upon the XS -axis and has the same beam waist diameter W1 as the subsidiary beam 131.
      <br/>
      The collimator lens 105 in FIG. 1 corresponds to a first convex lens 150 in FIG. 2(a).
      <br/>
      The objective lens 109 in FIG. 1 corresponds to a second convex lens 151 in FIG. 2(a).
      <br/>
      The first aperture 106 in FIG. 1 corresponds to an aperture 152 in FIG. 2(a).
      <br/>
      However, the diameter W1 of a light beam at a wavelength  LAMBDA  is set approximately 1.5 times as large as the beam diameter WR (WR is approximately equal to  LAMBDA /(N * A)= LAMBDA /sin ALPHA 1) of the diffraction limited for the diameter D of the aperture 152.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The first and second convex lenses 150 and 151 are Fourier transform lenses, which satisfy the following simultaneous equations of
      <br/>
      f1 * sin  ALPHA 1 =f2 * sin  ALPHA 2 =D/2  (1)
    </p>
    <p num="54">In this case, the principal portion of the intensity distribution 160 of the primary beam 130 is equal in size to that of the intensity distribution 161 of the subsidiary beam 131 on the X0 -axis in an image forming plane, which becomes W2 (W2 is approximately equal to (f2 /f1) * W1).</p>
    <p num="55">
      The polarizing phase plate 104 is a substrate having the phase boundary with a difference in level d1, which imparts, on the optical axis, a phase difference  PI  to a specified polarized light component, and having a refractive index n with respect to the light beam at the wavelength  LAMBDA , which satisfies the equation of (n-1) * d  LAMBDA /2.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the intensity distribution 161 of the subsidiary beam 131 mentioned above can be obtained as a result of the overlapping of two wavefronts 162 and 163 having amplitude distributions in opposite phases on the X0 -axis.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2(b), only that portion of the subsidiary beam 131 which is depressed in the vicinity of the optical axis remains as a difference Id (x0) between the intensity distribution 161 of the subsidiary beam 131 and the intensity distribution 160 of the primary beam 130 and the full width half maximum g0 becomes about 70% of the full width maximum gg of the diffraction limited in size.
    </p>
    <p num="56">As described earlier, the above principle of super-resolution is implemented by an integrated detecting unit 113 consisting of the first to third detectors 113a, 113b, and 113c for detecting the intensities of the primary and subsidiary beams 130 and 131 and by a signal processing unit 114.</p>
    <p num="57">
      FIG. 3 diagrammatically shows a variation which is an optical system similar to the optical system shown in FIG. 2 but which can be analytically handled for easy understanding.
      <br/>
      The optical system of FIG. 3 is different from that of FIG. 2 in that the subsidiary beam 131 is given by two points 170 and 171 which are apart from each other by a distance  DELTA =( LAMBDA  * f1)/D.
      <br/>
      The diffraction images corresponding to the two points 170 and 171 on the X0 -axis constitute the amplitude distributions 173 and 174 of the diffraction limited via the rectangular aperture 152, which are different in phase by  PI .
      <br/>
      The centers of the amplitude distributions 173 and 174 are apart from each other by  DELTA 1 = DELTA  * (f2 /f1).
      <br/>
      Since the distances  DELTA  and  DELTA 1 are set such that one amplitude becomes 0 in the peak position of the other, the intensity distribution 175 as shown in FIG. 3 can be obtained.
      <br/>
      If analytically shown, the complex amplitude distribution u1 (X0) of a double-humped beam obtained as the subsidiary beam 131 on the X0 -axis becomes  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      and the intensity distribution I(X0) becomes
      <br/>
      I(X0 =.vertline.u1 (X0).vertline.2  (3)
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      In the foregoing equation (2),
      <br/>
      sincX=(sinX)/X  (4)
    </p>
    <p num="60">is satisfied.  (Equation image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="61">
      concerns the resolving power of an optical head having a numerical aperture of sin ALPHA 2, which corresponds to the criterion of Rayleigh (in general, the minimum separation of two adjacent points that can be resolved).
      <br/>
      A description will be given later to an expansion into two dimensions.
      <br/>
      In that case, the Bessel function of the first kind J1 (r) is used instead of the sinc function to represent the amplitude and intensity distributions of the Airy pattern.
      <br/>
      The amplitude distribution of the Airy pattern which is formed on an optical axis through a circular aperture is represented by
      <br/>
      u(r)=(2 PI (D/2)2 * J1 (R))/R  (6)
    </p>
    <p num="62">where r is a distance from the center of the optical axis and R is given by R=( PI  * D * r)/( LAMBDA  * f2).</p>
    <p num="63">
      The size of a main lobe termed the Airy disk is given by
      <br/>
      A=2 * 1.22 * ( LAMBDA  * f2)/D  (7)
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      which is only 1.22 times as large as the size B of the main lobe obtained through a rectangular aperture, which is given by
      <br/>
      B=2 * ( LAMBDA  * f2)/D  (8)
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Thus, the diameter of the trough in the center of the double-humped beam formed by the subsidiary beam 131 focused on the information storage surface becomes about 70% of the beam diameter of the diffraction limited of the second convex lens 151 (objective lens 109 in FIG. 1), which can be derived by in computer simulation.
      <br/>
      The dimensions of the principal portion of the primary beam 130 are equated with those of the principal portion of the subsidiary beam 131 and the primary beam 130 and subsidiary beam 131 are detected individually, followed by calculations by the differential calculator (differential amplifier) 117.
      <br/>
      In this manner, an output signal from the differential calculator 117 equivalently corresponds to a signal scanned with a beam size about 70% of the diffraction limited, since signal components corresponding to the peripheral portion of the two beams are canceled after the signal processing.
      <br/>
      The size of the primary beam 130 and the size of the subsidiary beam 131 can be adjusted by means of the aperture 102 in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      As shown in FIG. 9(a), the phase region of the polarizing phase plate 104 (or a normal phase plate) is constituted by a first region 10 having a normal thickness and a second region 11 which is different in thickness from the first region 10 by d1.
      <br/>
      It has already been described that, with the arrangement, the double-humped distribution of light intensity can be obtained in the XS -direction of FIG. 9(a).
      <br/>
      Hence, the one-dimensional effect of super-resolution is achieved in the XS -direction.
      <br/>
      In the case of forming the primary beam 130 and subsidiary beam 131 with the separate optical systems, as will be described later with reference to FIG. 5, the same effect can be obtained using a non-polarizing phase plate instead.
    </p>
    <p num="67">FIG. 9(b) shows another example of the constitution of the polarizing phase plate 104 (or a normal phase plate), in which the polarizing phase plate 104 consists of four regions 12. 13, 14, and 15 so that a two-dimensional trough 16, which is lower in light intensity, is implemented in the center of the subsidiary beam 131, as diagrammatically shown in FIG. 9(c).</p>
    <p num="68">
      FIG. 10(a) shows another more preferable example of the constitution of the phase region of the polarizing plate 104 (or a normal phase plate), in which four regions 20, 21, 22, and 23 for sequentially providing 0,  PI /2,  PI , and (3/2) PI  are formed around the optical axis such that the phase difference between every other adjacent regions becomes  PI .
      <br/>
      With the arrangement, the central portion 24 of the image forming plane diagrammatically shown in FIG. 10(b) presents an intensity distribution with a deeper trough than in the case shown in FIG. 9(b).
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      FIG. 10(c) also shows still another example of the constitution of the phase region of the polarizing phase plate 104 (or a normal phase plate), in which the idea described above is further developed and eight regions 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, and 37 are formed by equally dividing the polarizing phase plate 104 around the center thereof.
      <br/>
      Each adjacent two of the eight regions provide a phase difference of 2 PI /8 so that the relative phase difference, starting from 0, advances stepwise till it reaches 2 PI .
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the phase difference provided by each opposing two of the eight regions (i.e., each two regions in directly opposite positions with an angle of 180 (degree)  formed therebetween) becomes  PI .
      <br/>
      Thus, by equally dividing the polarizing phase plate 104 into N phase regions around the center thereof so that a phase difference of 2 PI /N is provided by each adjacent two of the N regions, the substantially ideal subsidiary beam 131 which is symmetrical with respect to the optical axis can be formed.
      <br/>
      In practice, N=8 is adopted so that the central portion 38 of the subsidiary beam 131 on the information storage surface (X0, Y0) shown in FIG. 10(d) presents a roughly symmetrical distribution with respect to the optical axis.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      FIG. 11(a) to 11(d) show an example of the process of fabricating the polarizing phase plate 104.
      <br/>
      Initially, as shown in FIG. 11(a), a Ta film 181 is formed by sputtering to a thickness of 230  Angstrom  on the surface of a substrate 180 (X-plate) made of a crystal of lithium niobate (LiNbO3).
      <br/>
      The substrate 180 has a thickness of 500  MU m and its refractive index is uniaxially anisotropic.
    </p>
    <p num="71">Next, as shown in FIG. 11(b), the Ta film 181 is patterned by photolithography and dry etching, thereby forming a hemispherical proton substitution mask 182.</p>
    <p num="72">Then, as shown in FIG. 11(c), a heat treatment at a temperature of 260 (degree)  C. is performed with a pyrophosphoric acid (H4 P2 O7) using the proton substitution mask 182, so as to form a proton substitution region 183 which is 2.38  MU m deep.</p>
    <p num="73">
      Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 11(d), a phase compensation trench (with a depth of d2) is formed in the proton substitution region 183 by etching using a hydrofluoric acid (HF), thus providing the polarizing phase plate 104 as shown in FIG. 11(e).
      <br/>
      The Ta film 181 is promptly removed by the hydrofluoric acid and, thereafter, the proton substitution region 183 is selectively etched.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The polarizing phase plate 104 thus fabricated serves as a phase plate imparting a phase difference varying stepwise to a polarized light component (referred to as an ordinary ray) having a plane of polarization in the Y-direction, while serving as a uniform transparent substrate with respect to a polarized light component (referred to as an extraordinary ray) having a plane of polarization in the Z-direction.
      <br/>
      As for a method of forming the above phase compensation trench, it will be described later in detail.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The requirements for the polarizing phase plate 104 to impart a phase difference n to the ordinary ray and to serve as the uniform transparent substrate with respect to the extraordinary ray are generally satisfied if the following equations are satisfied:
      <br/>
      (2 PI / LAMBDA ) * + DELTA n0 * d3 +(1-n0) * d2 }=- PI   (9)
      <br/>
      (2 PI / LAMBDA ) * + DELTA ne * d3 +(1-ne) * d2 }=0  (10)
    </p>
    <p num="76">where d3 is the thickness of the proton substitution region 183, d2 is the depth of the phase compensation trench,  LAMBDA  is the wavelength of incident light, n0 is the refractive index of the ordinary ray with respect to the substrate (proton non-substitution region) 180, ne is the refractive index of the extraordinary ray with respect to the substrate (proton non-substitution region) 180,  DELTA n0 is a reduction in refractive index due to proton substitution with respect to the ordinary ray, and  DELTA ne is an increment in refractive index due to proton substitution with respect to the extraordinary ray.</p>
    <p num="77">By way of example, Table 1 shows the refractive indices of the substrate 180 made of lithium niobate and variations in refractive indices thereof due to proton substitution.</p>

No. 4,929,823. On the other hand, an optical head using a polarizing holographic optical element is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,062,098.</p>
    <p num="84">
      From the description given above with respect to FIGS. 1 to 3, it is apparent that the present first embodiment enables the reading of information stored on the information storage surface 110a of the optical disk 111 by super resolution (see FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      In short, by differentially calculating the sum of the respective signals in which the primary beam is detected (Sa1 to Sa3 and Sc1 to Sc5) and the signal Sb in which the subsidiary beam is detected, there can be performed the reading of information by super resolution equivalent to scanning an RF signal with about 70% of the beam size of the diffraction limited of the objective lens 109.
    </p>
    <p num="85">Below, a description will be given to a first variation of the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="86">
      Although the focusing error signal and the tracking error signal have been obtained by using the primary beam (ordinary ray) in the first embodiment, it is also possible to constitute the holographic optical element such that the subsidiary beam (extraordinary beam) is diffracted, thereby providing the servo signal.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is sufficient to simply change the direction of the crystal axis of the substrate by rotating it 90 (degree)  and form the holographic optical element thereon, without changing the direction of the holographic pattern shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      As a result, the intensity of the subsidiary beam becomes approximately 0 in the vicinity of the optical axis, while it becomes large in the vicinity of the periphery of the lens, so that a highly modulated tracking error signal corresponding to the pushpull signal is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="87">Below, a description will be given to a second variation of the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="88">
      In the second variation of the first embodiment, a third structure for providing the tracking signal can be provided.
      <br/>
      Specifically, all the surfaces of the holographic optical element are constituted by the Fresnel zone plates 111a and 111b, without the provision of the diffraction grating patterns 111c and 111d shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      In this case, the second optical detector 113b for detecting the subsidiary beam shown in FIG. 8 can be composed of two separate optical detectors with a division extending in the direction of Y in FIG. 8 (though not shown in FIG. 8) such that the tracking signal can be obtained using differential outputs from the two optical detectors.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      With the arrangement, the tracking error signal can be obtained without being affected by the focusing error signal resulting from the main beam, thereby implementing stable tracking servo control.
      <br/>
      Although the stable detection of the tracking error signal becomes more difficult as the spacing between any two adjacent tracks is reduced, the present variation utilizes the characteristic of the double-humped or quadruple-humped beam pattern for tracking control with the subsidiary beam in order to read information from the optical disk with tracks at reduced spacing.

    <p num="90">FIG. 4 schematically shows the structure of a super-resolution optical head apparatus according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="91">
      As shown in FIG. 4, a coherent light source 200 composed of a semiconductor laser comprises two light sources 200a and 200b having planes of polarization perpendicular (orthogonal) to each other.
      <br/>
      Light beams emitted from the two light sources 200a and 200b sequentially reach a collimator lens 201 and a holographic optical element 202.
      <br/>
      Each of the two light beams is divided by the holographic optical element 202 into a primary beam and a subsidiary beam having optical axes coincident with each other and having planes of polarization perpendicular to each other.
      <br/>
      The resulting primary beam and subsidiary beam have their directions changed by a beam splitter 204 and are then focused on an information storage surface 213a of an optical disk 213, in which information is stored in the form of pits, by an objective lens 205.
      <br/>
      The primary beam and subsidiary beam reflected from the information storage surface 213a are turned into parallel beams again by the objective lens 205 and travel through the beam splitter 204.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the primary beam is diffracted by a polarizing holographic optical element 206 and focused by a condenser lens 207 so as to reach a first optical detector 208a and a third optical detector 208c.

    <p num="94">
      The holographic optical element 202 can be obtained by irradiating any one of the polarizing phase plates (or normal phase plates) 104 described above with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10 with a coherent beam in specified size, collimating the transmitted beam, and superimposing the above coherent beam and a reference beam, which can interfere with the coherent beam, upon each other.
      <br/>
      In the process of fabricating the holographic optical element 202, the same effect can be obtained if the above-non-polarizing phase plate 104 is used instead.
    </p>
    <p num="95">A description will be given to the above holographic optical element 202 with reference to FIG. 3.</p>
    <p num="96">
      The polarizing phase plate 104 and two points 170 and 171 (in effect, slits with fine apertures) are irradiated with parallel coherent beams at a wavelength of  LAMBDA , thereby introducing a reference beam 176 onto the focal plane ( XI -axis) of the Fourier transform lens (convex lens) 150 so as to record an interference pattern on a photosensitive material.
      <br/>
      Since the holographic technique for recording a diffracted wavefront from a given object by superimposing an independent coherent reference beam upon each other has been well-known, the detailed description thereof is omitted here.
      <br/>
      Although a hologram is recorded using the wavelength  LAMBDA . the incident angle  THETA  of the reference beam, and a lens focal distance f1 here, it is also possible to use another wavelength  LAMBDA 0 and another lens focal distance f0.
      <br/>
      The incident angle  THETA 0 of the reference beam is set to satisfy sin THETA 0 / sin THETA = LAMBDA 0 / LAMBDA  and the focal distance of the second collimator lens 201 shown in FIG. 4 is set to satisfy f1 =f0 *  LAMBDA 0 / LAMBDA .
      <br/>
      The parameters of a holographic recording/reproducing optical system can also be set otherwise so as to equivalently obtain the same effect.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      Thus, the primary beam and subsidiary beam shown in FIG. 4 are formed on the same axis by constituting the holographic optical element 202, which is equivalent to the polarizing phase plate 104, so that it also functions as a beam splitter.
      <br/>
      However, it is also possible to alternatively design and fabricate the hologram of the polarizing phase plate 104 by a technology based on computer synthesis.
      <br/>
      In this case, the polarizing phase plate 104 divided into N regions as described above with reference to FIG. 10 can be calculated advantageously from an ideal model in which N --&gt;  (infinity) . Based on the calculation result, there can be obtained a relief-type hologram which can be produced as a mask pattern to be used in lithography and which can be duplicated by means of electronic beam drawing or laser beam drawing.
    </p>
    <p num="98">The polarizing holographic optical element 206 is similarly constituted to the polarizing hologram 111 of the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="99">The application of a polarizing holographic optical element of the same type has been disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,062,098. On the other hand, another substrate material such as a liquid-crystal device having polarizing anisotropy can also be used.</p>
    <p num="100">
      Among others, the method used in fabricating the polarizing holographic optical elements 111 and 206 according the first and second embodiments described above is particularly advantageous in terms of fabrication accuracy and cost, as will be described below.
      <br/>
      That is, in the device in which lithium ion Li+ in lithium niobate has been substituted by proton (H+), the refractive index with respect to the extraordinary ray undergoes a large variation ( DELTA ne) in the region in which proton substitution has been achieved, as shown in Table 1, so that the device functions as a phase-type diffraction grating having a large diffracting effect with respect to the extraordinary ray.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      However, in the region in which proton substitution has been achieved, the refractive index with respect to the ordinary ray also undergoes a slight variation ( DELTA n0).
      <br/>
      Thus, in the diffraction grating in which lithium niobate has been substituted by proton, the refractive index with respect to the extraordinary ray and the refractive index with respect to the ordinary ray undergo simultaneous variations and cannot perform the above function of polarization separation completely, so that it becomes necessary to add any phase compensation.
      <br/>
      In a conventional method (A.
      <br/>
      Ohba et al., Jap. Appl. Phys., 28 (1989) 359). the phase difference in the ordinary ray has been compensated by a dielectric film formed in the proton substitution region.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, additional steps of depositing and patterning the dielectric are required in fabricating the diffraction grating, while an improved accuracy is required in alignment.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      The polarizing holographic optical element (polarization separating element) 111 diagrammatically shown in FIG. 7 is formed as a holographic optical element with polarizing anisotropy in which proton substitution regions 111a are formed in a grid on the surface of a substrate (X plate).
      <br/>
      For phase compensation, only the proton substitution regions 111a are etched (hereinafter referred to as phase compensation trenches), conversely to the prior art, thereby offsetting the phase difference imparted by the proton substitution regions 111a and proton non-substitution regions 111b to the extraordinary beam passing through the proton substitution regions 111a after etching.
      <br/>
      As a result, the refractive index of the phase compensation trench becomes 1 (=refractive index of air), which is smaller than the refractive index of the substrate (refractive index with respect to ordinary ray:1-n0, refractive index with respect to extraordinary ray:1-ne).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, while the phase difference imparted to the extraordinary ray is eliminated by offsetting the increment ( DELTA ne) in refractive index caused by the proton substitution, the phase difference imparted to the ordinary ray is conversely increased due to the reduction in refractive index caused by the phase compensation trenches in addition to the reduction ( DELTA n0) in refractive index caused by the proton substitution.
      <br/>
      The conditions for diffracting the ordinary ray with the maximum efficiency and not diffracting the extraordinary ray are given by the above equations (9) and (10).
    </p>
    <p num="103">Below, a description will be given to the method of fabricating the polarizing holographic optical element 111.</p>
    <p num="104">
      The polarizing holographic optical element 111 can easily be fabricated using the processes of photolithography and proton substitution, similarly to that for the polarizing phase plate 104 shown in FIG. 11. That is, a Ta film is formed on a substrate made of a crystal of lithium niobate (LiNbO3). which is a uniaxially anisotropic material.
      <br/>
      Next, the Ta film is patterned by photolithography and dry etching, thereby forming a grid-like proton substitution mask.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, a heat treatment at a temperature of 260 (degree)  C. with a pyrophosphoric acid is performed using the proton substitution mask, thereby forming the proton substitution regions each having a depth of 2.38  MU m. Since etching with a hydrofluoric acid selectively proceeds with respect to the proton substitution regions, while it does not proceed with respect to the substrate, the phase compensation trenches composed of the proton substitution regions 111a (see FIG. 7) can be formed without alignment by utilizing the selectivity of the etching.
      <br/>
      As the depth of the phase compensation trench increases, the phase difference also increases in the ordinary ray, so that the efficiency  ETA o1 of the first-order diffracted ray of the ordinary ray is increased, while the transmittance  ETA o0 (efficiency of the zero-order diffracted ray) is reduced.
      <br/>
      In the extraordinary ray, on the other hand, the increment in refractive index of the proton substitution region 111a is offset by the phase compensation trenches, so that the efficiency  ETA e1 of the first-order diffracted ray of the extraordinary ray is reduced, while the transmittance is increased.
      <br/>
      The transmittance  ETA e0 of the extraordinary ray becomes minimum when the depth of etching is 0.13  MU m. The extinction ratio of the transmitted ray (extraordinary ray) is 24 dB, while the extinction ratio of the diffracted ray (ordinary ray) is 17 dB, so that excellent characteristics are obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      Thus, with the polarizing holographic optical element 206, the primary beam is detected by the first and third optical detectors 208a and 208c shown in FIG. 4, while the subsidiary beam is detected by the second optical detectors 208b shown in FIG. 4, with excellent extinction ratios.
      <br/>
      The first optical detector 208a is electrically connected to the third optical detector 208c, so that electrical signals are added up, similarly to the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      The output signals from the first to third optical detectors 208a to 208c are transmitted to a control unit 214 comprising the processing unit and the actuator driving unit, thereby controlling the electromagnetic driving means 212.

    <p num="120">To constitute a simple optical system of go-and-return (or round trip) type, the fifth embodiment uses, as the focusing means, an objective lens formed integrally with a holographic optical element, thereby implementing a compact super-resolution optical head.</p>
    <p num="121">
      As shown in FIG. 16, a coherent beam in an outward trip is emitted from a coherent light source 500 and passes through a polarizing phase plate 502 divided into four regions (0,  PI /2,  PI , and 3 PI /2), which has been formed on a substrate 501 having a uniaxially anisotropic refractive index, thereby forming the primary beam ( --&gt; ) and the subsidiary beam (.circleincircle.) having planes of polarization perpendicular to each other.
      <br/>
      The resulting primary and subsidiary beams pass through a holographic optical element 504 provided integrally with an objective lens 503.
      <br/>
      The zero-order transmitted beams from the holographic optical element 504 are superimposed upon each other and focused onto an information storage surface 505a.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that the intensity profile of the subsidiary beam may be slightly different from those at the foregoing embodiments since appreciable distance is given between the light source 500 and the phase plate 502.
      <br/>
      However, the distance is still small compared with the distance between the light source 500 and the objective lens 503, so that super-resolution effect as well as cross-talk cancelling effect of the present invention can also be available.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, the tracking direction of the optical disk 505 corresponds to the Y direction which is perpendicular to the paper face.
      <br/>
      The reflected beam from the information storage surface 505a passes through the objective lens 503 and the holographic optical element 504 in a return trip.
      <br/>
      The first-order diffracted beam from the holographic optical element 504 travels off the optical axis of the objective lens 503 and reaches a polarizing diffraction grating 506 formed in a region adjacent to the polarizing phase plate 502 of the substrate 501, which is shown in FIG. 17(b).
      <br/>
      The beam incident upon the polarizing diffraction grating 506 is separated thereby into the primary beam and the subsidiary beam through polarization separation and then detected by an optical detector 508 shown in FIG. 17(a).
      <br/>
      FIG. 17(c) shows the respective intensity distributions of the primary and subsidiary beams on the information storage surface 505a.
    </p>
    <p num="122">Below, a detailed description will be given to the function of the holographic optical element 504 and to a method of detecting a super-resolution scanning signal by means of the optical detector 508.</p>
    <p num="123">
      The holographic optical element 504 has multiple functions of: separating, as a beam splitter, the light beam in the return trip from the light beam in the outward trip by diffracting it off the optical axis of the objective lens 503; forming an optical beam for obtaining a focusing servo signal and a tracking servo signal from the beams obtained as a result of separation; and detecting an RF signal.
      <br/>
      Although the servo-signal detecting system can be implemented using various systems, the fifth embodiment obtains the focusing error signal and the tracking error signal by spot size detection (SSD) method and by a pushpull (PP) method, respectively.
      <br/>
      Although the SSD method is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 62-251025, the holographic optical element 504 in the fifth embodiment is constituted by two Fresnel zone plates of divided-region type with one region of a stripe form placed adjacent to the other as in a sampled pattern, suitably for integral formation with the objective lens 503.
      <br/>
      Such a Fresnel zone plate of divided-region type is detailed as a blazed hologram in a document (Makoto Kato et al.; "Recent advances in optical pickup head with holographic optical elements," Proc.
      <br/>
      SPIE, vol. 1507, pp. 36-44., European Congress on Optics, Holographic Optics III: Principles and Applications, 12-15 Mar. 1991. The Hague, The Netherlands).
      <br/>
      FIG. 18(a) diagrammatically shows the pattern of the holographic optical element 504 constituted by the two Fresnel zone plates with one plate placed upon the other, which is detailed in the foregoing document.
      <br/>
      In regions 5042i (i=1, 2, 3, . . . ) and 5043i (i=1, 2, 3, . . . ) is shown a pattern shaped like a Fresnel zone plate, which is not overlapped and is sampled in stripes.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 18(a), 5041a and 5041b designate hologram regions provided in order to detect the tracking signal.
    </p>
    <p num="124">Although the holographic optical element 504 is in a position closer to the coherent light source 500 and the objective lens 503 is in a position closer to the optical disk 505 in the fifth embodiment, their positions may be interchanged with each other.</p>
    <p num="125">
      As shown in FIG. 17(a), on a substrate 509 on which the coherent light source 500 and an optical detector 508 are integrated are provided element terminals 510a and 510b for detecting a focusing error signal using the SSD method.
      <br/>
      The focusing error signal is detected by the element terminals 510a and 510b as a pair of light beams 511a and 511b formed from the primary beam.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the tracking error signal is detected by element terminals 510c and 510d as a pair of light beams 511c and 511d.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      The subsidiary beam is separated by the polarizing diffraction grating 506 as a  +- first-order diffracted beam and detected, on both sides of the primary beam, by the element terminals 512a, 512b, 512c, and 512d and by element terminals 512e and 512f.
      <br/>
      The super-resolution scanning signal is obtained, as the RF signal, by subtracting the sum of the output signals from the element terminals 512a, 512b, 512c, 512d, 512e, and 512f from the sum of the output signals from the element terminals 510a, 510b, 510c, and 510d.
      <br/>
      However, a method of optimizing the calculations using proper amplifiers will not be described in greater detail, since it is a designing issue.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      Although the polarizing phase plate 502 has been divided into four regions in the fifth embodiment, it will easily be appreciated that the number of regions into which the polarizing plate is divided may be other than four.
      <br/>
      As for the manufacturing process of the polarizing phase plate 502, it will not be mentioned here, since it has been described in detail together with the polarizing diffraction grating.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      As the method of detecting the tracking error signal, a phase difference method, a three-beam method, or the like can be adapted to the holographic optical element 504 of the super-resolution optical head apparatus according to the fifth embodiment.
      <br/>
      FIG. 18(b) shows another example of the above holographic optical element 504.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 18(b), the holographic optical element according to another example has hologram regions 5241a and 5251b with grooves extending transversely in the Y direction.
      <br/>
      The primary beam and subsidiary beam reflected from the information storage surface 505a of the optical disk 505 are focused by the hologram regions 5241a and 5241b onto an optical detector 508A shown in FIG. 19. The optical detector 508A detects the tracking error signal from the subsidiary beam focused by the hologram regions 5241a and 5241b.
      <br/>
      The subsidiary beam focused on the optical detector 508A is received by a two-part optical detector composed of a pair of right and left detecting elements and then outputted from element terminals 512h and 512f and from element terminals 512i and 512g.
      <br/>
      The outputs from the element terminals 512h and 512f are differentially calculated, while the outputs from the element terminals 512i and 512g are also differentially calculated.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the sum of the respective differences are calculated and detected as the tracking error signal.
      <br/>
      Although the method is similar to the conventional three-beam method in which two beams are allowed to travel along the tracks in respective positions anterior and posterior to the primary beam for detecting the RF signal, the quantities of light of the two beams are detected in their respective image forming positions, and differential calculations are performed afterward, the method of the present embodiment is different from the conventional three-beam method in that it obtains the tracking error signal by halving an image of the subsidiary beam that has been overlaid on the same optical axis on which the primary beam has been overlaid.
      <br/>
      In other words, since the method of the present embodiment obtains the tracking error signal by halving the image of the subsidiary beam overlaid on the same optical axis on which the primary beam has been overlaid, it is excellently stable as well as advantageous in terms of adjustment accuracy.
      <br/>
      Since the longitudinal directions of the hologram regions 5241a and 5241b for detecting the tracking signal correspond to the Y direction perpendicular to the tracking direction (X) in the present embodiment, the expansion of the subsidiary beam expands in the Y direction on the optical detector 508A is confined within the range of the expansion of the diffraction limited of the object lens, so that a precise tracking error signal is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      With the super-resolution optical head apparatus according to the fifth embodiment, the following effects can be obtained.
      <br/>
      Specifically, since the optical system of go-and-return type is constructed, an optical head apparatus of a compact and simple super-resolution scanning optical system can be implemented.
      <br/>
      Since the polarizing phase plate 520 and the polarizing diffraction grating 506 are formed on the same substrate 501 close to each other, the apparatus presents excellent stability.
      <br/>
      Since the coherent light source 500 and the optical detector 508 are integrated on the same substrate 509, the apparatus can easily be assembled and adjusted, while exhibiting remarkable stability to secular changes, temperature changes, and mechanical changes.
      <br/>
      A technique for providing the coherent light source 500 and the optical detector 508 on the same substrate 509 is well known as the technique for implementing, e.g., a structure in which a light beam is emitted perpendicularly to the substrate 509 by means of an etched mirror integrally formed on a silicon substrate and a structure in which the optical detector 508 is integrated on the above silicon substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="130">Moreover, in detecting the tracking error signal as a differential signal between an output signal from the element terminal 510c and an output signal from the element terminal 510d in the fifth embodiment, the tracking error signal can be detected with reliability in high-density recording, which has conventionally been difficult with a normal means, by subtracting the sum of an output signal from the element terminal 512a and an output signal from the element terminal 512b from the output signal from the element terminal 510c at a proper rate and by subtracting the sum of the output signal from the element terminal 512c and the output signal from the element terminal 512d from an output signal from the element terminal 512e at a proper rate.</p>
    <p num="131">
      The servo signal thus obtained is feedbacked to an actuator 515 for driving the objective lens 503 formed integrally with the holographic optical element 504.
      <br/>
      However, a further description will not be given to the process, since it is a well-known technique.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      Although the control means for controlling the focusing means in each of the above embodiments is an electromagnetic driving means, another control means can be used as the control means for focusing and tracking the beam on the surface of the optical disk.
      <br/>
      For example, as another means for focusing the light beam onto the surface of the optical disk, a piezoelectric actuator or a means utilizing such fluid-dynamic floating power as used in a magnetic disk head.
      <br/>
      As another means for controlling the tracking of the light beam on the surface of the optical disk, a means for deflecting the light beam using an electric-optic effect can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="133">Since the individual embodiments of the present invention have been described above in detail, there will be easily understood the structure and functions of the super-resolution optical head apparatus of the present invention, which has equivalently achieved a beam size about 70% of the beam size of the diffraction limited in an optical head apparatus using the conventional optical system.</p>
    <p num="134">
      The significant effect achieved by the present invention is that information can be read from a high-density disk having double the density of a conventional disk without increasing the numerical aperture of the objective lens and without changing the light-source wavelength (e.g., NA=0.45, wavelength  LAMBDA =0.78  MU m with an optical head built in a compact disk player).
      <br/>
      Since the focal depth of the optical head in the compact disk player is generally set to about 1.5  MU /m, focusing can be controlled easily.
      <br/>
      However, in the case of using an objective lens with an increased numerical aperture (e.g., NA=0.6) and a short-wavelength light source (e.g.,  LAMBDA =0.43  MU m), the focal depth is reduced in proportion to the wavelength and in inverse proportion to the square of the numerical aperture, as shown in the following equation:
      <br/>
      1.5  MU m * (430/780) * (0.45/0.60)=1.5  MU m * 0.31 (roughly equal to 0.47  MU m)  (13)
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      Consequently, if the super-resolution optical system of the present invention is used in an optical head apparatus, information can be read from a high-density optical disk, using a short-wavelength light source, by means of a simple and cheap player.
      <br/>
      As a result, there can be achieved the significant effect that an optical-disk apparatus can easily be implemented with reliability by using a conventional servo-signal detecting technique and a conventional control technique.
    </p>
    <p num="136">In other words, since the differential calculating process is performed with respect to the light intensities of the primary and subsidiary beams according to the present invention, there can be achieved the significant effect of increasing, by twice or more, the focal depth based on the diffraction limited resolution of the objected lens.</p>
    <p num="137">
      The effects of the present invention have been described from the view point of super resolution in a single track.
      <br/>
      It is, however, also pointed out that the cross-talk cancelling effects in reading the information on the optical disks recorded on multiple track structures, since the equivalent spot size on the disk plane can be reduced to about 70% of the diffraction limited so that cross-talk signals due to the adjacent tracks are greatly suppressed.
    </p>
    <p num="138">As a whole, it is concluded that the signal characteristics can be improved both in the track direction (as a waveform equalizes) and in the cross-track direction (as a cross-talk canceler) according to the present invention described thereof.</p>
