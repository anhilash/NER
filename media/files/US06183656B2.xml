      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a method of detecting an end point of polishing.
      <br/>
      The detection is performed such that a wafer having a permalloy magnetic layer constituted by forming a permalloy magnetic layer made of permalloy containing metal, such as iron, nickel or cobalt, such as Ni--Fe, Mn--Fe, Co--Fe Ni--Rh--F, Co--Zr--Fe, Co--Fe--B, on the surface of a substrate made of silicon, an alumina-titanium carbide (AlTiC) alloy or glass and having a circuit made of Cu, Ag or Au formed if necessary and furthermore incorporating an insulating layer made of aluminum oxide or the like is joined to a chuck.
      <br/>
      Then, the wafer is pressed against a platen having a polishing cloth or a lapping surface plate (hereinafter the platen and the lapping surface plate are generally called a "polishing surface plate" and a CMP polishing apparatus and a lapping apparatus are generally called a "CMP polishing apparatus") made of copper, tin, aluminum or plastic.
      <br/>
      While supplying abrasive material slurry to the surface of the polishing surface plate, the polishing surface plate and the wafer are rotated to polish the insulating layer to perform chemimechanical polishing (CMP) until the permalloy layer is exposed to the outside.
      <br/>
      As an alternative to this, the wafer is sucked to a chuck table by using a vacuum to downwards and then a platen to which a polishing cloth is bonded, namely a polishing pad, is pressed against the upper surface of the wafer.
      <br/>
      While supplying abrasive material slurry to the platen or supplying abrasive material slurry to the upper surface of the wafer, the platen and the wafer are rotated to polish the insulating layer to perform chemimechanical polishing (CMP) until the permalloy layer is exposed.
      <br/>
      The present invention also relates to an apparatus for detecting an end point of polishing.

    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      For example, a magnetic recording head substrate is, as shown in FIGS. 2A to 2D, manufactured such that a permalloy layer 3 is formed on a substrate 2.
      <br/>
      Then, a wafer 1 (see FIG. 2A) having an aluminum insulating layer formed thereon is polished by chemimechanical polishing (CMP) until the permalloy layer is exposed to the outside (see FIG. 2D).
      <br/>
      Also the CMP polishing operation is performed when a device wafer is manufactured as a substitute for the magnetic head substrate.
      <br/>
      At this time, a structure consisting of 2 to 10 permalloy layers and device layers is sometimes constituted.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      When the water is polished as described above, automatic polishing free of no manpower is required from the market.
      <br/>
      A variety of pieces of automatic CMP apparatus for automatically detecting an end point of polishing have been suggested.
    </p>
    <p num="6">The end point of polishing is detected by any one of the following methods.</p>
    <p num="7">
      (1) A method for determining the end point in accordance with an amount of polishing by measuring a change of the thickness of the wafer which is being polished by a thickness meter (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 62-257742, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 9-193003, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-106984 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-98016).
      <br/>
      (2) A method for determine the end point in accordance with a load electric current, voltage or change in the resistance of the motor which rotates the platen or the chucking mechanism during the polishing operation (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 61-188702, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 6-252112, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No 8-99625, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 9-70753, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-44035, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-128658 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-177976).
      <br/>
      (3) A method determining the end point of polishing in accordance with change in the torque of the motor which rotates the platen or the chucking mechanism during the polishing operation (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 5-138529, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 6-216095, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 8-139060, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 8-197417, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 9-36073, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 9-262743 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-256209).
      <br/>
      (4) A method in which the wafer being polished is irradiated with a laser beam to determine the end point of polishing in accordance with the quantity of reflected light (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 57-138575, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 61-214970, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 4-255218, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 5-309559, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 7-328916, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 8-174411 Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 9-7985 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-160420).
      <br/>
      (5) A method with which a color sensor is disposed opposite to a chuck for holding a device substrate which has an interlayer insulating film on which a metal film has been formed to detect the color of the interlayer insulating film which has been chemimechanically polished (refer to JP-A-11-70467).
      <br/>
      (6) A method in which phosphorus or tracer particles serving as an index is added to the polishing-material slurry to measure the quantity of the index on the polishing cloth so as to determine the end point of polishing (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2-241017 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 8-69987).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The method (1) in which the thickness of the wafer is measured is arranged such that the thickness of only a part of the wafer is measured.
      <br/>
      Since a long time is required to measure the distribution of thicknesses of the overall portion of the wafer, only a poor accuracy can be realized.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Each of the determining method (2) in which the electric current, the voltage or the resistance is used and the method (3) in which the torque is used, is not a method of directly observing the surface of the polished wafer.
      <br/>
      Also only a poor accuracy of flattening can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The method (4) in which the quantity of reflected laser beam is used, is arranged such that the wafer is directly irradiated with the laser beam to determine the end point in accordance with the quantity of reflected light.
      <br/>
      Therefore, presence of water of the polishing-material slurry for use in the CMP polishing process on the surface of the wafer causes data to be scattered.
      <br/>
      Hence it follows that an apparatus for cleaning and drying the position on the surface of the wafer on which the laser beam is made incident and from which the same is reflected must be joined.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the foregoing method cannot be employed when the size of the CMP apparatus is reduced.
      <br/>
      What is worse, the cost of the apparatus cannot be reduced.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the polishing process is interrupted because the cleaning and drying processes of the wafer have to be performed.
      <br/>
      The method (5) with which the color sensor is employed is free of description about a specific embodiment (computer soft program) of detecting the end point of polishing.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it is difficult to instantaneously observe the overall surface of the device wafer by one color sensor when a consideration is made from the disclosed drawings.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the method cannot be employed from a viewpoint of practical use.
    </p>
    <p num="11">The method (5) in which the index is added cannot be employed because the index's influences on polishing of the wafer and on a post-process performed after the CMP polishing process has been completed are not known.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The inventors of the present invention have focused attention on the metal material contained in the permalloy layer and the metal layer.
      <br/>
      Thus, a fact has been detected that metal materials mixed with the waste solution of abrasive material slurry together with the insulating material as trash have been formed into ions (when the metal is iron, trivalent Fe ions).
      <br/>
      The physical quantity (Co) detected in accordance with the concentration or metal ions in the abrasive material slurry realized when the polished wafer in an optimum state is read as a digital value (Ii) of a color identifying sensor.
      <br/>
      Then, a comparison is made with a digital value (Ti) caused from the physical quantity of metal ions in the waste solution of abrasive material slurry during the polishing operation and obtained by a color identifying sensor.
      <br/>
      A moment of time at which the value of Ii reaches Io is determined as an end point of polishing.
      <br/>
      Thus, a fact that detection of an end point of polishing can be performed more accurately as compared with the conventional method has been detected.
      <br/>
      Thus, the present invention has been established.
    </p>
    <p num="13">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of detecting an end point of polishing arranged to perform CMP polishing with which an insulating layer of a wafer incorporating a substrate having a metal-containing permalloy layer formed thereon and the insulating layer formed on the metal-containing permalloy layer is chemimechanically polished to expose the flat permalloy layer, the method of detecting an end point of polishing, comprising the steps of: collecting abrasive material slurry on a surface plate for polishing as a continuous flow from the start or during CMP polishing; continuously mixing a color developing reagent with the collected continuous flow to prepare a specimen for the continuos flow; reading the color of the specimen as a digital value (Ii) by a color identifying sensor; and determining a moment of time at which the digital value (Ii) reaches a digital value (Io) of a specimen of a waste flow of the abrasive material slurry at the end of polishing to be the end of CMP polishing.</p>
    <p num="14">
      As the polishing operation proceeds, chips of permalloy or the metal layer produced during the polishing operation and trash of insulating layer added to the waste solution of the abrasive material as well as the slurry components of the abrasive material.
      <br/>
      Thus, the composition ratio of the waste solution varies as time elapses.
      <br/>
      Therefore, an experiment is performed to previously obtain a color value (Io) correlating to the content (Co) of specific metal ion substance in the waste solution of the abrasive material in the optimum polishing state.
      <br/>
      Then, a color value (Ii) correlating to the content of the substance in the waste solution of the abrasive material slurry of the abrasive material slurry during the polishing operation is monitored by a color identifying sensor.
      <br/>
      A moment of time at which the color value (Ii) coincides with the color value (Io) at the end of polishing is determined as an end of polishing.
      <br/>
      Thus, the polishing process can be completed in a state where a predetermined area ratio of the permalloy and the insulating material is maintained.
    </p>
    <p num="15">A second aspect of the invention is characterized in that the metal contained in the permalloy layer is iron, the color developing reagent contains coloring matter and hydrogen peroxide water, and the value detected by the color identifying sensor as the digital value (Ii) is a color value of the specimen of the waste flow of the abrasive material slurry color-developed owing to iron ions in the abrasion material slurry.</p>
    <p num="16">
      Since iron ions even in a small quantity can be colored with the color developing reagent, the waste solution can be colored within the wafer throughput (two minutes to six minutes) in the CMP process.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the end point can be determined by operating the color sensor.
    </p>
    <p num="17">A third aspect of the invention is characterized in that coloring matter is N,N-dialkyl-p-phenylene diamine (where the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group is 1 or 2).</p>
    <p num="18">Among a variety of coloring matter for iron ions, N, N-dialkyl-p-phenylene diamine can be colored most quickly in the presence of an oxidizer.</p>
    <p num="19">A fourth aspect of the invention is characterized in that the specimen of the waste solution of the abrasive material slurry is added with a buffer solution as well as the color matter which develops color in the presence of iron ions and hydrogen peroxide water.</p>
    <p num="20">
      When the buffer solution is blended, the state of the specimen can be stabilized.
      <br/>
      Thus, deviation of the color value as the time elapses can be eliminated, the color value being used to detect the end point of polishing after a wafer which is newly polished has been conveyed and the CMP polishing operation has been repeated.
    </p>
    <p num="21">A fifth aspect of the invention is characterized in that the metal contained in the permalloy layer is nickel, and the color-developing reagent is dimethyl oxime.</p>
    <p num="22">
      The color-developing reagent varies according to metal contained in the permalloy on which attention is focused.
      <br/>
      When nickel ions are detected, dimethyl oxime is employed.
    </p>
    <p num="23">According to a sixth aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for detecting an end point of polishing of a wafer adaptable to a CMP polishing apparatus with which an insulating layer of a wafer incorporating a substrate having a metal-containing permalloy layer formed thereon and the insulating layer formed on the metal-containing containing permalloy layer is chemimechanically polished to expose the flat permalloy layer, the apparatus for detecting an end point of polishing comprising: a scraper for collecting waste solution of abrasive material slurry on a polishing surface plate; a roller pump for pumping up the waste solution of polishing material slurry collected by the scraper as a continuous flow to send the waste solution of the abrasive material slurry collected by the scraper to a temperature regulator; a reagent supply mechanism for continuously supplying color-developing reagent to the flow of the waste solution of the abrasive material slurry pumped up by the roller pump; a color identifying sensor for reading, as a digital value (Ii), the color of a specimen of the waste flow of the abrasive material slurry containing the color-developing reagent sent to the temperature regulator; a mechanism for making a comparison between the digital value (Ii) read by the color identifying sensor and a digital value (Io) of a specimen of the waste flow of the abrasive material slurry containing the color-developing reagent in a state where CMP polishing has been completed which has been read by a color identifying sensor and input previously; a mechanism for transmitting a signal when the measured value (Ii) has reached the value (Io) input previously; and a mechanism for indicating completion of CMP polishing of the wafer in response to the signal.</p>
    <p num="24">Since a state of polishing can be detected by the color identifying sensor in a real time manner, the CMP process can be automated.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="26">The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. (Wafer to be processed)</p>
    <p num="27">
      A wafer to be processed of the present invention has a substrate made of silicon, an alumina-titanium carbide alloy or LCD glass.
      <br/>
      A permalloy magnetic layer made of, for example, Ni--Fe, Mn--Fe, Co--Fe, Ni--Rh--Fe, Co--Zr--Fe or Co--Fe--B is formed on the surface of the foregoing substrate.
      <br/>
      If necessary, a circuit made of Cu, Ag or Au is formed thereon.
      <br/>
      Then, an insulating layer made of aluminum oxide or the like is formed so that the wafer is formed.
      <br/>
      Also the present invention may be applied to a substrate for a device incorporating an interlayer insulating film made of aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide or titanium oxide on which a metal film made of titanium or titanium-aluminum is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="28">(CMP Polishing apparatus)</p>
    <p num="29">
      FIG. 3 shows a CMP polishing apparatus 10 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the CMP polishing apparatus 10, a wafer "w" is vacuum-adsorbed to a chuck table (plate) 14. Then, a platen 15 to which a polishing cloth 15a is bonded is pressed against, the upper surface of the wafer.
      <br/>
      While supplying abrasive material slurry 13 to the upper surface of the wafer, the platen and the wafer are rotated to polish the wafer.
      <br/>
      In stead of the platen, a polishing tape may be used as a substitute for the platen.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Alternatively, FIGS. 4 and 5 show another CMP apparatus 10 arranged such that a wafer "w" is bond to a head or vacuumed onto the chuck plate 11.
      <br/>
      Then, the wafer w is pressed against a platen 12 to which a polishing cloth 12a is bonded.
      <br/>
      While supplying abrasive material slurry 13 to the platen 15, the platen and the semiconductor wafer are rotated so that the chemimechanical polishing (CMP) apparatus 10 polishes the wafer.
    </p>
    <p num="31">(Abrasive Material Slurry)</p>
    <p num="32">The components of the abrasive material slurry for use to perform the CMP polishing operation vary according to the composition, the structure and an amount of polishing of the wafer to be polished.</p>
    <p num="33">For example, when a permalloy layer is polished, aqueous abrasive material slurry may be employed which contains (a) abrasive grains having an average particle size of 0.05 mm to 1 mm in a quantity of 0.1 wt. % to 10 wt %, (b) an inorganic salt selected from water-soluble inorganic aluminum salts and nickel salts in a quantity of 0.1 wt % to 3 wt %; and (c) an aqueous chelating agent.</p>
    <p num="34">
      Aluminum oxide, cerium oxide, single-crystal diamond, polycrystal diamond, silicon oxide, silicon carbide, chromium oxide or glass powder may be used as the abrasive grains.
      <br/>
      The average particle size of the abrasive grain to be used is 0.1  MU m to 1.0  MU m, preferably 0.3  MU m to 0.5  MU m. The quantity of the abrasive grains having the component (a) with respect to the abrasive material slurry varies according to the type of the abrasive grains and purpose of the same.
      <br/>
      The quantity is 0.05 wt % to 10 wt %, preferably 0.1 wt %. If the quantity is smaller than 0.05 wt %, a practical polishing rate of layer removed cannot be realized.
      <br/>
      If the quantity is larger than 10 wt %, the effect cannot furthermore be improved.
      <br/>
      What is worse, use of the abrasive grains in a large quantity causes an economic disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The component (b) which is the water-soluble inorganic salt or the nickel salt being an inorganic slat improves the polishing rate.
      <br/>
      The component (b) is exemplified by acetate of aluminum or nickel, hydrochloride, sulfate, phosphate and thiosulphate.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the foregoing component is any one of the following materials: aluminum nitrate, nickel nitrate, aluminum sulfate and the like.
      <br/>
      The water-soluble inorganic salt is contained in the polishing-material slurry in a quantity of 0.1 wt % to 3 wt %.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The water-soluble chelating agent which is the component (c) is added to the slurry in order to raise the polishing rate and flatten the obtained wafer.
      <br/>
      The water-soluble chelating agent is exemplified by ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), ethylene diamine tetraacetate disodium (EDTA-2Na), alkali metal salt of aminosulfonic acid-N,N-diacetate, alkali metal salt of 2, 2-dimethylpropane bisoxide, diethylene triamine pentaacetate and its sodium salt.
      <br/>
      The chelating agent which is the component (c) is contained in the abrasive material slurry in a quantity of 0.1 wt % to 3 wt %.
    </p>
    <p num="37">To the polishing-material slurry, aqueous medium, polishing oil, a rust-preventive agent, a dispersing agent, an antiseptic agent, an antifoaming agent and a pH adjuster and the like are added.</p>
    <p num="38">
      The dispersing medium may be composed of only water or a mixture, the main component of which is water (in a quantity of 70 wt % to 99 wt % of the dispersing medium) and a sub-component of which is water-soluble organic solvent, such as alcohol or glycol (in a quantity of 1 wt % to 30 wt %. It is preferable that water is obtained by filtration using a 0.1 mm cartridge filter to satisfactorily remove giant particles.
      <br/>
      Alcohol may be methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol.
      <br/>
      The glycol may be ethylene glycol, tetramethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol
    </p>
    <p num="39">The quantity of the water-soluble dispersing medium which is contained in the abrasive material slurry is 70 wt % to 99 wt %, preferably 90 wt % to 99 wt %. If the quantity is smaller than 70 wt %, the viscosity of slurry is raised excessively to smoothly supply the abrasive material slurry to the surface of the substrate and stably preserve slurry.</p>
    <p num="40">Polishing oil having a function of a polishing improver and an agent for dispersing abrasive grains is exemplified by a variety of surface active agents, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, polyoxyethylene alkylether, polyoxyethylene alkylphenylether, and pulonic-type non-ion surface active agent (addition reactant of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide).</p>
    <p num="41">
      The surface active agent may be an anion surface active agent, a cation surface active agent, a nonion surface active agent, an ampholytic surface active agent, use of both of the anion surface active agent and the nonion surface active agent, use of both of the anion surface active agent and the ampholytic surface active agent, use of both of the cation surface active agent and the nonion surface active agent or use of both of the cation surface active agent and the ampholytic surface active agent.
      <br/>
      The foregoing materials are mixed by 0.1 wt % to 3 wt %.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The dispersion assisting agent is exemplified by hexametaphosphate soda, oleic acid and monobasic calcium phosphate.
      <br/>
      The ph adjuster is exemplified by potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, morpholine and ammonia water.
      <br/>
      The rust-preventive agent is exemplified by a nitrogen-containing organic compound, such as a condensation product of alkanolamine-alkanolamine borate, monoethanol amine, diethanol amine, triethanol amine, alkanol amine borate or benzisothiazone.

    <p num="43">(Detection of End of Polishing)</p>
    <p num="44">A method of detecting an end point of polishing arranged to perform CMP polishing with which an insulating layer of a wafer incorporating a substrate having a metal-containing permalloy layer formed thereon and the insulating layer formed on the metal-containing permalloy layer is chemimechanically polished to expose the flat permalloy layer, the method of detecting an end point of polishing comprising the steps of: collecting abrasive material slurry on a surface plate 12a or w for polishing as a continuous flow from the start or during CMP polishing; continuously mixing a color developing reagent with the collected continuous flow to prepare a specimen for the continues flow; reading the color of the specimen as a digital value (Ii) by a color identifying sensor; and determining a moment of time at which the digital value (Ii) reaches a digital value (Io) of a specimen of a waste flow of the abrasive material slurry at the end of polishing to be the end of polishing.</p>
    <p num="45">
      The discharged metal-containing waste solution of the abrasive material slurry is added with the reagent which develops color in the presence of metal ions.
      <br/>
      If necessary, an oxidizer and a buffer are added to cause the waste solution of the abrasive material slurry to develop color.
      <br/>
      The developed color of the solution is read by the color identifying sensor and converted into a digital value.
    </p>
    <p num="46">When attention is focused on the iron which is the metal contained in the permalloy layer, the color value of the waste solution of the abrasive material slurry containing the compound caused to develop color by the reagent owing to iron ions is read.</p>
    <p num="47">
      That is, the iron ions serve as catalysts.
      <br/>
      If the density of the iron ions is high, the color developing reaction proceeds quickly.
      <br/>
      Thus, the color of the waste solution of the abrasive material slurry is changed as the density of the iron ions is raised.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the color value (Io) of the waste solution of the abrasive material slurry realized when the CMP polishing process has been completed is previously obtained by performing an experiment.
      <br/>
      The color value (Io) is input to the ROM of the central processing unit (CPU).
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The reagent for developing color in the presence of iron ions is exemplified by N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, N, N-diethyl-p-phenylene diamine, o-phenanthroline and sodium thiocynate.
      <br/>
      In particular, it is preferable that N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine or N,N-diethyl-p-phenylene diamine exhibiting excellent sensitivity with respect to iron ions is employed.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The color development of N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine is performed when the pH is 5.0 or higher, preferably 5.5 to 7.

      The buffer is added to the waste solution.
      <br/>
      The buffer is exemplified by mixture solution of acetic acid and sodium acetate, mixture solution of phosphoric acid and ammonium phosphate and mixture solution of sulfuric acid and ammonium sulfate.
      <br/>
      Since the N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine solution can easily be oxidized with air, it is preferable that the pH is previously brought to the acidic region by adding an acid material, such as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid.
      <br/>
      As an alternative to this, buffer is added to bring the pH to the acidic region.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Since color development of N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine is caused by oxidation, an oxidizer is added to quickly complete color development.
      <br/>
      As the oxidizer, hydrogen peroxide water is employed which is a low-cost material and which exhibits easy handling.

      Oxidation of the reagent causes two derivatives.
      <br/>
      As the polishing duration elapses, an amount of the iron ions for performing the catalyst action increase.
      <br/>
      Thus, according to the reaction proceeding, the color of the waste solution changes.
    </p>
    <p num="53">The color of the waste solution of the abrasive material slurry of the specimen is darkened from clouded color which is realized when no Fe ion is contained to light pink, light red purple and dark purple as the oxidation reaction of iron ions proceeds.</p>

      The color value (Io) of the waste solution of the abrasive material slurry which has been obtained by performing the experiment and realized when the CMP process has been completed is input to the ROM.

      For example, the digital color value of the waste solution of the abrasive material slurry of the specimen is set such that the digital value of the specimen of cloudy solution which does not contain any Fe ion and which is realized when the identification of the color of the specimen has been started by operating the color identifying sensor is set to 999.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the color value (Io) of light red purple of the waste solution of the abrasive material slurry which has been obtained by performing the experiment and which is realized when the CMP process has been completed is set to be 985 which is input to the ROM.

    <p num="56">
      When iron ions are contained in the abrasive material slurry, the color value (Io) of the waste solution of the abrasive material slurry realized when the polishing process has been completed is, as a matter of course, obtained by performing an experiment to input the obtained color value (Io).
      <br/>
      Therefore, the value does not always coincide with the foregoing value of, for example, 985.

      As a matter of course, the color of the waste solution of the abrasive material slurry realized when the CMP process has been completed is sometimes dark purple.
