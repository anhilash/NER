      The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family consists of extracellular proteinase with amino acid sequence homologies and similarities in protein domain organization, which have been implicated in a variety of tissue remodeling processes (Hembry, R. M., et al., Am. J. Pathol. 143(2):628-642(1993); Murphy, G., Acta Orthop.
      <br/>
      Scand. 66 (Suppl. 266):55-60 (1995)).
      <br/>
      One member of the MMP family is stromelysin-3, the expression of which has been associated with cutaneous wound healing (Okada, A., et al., Gene185:187-193 (1997)), mammary gland involution (Lefebvre, O., et al., J. Cell Biol. 119:997-1002 (1992)), cycling endometrium (Rodgers, W. H., et al., J. Clin. Invest. 94:946-953 (1994)), embryonic development (Lefebvre, O., et al., Development121:947-955 (1995)) and metamorphosis (Patterson, D., et al, Dev.
      <br/>
      Biol. 167:252-262 (1995)), where its expression was predominantly found in cells of mesodermal origin.
      <br/>
      In human carcinomas, stromelysin-3 was the first MMP identified as being expressed by stromal cells (Basset, P., et al, Nature348:699-704 (1990); Rouyer, N., et al., Metastasis14:269-275 (1994)).
      <br/>
      Although human stromelysin-3 appears to be unable to degrade any major component of the extracellular matrix (Pei, D., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269:25849-25855 (1994); Noel, A., et al, J. Biol. Chem 270:22866-22872 (1995)) and exhibits unusual activation properties (Pei, D., and Weiss, S. J., Nature375:244-247 (1995); Santavicca, M., et al., Biochem. J. 315:953-958 (1996)), its role in cancer progression is supported by high expression levels which are predictive of a poor clinical outcome (Engel, G., et al., Int. J. Cancer 58:830-835 (1994); Chenard, M.-P., et al., Int. J. Cancer 69(6):448-451 (1996)).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, stromelysin-3 has been shown to facilitate the tumor "take" of cancer cells in nude mice (Noel, A., et al., J. Clin. Invest. 97:1924-1930 (1996)).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Following the identification of stromelysin-3, a number of other MMPs were found to be expressed by stromal cells of human carcinomas (MacDougall, J. R., and Matrisian, L. M., Canc. Metast. Rev. 14:351-362 (1996)).
      <br/>
      Together, these results indicate that the production of MMPs by stromal cells represents a significant contribution to the overall proteolytic activities in malignant tumors (MacDougall, J. R., and Matrisian, L. M., Cancer Metastasis Rev. 14:351-362 (1996); Stetler-Stevenson, W. G., et al., Semin. Cancer Biol. 7:147-154 (1996), and references cited therein).
      <br/>
      Despite the observation that most stromal MMPs are expressed by fibroblastic cells, no regulatory sequence that could account for this cell-specific expression pattern has yet been identified in the promoter of the corresponding genes.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Retinoids</p>
    <p num="9">
      A number of studies have demonstrated that retinoids (vitamin A derivatives) are essential for normal growth, vision, tissue homeostasis, reproduction and overall survival (for reviews and references, See Sporn et al., The Retinoids, Vols. 1 and 2, Sporn et al., eds., Academic Press, Orlando, Fla. (1984)).
      <br/>
      For example, retinoids have been shown to be vital to the maintenance of skin homeostasis and barrier function in mammals (Fisher, G. J., and Voorhees, J. J., FASEB J. 10:1002-1013 (1996)).
      <br/>
      Retinoids are also apparently crucial during embryogenesis, since offspring of dams with vitamin A deficiency (VAD) exhibit a number of developmental defects (Wilson, J. G., et al., Am. J. Anat. 92:189-217 (1953); Morriss-Kay, G. M., and Sokolova, N., FASEB J. 10:961-968 (1996)).
      <br/>
      With the exceptions of those on vision (Wald, G., et al., Science 162:230-239 (1968)) and spermatogenesis in mammals (van Pelt, H. M. M., and De Rooij, D. G., Endocrinology 128:697-704 (1991)), most of the effects generated by VAD in animals and their fetuses can be prevented and/or reversed by retinoic acid (RA) administration (Wilson, J. G., et al. Am. J. Anat. 92:189-217 (1953); Thompson et al., Proc. Royal Soc. 159:510-535 (1964); Morriss-Kay, G. M., and Sokolova, N., FASEB J. 10:961-968 (1996)).
      <br/>
      The dramatic teratogenic effects of maternal RA administration on mammalian embryos (Shenefelt, R. E., Teratology 5, 103-108 (1972), Kessel, M., Development 115:487-501 (1992); Creech Kraft, J., In Retinoids in Normal Development and Teralogeniesis, G. M. Morriss-Kay, ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK, pp. 267-280 (1992)), and the marked effects of topical administration of retinoids on embryonic development of vertebrates and limb regeneration in amphibians (Mohanty-Hejmadi, et al., Nature 355:352-353 (1992); Tabin, C. J., Cell 66:199-217 (1991)), have contributed to the notion that RA may have critical roles in morphogenesis and organogenesis.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Retinoid Receptors</p>
    <p num="11">
      Except for those involved in visual perception (Wald, G. et al., Science 162:230-239 (1968)), the molecular mechanisms underlying the highly diverse effects of retinoids have until recently remained obscure.
      <br/>
      The discovery of nuclear receptors for RA (Petkovich et al., Nature 330:444-450 (1987); Giguere et al., Nature 330:624-629 (1987)) has greatly advanced the understanding of how the retinoids may exert their pleiotropic effects (Leid et al., TIBS 17:427-433 (1992); Linney, E., Current Topics in Dev.
      <br/>
      Biol. 27:309-350 (1992)).
      <br/>
      Since this discovery it has become apparent that the genetic activities of the RA signal are mediated through two families of receptors--the RAR family and the RXR family--which belong to the superfamily of ligand-inducible transcriptional regulatory factors that include steroid/thyroid hormone and vitamin D3 receptors (for reviews see Leid et al., TIBS 17:427-433 (1992); Chambon, P., Semin. Cell Biol. 5:115-125 (1994); Chambon, P., FASEB J. 10:940-954 (1996); Giguere, V., Endocrinol.
      <br/>
      Rev. 15:61-79 (1994); Mangelsdorf, D. J., and Evans, R. M., Cell 83:841-850 (1995); Gronemeyer, H., and Laudet, V., Protein Profile 2:1173-1236 (1995)).
    </p>
    <p num="12">RAR Receptors</p>
    <p num="13">
      Receptors belonging to the RAR family (RAR ALPHA ,  BETA  and  GAMMA  and their isoforms) ate activated by both all-trans- and 9-cis-RA (Leid et al., TIBS 17:427-433 (1992); Chambon, P., Semin. Cell Biol. 5:115-125 (1994); Dolle, P., et al., Mech. Dev. 45:91-104 (1994); Chambon, P., FASEB J. 10:940-954 (1996)).
      <br/>
      Within a given species, the DNA binding (C) and the ligand binding (E) domains of the three RAR types are highly similar, whereas the C-terminal domain F and the middle domain D exhibit no or little similarity.
      <br/>
      The amino acid sequences of the three RAR types are also notably different in their B regions, and their main isoforms ( ALPHA 1 and  ALPHA 2,  BETA 1 to  BETA 4, and  GAMMA 1 and  GAMMA 2) further differ in their N-terminal A regions (Leid et al., TIBS 17:427-433 (1992)).
      <br/>
      Amino acid sequence comparisons have revealed that the interspecies conservation of a given RAR type is greater than the similarity found between the three RAR types within a given species (Leid et al., TIBS 17:427-433 (1992)).
      <br/>
      This interspecies conservation is particularly striking in the N-terminal A regions of the various RAR ALPHA ,  BETA  and  GAMMA  isoforms, whose A region amino acid sequences are quite divergent.
      <br/>
      Taken together with the distinct spatio-temporal expression patterns observed for the transcripts of each RAR and RXR type in the developing embryo and in various adult mouse tissues (Zelent, A., et al., Nature 339:714-717 (1989); Dolle, P., et al., Nature 342:702-705 (1989); Dolle et al., Development 110:1133-1151 (1990); Ruberte et al., Development 108:213-222 (1990); Ruberte et al., Development 111:45-60 (1991); Mangelsdorf et al., Genes &amp; Dev. 6:329-344 (1992)), this interspecies conservation has suggested that each RAR type (and isoform) may perform unique functions.
      <br/>
      This hypothesis is further supported by the finding that the various RAR isoforms contain two transcriptional activation functions (AFs) located in the N-terminal A/B region (AF-1) and in the C-terminal E region (AF-2), which can synergistically, and to some extent differentially, activate various RA-responsive promoters (Leid et al., TIBS 17:427-433 (1992); Nagpal, S., et al., Cell 70:1007-1019 (1992); Nagpal, S., et al., EMBO J. 12:2349-2360 (1993)).
    </p>
    <p num="14">RXR Receptors</p>
    <p num="15">
      Unlike the RARs, members of the retinoid X receptor family (RXR ALPHA ,  GAMMA  and  GAMMA ) are activated exclusively by 9-cis-RA (Chambon, P., FASEB J. 10:940-954 (1996); Chambon, P., Semin. Cell Biol. 5:115-125 (1994); Dolle, P., et al., Mech. Dev. 45:91-104 (1994); Linney, E., Current Topics in Dev.

      Biol. 27:309-350 (1992); Leid et al., TIBS 17:427-433 (1992); Kastner et al., in Vitamin A in Health and Disease, R. Blomhoff, ed., Marcel Dekker, New York (1993)).
      <br/>
      However, the RXRs characterized to date are similar to the RARs in that the different RXR types also differ markedly in their N-terminal A/B regions (Leid et al., TIBS 17:427-433 (1992); Leid et al., Cell 68:377-395 (1992); Mangelsdorf et al., Genes and Dev. 6:329-344 (1992)), and contain the same transcriptional activation functions in their N-terminal A/B region and C-terminal E region (Leid et al., TIBS 17:427-433 (1992); Nagpal, S., et al., Cell 70:1007-1019 (1992); Nagpal, S., et al., EMBO J. 12:2349-2360 (1993)).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      RXR ALPHA  and RXR BETA  have a widespread (possibly ubiquitous) expression pattern during mouse development and in the adult animal, being found in all fetal and adult tissues thus far examined (Mangelsdorf, D. J., et al., Genes &amp; Devel. 6:329-344 (1992); Dolle, P., et al., Mech. Devel. 45:91-104 (1994); Nagata, T., et al., Gene 142:183-189 (1994)).
      <br/>
      RXR GAMMA  transcripts, however, appear to have a more restricted distribution, being expressed in developing skeletal muscle in the embryo (where their expression persists throughout life), in the heart (after birth), in sensory epithelia of the visual and auditory systems, in specific structures of the central nervous system, and in tissues involved in thyroid hormone homeostasis, e.g., the thyroid gland and thyrotrope cells in the pituitary (Mangelsdorf, D. J., et al., Gene &amp; Devel 6:329-344 (1992); Dolle, P., et al., Mech. Devel. 45:91-104 (1 994); Sugawara, A., et al., Endocritnology 136:1766-1774 (1995); Liu, Q., and Linney, E., Mol. Endocrinol. 7:651-658 (1993)).
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      It is currently unclear whether all the molecular properties of RXRs characterized in vitro are relevant for their physiological functions in vivo.
      <br/>
      In particular, it is unknown under what conditions these receptors act as 9-cis-RA-dependent tanscriptional regulators (Chambon, P., Semin. Cell Biol. 5:115-125 (1994)).
      <br/>
      The knock-outs of RXR ALPHA  and RXR BETA  in the mouse have provided some insight into the physiological functions of these receptors.
      <br/>
      For example, the ocular and cardiac malformations observed in RXR ALPHA -/- fetuses (Kastner, P., et al., Cell 78:987-1003 (1994); Sucov, H. M., et al., Genes &amp; Devel 8:1007-1018 (1994)) are similar to those found in the fetal VAD syndrome, thus suggesting an important function of RXR ALPHA  in the transduction of a retinoid signal during development The involvement of RXRs in retinoid signaling is further supported by studies of compound RXR ALPHA /RAR mutants, which reveal defects that are either absent or less severe in the single mutants (Kastner, P., et al., Cell 78:987-1003 (1994); Kastner, P., et al., Cell 83:859-869 (1995)).
      <br/>
      Interestingly, however, knockout of RXR GAMMA  in the mouse induces no overt deleterious effects, and RXR GAMMA -/- homozygote which are also RXR ALPHA -/- or RXR BETA -/- exhibit no additional abnormalities beyond those seen in RXR ALPHA -/-, RXR BETA -/- and fetal VAD syndrome fetuses (Krezel, W., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93(17):9010-9014 (1996)), suggesting that RXR GAMMA , despite its highly tissue-specific expression pattern in the developing embryo, is dispensable for embryonic development and postnatal life in the mouse.
      <br/>
      The observation that live-born RXR GAMMA -/- /RXR BETA -/- /RXR ALPHA -/- mutants can grow to reach adult age (Krezel et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93(17):9010-9014 (1996)) indicates that a single RXR ALPHA  allele is sufficient to carry out all of the vital developmental and postnatal functions of the RXR family of receptors, particularly all of the developmental functions which depend on RARs and may require RXR partnership (Dolle, P., et al., Mech. Dev. 45:91-104 (1994); Kastner, P., et al., Cell 83:859-869 (1995)).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the finding that RXR ALPHA -/- /RXR GAMMA -/- double mutant embryos are not more affected than are single RXR ALPHA -/- mutants (Krezel et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93(17):9010-9014 (1996)) clearly shows that RXR BETA  alone can also perform some of these functions.
      <br/>
      Therefore, i the fact that RXR ALPHA  alone and, to a certain extent RXR BETA  alone, are sufficient for the completion of a number of developmental RXR functions, clearly indicates the existence of a large degree of functional redundancy amongst RXRs.
      <br/>
      In this respect, the RXR situation is different from that of RARs, since all of types of RAR double mutants displayed much broader sets of defects than single mutants (Rowe, A., et al., Develop. 111:771-778 (1991); Lohnes, D., et al., Develop. 120:2723-2748 (1994); Mendelsohn, C., Develop. 120:2749-2771 (1994)).
    </p>
    <p num="18">Retinoid Binding to RAR and RXR Receptors</p>
    <p num="19">
      The crystal structures of the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of the RARs and RXRs have recently been elucidated (Bourget, W., et al., Nature 375:377-382 (1995); Renaud, J. P., et al., Nature 378:681-689 (1995); Wurtz, J. M., et al., Nature Struct.
      <br/>
      Biol. 3:87-94 (1996)).
      <br/>
      Among the various RAR types, substantial amino acid sequence identity is observed in these domains: comparison of the LBDs of RAR ALPHA , RAR BETA  and RAR GAMMA  indicates that only three amino acid residues are variable in the ligand-binding pocket of these receptors.
      <br/>
      These residues apparently account for the fact that the various RAR types exhibit some selectivity in binding certain synthetic retinoids (Chen, J.-Y., et al., EMBO J. 14(6):1187-1197 (1995): Renaud, J. P., et al., Nature 378:68 1-689 (1995)), and consideration of these divergent residues can be used to design RAR type-specific synthetic retinoids which may be agonistic or antagonistic (Chambon, P., FASEB J. 10:940-954 (1996)).
      <br/>
      This design approach may be extendable generally to other nuclear receptors, such as thyroid receptor  ALPHA  (Wagner, R. L., et al., Nature 378:690-697 (1995)), the ligand-binding pockets of which may chemically and structurally resemble those of the RARs (Chambon, P., FASEB J. 10:940-954 (1996)).
      <br/>
      Conversely, molecular modeling of the ligand-binding pocket of the RXRs demonstrates that there are no overt differences in amino acid composition between RXR ALPHA , RXR BETA  and RXR GAMMA  (Bourguet, W., et al., Nature 375:377-382 (1995); Wurtz, J. M., et al., Nature Struct.
      <br/>
      Biol. 3:87-94 (1996)), suggesting that design of type-specific synthetic ligands for the RXRs may be more difficult than for the RARs (Chambon, P., FASEB J. 10:940-954 (1996)).

    <p num="20">Retinoid Signaling Through RAR:RXR Heterodimers</p>
    <p num="21">
      Nuclear receptors (NRs) are members of a superfamily of ligand-inducible transcriptional regulatory factors that include receptors for steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, vitamin D3 and retinoids (Leid, M., et al., Trends Biochem.
      <br/>
      Sci. 17:427-433 (1992); Leid, M., et al., Cell 68:377-395 (1992); and Linney, E. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol., 27:309-350 (1992)).
      <br/>
      NRs exhibit a modular structure which reflects the existence of several autonomous functional domains.
      <br/>
      Based on amino acid d sequence similarity between the chicken estrogen receptor, the human estrogen and glucocorticoid receptors, and the v-erb-A oncogene (Krust, A., et al., EMBO J. 5:891-897 (1986)), defined six regions--A, B, C, D, E and F--which display different degrees of evolutionary conservation amongst various members of the nuclear receptor superfamily.
      <br/>
      The highly conserved region C contains two zinc fingers and corresponds to the core of the DNA-binding domain (DBD), which is responsible for specific recognition of the cognate response elements.
      <br/>
      Region E is functionally complex, since in addition to the ligand-binding domain (LBD), it contains a ligand-dependent activation function (AF-2) and a dimerization interface.
      <br/>
      An autonomous transcriptional activation function (AF-1) is present in the non-conserved N-terminal A/B regions of the steroid receptors.
      <br/>
      Interestingly, both AF-1 and AF-2 of steroid receptors exhibit differential transcriptional activation properties which appear to be both cell type and promoter context specific (Gronemeyer, H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 25:89-123 (1991)).
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As described above, the all-trans (t-RA) and 9-cis (9C-RA) retinoic acid signals are transduced by two families of nuclear receptors, RAR  ALPHA ,  BETA  and  GAMMA  (and their isoforms) are activated by both t-RA and 9C-RA, whereas RXR  ALPHA ,  BETA  and  GAMMA  are exclusively activated by 9C-RA (Allenby, G. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:30-34 (1993)).
      <br/>
      The three RAR types differ in their B regions, and their main isoforms ( ALPHA 1 and  ALPHA 2,  BETA 1-4, and  GAMMA 1 and  GAMMA 2) have different N-terminal A regions (Leid, M. et al., Trends Biochem.
      <br/>
      Sci. 17.427-433 (1992)).
      <br/>
      Similarly, the RXR types differ in their A/B regions (Mangelsdorf, D. J. et al., Genies Dev. 6:329-344 (1992)).
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The E-region of RARs and RXRs has also been shown to contain a dimerization interface (Yu, V. C. et al., Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 3:597-602 (1992)).
      <br/>
      Most interestingly, it was demonstrated that RAR/RXR heterodimers bind much more efficiently in vitro than homodimers of either receptor to a number of RA response elements (RAREs) (Yu, V. C. et al., Cell 67:1251-1266 (1991); Berrodin, T. J. et al., Mol. Endocrinol 6:1468-1478 (1992); Bugge, T. H. et al., EMBO J. 11:1409-1418 (1992); Hall, R. K. et al., Mol Cell. Biol. 12: 5527-5535 (1992); Hallenbeck, P. L. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:5572-5576 (1992); Husmann, M. et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 187:1558-1564 (1992); Kliewer, S. A. et al., Nature 355:446-449 (1992); Leid, M. et al., Cell 68:377 395 (1992); Marks, M. S. et al., EMBO J. 11:1419-1435 (1992); Zhang, X. K. et al., Nature 355:441-446 (1992)).
      <br/>
      RAR and RXR heterodimers are also preferentially formed in solution in vitro (Yu, V. C. et al., Cell 67:1251-1266 (1991); Leid, M. et al., Cell 68:377-395 (1992); Marks, M. S. et al., EMBO J. 11:1419-1435 (1992)), although the addition of 9C-RA appears to enhance the formation of RXR homodimers in vitro (Lehman, J. M. et al., Science 258:1944-1946 (1992); Zhang, X. K. et al., Nature 358:587-591 (1992b)).
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      It has been shown that activation of RA-responsive promoters likely occurs through RAR:RXR heterodimers rather than through homodimers (Yu, V. C. et al., Cell 67:1251-1266 (1991); Leid et al., Cell 68:377-395 (1992b); Durand et al., Cell 71:73-85 (1992); Nagpal et al., Cell 70:1007-1019 (1992); Zhang, X. K, et al., Nature 355, 441-446 (1992); Kliewer et al., Nature 355:446-449 (1992); Bugge et al., EMBO J. 11:1409-1418 (1992); Marks et al., EMBO J. 11:1419-1435 (1992); Yu, V. C. et al., Cur. Op. Biotech. 3:597-602 (1992); Leid et al., TIBS 17:427-433 (1992); Laudet and Stehelin, Curr.
      <br/>
      Biol. 2:293-295 (1992); Green, S., Nature 361:590-591 (1993)).
      <br/>
      The RXR portion of these heterodimers has been proposed to be silent in retinoid-induced signaling (Kurokawa. R., et al., Nature 371:528-531 (1994); Forman, B. M., et al., Cell 81:541-550 (1995); Mangelsdorf, D. J., and Evans, R. M., Cell 83:835-850 (1995)), although conflicting results have been reported on this issue (Apfel, C. M., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270(51):30765-30772 (1995); see Chambon, P., FASEB J. 10:940-954 (1996) for review).
      <br/>
      Although the results of these studies strongly suggest that RAR/RXR heterodimers are indeed functional units that transduce the RA signal in vivo, it is unclear whether all of the suggested heterodimeric combinations occur in vivo (Chambon, P., Semin. Cell Biol. 5:115-125 (1994)).
      <br/>
      Thus, the basis for the highly pleiotropic effect of retinoids may reside, at least in part, in the control of different subsets of retinoid-responsive promoters by cell-specifically expressed heterodimeric combinations of RAR:RXR types (and isoforms), whose activity may be in turn regulated by cell-specific levels of all-trans- and 9 cis-RA (Leid et al., TIBS 17:427-433 (1992)).
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The RXR receptors may also be involved in RA-independent signaling.
      <br/>
      For example, the observation of aberrant lipid metabolism in the Sertoli cells of RXR BETA -/- mutant animals suggests that functional interactions may also occur between RXR BETA  and the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway (WO 94/26100; Kastner, P., et al., Genes &amp; Devel. 10:80-92 (1996)).
    </p>
    <p num="26">Retinoid Signaling and MMP Gene Expression</p>
    <p num="27">
      While MMP gene expression can be induced in human fibroblasts by agents such as phorbol ester (TPA) or growth factors (Basset, P., et al., Nature 348:699-704 (1990); Okada, A., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:2730-2734 (1995)), very little is known about the mechanisms regulating this expression.
      <br/>
      The stromelysin-3 gene has recently been isolated and characterized (Anglard, P., et al., J Biol. Chem. 270:20337-20344 (1995)), and the proximal promoter of this gene shown to differ from those of other MMPS by the absence of a consensus AP1 (c-jun/c-fos) binding site and the presence of a retinoic acid responsive element (RARE) of the DR1 type (DR1-RARE).
      <br/>
      This DR1-RARE can be transactivated by retinoid receptors (RARs/RXRs) in a ligand-dependent manner in transfected COS-1 cells.
      <br/>
      In contrast, AP1 binding sites were found to play a crucial role in controlling both the activation of other MMP gene promoters in response to growth factors and cytokines (McDonnell, S. E., et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 10:42:34-4293 (1990); Lafyatis, R., et al., Mol. Endocrinol. 4:973-980 (1990)), and their inhibition by retinoic acid (RA) (Lafyatis, R., et al., Mol. Endocrinol. 4:973-980 (1990); Nicholson, R. C., et al., EMBO J. 9:4443-4454 (1990); Fanjul, A., et al., Nature 372:107-111 (1994)).
      <br/>
      Gene transcription studies have shown that while RARs and RXRs can induce transcriptional activation through specific DNA binding sites, they can also interact indirectly with AP1 through transcriptional mediators, in order to repress gene transcription (Yang-Yen, H. F., et al., New. Biol. 3:1206-1219 (1991); Pfahl, M., Endocr. Rev. 14:651-658 (1993); Chen, J.-Y., et al., EMBO J. 14:1187-1197 (1995)).
      <br/>
      In agreement with these findings, inhibition of baseline and TPA-induced RNA expression by RA has been reported for interstitial collagenase (Lafyatis, R., et al., Mol. Endocrinol. 4:973-980(1990)) and stromelysin-1 (Nicholson, R. C., et al., EMBO J. 9:4443-4154 (1990)).
      <br/>
      However, many retinoids which inhibit the expression of interstitial collagenase and other AP1-containing MMP genes simultaneously activate stromelysin-3 (Anglard, P., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270(35):20337-20344 (1995)).
      <br/>
      Thus, identification of potential therapeutic compounds which inhibit interstitial collagenase (and other AP1-binding site-containing genes) while not inducing, or only moderately inducing, stromelysin-3 (and other RARE-containing genes) has proven to be difficult.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Therapeutic Uses of Retinoids</p>
    <p num="29">
      As retinoic acid is known to regulate the proliferative and differentiative capacities of several mammalian cell types (Gudas, L. J., et al., In The Retinoids, 2nd ed., Sporn, M. B., et al., eds., New York: Raven Press, pp. 443-520 (1994)), retinoids are used in a variety of chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic settings.
      <br/>
      The prevention of oral, skin and head and neck cancers in patients at risk for these tumors has been reported (Hong, W. K. et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 315:1501-1505 (1986); Hong, W. K. et al., N.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="37">Overview</p>
    <p num="38">
      The present invention provides methods for the screening of one or more compositions to select a composition capable of differentially modulating the expression of a first and a second mammalian genes.
      <br/>
      By "differentially modulating the expression of a first and second mammalian genes" is meant that the composition affects (induces, inhibits or has no activity on) the expression of the first mammalian gene to a different extent than the composition affects the expression of the second mammalian gene.
      <br/>
      For example, a compound is said to "differentially modulate" the expression of a first and second mammalian genes in a mammalian cell if it inhibits the expression of the first mammalian gene by at least 50% (when compared to the expression of that same gene in a control cell not treated with the compound) while inducing the expression of the second mammalian gene by three-fold or less (again, compared to the level of expression of the second gene in a control cell).
      <br/>
      Of course, a compound is said to "differentially modulate" the expression of these genes if it induces the expression of both genes (at different levels), inhibits the expression of both genes (at different levels), induces one and inhibits the other, induces one and has no effect on the other, or inhibits one and has no effect on the other.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      According to the invention, the first mammalian gene preferably comprises at least one AP1-binding site and is more preferably a matrix metalloproteinase gene and most preferably an interstitial collagenase gene, and the second mammalian gene comprises at least one RARE and is most preferably a stromelysin-3 gene.
      <br/>
      In general, the methods of the invention comprise obtaining cells comprising the first and second genes, contacting the cells with one or more of the compositions to be assayed, determining the levels of expression of the genes in the cells contacted with the compositions to be assayed, comparing the levels of expression of the genes in these cells to those in control cells not contacted with the compositions, and selecting a composition demonstrating the ability to inhibit the expression of a first gene by at least 50% while only inducing the expression of a second gene by less than about three-fold.

      <br/>
      The compositions selected according to the methods of the invention may further comprise at least one RAR agonist or RAR antagonist, preferably at least one RAR ALPHA  agonist which is most preferably BMS753.

      (d) comparing the levels of expression of said first and second genes in said first mammalian cell to the levels of expression of said first and second genes in said second mammalian cell; and
      <br/>
      (e) selecting a composition wherein the level of expression of said first gene in said first mammalian cell is at least about 50% lower than the level of expression of said first gene in said second mammalian cell, and wherein the level of expression of said second gene in said first mammalian cell is no greater than about three-fold higher than the level of expression of said second gene in said second mammalian cell.

    <p num="45">Screening Methods</p>
    <p num="46">
      The first and second mammalian cells used in the present selection methods may be normal cells, diseased cells, transformed cells or established cell lines, and may be epithelial cells, stromal cells (e.g., fibroblasts), stem cells, neuronal cells, osteocytes, chondrocytes, cancer cells (e.g., carcinoma, sarcoma or leukemia cells) and the like.
      <br/>
      According to the invention, the first and second mammalian cells are of the same type and undergo the same incubation conditions, except that the first mammalian cell is contacted with one or more of the compositions to be assayed for its ability to differentially modulate the expression of the two or more genes in the cell, while the second mammalian cell is incubated in parallel with the first cell but in the absence of the one or more compositions to be assayed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the second mammalian cell serves as a "control" cell to indicate the levels of expression of the two or more genes typically seen in that particular cell type in the absence of the compositions to be assayed, and provides a reference for determining the effects of the compositions on gene expression.
      <br/>
      As an alternative to using normal, diseased or established cells, transfected cell lines may be constructed and used in the methods of the invention.
      <br/>
      For example, in Chen et al., EMBO J. 14(6):1187-1197 (1995), three `reporter` cell lines have been used to characterize a number of RAR ALPHA -, RAR BETA -, or RAR GAMMA -specific dissociating synthetic retinoids that selectively induce the AF-2 activation function present in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of RAR BETA  ( BETA AF-2).
      <br/>
      These cell lines stably express chimeric proteins containing the DNA binding domain of the yeast transactivator GAL4 fused to the EF regions (which contain that LBD and the AF-2 activation function) of RAR ALPHA  (GAL-RAR ALPHA ), RAR BETA  (GAL-RAR BETA ) or RAR GAMMA  (GAL-RAR GAMMA ), and a luciferase reporter gene driven by a pentamer of the GAL4 recognition sequence ("17 m") in front of the  BETA -globin promoter (17 m) 5-GAL-Luc).
      <br/>
      In these cell lines, the RAR ligands thus induce luciferase activity that can be measured in the intact cells using a single-photon-counting camera.
      <br/>
      This reporter system is insensitive to endogenous receptors which cannot recognize the GAL4 binding site.
      <br/>
      Using analogous screening assays, these synthetic retinoids, like RA, have been reported to inhibit the anchorage-independent growth of oncogene-transformed 3T3 cells, while the promoter of the human interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene, whose product is involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis, immune responses and inflammation (Kishimoto, T. et al., Science 258:593-597 (1992)), has been shown to be induced by RA but not by the synthetic dissociating retinoids which repressed its activity.
      <br/>
      In a similar manner, RXR agonists have been identified using cell lines that express a RXR receptor linked to a TREpal-tk reporter gene which is activated by both RAR-RXR heterodimers and RXR homodimers (Lehmann, J. M., et al., Science 258:1944-1946 (1992)).
      <br/>
      Thus, reporter cell lines that are easily constructed, by methods routine to one of ordinary skill, may be used to distinguish not only the specific RAR or RXR types to which a candidate ligand will bind, but also whether that binding induces an activating or inhibiting (i.e., agonistic or antagonistic) effect.
      <br/>
      Although the above-referenced reporter cell lines comprised the luciferase or thymidine kinase genes as reporters, other reporters such as Neo, CAT,  BETA -galactosidase or Green Fluorescent Protein are well known in the art and may be used in a similar fashion to carry our the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, the use of CAT reporters to measure retinoic acid inhibition of stromelysin-1 gene expression has been reported (Nicholson, R. C., et al., EMBO J. 9(13):4443-4454 (1990)), and CAT reporters have been used in the methods of the present invention to examine RAR and RXR modulation of MMP gene expression, particularly of stromelysin-3 gene expression, as shown below in Example 4.

    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Other routine assays have been used to screen compounds for their agonistic properties on functions of other nuclear receptors, such as steroid receptors.
      <br/>
      For example, a transient expression/gel retardation system has been used to study the effects of the synthetic steroids RU486 and R5020 on glucocorticoid and progesterone receptor function (Meyer, M-E., et al., EMBO J. 9(12): 3923-3932 (1990)).
      <br/>
      Similar assays have been used to show that tamoxifen competitively inhibits estradiol-induced ERAP160 binding to the estrogen receptor, suggesting a mechanism for its growth-inhibitory effects in breast cancer (Halachimi, S., et al., Science 264:1455-1458 (1994)).
      <br/>
      Since the RAR and RKR receptors are apparently structurally similar to other nuclear receptors such as the steroid receptors (as reviewed in Chambon, P., FASEB J. 10:940-954 (1996)), routine assays of this type may be useful in assessing compounds for their abilities to modulate gene expression through RARs or RXRs.
    </p>
    <p num="48">As an alternative routine method, the effect of a candidate compound or compositor on the binding of the ligand-dependent AF-2 modulator TIF1 to a RAR or RXR LBD can be studied using glutathione-S-transferase (GST) interaction assays by tagging the LBDs with GST as described in detail in Le Douarin et al., EMBO J. 14:2020-2033 (1995).</p>
    <p num="49">
      In another screening assay, transgenic mice and cell lines that are altered in their expression of one or more RAR or RXR receptors may be made as described previously (Krezel, W., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93(17):9010-9014 (1996)) and may be used to identify agonists of specific members of the RAR/RXR class of receptors using methods described previously (WO 94/26100).
      <br/>
      In such an assay, the agent which is to be tested will be incubated with one or more of the transgenic cell lines or mice or tissues derived therefrom.
      <br/>
      The level of binding of the agent is then determined, or the effect the agent has on development or gene expression is monitored, by techniques that are routine to those of ordinary skill.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term "incubate" is defined as contacting the compound or agent under investigation with the appropriate cell or tissue, or administering the agent or compound to the appropriate mouse, via any one of the well-known routes of administration including enteral, intravenous, subcutaneous, and intramuscular.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Other assays, such as those described in detail below in the Examples, may also be used to predict the modulatory effects of RAR and RXR ligands on mammalian gene expression by determining the agonistic effects of these ligands on other targets.
      <br/>
      For example, certain agonistic retinoids will induce the association of endogenous PML/PML-RAR ALPHA  fusion protein with nuclear bodies in cells from APL patients (Dyck, J. A., et al., Cell 76:333-343 (1994); Weis, K., et al., Cell 76:345-356 (1994); Koken, M. H. M., et al., EMBO J. 13(5):1073-1083 (1994)) or in related established cell lines such as NB4 (Lanotte, M., et al., Blood 77(5):1080-1086 (1991)).
      <br/>
      These effects of RAR or RXR agonists or antagonists may be determined, for example, by various immunological techniques such as immunofluorescent or immunoelectron microscopy, using antibodies specific for PML, RAR and/or PML-RAR ALPHA  fusion proteins.
      <br/>
      RAR or RXR agonists may also be identified by their abilities to induce the in vitro differentiation (maturation) of certain established cell lines such as HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells (Nagy, L., et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 15(7):3540-3551 (1995)), NB4 promyelocytic cells (Lanotte, M., et al., Blood 77(5):1080-1086 (1991), P19 or F9 embryonic carcinoma cells (Roy, B., et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 15(12):6481-6487 (1995); Horn, V., et al., FASEB J. 10:1071-1077 (1996)), or ras-transformed 3T3 cells (Chen et al., EMBO J. 14(6):1187-1197 (1995)).
      <br/>
      Ligand-induced differentiation in these and other cell lines may be determined by assaying ligand-treated or -untreated cells for the expression of a variety of well-known markers of differentiation as generally described in the above references.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Similarly, the candidate compounds may be screened by measuring their abilities to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in, for example, HL-60 cells (Nagy, L., et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 15(7):3540-3551 (1995)) or P19 cells (Horn, V., et al., FASEB J. 10:1071-1077 (1996)), or in other primary cells or established cell lines.
      <br/>
      A poptosis is typically assessed by measurement of ligand-induced DNA fragmentati on, which is accomplished by methods such as gel electrophoresis (appearance of smaller molecular weight bands), microscopy (changes in plasma membrane morphology such as formation of surface protruberances ("blebbing") or in nuclear morphology such as pycnosis or fragmentation) or expression of the putative apaptosis suppressive protein BCL-2 (decreased in apoptotic cells); for general methods and discussions of these assays as they pertain to RAR and RXR biology: see Nagy, L , et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 15(7):3540-3551 (1995); Horn, V., et al., FASEB J. 10:1071-1077 (1996)).
      <br/>
      Other methods for assaying ligand-induced apoptosis in primary cells and established cell lines, such as flow cytometry or particle analysis (appearance of smaller particles with different light scatter and, or DNA content profiles), are well-known in the art (Telford, W. G., et al., J Immunol.
      <br/>
      Meth. 172(1):1-16 (1994); Campana, D., et al., Cytometry 18(2):68-74 (1994); Sgonc, R., and Wick, G., Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 105(4):327-332 (1994); Fraker, P. J., et al., Meth.

J., Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 6(2):198-202 (1995)).
      <br/>
      Screening of agonists may also be accomplished by an assay known as "in vivo footprinting" (Mueller, P. R., and Wold, B., Science 246:780-786 (1989); Garrity, P. A., and Wold, B. J., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:1021-1025 (1992)), which has proven useful for analysis of RA-induced transcription of RAR BETA 2 (Dey, A., et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 14(12):8191-8201 (1994)).
    </p>
    <p num="52">Finally, the effects of candidate compositions or compounds on mammalian gene expression, particularly on MMP gene expression, may be determined in cellular or animal models using assays that directly measure increases in MMP protein levels in extracellular fluid (e.g., culture media) or tissue samples by immunological or immunohistochemical techniques (see, e.g., Hembry, R. M., et al., Am. J. Pathol. 143(2):628-642 (1993)).</p>
    <p num="53">
      Other methods for determining the ability of a candidate ligand to modulate mammalian gene expression, particularly MMP gene expression, which are routine in the art, may also be used in carrying out the present invention.
      <br/>
      In performing such assays, one skilled in the art will be able to determine which RAR or RXR receptor type an agent binds to, what specific receptor(s) are utilized by a given compound, whether the agent is an agonist or an antagonist of the given receptor(s), and whether the compound or combination of compounds are capable of differentially modulating mammalian gene expression.

      Preferably, the first and second mammalian genes to be modulated by the compounds identified or selected according to the methods of the invention are a first mammalian gene which preferably comprises at least one AP1-binding site, and a second mammalian gene which preferably comprises at least one retinoic acid response element (RARE).
      <br/>
      Preferred AP1-binding site-containing genes according to the invention include matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)genes, growth factor response genes, cytokine response genes and the like.

      More preferable AP1-binding) site-containing genes according to the invention are MMP genes, including but not limited to those genes encoding interstitial collagenase, stromelysin-1, stromelysin-2, matrilysin and gelatinase B; most preferable is an interstitial collagenase gene.
      <br/>
      Preferred AP1-binding site-containing genes according to the invention include MWP genes, particularly a stromelysin-3 gene.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      According to the invention, the first mammalian cell, but not the second mammalian cell, is contacted with the one or more compositions to be assayed.
      <br/>
      The levels cf expression of the first mammalian gene (preferably comprising one or more AP1-binding sites) and of the second mammalian gene (preferably comprising one or more RAREs) are then determined in the first and second cells according to one or more of the above-described assays.
      <br/>
      The level of expression of the first gene in the first cell is then compared to the level of expression of the first gene in the second (control) cell; this comparison is then repeated for the second gene in each cell.
      <br/>
      A compound or composition is then selected as differentially modulating the expression of the first and second genes if:
      <br/>
      (a) the level of expression of the first gene in the first cell is at least about 50% lower, preferably at least about 55% lower, more preferably at least about 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 83%, 85%, 87%, 90%, 95% or 99% lower, than the level of expression of the first gene in the second (control) cell; and
      <br/>
      (b) the level of expression of the second gene in the first cell is no greater than about three-fold, more preferably no greater than about two-fold or about one-fold, higher than the level of expression of the second gene in the second (control) cell.

      Thus, the methods of the invention may be used to select or identify one or more compounds or compositions that are capable of differentially modulating the expression of two or more genes.
      <br/>
      Compounds or compositions selected according to these methods can be, but are not limited to, peptides, carbohydrates, steroids and vitamin derivatives, which may each be natural or synthetic, and are preferably retinoids or retinoid derivatives that bind to one or more RARs or RXRs.
      <br/>
      The agents can be selected and screened at random, or can be rationally selected or rationally designed using protein modeling techniques.
      <br/>
      For random screening, agents such as peptides, carbohydrates, steroids or vitamin derivatives (e.g., derivatives of RA) are selected at random and are assayed, using direct or indirect methods that are routine in the art, for their ability to bind to a RAR or RXR receptor or a functional retinoid RAR:RXR receptor heterodimer.
      <br/>
      For example, candidate RAR agonists according to the present invention include synthetic retinoids such as Am580, Compound 1 and Compound 2 (the structures of which are disclosed in Ostrowski et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:1812-1816 (1995), which is incorporated herein in its entirety), Am80 or CD666 (Roy et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 15(12):6481-6487 (1995)), and BMS753 (Taneja, R., et al., Proc.

      Since highly purified RAR and RXR proteins are now available, X-ray crystallography and NMR-imaging techniques, or techniques based on a computer model of the LBD of one or more RAR or RXR receptor types, can be used to identify the structure of the ligand binding site present on these proteins and, by extension, that which is specifically present on one or more RAR or RXR receptor types.
      <br/>
      For example, the crystal structure of the ligand binding domains of certain nuclear receptors have been described.
      <br/>
      In particular, the crystal structure of the RXR LBD is described in Bourguet et al., Nature 375:377-382 (1995), and the crystal structure of the RAR LBD is described in Renaud et al., Nature 378:681-689 (1995).
      <br/>
      Using information from the crystal structure of a RAR or RXR, computer programs are available that allow one to "rationally design" candidate agonists which would likely bind to the receptor ligand binding domains (Hodgson, Biotechnology 8:1245-1247 (1990); Hodgson, Biotechnology 9:609-613 (1991)).

    <p num="84">Clinical Indications</p>
    <p num="85">
      Thus, methods for identifying compositions or compounds capable of differentially modulating the expression of two or more mammalian genes are provided by the present invention.
      <br/>
      The compounds or compositions identified according to these methods may then be used, in another preferred embodiment of the invention, in methods for the treatment of a variety of physical disorders in animals (particularly mammals including humans) that are predisposed to or suffering from a physical disorder that may be delayed, prevented, cured or otherwise treated by differentially modulating the expression of two or more genes in the mammal, preferably by differentially modulating the expression of two or more MMP genes and most preferably by differentially modulating the expression of an interstitial collagenase gene and a stromelysin-3 gene.
      <br/>
      As used herein, an animal that is "predisposed to" a physical disorder is defined as an animal that does not exhibit a plurality of overt physical symptoms of the disorder but that is genetically, physiologically or otherwise at risk for developing the disorder.
      <br/>
      The compositions identified by the methods of the invention, which preferably comprise at least one RXR agonist (more preferably a pan-RXR agonist and most preferably BMS649) or at least one RXR antagonist, and which may further comprise at least one RAR agonist (more preferably a RAR ALPHA  agonist and most preferably BMS753) or at least one RAR antagonist, may thus be used prophylactically as chemopreventive agents for such disorders.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      According to the invention, a mammal (preferably a human) that is predisposed to or suffering from a physical disorder may be treated by administering to the animal an effective dose of a composition or compound selected according to the above-described methods of the invention, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient therefor (as described Delow).
      <br/>
      Physical disorders treatable with the compositions and methods of the present invention include any physical disorder that may be delayed, prevented cured or otherwise treated by modulating MMP gene expression in an animal suffering from or predisposed to the physical disorder.
      <br/>
      Such physical disorders include, but are not limited to, a variety of carcinomas and other cancers, such as skin cancers (including melanomas and Kaposi's Sarcoma), oral cavity cancers, lung cancers, breast cancers, prostatic cancers, bladder cancers, liver cancers, pancreatic cancers, cervical cancers, ovarian cancers, head and neck cancers, colon cancers, germ cell cancers (including teratocarcinomas) and leukemias.
      <br/>
      Other physical disorders treatable by the methods of the present invention include inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosis, pelvic inflammatory disease and Crohn's disease.
      <br/>
      The methods of the invention may also be used to treat an animal suffering from or predisposed to a fibrotic disorder or disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, endomyocardial fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis (particularly hepatic cirrhosis), myelofibrosis, scleroderma and systemic sclerosis.
      <br/>
      Other physical disorders treatable by the methods of the invention include osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, and ocular disorders such as corneal ulceration and diabetic retinopathy.
      <br/>
      The methods of the present invention may also be used in the prevention of disease progression, such as in chemoprevention of the progression of a premalignant lesion to a malignant lesion, and to treat an animal suffering from, or predisposed to, other physical disorders that respond to treatment with compositions that differentially modulate gene expression, particularly those that differentially modulate MMP gene expression and most particularly those that inhibit interstitial collagenase gene expression by at least 50% while only moderately inducing (i.e., by three-fold or less) stromelysin-3 gene expression.
    </p>
    <p num="87">Formulation and Methods of Administration</p>
    <p num="88">
      As indicated above, compositions and compounds selected according to the methods of the invention, such as RAR- and RXR-selective ligands, are known to elicit a wide array of cellular responses, several of which have clinical applications in treating a patient.
      <br/>
      The term "patient" as used herein is defined as an animal, preferably a mammal, including a human.
      <br/>
      As used herein, "an effective amount of a RAR (or RXR) agonist" is defined as an amount effective to elicit a cellular response in cells which express a RAR (or RXR) receptor.
      <br/>
      Example clinical therapies which involve administering compositions comprising at least one RAR agonist and at least one RXR agonist to a patient are discussed in more detail below.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The therapeutic methods of the invention thus use pharmaceutical composition comprising a composition selected for its ability to differentially modulate the expression of two or more mammalian genes as described above, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient therefor, which may be administered orally, rectally, parenterally, intrasystemically, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, drops or transdermal patch), bucally, or as an oral or nasal spray.
      <br/>
      Preferred such compositions comprise at least one agonist (preferably a pan-RXR agonist and most preferably BMS649) or at least one RXR antagonist, and may optionally further comprise at least one PRR agonist (preferably a RAR ALPHA  agonist and most preferably BMS753) or at least one RAR antagonist.
      <br/>
      Importantly, by co-administering a RXR agonist and/or antagonist, and a RAR agonist and/or antagonist, clinical side effects can be reduced by using lower doses of both the RAR-binding compound and the RXR-binding compound.
      <br/>
      It will be understood that the RXR agonist or antagonist can be "co-administered" either before, after, or simultaneously with the RAR agonist or antagonist, depending on the exigencies of a particular therapeutic application.
      <br/>
      By "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" is meant a non-toxic solid, semisolid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type.
      <br/>
      The term "parenteral" as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      Pharmaceutical compositions used in the methods of the present invention for parenteral injection can comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene ,lycol, and the like), carboxymethylcellulose and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil), and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate.
      <br/>
      Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      The pharmaceutical compositions used in the methods of the present invention may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents.
      <br/>
      Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like.
      <br/>
      It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like.
      <br/>
      Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drugs, it is desirable to slow the absorption from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.
      <br/>
      This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility.
      <br/>
      The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Injestable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide.
      <br/>
      Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled.
      <br/>
      Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides).
      <br/>
      Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.
    </p>
    <p num="94">The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.</p>

      They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.
      <br/>
      Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.
    </p>
    <p num="98">The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-mentioned excipients.</p>
    <p num="99">
      Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs.
      <br/>
      In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="100">Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.</p>
    <p num="101">Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p num="102">
      Topical administration includes administration to the skin or mucosa, including surfaces of the lung and eye.
      <br/>
      Compositions for topical administration, including those for inhalation, may be prepared as a dry powder which may be pressurized or non-pressurized.
      <br/>
      In nonpressurized powder compositions, the active ingredients in finely divided form may be used in admixture with a larger-sized pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier comprising particles having a size, for example, of up to 100  MU m in diameter.
      <br/>
      Suitable inert carriers include sugars such as lactose.
      <br/>
      Desirably, at least 95% by weight of the particles of the active ingredient have an effective particle size in the range of 0.01 to 10  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition may be pressurized and contain a compressed gas, such as nitrogen or a liquefied gas propellant.
      <br/>
      The liquefied propellant medium and indeed the total composition is preferably such that the active ingredients do not dissolve therein to any substantial extent.
      <br/>
      The pressurized composition may also contain a surface active agent.
      <br/>
      The surface active agent may be a liquid or solid non-ionic surface active agent or may be a solid anionic surface active agent.
      <br/>
      It is preferred to use the solid anionic surface active agent in the form of a sodium salt.

    <p num="104">
      A further form of topical administration is to the eye.

    <p num="105">Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the RXR agonist(s)/antagonist(s) and optionally the RAR agonist(s)/antagonist(s) with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the drugs.</p>
    <p num="106">
      The pharmaceutical compositions used in the present therapeutic methods may also be administered in the form of liposomes.
      <br/>
      As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances.
      <br/>
      Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium.
      <br/>
      Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used.
      <br/>
      The present pharmaceutical compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to the RXR agonist(s)/anttagonist(s) and optionally the RAR agonist(s)/antagonist(s), stabilizers, preservatives, excipients, and the like.
      <br/>
      The preferred lipids are the phospholipids and the phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic.
      <br/>
      Methods to form liposomes are known in the art (see, e.g., Prescott, E., Meth. Cell Biol. 14:33 (1976)).
    </p>
    <p num="107">Dosaging</p>
    <p num="108">
      By the invention, a RXR agonist or antagonist can be administered in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo to cells to enhance the cellular response to a RAR agonist or antagonist.
      <br/>
      One of ordinary skill will appreciate that effective amounts of a RXR agonist or antagonist and a RAR agonist or antagonist can be determined empirically and may be employed in pure form or, where such forms exist, in pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug form.
      <br/>
      The RXR agonist(s)/antagonist(s) and RAR agonist(s)/antagonist(s) may be administered to a patient in need thereof as pharmaceutical compositions in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.
      <br/>
      It will be understood that, when administered to a human patient, the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgement.
      <br/>
      The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the type and degree of the cellular response to be achieved; activity of the specific RXR agonist/antagonist and RAR agonist/antagonist employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the RXR agonist/antagonist and RAR agonist/antagonist; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific RXR agonist/antagonist and RAR agonist/antagonist; and like factors well known in the medical arts.
      <br/>
      For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of RXR agonists/antagonists and/or RAR agonists/antagonists at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosages until the desired effect is achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      For example, satisfactory results are obtained by oral administration of a RXR agonist/antagonist and a RAR agonist/antagonist at dosages on the order of from 0.05 to 10 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.1 to 7.5 mg/kg/day, more preferably 0.1 to 2 mg/kg/day, administered once or, in divided doses, 2 to 4 times per day.
      <br/>
      On administration parenterally, for example by i.v. drip or infusion, dosages on the order of from 0.01 to 5 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.05 to 1.0 mg/kg/day and more preferably 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg/day can be used.
      <br/>
      Suitable daily dosages for patients are thus on the order of from 2.5 to 500 mg p.o., preferably 5 to 250 mg p.o., more preferably 5 to 100 mg p.o., or on the order of from 0.5 to 250 mg i.v., preferably 2.5 to 125 mg i.v. and more preferably 2.5 to 50 mg i.v.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      Dosaging may also be arranged in a patient-specific manner to provide a predetermined concentration of a RXR agonist/antagonist and/or RAR agonist/antagonist in the blood, as determined by techniques accepted and routine in the art (HPLC is preferred).
      <br/>
      Thus patient dosaging may be adjusted to achieve regular on-going blood levels, as measured by HPLC, on the order of from 50 to 1000 ng/ml, preferably 150 to 500 ng/ml.

    <p num="127">Stimulation of Stromelysin-3 and Inhibition of Interstitial Collagenave RNA Expression by Retinoic Acid in Fibroblasts</p>
    <p num="128">
      Since a RARE that conferred ST3 promoter inducibility in COS-1 cells in the presence of RA and its receptors has been previously identified (Anglard, P., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:20337-20344 (1995)), the question of whether stromelysin-3 gene expression was also regulated by RA in human fibroblasts was evaluated in the present studies.
      <br/>
      Time course and dose response experiments were performed., and expression of the stromelysin-3 gene was compared to that of interstitial collagenase by Northern blot analysis in HFL1 fibroblasts exposed to 9-cis-RA (9C-RA) in the presence of 5% calf serum.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      As shown in FIG. 1A, in the presence of 1  MU M 9C-RA, stromelysin-3 RNA levels progressively increased from day 1 to day 4, with a 20-fold increase measured after four days of incubation.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the levels of interstitial collagenas.
      <br/>
      RNA remained constant when fibroblasts were exposed to RA for one day and rapidly decreased to almost undetectable levels after two days of treatment.
      <br/>
      When dose response experiments were conducted after incubation during 3.5 days with RA concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 1  MU M, the effect of RA was found to be dose-dependent for both genes (FIG. 1B).
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, the repression of interstitial collagenase expression was much more sensitive to RA treatment than was the induction of the ST3 gene.
      <br/>
      Indeed, the half-maximal values for stromelysin-3 induction (EC50) and interstitial collagenase repression (IC50) differed by a factor of about 100 (FIG. 1B; EC50.about.10 nM and IC50 .about 0 (slashed zero) 1 nM).
      <br/>
      Similar results were obtained by using all-trans-RA (t-RA) instead of 9C-RA, and when the experiments were carried out in serum-free conditions (data not shown).
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, however, in the latter case the interstitial collagenase baseline was much lower, hampering analysis of its repression by RA isomers.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      These results showing a significant induction of ST3 RNA levels in HFL1 fibroblasts in the presence of RA initially appeared to contradict a recent report using the same fibroblasts as models, wherein it was found that TPA-mediated induction of stromelysin-3 RNA was inhibited by RA (Anderson, I. C., et al., Cancer Res. 55:4120-4126 (1995)).
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, however, this inhibition was repeated in the present studies, but only at a concentration of RA of about 10  MU M which by far exceeds typical physiological RA concentrations.
      <br/>
      In addition, this 10  MU M RA concentration failed to repress the expression of the interstitial collagenase gene, while this repression was observed at lower, more physiological, RA concentrations, as has been previously noted by others (Yang-Yen, H. F., et al., New Biol. 3:1206-1219 (1991)).

      In order to determine whether stromelysin-3 protein synthesis and/or secretion were also increased by RA treatment, conditioned media from HFL1 fibroblasts were analyzed by Western blot.
      <br/>
      As demonstrated in FIG. 3, only low levels of the mature form of stromelysin-3 were detected at a molecular weight of about 47 kDa in cells cultured under serum-free conditions.
      <br/>
      However, when fibroblasts were exposed for three days to 1  MU M of either 9C-RA or t-RA, high levels of mature stromelysin-3 were detected together with additional protein species.
      <br/>
      The highest molecular weight form corresponds to the stromelysin-3 proform, which is known to be converted by furin or furin-like enzymes into the mature form (Pei, D., and Weiss, S. J., Nature 375:244-247 (1995); Santavicca, M., et al., Biochem. J. 315:953-958 (1996)), which in turn can be processed further into another low molecular weight species (FIG. 3).

    <p num="136">
      To determine whether a transcriptional mechanism was involved in controlling the levels of stromelysin-3 and interstitial collagenase RNAs by RA, the nuclear RNAs of both MMPs were analyzed by nuclear run-on assays performed on nuclei isolated from HFL1 fibroblasts treated for one to three days with 1  MU M 9C-RA.
      <br/>
      Radiolabeled RNAs resulting from nascent nuclear RNA transcripts elongated in vitro were hybridized to cDNAs cloned into the pBluescript II SK+ plasmid and corresponding to interstitial collagenase, stromelysin-3, 36B4, or to the plasmid alone as a control for non-specific hybridizati.
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      As shown in FIG. 4, both MMP genes are constitutively transcribed in HFL1 fibroblasts.
      <br/>
      After three days in the presence of RA, interstitial collagenase transcription was no longer detectable.
      <br/>
      Conversely, RA was found to increase the rate of stromelysin-3 gene transcription twofold, to levels similar to those observed fDr the 36B4 gene whose expression is not affected by RA.
      <br/>
      Shorter exposure times of HFL1 fibroblasts to RA (one or two days) led to either no, or only minimal, increase in stromelysin-3 gene transcription (data not shown).

    <p num="139">Activation of the Human Stromelysin-3 Gene Promoter by Retinoic Acid via Endogenous Retinoid Receptors in RD Cells</p>
    <p num="140">
      HFL1 fibroblasts, like other non-immortalized human diploid fibroblasts, are difficult to use for promoter studies in transient transfection experiments.
      <br/>
      Therefore, an established cell line expressing the stromelysin-3 gene was sought to facilitate these transfection studies.
      <br/>
      Since the stromelysin-3 gene is only weakly expressed in human fibrosarcoma cell lines such as HT-1080 and cannot be induced by TPA in these cells (Okada, A., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:2730-2734 (1995)), several human cell lines of mesodermal origin were screened for their ability to respond to TPA and RA.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      This screening identified a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD) that exhibits a stromelysin-3 expression pattern very similar to that of HFL1 fibroblasts.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown in FIG. 5, basal levels of stromelysin-3 RNA expression, as well as its induction by RA which is maximal after four days of incubation, were similar in HFL1 and RD cells.
      <br/>
      However, RD cells did not express the interstitial collagenase gene, even upon exposure to TPA.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      In order to further evaluate whether a transcriptional regulation was involved in the induction of stromelysin-3 gene expression by RA, stromelysin-3 promoter activity was analyzed in RD cells exposed to 9C-RA for four days.
      <br/>
      RD cells that had been preincubated with 9C-RA for two days were transiently transfected by a CAT-reporter gene driven by various lengths of stromelysin-3 promoter and further exposed to RA for an additional period of 2 days, before measurement of CAT activities.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 6, upon the addition of RA the activities of all three stromelysin-3 promoter constructs containing the DR1-RARE (0.45-, 1.47-, and 3.40-ST3-CAT) were induced 2.8.+- 0 (slashed zero) 5, 3.2.+- 0 (slashed zero) 6, and 3.3.+- 0 (slashed zero) 5 fold (n=3), respectively.
      <br/>
      Conversely, the absence of the DR1-RARE in the 0.29ST3-CAT and the 3.40ST3- DELTA DR1 constructs reduced RA inducibility to 1.2.+- 0 (slashed zero) 1 and 1.6.+- 0 (slashed zero) 1 fold (n=3), respectively.
      <br/>
      A similar remaining activation by RA was previously observed for the 0.29ST3-CAT construct when transfected into COS-1 cells (Anglard, P., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:20337-20344 (1995)).
      <br/>
      This finding may be attributed to the presence of several widely spaced half RARE motifs (PuGG /TTCA) present in this promoter region and which have been shown to activate transcription in the presence of RA (Kato, S., et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 15:5858-5867 (1995)).
      <br/>
      The activation by RA was also tested on the RAR BETA 2 promoter, which contains a RARE of the DR5 type (Nagpal, S., et al., Cell 70:1007-1019 (1992)), and on the isolated DR1 element inserted upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) promoter.
      <br/>
      The activity of these two constructs was induced 3.1.+- 0 (slashed zero) 2. and 4.9.+- 0 (slashed zero) 7 fold (n=3) by RA, respectively, thus to levels comparable to those observed for ST3 constructs.
      <br/>
      However, the transactivation of the DR1-tk-CAT construct was weaker (1.4.+- 0 (slashed zero) 3 fold, n=2) when RD cells were exposed to RA for only two instead of four days, thereby suggesting, that some of the regulatory factors implicated in this activation are not constitutively expressed in RD cells.
      <br/>
      Since these experiments were performed without the cotransfection of any retinoid receptor, it is clear that the observed effects were mediated through endogeneous RA receptors.

      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 7, untreated fibroblasts cultured in serum-free conditions expressed similar levels of RAR ALPHA , RAR GAMMA  and RXR ALPHA  RNAs, with steady state levels relatively constant over the time of culture (not shown).
      <br/>
      No expression was detected in untreated zells for RAR BETA , RXR BETA  and RXR GAMMA  RNAs, however, even when up to 30  MU g of total RNA were loaded for analysis (FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      These results are consistent with recent studies that have shown that RAR ALPHA , RAR GAMMA  and RXR ALPHA  are the predominant receptors expressed in human skin (Fisher, G. J., et al., J.

      <br/>
      The expression of RXR ALPHA , was only slightly increased (less than twofold) in cells treated with either 9C-RA or t-RA, whereas RAR ALPHA  and RAR GAMMA  levels remained unaffected.
      <br/>
      In contrast, RAR BETA  RNA levels increased from undetectable to high levels in cells exposed to either of the RA isomers (FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      Similar results were obtained in fibroblasts cultured in 5% calf serum, although RAR BETA  was induced to a lower extent in these cells than in cells cultured under serum-free conditions (data not shown).

    <p num="148">
      Having demonstrated the effects of RA on induction of the expression of the stromelysin-3 gene, and on the repression of the expression of the interstitial collagenase gene, it was asked whether the ligand-dependent activation of both RARs and RXRs was required for these effects.
      <br/>
      These studies used the synthetic ligands Am80 (Hashimoto, Y., et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 166:1300-1307 (1990)) and CD666 (Bernard, B.A., et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 186:977-983 (1992)), which at appropriate concentrations selectively activate RAR ALPHA  and RAR GAMMA , respectively (Taneja, R., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:6197-6202 (1996)); BM753, a pure RAR ALPHA  agonist (Chen, J.-Y., et al., Nature 382:819-822 (1996)), and BM649, an RXR ( ALPHA , BETA , GAMMA )-selective agonist (Lehmann, J. M., et al., Science 258:1944-1946 (1992)).
      <br/>
      The expression levels of stromelysin-3 and interstitial collagenase RNAs in retinoid-treated HFL1 cells were evaluated after 3.5 days of cell culture in the presence of these synthetic retinoids and compared to those observed in the presence of 9C-RA and t-RA.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      As shown in FIG. 8, using these retinoids individually at low and/or selective concentrations, either no or only minimal induction of stromelysin-3 was detected (FIGS. 8A and 8B), while interstitial collagenase expression was reduced by at least 50% (FIGS. 8C and 8D).
      <br/>
      At higher concentrations (&gt;10 nM), where Am80 and CD666 lose their specificity and act as pan-RAR agonists (Taneja, R., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:6197-6202 (1996)), higher levels of stromelysin-3 RNA were observed, while interstitial collagenase expression was repressed further.
      <br/>
      Interestingly, very little stromelysin-3 gene induction was observed in cells treated with the pure RAR ALPHA  agonist BM753 or the pan-RXR agonist B4649, even when these retinoids were used at a 1  MU M concentration (FIGS. 9A and 9B).
      <br/>
      In marked contrast, the combination of either Am80 (100 nM and 1  MU M) or CD666 (100 nM) with the pan-RXR ligand BM649 (1  MU M) resulted in a synergistic induction of the stromelysin-3 gene, reaching expression levels close to those observed with the natural ligands.
      <br/>
      A synergistic effect was also observed when the BM753 and BM649 ligands were combined, although the expression levels of stromelysin-3 RNA did not exceed 50% of those observed in the presence of the natural ligands (FIGS. 10A and 10B).
      <br/>
      However, any of these combinations was found to fully repress interstitial collagenase gene expression.
      <br/>
      Stromelysin-1 gene expression was similarly repressed in HFL1 fibroblasts (data not shown), suggesting that the retinoids used in the present studies may efficiently repress the expression of any AP1-regulated MMP.
    </p>
    <p num="150">Taken together, the present observations indicate that while the selective activation of either RAR ALPHA  or RAR GAMMA  or RXRs substantially repress interstitial collagenase gene expression, the combination of RARs and RXRs is required for optimal stromelysin-3 gene induction and for fill repression of interstitial collagenase.</p>
    <p num="151">General Discussion</p>
    <p num="152">
      It has previously been shown that the stromelysin-3 gene promoter differed from most other MMP promoters by the absence of a functional AP1 binding site and the presence of a RARE in its proximal region.
      <br/>
      In the present study, the regulation of stromelysin-3 gene expression by RA was further investigated and this expression was compared to that of interstitial collagenase, another MMP.
      <br/>
      Stromelysin-3 and interstitial collagenase are both predominantly expressed by stromal cells of human carcinomas (MacDougall, J. R., and Matrisian, L. M., Canc. Metast. Rev. 14:351-362 (1996)), and their high expression levels were found to be associated with a poor clinical outcome in some carcinomas (Engel, G., et al., Int. J. Cancer 58:830-835 (1994); Chenard, M.-P., et al. Int. J. Cancer 69(6)):448-451 (1996); Murray, G. I., et al., Nat. Med. 2:461-462 (1996)).
      <br/>
      Considering that retinoids by themselves, or when associated with other drugs such as tamoxifen, are regarded as potential new anticancer agents (Abrams, J. S., et al., Cancer 94:1164-1176(1994); Sporn, M. B., Lancet 347:1377-1381 (1996); Costa, A., et al., Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 37:655-5656 (1996)), it is important to elucidate the mechanisms by which the expression of MMPs implicated in cancer progression is regulated by RA.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, it has been demonstrated that both natural RA isomers, 9C-RA and t-RA strongly induce stromelysin-3 RNA and protein expression and simultaneously repress interstitial collagenase expression in human fibroblasts.
      <br/>
      In addition, the present results demonstrate that both genes are controlled by RA through a transcriptional mechanism, and that RAR-RXY heterodimers are likely to be the functional units required for optimal control of these genes by RA.
    </p>

      AP1 and retinoid receptors are regarded as effectors of opposite pathways of cell proliferation and differentiation, and they are mutually antagonistic at the level of transactivation and DNA binding (Fanjul, A., et al., Nature 372:107-111 (1994), Yang-Yen, H. F., et al., New. Biol. 3:1206-1219 (1991); Pfahl, M., Endocr. Rev. 14:651-658 (1993); Chen, J. Y., et al., EMBO J. 14:1187-1197 (1995)).
      <br/>
      Indeed, MMP genes containing an AP1 binding site in a conserved position in their promoter, or other genes like those for TGF- BETA 1 (Salbert, G., et al., Mol Endocrinol. 7:1347-1356 (1993)) and IL-6 (Zitnik, R. J., et al., J. Immuol. 152:1419-1427 (1994)), are TPA-inducible, while their expression is inhibited by RA.
      <br/>
      Since AP1 can reciprocally inhibit transactivation by RARs and RXRs, the observation that the stromelysin-3 gene is induced by both TPA and RA in a given cell type is quite unexpected and represents an unusual example of a gene uprngulated by both agents.
    </p>
    <p num="154">
      In the present invention, it has further been found that physiological concentrations of RA efficiently induce both the expression of the stromelysin-3 gene and the repression of the interstitial collagenase gene in HFL1 human fibroblasts, the latter being observed at RA concentrations lower than those necessary for stromelysin-3 induction.
      <br/>
      Interestingly, the IC50 for interstitial collagenase and the EC50 for stromelysin-3 reported here are very similar to the those recently reported in promoter studies (Chen, J. Y., et al., EMBO J. 14:1187-1197 (199.5)), wherein it was shown that the repression of AP1-induced transcription from the interstitial collagenase promoter was about 100 times more sensitive to RA treatment than was the transactivation of a RARE-tk-CAT construct.
      <br/>
      These observations suggesting that the regulation of both genes by RA may be achieved through a transcriptional mechanism were further evaluated here by measuring the transcriptional rate of both genes in HFL1 fibroblasts in run-on assays.
      <br/>
      In the presence of RA, a complete inhibition of interstitial collagenase transcription was observed; this inhibition is likely to result from an RAR/AP1 interaction, as has been previously documented (Pfahl, M., Endocr. Rev. 14:651-658 (1993); Nagpal, S., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:923-927 (1995)).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a twofold increase in the stromelysin-3 gene transcriptional rate was found when HFL1 fibroblasts were exposed to RA for three days, while no clear transcriptional activation could be detected for shorter exposure times.
      <br/>
      Although it is difficult to determine whether this twofold increase can fully account for the 20-fold increase in stromelysin-3 RNA levels observed after four days of RA treatment, it should be noted that run-on studies with other RA-inducible genes containing a RARE in their promoter exhibited similar profiles.
      <br/>
      Thus, the RAR BETA  and the laminin B1 RNAs were found to be induced at high levels by RA in F9 cells, while no, or only a moderate, increase in transcriptional rates could be detected for these genes by nuclear run-on assays (Hu, L., &amp; Gudas, L. J., Mol. Cell Biol. 10:391-396 (1990); Wang, S. Y., et al., Dev. Biol. 107:75-86 (1985)).
      <br/>
      In all instances, the contribution of a transcriptional mechanism in stromelysin-3 gene induction is further supported by the finding that RA induces stromelysin-3 promoter activity in RD cells.
      <br/>
      By analyzing various lengths of this promoter in transient transfection experiments, a threefold induction of stromelysin-3 promoter activity was observed in the presence of 9C-RA; this induction was strongly reduced in the constructs lacking the DR1-RARE.
      <br/>
      Interestingly, this transactivation was observed without addition of retinoid receptors, indicating that the DR1-RARE was activated by functional endogenous retinoid receptors in these cell.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      Previous studies have shown that while all RARs could potentially mediate the induction of RA target genes, the involvement of a given receptor was dependent on many parameters including promoter context or cell type (Nagpal, S., et al., Cell 70:1007-1019 (1992); Taneja, R., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:6197-6202 (1996)).
      <br/>
      When the expression of RARs and RXRs was evaluated in HFL-1 fibroblasts in the present invention, RAR ALPHA , RAR GAMMA  and RXR ALPHA  RNAs were found to be constitutively expressed at high levels.
      <br/>
      In contrast, no RNA could be detected for RXR BETA  and RXR GAMMA , while that for RAR BETA  was strongly induced from barely detectable levels in untreated fibroblasts to high levels in the presence of 9C- or t-RA.
      <br/>
      Similar observations have been made in fibroblasts from human dermis (Lee, X., et al., Mol Carcinog. 8:112-122 (1993)) and lung (van der Leede, B. M., et al., Mol Carcinog. 8:112-122 (1993)).
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      The suggestion that specific retinoid receptors might be involved in the regulation of stromelysin-3 and interstitial collagenase expression by RA in HFL1 fibroblasts was tested here by examining the expression of both genes in the presence of selective retinoids.
      <br/>
      These retinoids, when used individually at concentrations at which they selectively activate a given RAR (Am80, CD666, BM753), or all three RXRs (BM649), led to no, or only very weak, induction of the stromelysin-3 gene, while they repressed interstitial collagenase expression by at least 50%.
      <br/>
      In marked contrast, a clear induction of the stromelysin-3 gene was observed when any of the selective RAR ligands was used in combination with the BM649 RXR-specific ligand.
      <br/>
      It should be noted, however, that the combination BM753-BM4649 (RAR ALPHA -RXRs) was less efficient than the other combinations.
      <br/>
      Since stronger inductions were observed by combining the BM649 RXR agonist with either Am80 or CD666 at concentrations at which they both promiscuously activate all three RARs, it is reasonable to believe that either RAR BETA  and/or RAR GAMMA  could interact with RXRs for an optimal stromelysin-3 induction.
      <br/>
      Consistent with the notion that RXR ALPHA  seems to be the major RXR expressed in fibroblasts, it can be concluded from the present results that the two heterodimers RAR BETA  and/or RAR GAMMA -RXR ALPHA  are likely to represent the functional units required to induce the expression of the stromelysin-3 gene at physiological RA concentrations.
      <br/>
      This possibility is also consistent with in vitro studies which have shown that heterodimers bind to RARE much more efficiently than do the respective homodimers (Glass, C. K., Endocr. Rev. 15:391-407 (1994); Giguere, V., Endocr. Rev. 15:61-79 (1994)).
      <br/>
      In this respect, it is noteworthy that the activation of a single RAR or RXR was shown here to be sufficient to substantially repress interstitial collagenase expression in HFL1 fibroblasts, but that the activation of both partners of heterodimers was necessary for a full repression.
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      In summary, while transcription studies have demonstrated that RA regulates the expression of target genes by either activating RAREs or repressing AP1 activity, the present studies have examined the regulation of two genes belonging to the MMP family and have shown that they are differentially regulated by RA in luman fibroblasts.
      <br/>
      Indeed, it has been shown here that physiological concentrations of RA induce stromelysin-3 expression but repress interstitial collagenase expression.
      <br/>
      Compared to the repression of interstitial collagenase, stromelysin-3 gene induction relies on more restricted conditions based on a lower sensitivity to both natural and synthetic retinoids, and on a more restricted receptor requirement involving RAR/RXR heterodimers.
      <br/>
      In contrast, a substantial transcriptional repression of interstitial collagenase is achieved by retinoids activating only one type of receptors, although the involvement of RAR/RXR heterodimers is required for a full repression.
