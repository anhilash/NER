      A clear air turbulence (CAT) detection system performs a nested grid modeling algorithm to detect CAT along the flight path of an aircraft.
      <br/>
      The aircraft stores coarse simulation information and utilizes the information to perform large scale weather modeling over a large grid.
      <br/>
      On board sensors are utilized to generate observational information to model atmospheric conditions within a smaller grid, nested within the larger grid, and including the flight path of the aircraft.
      <br/>
      A nowcast predicting turbulence along the flight path in the near future alerts the pilot to the likelihood of encountering clear air turbulence.
      <br/>
      A data link may be utilized to receive coarse simulation data or observational data from sources external to the aircraft.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the coarse simulation information may include turbulence forecast data and the observational information is used to refine the turbulence forecast to more accurately predict clear air turbulence along the flight path of the aircraft.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to the detection of clear air turbulence, vertical windshear and wake vortices; and more particularly, to systems for alerting pilots to the presence of these hazards.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Clear air turbulence (CAT) and wake vortices present potential hazards to aircraft in flight.
      <br/>
      An aircraft passing through such phenomenon may experience an upset from steady, equilibrium flight.
      <br/>
      This upset may be severe enough to cause injury to passengers or in severe cases may cause a departure from controlled flight.
      <br/>
      CAT is a weather phenomenon that is due to vertical wind shear in the atmosphere and usually occurs in temperature inversion layers typically found in the tropopause.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Since the conditions that result in clear air turbulence are not visually apparent nor are they generally detectable by active sensors such as radar, there have been a number of attempts to detect wind shear and clear air turbulence conditions by passive detectors.
      <br/>
      In particular, attempts have been made to sense air temperature gradients, which are associated with air turbulence, by detecting the radiation emanating from the atmosphere ahead of the aircraft in the infrared and microwave spectral regions.
      <br/>
      The intensity of the detected radiation varies with the atmospheric temperatures along the line of sight of the detector.
      <br/>
      Typically these passive systems use a radiometer to measure the thermal radiation from one of the atmospheric gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), oxygen (O2) or water vapor (H2O) to determine changes in the spatial temperature profile in front of the aircraft.
      <br/>
      Examples of such approaches based on the infrared emission of CO2 are provided in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,475,963, 3,735,136, 3,780,293, 3,935,460, 4,266,130, 4,427,306, 4,937,447, 4,965,572, 4,965,573, 5,105,191, 5,276,326 and 5,285,070.

      Other approaches determine atmospheric temperature by measuring the microwave emission from O2 as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,359,557, 3,380,055, 4,346,595, and 5,117,689.

    <p num="5">
      Systems for measuring atmospheric temperature based on infrared emission from H2O are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,266,130 and in the paper by Kuhn et al, "Clear Air Turbulence: Detection by Infrared Observations of Water Vapor" in Science, Vol. 196, p.1099, (1977).
      <br/>
      In addition, there have been several papers written describing these types of passive infrared systems including: S. M. Norman and N. H. Macoy, "Remote Detection of Clear Air Turbulence by Means of an Airborne Infrared System," AIAA Paper No. 65-459 presented at the AIAA Second Annual Meeting, San Francisco, Calif., Jul. 26-29, 1965; and R. W. Astheimer, "The Remote Detection of Clear Air Turbulence by Infrared Radiation" in Applied Optics Vol. 9, No. 8, p.1789 (1970).
      <br/>
      In U.S. Pat. No. 4,346,595, Gary describes a microwave radiometer for determining air temperatures in the atmosphere at ranges of about 3 km from the aircraft for the purpose of detecting the height of the tropopause and the presence of temperature inversions.
      <br/>
      He teaches that by flying the aircraft above or below the tropopause or temperature inversion layer, it is possible to avoid CAT.
      <br/>
      Since the effective range of the microwave radiometer is relatively short, the system doesn't provide sufficient warning time for the aircraft to avoid the CAT condition.
      <br/>
      The present invention has detection ranges on the order of 100 km which will allow time for the aircraft to change altitude to avoid CAT.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A number of the above systems were not successful or were only partially successful because they were based solely on the measurement of atmospheric temperature in order to predict the presence of turbulence.
      <br/>
      A more reliable indication of atmospheric turbulence can be realized by determining the Richardson number, Ri.
      <br/>
      The use of the Richardson number to determine the stability of the atmosphere is well known in meteorology (see, for example, D. Djuric, "Weather Analysis," Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1994, p. 64).
      <br/>
      In U.S. Pat. No. 5,117,689, Gary discussed the correlation of the reciprocal of the Richardson number with the occurrence of CAT conditions.
      <br/>
      The Richardson number, Ri, contains two components: (1) the vertical lapse rate of potential temperature and (2) the wind shear which is related to the horizontal temperature gradient.
      <br/>
      A number of the prior art discussions measure the vertical temperature lapse rate.
      <br/>
      Gary used the inertial navigation system (INS) to measure the East-West and North-South components of the wind (the wind shear) along with a microwave radiometer to measure the air temperature vertical lapse rate.
      <br/>
      This information is then used to calculate the Richardson number or its reciprocal.
      <br/>
      The deficiency of the system described in this patent (U.S. Pat. No. 5,117,689) is that it determines the Richardson number at relatively close ranges (less than 3 km) and therefore does not provide advance warning of the CAT condition and that it measures the wind shear only at the aircraft.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Previous approaches for the determination of the range and probability of CAT can be summarized as follows:</p>
    <p num="8">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,276,326 to Philpott determines turbulence as a function of temperature vs. range through the analysis of infrared radiometer signals at two or more discrete wavelengths.
      <br/>
      The temperature associated with a given range as a function of wavelength is then derived through a matrix inversion process.
      <br/>
      This transition is difficult and requires noise and error free input data to yield valid results.
      <br/>
      Gary overcomes the multiple wavelength difficulty in U.S. Pat. No. 4,346,595 by measuring effective temperature and range at a single wavelength, however no attempt is made to determine the probability of clear air turbulence using the Richardson number (Ri).
      <br/>
      In U.S. Pat. No. 5,117,689, Gary teaches the significance of the Richardson number in CAT prediction but does not suggest a method to derive Ri directly from radiometric measurements of horizontal and vertical temperature lapse rates obtained by combining azimuth and elevation scanning with the aircraft motion to produce a temperature map.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The above methods for airborne detection of clear air turbulence require the use of an aircraft sensor.
      <br/>
      Both infrared and radar sensors have been suggested for use.
      <br/>
      The practical difficulties involved with implementing these systems are several.
      <br/>
      First, the extremely small changes in temperature associated with the rising air current must be detected by those systems using infrared sensing.
      <br/>
      This task can be difficult to accomplish in thermally noisy environments or at long range.
      <br/>
      Second, such infrared systems require a clear lens to protect the infrared sensor.
      <br/>
      Real world flight conditions make the protection and maintenance of the lens such that reliable readings could be had costly and difficult.
      <br/>
      Third, those systems employing radar must have either a dedicated radar or must employ existing aircraft radars originally designed and dedicated for other purposes.
      <br/>
      Dedicated radar systems, such as LIDAR, tend to be extremely heavy which imposes fuel and capacity costs on the aircraft operator.
      <br/>
      The operator also must shoulder the additional burden of acquiring and maintaining a separate radar system.
      <br/>
      Fourth, the sensor is required to sweep out a large expanse of area in to either side of the aircraft and at various ranges in front of the aircraft.
      <br/>
      This requirement means that the sensor and the associated signal processing system must acquire and analyze a large quantity of data.
      <br/>
      Detecting the subtle changes indicative of turbulence becomes more difficult at long range.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the bandwidth and time dedicated to the sensing activity can become onerous when the sensor is shared with other tasks, or when rapid update rates are desired.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Other solutions for avoiding invisible flight hazards such as CAT involve the use of mathematical atmospheric models.
      <br/>
      In particular, wake vortices models have been promulgated for several aircraft types.
      <br/>
      Air traffic controllers in the United States employ these models to develop separation rules such that one aircraft's vortices do not pose a hazard to others.
      <br/>
      One such model used by controllers is called AVOSS, or Aircraft Vortex Separation System.
      <br/>
      Such models do not actually detect the presence of vortices or turbulence, but merely indicated theoretical behaviors and regions of likely occurrence.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      The present invention recognizes the advantages of providing pilots with a means for alerting of the possibility of clear air turbulence or hazardous wake vortices.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides the pilot with tactical information such that the pilot may divert or take other corrective action.
      <br/>
      The present invention may be utilized to warn of these hazards both proximate and at an extended range from the aircraft.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In recent years, it has been determined that various meteorological models can reconstruct and predict severe weather phenomena, given adequate sounding data as initial and boundary conditions.
      <br/>
      With the rapid advancement of computer processing, these models can now run on high-end personal computers for small spatial and temporal scales.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the possibility of using a high-speed avionics data link to provide sounding data, not available before, offers the possibility of new approaches to the CAT problem.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Thus, according to one aspect of the invention, ground based uplinked weather information and local information generated by sensors on-board the aircraft are used to model clear air turbulence in the flight path of the aircraft.</p>
    <p num="14">
      According to a further aspect of the invention, a nested grid modeling algorithm is utilized to process the coarse-modeling and observational information.
      <br/>
      The coarse-modeling information is used to model large-scale weather conditions in a large grid including the flight path of the aircraft.
      <br/>
      Observational information refines the weather information in a smaller grid, nested in the larger grid, that includes the flight path of the aircraft.
      <br/>
      The refined information is utilized to predict CAT in path of the aircraft and provide a nowcast alerting the pilot of CAT.
    </p>
    <p num="15">According to another aspect of the invention, the coarse modeling information can be pre-stored on-board the aircraft or uplinked using a data link on the aircraft.</p>
    <p num="16">
      According to another aspect of the invention, a CAT nowcast system includes an on-board computer, on-board sensors, on-board storage and a data link.
      <br/>
      The on-board computer processes coarse simulation data and observational data, either generated by the on-board sensors or uplinked via the data link, to nowcast CAT along the flight path.
      <br/>
      On board instrumentation is coupled to the on-board computer to alert the pilot of CAT.
    </p>
    <p num="17">According to another aspect of the invention, the on-board sensors, data link, and instrumentation are existing equipment on the aircraft used for other purposes as well as CAT nowcasting.</p>
    <p num="18">
      According to another aspect of the invention, the coarse modeling information includes turbulence forecasts.
      <br/>
      Observational information is used to refine the turbulence forecast to provide a turbulence nowcast to alert the pilot of CAT occurring along the flight path of the aircraft.
    </p>
    <p num="19">According to another aspect of the invention, an infrared radiometer, which detects temperature gradients, is used as an on-board sensor to detect CAT.</p>
    <p num="20">The present invention has the additional advantage of making maximum use of the value of existing aircraft instruments, such as weather radar and EGPWS, to provide observational information.</p>
    <p num="21">
      According to another aspect of the present invention, a system is provided in which a mathematical model and/or atmospheric data is uplinked to an aircraft.
      <br/>
      The uplinked data contains information on possible vortex characteristics and/or weather phenomenon.
      <br/>
      This information is combined or utilized on board the aircraft to develop a real time airborne model of where these hazardous phenomenon are likely to be encountered.
      <br/>
      The predictive model can be used to assert an aural and/or visual warning to the pilot.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      According to one aspect of the present invention, this predictive model is combined with detection.
      <br/>
      The predictive model is employed by the invention to direct the sensor system to scan those areas of interest.
      <br/>
      Thus, the present invention has the advantage of providing faster update rates than would be available in a prior art system.
      <br/>
      The present invention has the further advantage of minimizing the number of radar scans that must be dedicated to this task when the radar or sensor is shared amongst various data gathering functions.
    </p>
    <p num="23">According to yet another aspect of the present invention, the system additionally receives updated enroute weather information.</p>
    <p num="24">
      According to still another aspect of the present invention, the present invention receives uplinked data from ground based radar systems.
      <br/>
      The information uplinked to the airborne detection system assists that system in defining the particular indicia of the turbulence hazard.
      <br/>
      This information enables the present invention to better discriminate amongst the sensor data and improves the reliability that a hazard will be detected.
      <br/>
      In addition, this information reduces the chances that a false warning will be output to the pilot.
      <br/>
      As is well known to those of skill in the art, frequent false, or nuisance, warnings cause the cockpit crew to ignore subsequent and possibly valid warnings.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the number of false alerts in the manner taught by the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      According to an additional aspect of the present invention, the invention contains a database of terrain information.
      <br/>
      Optionally, this terrain data may also be uplinked to the aircraft via a communications link or may be contained in an existing aircraft system, such as, for example, an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) or a navigation database.
      <br/>
      Terrain data may also be acquired via terrain data scans of the on board weather radar.
      <br/>
      The terrain data may be used by the predictive modeling system of the present invention to identify areas of possible turbulence hazards, e.g. mountain waves, or to assist in modeling the propagation of wake vortices and dissipation of turbulence.
      <br/>
      Such information would be particularly useful in the vicinity of airports during the landing and takeoff phases of flight.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Data uplinked to the aircraft may be uplinked via satellite telecommunications systems as known to those of skill in the art.
      <br/>
      The data uplink may also occur via known and existing on board telecommunications devices such as ACARS or HF radio communications links.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the present invention may include its own dedicated hardware for receiving these information updates.
    </p>
    <p num="27">Warnings provided to the pilot may include an aural and/or visual warning.</p>
    <p num="28">
      In one embodiment, externally generated turbulence forecast information is provided to the on-board system.

      The system utilizes observational data to refine the provided turbulence forecast information to provide a nowcast of expected CAT along the flight path of the aircraft.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="30">Airborne Sensor Detection</p>
    <p num="31">
      FIG. 1A is a conceptual diagram of a model-based airborne CAT nowcast/avoidance system.
      <br/>
      Inputs to the model are from data link and/or from on-board sensors.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 1A illustrates one embodiment of a model-based airborne CAT nowcast/avoidance system.
      <br/>
      A data link provides large-scale weather information from ground stations and environmental data from other airplanes.
      <br/>
      An airborne system combines the information from the data link with on-board sensors to enable CAT nowcast for an area about 100 km ahead.
      <br/>
      This will give pilots about 10 minutes of warning time.
      <br/>
      The proposed system overcomes the difficulties associated with a purely ground-based uplinking system.
      <br/>
      Such a system requires a large communication bandwidth and makes the airplane dependent on ground stations and a communication link with the ground.
      <br/>
      An airborne system combined with selective data-linked inputs will decrease such risk and gives more control to the pilot.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The detection of CAT is a difficult problem.
      <br/>
      CAT generally occurs as one of four types: turbulence near thunderstorm (TNT), mountain wave turbulence (MWT), clear-air turbulence in the free atmosphere without any visible activity (CAT), and low-level turbulence (LLT).
      <br/>
      TNT constitutes a large amount of information, the nowcast on TNT requires less real-time computation and does not depend as much on data link information.
      <br/>
      The algorithms and methodologies developed for TNT and MWT nowcast can be expanded and applied for CAT warning.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Using data from ground and airborne radar, a small-scale model can simulate weather development with sufficient accuracy for TNT nowcast.
      <br/>
      Given the limited computational capacity on the airplane, a model aimed at a small area along the flight path can be developed by modifying existing large-scale meteorological models.
      <br/>
      This airborne modeling system takes advantage of all the information it can get from a ground-based system (such as large-scale weather information and modeling results) and reduces the computation complexity by narrowing the field of regard for the on-board modeling and prediction algorithm.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Most existing models are for meteorological research and forecast with large spatial and temporal scale and also stimulate many meteorological parameters not of interest here.
      <br/>
      An embodiment of the present invention can employ a simplified model to establish an airborne model running on a personal computer that gives information for limited spatial and temporal bounds: about 100 km along the flight path and 10 minutes of warning time to the pilots.
      <br/>
      A nested-grid modeling approach is used in a preferred embodiment.
      <br/>
      Most ground-based systems provide 36-km to 12-km regional weather forecast every hour.
      <br/>
      The result can be used to provide initial and boundary conditions for further air-borne finer-grid modeling.
      <br/>
      The radar data can be used to correct the coarse-grid modeling result.
      <br/>
      For example, inaccurate position and speed of a convective supercell forecasted by a ground-based system can be corrected by radar data and more accurate initial and boundary conditions can be formed for further airborne small-scale modeling.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      FIG. 1B is a more detailed depiction of a preferred embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      Coarse resolution forecasts for large grids, e.g., 4,000 by 500 km are received periodically from land-based weather stations.
      <br/>
      Own-aircraft observational data such as Radar, Lidar (light detection and ranging), and infrared (IR) as well as datalinked data such as data linked from satellites, other aircraft, or ground stations is updated about every 10 minutes and used to model a nested grid of about 200 by 50 km which is oriented to include the path of the aircraft.
      <br/>
      The fine resolution modeling data is processed by a nowcast algorithm to determine if CAT is likely to occur in the path of the aircraft.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Several existing models known to those of skill in the art may be modified as described above for use in the present invention.
      <br/>

Proctor, The Terminal Area Simulation System, NASA Contract Report 4046, 1987, and integrated electromagnetic sensor simulation (IESS), PennState/NCAR's meso-scale model 5 (MM5), see. e.g., Phillip L. Haagenson et al, The Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) Source Code Documentation, March 1994, the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS), see, e.g., Ming Xue et al., "ARPS Version 4.0 User's Guide," Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms (CAPS), University of Oklahoma, Norman Okla., 1995.

      Alternative preferred embodiments of a computational method are depicted in FIGS. 1C and 1D.

      A "snapshot" of data could be stored in no more than 6 MB in compressed form and could include data covering, for example, an area of 4,000 by 500 km with 36-km horizontal resolution and 20 layers of vertical resolution.

      A snapshot data includes all the simulation parameters for each point in 3-D grid space.

      If the computer is to be pre-loaded with hourly forecast data for 10 hours of flight time, the total amount of data would be about 60 Mb.

      The data could also be gathered by sensors from satellites.

      The observational data and coarse-resolution data are used for nested fine-resolution simulation.
      <br/>
      The coarse resolution data, e.g., forecast data from NCEP, is used to initialize the coarse grid and establish boundary conditions and initial parameters for modeling fine grids, nested within the coarse grids, to improve the data.
      <br/>
      Mathematical systems for performing nested grid modeling include the Advance Regional Prediction System (ARPS), Xue et al., "ARPS User's Guide Version 4.0," Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms (CAPS), 1995 and NCAR'S Clark-Hall Code Model, Clark et al., "Source Code Documentation for the Clark-Hall Cloud-Scale Model Code Version G3CH01," NCAR, Boulder, Colo., 1996.

    <p num="49">
      The meteorological variables calculated by the nested grid simulation are utilized to calculate the turbulence index.
      <br/>
      Particular variables used include turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), Richardson's number (see below), vertical windshear, the deformation index, eddy dissipation rate, TI2, etc.
      <br/>
      The turbulence index is defined as the weighted and normalized summation of various combinations of the these parameters.
      <br/>
      Weighting factors are assigned by using experience formulae, which are developed by comparing the numbers against available flight data with real turbulence encounters.
      <br/>
      The values depend on the location of the aircraft (mountainous or flat terrain), seasons, and other parameters.

      The nowcast is based on the value of the calculated turbulence index.

      Referring now to FIG. 1D, this method requires less computational power from the aircraft computer.

      <br/>
      In this case a turbulence forecast is also provided.

      The onboard computer utilizes the observational information to correct the forecast to generate a nowcast.

    <p num="52">
      Many agencies and service centers issue aviation turbulence forecasts based on coarse-resolution modeling results.
      <br/>
      The accuracy may be poor due to the nature of the forecast, i.e., relative long time span, low resolution, and local weather phenomena not included in simulation.
      <br/>
      However, the forecast result can be used together with observational data to improve its accuracy and give a good nowcast product.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The accuracy of the coarse-resolution turbulence forecast can be improved by comparing observational data with coarse-resolution data because errors in the forecast can be corrected by results of localized observations.
      <br/>
      For example, the forecast may predict turbulence in location (x,y) at time t, with associated wind and temperature profiles in an area A. However, the observational data may indicate similar wind and temperature profiles but in a different area B. This difference may be caused by inaccuracies in coarse-resolution simulation.
      <br/>
      By comparing the two sets of data, the airborne computer may issue a turbulence warning at a shifted location from area A. Another example is when the coarse-resolution data and observational data have overlapping meteorological profiles, but with different intensities.
      <br/>
      This will lead to turbulence nowcast with increased or decreased severity than previously forecast.

      Installed in a forward and partially sideways-looking location of the aircraft, such as the nose or a leading portion of a wing, is a passive detector 12, preferably a radiometer, for receiving infrared radiation from the atmosphere as indicated by a dashed line 14.
      <br/>
      Also, as indicated by a block 16, the radiometer 12 is connected to a directional scanning mechanism which permits the radiometer 12 to receive the radiation 14 from different directions in both the azimuth and vertical directions or in only the azimuth direction.

      Shown at block 18, the apparatus 10 converts the sterance or energy L at a particular wave length  LAMBDA  of the radiation 14 as detected by the radiometer 12 into a value Teff which represents the temperature of the atmosphere at an effective range Reff from the aircraft.
      <br/>
      The concept of converting the radiation 14 into temperature Teff and the effective range Reff will be described below.
    </p>
    <p num="59">Then, as indicated at a block 20, the Teff values obtained will be used to create a horizontal or vertical temperature map of atmospheric temperature ahead of the aircraft as illustrated in FIGS. 2B-2G. As the aircraft progresses along its line of flight, the system data is collected as shown in FIG. 2B. The apparatus then generates a temperature map as indicated at 20.</p>
    <p num="60">The temperature mapping 20 is used to compute horizontal temperature gradients VT, indicated at a block 22, between the temperatures T, contained in the map 20 in a horizontal plane.</p>

      Effective use of the wind vector difference information generated at 24 can be made, as shown at a block 26, by displaying the wind vector difference at flight levels above or below the aircraft in order to provide the air crew with information as to winds that might be more favorable.

      This information 24 can also be used as an input to a flight management system, indicated by a block 28, so that it can be combined with other flight parameters to provide guidance as to the most efficient flight regime.

      In addition, this information 24 can be used to compute the probability of clear air turbulence, as indicated by a block 30 that in turn can be used as an input to a clear air turbulence display or warning system as shown by a block 32.
    </p>
    <p num="63">The following is a more detailed description of the various elements and concepts of the invention as shown in the block diagram of FIG. 2A.</p>
    <p num="64">
      For example, FIG. 2B provides an illustration of the operation of the radiometer 12 in conjunction with the directional scan mechanism 16.
      <br/>
      In this case the scan mechanism 16 directs the radiometer 12 so as to receive radiation 14 from what in effect are 3 * 3 arrays 34a, 34b and 34c of points in the atmosphere ahead of the aircraft collecting sterance associated with an effective range Reff at time intervals t0, t1, and t2.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment of the invention, a middle row 36 of the arrays 34a-c is located at the aircraft's flight level while an upper row 38 is located at a level intermediate between the flight level and an upper flight level and a lower row 40 is located at a level intermediate between the flight level and a lower flight level.
      <br/>
      An illustration of the flight levels is provided in FIG. 2G. The radiometer 12 can be any suitable commercially available radiometer or a radiometer of the type described in the above referenced patents such as U.S. Pat. No. 4,937,447 to Barrett, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      In another preferred embodiment, only one horizontal temperature map at one level is used for determining wind difference.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Referring also to FIG. 2A and FIG. 2C, the temperature conversion 18 of each point in the arrays 34a-c is accomplished by translating the radiance L( LAMBDA ) received by the radiometer 12, where the wavelength is  LAMBDA , into a signal that is associated with a temperature Teff of the volume of air seen by the radiometer.
      <br/>
      The temperature, Teff, is associated with the effective range, Reff. which is the weighted average distance of the signal reaching the radiometer 12.
      <br/>
      This use of Reff is only useful in conditions for which Reff does not vary significantly during aircraft flight across reasonable distances at a fixed altitude.
      <br/>
      It has been found that Reff does not vary significantly for normal flight conditions, i.e., Reff is determined by only the wavelength  LAMBDA , the altitude and latitude of the aircraft and the particular time of year.
      <br/>
      This has been verified through the use of the FASCODE program.
      <br/>
      The FASCODE program is a computer model of atmospheric transmission and radiance in the infrared.

The following Table 1 is a table illustrating the FASCODE (using the mid-latitude, winter atmosphere program) computed effective range Reff vs.  LAMBDA  in the case that  LAMBDA  falls within the preferred band of wavelengths of CO2 emission for a zenith angle of 90 degrees and an altitude of 35,000 ft.

      For normal flight conditions, Reff does not vary significantly and is determined only by altitude and latitude for a given time of year.
      <br/>
      With respect to FIG. 2C, the altitude of  DELTA Vvol for a Reff of 120 km will be about 1000 ft. above the flight level of the aircraft due to the earth's curvature assuming the radiometer 12 is directed toward the horizon.

    <p num="71">
      FIGS. 2D-2F illustrate how the temperature mapping 20 can be accomplished.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2D, an aircraft 42 having the radiometer 12 mounted in its nose causes the radiometer 12 to perform an azimuth scan of 180 (degree) . At each of the five positions shown in FIG. 2D, the radiometer 12 will detect the radiance 14.
      <br/>
      In this manner a horizontal temperature map is generated.
      <br/>
      The radiometer can detect signals sufficiently fast that the motion of the aircraft can be ignored.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2E shows a series of locations indicated by a set of rectangular boxes 44a-d that correspond to a set of time intervals ta-d as the aircraft 42 proceeds along its flight path, where the temperatures Teff detected for each location 44a-d can be stored in memory.
      <br/>
      Similarly, as illustrated in FIG. 2F, the radiometer 12 in the aircraft 42 can perform a vertical scan so that temperatures of locations above and below the flight path can be mapped.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is possible to generate temperature maps for horizontal planes above and below the aircraft 42.
    </p>
    <p num="72">By mapping the temperature fields 20 as described above, it is possible to compute horizontal temperature gradients VT as indicated at 22 of FIG. 2A. It is also possible, by using the vertical temperature mapping to calculate the temperature lapse rate .differential.T/.differential.z for use in calculation of the Richardson Number for computing the probability of clear air turbulence.</p>
    <p num="73">
      As is illustrated by the representation of FIG. 2G, one of the salient features of the invention is the capability of utilizing the temperature gradients computed at 22 to generate values representing vertical wind vector difference or horizontal winds at various flight levels.
      <br/>
      In this case, only a horizontal mapping at one level is needed.
      <br/>
      For example, a method according to the invention whereby the thermal wind concepts can be used to compute vertical wind vector difference,  DELTA V, as indicated at 24 of FIG. 2A, makes use of the following relation:  (Equation image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      where g is the acceleration due to gravity,  DELTA z is the distance between Z1 and Z2, f is the Coriolis parameter resulting from the earth's rotation, T is the temperature at said flight altitude Z1, T is the vector representing the temperature gradient at the intermediate level Z3 between Z1 and Z2, k is the unit vector parallel to the aircraft's local vertical and the symbol X represents the vector cross-product operator.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2G, Z1 denotes the current flight level of the aircraft, Z2 denotes the flight level above the aircraft and Z3 denotes the intermediate level.
      <br/>
      Equation 3 may be found in any standard meteorological text such as "Dynamical and Physical Meteorology," by G. J. Haltiner and F. L. Martin, (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1957) p. 204.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      As a result, once the temperature gradients are computed 22 from the temperature field 20 the value of  DELTA V can be computed at 24 for the upper flight level 48 per equation (3).
      <br/>
      For an aircraft direction vector, Vac, the vector dot product,  DELTA V * Vac, is the increase in headwind or tailwind the aircraft would experience at the different altitude.
      <br/>
      In addition, the vector value  DELTA V can then be added to the vector value V1 of the wind at the current flight level 46 to obtain a vector value V2 which represents the direction and speed of the wind at the upper flight level 48.
      <br/>
      This value then can also be displayed on the display 26 in order to provide the air crew with information as to the wind at the upper flight level 48.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the display 26 can be used to display just the difference in wind speed along the direction of the aircraft's flight at the upper flight level 48, for example by displaying a simple plus or minus sign along with a value representing the difference in velocity.
      <br/>
      In addition, the value of V2 can be used as an input to the flight management system 28 so that factor can be used by the system 28 in determining the most efficient flight regime.
      <br/>
      Note that the temperatures are only needed in one horizontal plane to determine T, and the wind difference,  DELTA V.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      It will be understood that the above discussed method of determining wind direction and velocity V2 at the upper flight level 48 would also apply to the determination of wind at a lower flight level below the current flight level 46.
      <br/>
      In this manner, it is possible to provide on the display 26 or to the flight management system 28 an indication of the winds both above and below the aircraft so that the crew can take advantage of this information in selecting the most fuel efficient altitude.

    <p num="77">
      Another feature of the invention relates to the use of the temperature mapping function 20 along with the computation of vertical temperature gradients 22 to compute the probability of clear air turbulence 30.
      <br/>
      In particular, the vertical temperature mapping 20 can be used to calculate the lapse rate .differential.T/.differential.z for determination of the Richardson number Ri which is correlated with turbulent conditions.
      <br/>
      In this case Ri is computed using the following relations:  (Equation image '4' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="78">where  (Equation image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="79">
      and where  THETA  is the potential temperature, .differential.
      <br/>
      THETA /.differential.z is the vertical gradient of the potential temperature, .differential.V/.differential.z is the vertical wind shear, g is acceleration due to gravity, V is the horizontal wind vector, z is height, T is temperature in Kelvin, p is atmospheric pressure in millibars, R is the universal gas constant and Cp is the specific heat of air at constant pressure.
      <br/>
      The Richardson number, Ri, is a measure of the probability of CAT.
      <br/>
      For Ri below 0.21, atmospheric turbulence occurs and CAT is likely.
      <br/>
      Severity of CAT increases with decreasing Ri.
      <br/>
      Referring again to FIG. 2A, the probability of clear air turbulence is determined at 30 with the result displayed on the CAT display 32.

      The embodiment of the invention in FIG. 2A has been described in terms of its use in connection with an aircraft traversing temperature fields in its flight path.
      <br/>
      However, this type of apparatus can also adapted for use in mapping temperature fields from a fixed geographical position.
      <br/>
      By using the radiometer 12 at a fixed site to scan temperature at the effective range Reff as described above over a period of time as the weather moves over the radiometer, it is possible to generate a map of the temperature fields for a wide area.
      <br/>
      The temperature map can then be used for warnings of wind conditions such as clear air turbulence and dry microburst conditions.
      <br/>
      Another use at a fixed position is to scan the temperature field in 360 (degree)  azimuth and in elevation to determine wind differences, or CAT at one time.

      The schedule of FIG. 3B first determines the values of the aircraft position variables.
      <br/>
      Then, for each latitude index within the radar range scale and within 90 degrees of the aircraft heading, the minimum and maximum longitude indices within those same limits are determined.
      <br/>
      The latitude index is then set to the minimum latitude index within the range scale and within 90 degrees of the aircraft heading and the longitude index is set to the minimum longitude index within the range scale and within 90 degrees of the aircraft heading and intersecting the latitude index.
      <br/>
      A maximum angle variable (MaxAng) is created and set to negative 90 degrees.
      <br/>
      The schedule of FIG. 3B then computes the distance between the aircraft and the terrain database point that corresponds to the latitude and longitude indices.

    <p num="92">
      Compensating for earth curvature and radar diffraction according to techniques known to those of skill in the art, the elevation angle between the aircraft and the terrain database cell (E1Ang) is measured and compared to the maximum angle variable.
      <br/>
      If the elevation angle is greater than the maximum angle, the maximum angle is set equal to the elevation angle.
      <br/>
      If the elevation angle is not greater than the maximum angle, the longitude index is increased by one.
      <br/>
      The longitude index is then compared to the maximum longitude index within the range scale and within 90 degrees of the aircraft heading and intersecting the latitude index.
      <br/>
      If the longitude index is not greater than the maximum longitude index, then the algorithm loops back to the computation of the distance between the aircraft and the terrain database point that corresponds to the latitude and longitude indices.
      <br/>
      If the longitude index is greater than the maximum longitude index, then the latitude index is increased by one.
      <br/>
      The latitude index is then compared to the maximum latitude index within the range scale and within 90 degrees of the aircraft heading.
      <br/>
      If the latitude index is not greater than the maximum latitude index, then longitude index is set equal to the minimum longitude index within the range scale and within 90 degrees of the aircraft heading and intersecting the latitude index and the method loops back to the computation of the distance between the aircraft and the terrain database point that corresponds to the latitude and longitude indices.
      <br/>
      If the latitude index is greater than the maximum latitude index, then the tilt angle is calculated by adding the maximum angle to the half-power elevation beam width of the weather radar.
