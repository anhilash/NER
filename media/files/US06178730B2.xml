      A fruit harvester includes a single shaker head having multiple, independently operable, shaker head segments freely rotatable about an axis of the head and moveable in a to and fro linear displacement.
      <br/>
      Each head segment includes a shaft and multiple finger elements radially extending from the shaft for penetrating fruit bearing branches of a tree.
      <br/>
      A shaker provides the radially linear displacement of the shaker head segment to and from the axis of the single shaker head.
      <br/>
      Adjacent shaker head segments are displaced in parallel and opposing directions for providing an oscillating movement to the finger elements, and thus a balance and stability to the shaker head during shaking movement of the tree branches.
      <br/>
      The shaker head is operable with a mobile carrier.
      <br/>
      A conveyor, also carried by the mobile carrier, is independently operable for receiving fruit falling from the tree and delivering the fruit onto a hauler.
      <br/>
      A flexible trunk seal is juxtaposed with the conveyor for assisting fruit falling from the tree to roll onto the conveyor.
      <br/>
      The flexible trunk seal is positioned for contacting the trunk in a sealing arrangement when operating with a similar and opposing fruit harvester.
      <br/>
      A hydraulic mechanism positions the conveyor and seal at a desirable distance from the trunk when a sensor sliding along the trunk activates the mechanism for lateral movement of the conveyor and seal in response to movement of the sensor, thus maintaining a desirable distance between the tree and fruit harvester.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to harvesters, and more particularly to harvesters operating so as to shake mature fruit from branches of a plant or tree.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The use of spiked shaker head styled fruit harvesters is known in the art as illustrated by way of example with reference to U.S. Pat. No. 4,860,529 to Peterson et al. for "Shaking Mechanism For Fruit Harvesting" and U.S. Pat. No. 4,329,836 to Scudder for "Harvesting Units." However, problems using such spiked shaker head harvesting mechanisms include shaker head diameters being too small to sufficiently penetrate the canopy of a larger fruit bearing trees, especially those found in the citrus field.
      <br/>
      Further, simply increasing the diameter of the shaker head lowers the natural frequency of the finger elements which reduces the efficiency with which fruit can be shaken loose from their branches, and increases damage thereto.
      <br/>
      The diameter may be increased to offset the frequency problem, but the diameter would have to be exponentially increased to an impractical length.
      <br/>
      The harvester will be too big, too long, too wide and awkward to maneuver in a typical grove.
      <br/>
      Further, if the harvester were high enough to pick tall trees, its height would be too high for transporting, as limited by the DOT specifications for height of equipment traveling on highways.
      <br/>
      There is a need for a practical way to easily extend the spiked shaker heads and lower them for transport.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Dual shaker head systems are typically used in place of single shaker head systems to provide adequate balancing of the harvester during the oscillating or shaking movement of the shaker head.
      <br/>
      When inertia of the fruit is used to sever its connection to the fruit stem, the frequency must be of a high enough order of magnitude to generate the required forces to sever this connection.
      <br/>
      The frequency of a tree nicking action can be reduced when the shaker head displacement (amplitude) is increased.
      <br/>
      The benefit of a lower frequency provides for reduced damage to the tree, reduced stresses in harvester machine parts, increased durability, and reduced weight.
      <br/>
      Further, typical shaker head styled harvesters are typically rigid and long, and as such cannot be moved sideways to increase or decrease the penetration depth into the canopy.
      <br/>
      The rigid machine cannot get close enough to the scallop pockets between two adjacent trees in order to pick the fruit.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      As described in the Peterson '529 patent, The spiked head shaker is preferred over other styled harvesters because the spikes, finger elements, can gently enter the fruiting canopy as the harvester moves along the tree rows, and the force of oscillation adjusted to shake ripe fruit loose from the branches without damaging the tree.
      <br/>
      However, there are inherent disadvantages of shaking a fruit tree with a pivoting, angular, and non-uniform displacement of the spikes.
      <br/>
      By way of example, a uniform movement having a pivot point off set in relation to the center of the shaker head imparts an angular movement although on a bigger radius, and consequently the tips of the spikes of the shaker head are displaced more than the center of the shaker head.
      <br/>
      Typically, the tip would have a 6 inch displacement and the center of the shaker head only 3 inch displacement.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the tips are more aggressively shaking the branches than the center of the shaker head.
      <br/>
      This results in an extremely aggressive movement of the tips while the central part of the shaker head is not aggressive enough to remove fruit.
      <br/>
      There is a need for a more uniform translation or movement along the length of the spikes rather than the typical angular displacement which results in the differing linear displacement along the shaking members.
      <br/>
      Further, it is believed that a single shaker head harvester has the ability to remove fruit as efficiently as a double shaker head machine, but there is a need for improved balancing of a single shaker head harvester.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It is typical for a fruit harvester to operate with a catcher floor adapter to straddle and travel along a row of plants, as described, by way of example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,772,866 to Sell, for "Apparatus For Harvesting Grapes." Integrating the fruit shaker with a collector comes with some disadvantages, and as a result, a collector operated independently from the shaker is desirable.
      <br/>
      By way of example, maneuvering the harvester becomes easier, especially with harvesters having a three point mounted system for the shaker, and harvesters typically drawn by the same tractor that operates with the collector.
      <br/>
      There is a need for a collector to have versatility when negotiating tight turning radii, to have adjustment capability for horizontal and vertical movement that would enable it to be effectively positioned under the tree to catch and convey the fruit.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Further, when using left and right handed collectors in combination, there is a need for a continuous seal therebetween that enables the harvester to intercept and catch the fruit falling from the tree without losing fruit as the harvester moves along and brushes by the trees being harvested.
      <br/>
      It would further be desirable for the collector to separate debris from fruit before being discharged for transporting of the fruit.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      In view of the foregoing background, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a balanced single shaker head harvester which provides a shaking action for harvesting fruit from fruit bearing branches without damage to the branches or tree.
      <br/>
      It is further an object of the invention to effectively and efficiently collect the fruit once shaken from the tree.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      These and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention, are provided by a fruit harvester comprising a single shaker head having a plurality of shaker head segments aligned along a shaker head axis for rotation generally about the axis and linear radial displacement therefrom.
      <br/>
      Each shaker head segment is operable for independent movement and includes a shaft and a plurality of flexible finger elements rotatably carried by and radially extending from the shaft for penetrating fruit bearing branches of a tree.
      <br/>
      A plurality of shakers are operable with the single shaker head, wherein each one of the plurality of shakers is operable with one of the plurality of shaker head segments for providing a radially linear displacement of the shaker head segment to and from the axis of the single shaker head, and wherein adjacent shaker head segments are displaced in parallel and opposing directions for providing an oscillating movement to the plurality of finger elements, and thus providing balance and stability to the shaker head during shaking movement of tree branches being harvested.
    </p>
    <p num="10">In one embodiment, each of the plurality of shakers comprises a housing fixedly attached to a rigid arm extending from the frame, a plate having an aperture therein for rotatably receiving the shaft of the shaker head segment therethrough, a pair of lever arms pivotally attached between the housing and the plate for limiting movement of the aperture along a straight line extending from the axis of the rigid arm, and a crank assembly operable with an elongate rod rotatable attached to the plate for providing the to and fro movement to the plate.</p>
    <p num="11">In another embodiment, each of the plurality of shakers comprises a straight raceway formed at the distal end of a rigid rod extending from the frame, a carriage slidably carried by the raceway for providing a linear to and fro movement of the carriage along the raceway, wherein the shaft of the shaker head segment is rotatably carried by the carriage, and a crank assembly operable with an elongate rod rotatably attached to the carriage for providing the to and fro movement to the carriage.</p>
    <p num="12">In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the plurality of shaker head segments includes three pairs of shaker head segments, and each of the pairs of shaker head segments is operable for providing the parallel and opposing displacing movement to the shaker head segments within the pair, and wherein the three pairs of shaker head segments operate independently of the other pairs.</p>
    <p num="13">
      In one embodiment, the finger elements are carried within an elongate rigid sleeve extending from a disk for receiving the finger element therein.
      <br/>
      The rigid sleeves sufficiently cover each finger element for providing rigidity to an axial portion of the finger element.
      <br/>
      In an alternate embodiment, the finger elements within each shaker head segment are attached to the shaft in a helical pattern, and adjoining shaker head segments have the helical pattern of finger elements arranged for providing a continuous helical pattern from a top portion of the shaker head to a bottom portion thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      A preferred embodiment includes the frame rotatably carried by a mobile carrier for movement from an operating position to a transporting position.
      <br/>
      A conveyor is carried by the mobile carrier for receiving fruit falling from the tree and delivering the fruit outwardly therefrom.
      <br/>
      A flexible trunk seal is juxtaposed with the conveyor for assisting fruit falling from the tree proximate a trunk of the tree being harvested to roll onto the conveyor.
      <br/>
      The flexible trunk seal is positioned for contacting the trunk in a sealing arrangement when operating with a similar and opposing fruit harvester.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      A trunk sensor is operable with positioning means for positioning the conveyor and seal at a desirable distance from the trunk.
      <br/>
      One embodiment of the trunk sensor includes an elongate sensing rod extending in spaced relation from the mobile carrier and longitudinally along a direction of travel of the mobile carrier.
      <br/>
      The elongate sensing rod is operable for slidably biasing against the trunk and activating the positioning means for providing lateral movement of the conveyor and seal in response to movement of the sensing rod.
    </p>
    <p num="16">A method aspect of the invention includes the steps of providing a single shaker head having a plurality of shaker head segments aligned along an axis for freely rotating thereabout, each shaker head segment having a shaft and a plurality of flexible finger elements rotatably carried by and radially extending from the shaft for penetrating fruit bearing branches of a tree, extending the single shaker head, and thus the plurality of flexible finger elements into branches of a tree to be harvested, and independently displacing each axis of the shaker head segments in a linear to and fro manner from the axis of the shaker head, wherein adjacent shaker head segments are displaced in parallel and opposing directions for providing an oscillating movement to the plurality of finger elements for providing balance and stability to the shaker head during shaking movement of tree branches being harvested.</p>
