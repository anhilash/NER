    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">a) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to system and method for communicating an information via a common communication bus applicable to an in-vehicle communication network architecture.</p>
    <p num="4">b) Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">A Japanese Patent Application First Publication (not examined) No. Heisei 4-326898 published on Nov. 16, 1992 exemplifies a previously proposed in-vehicle data communication system.</p>
    <p num="6">The previously proposed in-vehicle information communication system disclosed in the above-identified Japanese Patent Application First Publication includes: a master unit which performs a display of various types of information using a display; a plurality of slave units, each of which an information used for the display purpose on the display of the master units is transferred therefrom to the master unit; and a common communication bus to which the master unit and the slave units are connected.</p>
    <p num="7">Even if another slave unit which is not previously projected by the master unit is connected to the common communication bus, the display of the master unit can display an information representing the function of the other slave unit.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">However, in the previously proposed in-vehicle information communication system, in a case where such any one of the slave units as being operated utilizing a function of another slave unit is connected to the common communication bus prior to the connection of the other slave unit which provides the function for the one slave unit to the common communication bus, the one slave unit cannot make use of the function of the other slave unit.</p>
    <p num="9">In addition, if one of the slave units which has been connected to the common communication bus is disconnected from the common communication bus, such a countermeasure that how an operation of the whole in-vehicle information communication system should be arranged is not considered.</p>
    <p num="10">
      On the other hand, in the previously proposed in-vehicle communication system, the slave units are operated according to operations by an operator(s).
      <br/>
      And, the master unit determines the slave unit which is being operated and displays the information used for the display purpose on the display of the master unit.
      <br/>
      Hence, the slave units cannot be installed at locations inaccessible to the operator(s).
    </p>
    <p num="11">Furthermore, the master unit cannot select any one of the slave units and cannot operate simultaneously the slave units.</p>
    <p num="12">In addition, since the contents of operations which are not previously projected on the display information cannot be added, an improvement in operability cannot be expected.</p>
    <p num="13">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide information communication system and method applicable to an in-vehicle networking architecture which can freely connect and disconnect such a slave unit or slave units as described above to and from a common communication bus and can contribute onto the improvement in operability.</p>
    <p num="14">The above-described object can be achieved by providing an information communication system, comprising: a function serving electronic equipment which is so arranged and constructed as to be enabled to serve another electronic equipment with at least one function that the function serving electronic equipment has; a making-use-of function electronic equipment which is so arranged and constructed as to be enabled to make use of at least one function that another electronic equipment has; a common communication bus to which the function serving electronic equipment and the making-use-of function are enabled to be connected; and an equipment managing apparatus which is enabled to be connected to the common communication bus and including a storage block for storing a function serving information representing the function which the function serving electronic equipment is enabled to serve and a making-use-of function information representing the function of which the making-use-of function electronic equipment is enabled to make use, and a comparing block for comparing the function serving information stored in the storage block with the making-use-of function information stored in the storage block so as to determine whether both contents of the function serving information and the making-use-of function information are coincident with each other, the equipment managing apparatus allowing the making-use-of function electronic equipment to make use of the function which the function serving electronic equipment is enabled to serve when determining that both contents of the function serving information and the making-use-of function information are coincident with each other.</p>
    <p num="15">The above-described object can also be achieved by providing an information communication system, comprising: a function serving electronic equipment which is so arranged and constructed as to be enabled to serve another electronic equipment with at least one function that the function serving electronic equipment has; a making-use-of function electronic equipment which is so arranged and constructed as to be enabled to make use of at least one function that another electronic equipment has; a common communication bus to which the function serving electronic equipment and the making-use-of function are enabled to be connected; and equipment managing apparatus which is enabled to be connected to the common communication bus and including storage means for storing a function serving information representing the function which the function serving electronic equipment is enabled to serve and a making-use-of function information representing the function of which the making-use-of function electronic equipment is enabled to make use, and comparing means for comparing the function serving information stored in the storage means with the making-use-of function information stored in the storage means so as to determine whether both contents of the function serving information and the making-use-of function information are coincident with each other, the equipment managing apparatus allowing the making-use-of function electronic equipment to make use of the function which the function serving electronic equipment is enabled to serve when determining that both contents of the function serving information and the making-use-of function information are coincident with each other.</p>
    <p num="16">The above-described object can also be achieved by providing an information communication method, comprising the steps of: connecting a function serving electronic equipment which is so arranged and constructed as to be enabled to serve another electronic equipment with at least one function that the function serving electronic equipment has to a common communication bus; connecting a making-use-of function electronic equipment which is so arranged and constructed as to be enabled to make use of at least one function that another electronic equipment has to the common communication bus; connecting an equipment managing apparatus to the common communication bus; storing a function serving information representing the function which the function serving electronic equipment is enabled to serve and a making-use-of function information representing the function of which the making-use-of function electronic equipment is enabled to make use into a storage block of the equipment managing apparatus; comparing the function serving information stored in the storage block with the making-use-of function information stored in the storage block so as to determine whether both contents of the function serving information and the making-use-of function information are coincident with each other; and allowing the making-use-of function electronic equipment to make use of the function which the function serving electronic equipment is enabled to serve when determining that both contents of the function serving information and the making-use-of function information are coincident with each other at the comparing step.</p>

    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="18">Reference will hereinafter be made to the drawings in order to facilitate a better understanding of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="19">(First Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="20">FIG. 1A shows a first preferred embodiment of an information communication system applicable to an in-vehicle networking architecture according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="21">
      In FIG. 1A, a first function serving electronic equipment 21 and a second function serving electronic equipment 23 are connected to a common communication bus 1.
      <br/>
      Each function serving electronic equipment 21 and 23 is an electronic equipment which can serve another electronic equipment with a function (or functions) thereof and is constituted by, for example, a monitor having an operation switch or a voice recognition device.
      <br/>
      Each making-use-of function electronic equipment 31 and 33 is an electronic equipment which can make use of the function or the functions of another electronic equipment and is constituted by, for example, a car navigation system, an audio equipment, a vehicular air conditioner, and a mobile telephone with a vehicular adapter.
    </p>
    <p num="22">Each making-use-of function electronic equipment 31 and 33 is interconnected to the common communication bus 1, thus a bus type network being formed together with each function serving electronic equipment 21 and 23.</p>
    <p num="23">
      In addition, an equipment managing apparatus 11 performs a management of the network having these pieces of electronic equipment 21, 23, 31, and 33 interconnected to the common communication bus 1.
      <br/>
      The equipment managing apparatus 11 includes an information storage block 13, an information comparing block 15, and connection managing block 17.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The information storing block 13 stores thereinto a serving function information representing functions with which the first and second function serving pieces of the electronic equipment 21 and 23 can serve and a making-use-of function information representing functions of the other pieces of electronic equipment of which each of the first and second making-use-of function pieces of the electronic equipment 31 and 33 can make use.
      <br/>
      The information storage block 13 is constituted by a RAM (Random Access Memory).
    </p>
    <p num="25">The information comparing block 15 compares the information stored in the information storage block 13.</p>
    <p num="26">
      The connection managing block 15 performs the management of connection situations of these pieces of the electronic equipment 21, 23, 31, and 33 connected onto the communication bus 1.
      <br/>
      The information comparing block 15 and the connection managing block 15 are constituted by, e.g., a microcomputer.
    </p>
    <p num="27">In addition, the equipment managing apparatus may be constituted by the microcomputer having the RAM.</p>
    <p num="28">Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 1B, a third electronic equipment 30A mixing both functions of the function serving electronic equipment 31A and the making-use-of function electronic equipment 23A is connected to the common communication bus 1.</p>
    <p num="29">It is noted that a reference numeral 10 in FIGS. 1A and 1B denotes a whole in-vehicle information communication system and each equipment and managing apparatus has an information interface communication unit IC (ICU) connected to the common communication bus 1.</p>
    <p num="30">Next, an operation of the in-vehicle information communication system will be described below with reference to FIGS. 2 through 5.</p>
    <p num="31">In FIG. 2, at a step S100, the equipment managing apparatus 11 initializes so as to wait for a receipt of an information to be transmitted from the information serving electronic equipment 21 or 23 (23A) or from the making-use-of function electronic equipment 31 or 33 (31A).</p>
    <p num="32">At a step S110, when the managing apparatus 11 has received the information from any one of the pieces of electronic equipment, the routine goes to a step S120.</p>
    <p num="33">
      At the step S120, the managing apparatus 11 determines whether the received information is the serving function information or not.
      <br/>
      If it is the serving function information (YES) at the step S120, the routine goes to a step S125.
      <br/>
      If it is not the making-use-of information (NO) at the step S120, the routine goes to a step S130.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Now, an operation of the storage of the serving function information by the managing apparatus at the step S125 will be described below.</p>
    <p num="35">When the equipment managing apparatus 11 recognizes that the received information from the common communication bus 1 is the function serving information at the step S120 (YES), the routine of the step S125 goes to the step S210 of FIG. 3 in which the received function serving information is stored in the information storing block 13 within the equipment managing apparatus 11.</p>
    <p num="36">At a step S220 of FIG. 3, the equipment managing apparatus 11 searches the information stored in the information storing block 13 for the making-use-of function information.</p>
    <p num="37">
      If the making-use-of function information is searched out at the step S220 (NO) at the step S220, the routine goes to a step S223.
      <br/>
      If the search of the making-use-of function information is ended at the step S220 (YES), the process during the storage of the function serving information of FIG. 3 is ended.
    </p>
    <p num="38">At the step S223, the content of the searched making-use-of function information is compared with that of the received function serving information.</p>
    <p num="39">If both contents of the searched making-use-of function information and received function serving information are coincident with each other at the step S223, the routine goes to a step S225.</p>
    <p num="40">If not coincident with each other (NO) at the step S223, the routine returns to the step S220.</p>
    <p num="41">At the step S225, the equipment managing apparatus 11 transmits a registration instruction information to one of the making-use-of function pieces of electronic equipment 31 or 33 (or 31A) which has transmitted the making-use-of function information thereto to register one of the function serving equipment 21 or 23 (or 23A) which has already transmitted the function serving information to the managing apparatus 11 into its making-use-of function source list.</p>
    <p num="42">Referring back to a step S130 of the flowchart shown in FIG. 2, the equipment managing apparatus 11 searches whether the received information is the making-use-of function information.</p>
    <p num="43">If the received information is determined to be the making-use-of function information (YES) at the step S130, the routine goes to a step S135.</p>
    <p num="44">If (NO) at the step S130, the routine goes to a step S140.</p>
    <p num="45">At the step S135, the process during the storage of the making-use-of function information is advanced as shown in FIG. 4.</p>
    <p num="46">FIG. 4 shows the detailed processing routine of the step S135.</p>
    <p num="47">That is to say, at a step S310, the equipment managing apparatus 11 stores the received making-use-of function information into the information storing block 13 within the equipment managing apparatus 11.</p>
    <p num="48">At a step S320, the equipment managing apparatus searches the information stored in the information storing block 13 for the function serving information.</p>
    <p num="49">If the function serving information is searched (NO) at the step S320, the routine goes to a step S323.</p>
    <p num="50">If the search for the function serving information is ended (YES) at the step S323, the routine of FIG. 4 (step S135) is ended.</p>
    <p num="51">
      At the step S323, the equipment managing apparatus 11 compares the content of the searched function serving information with that of the received making-use-of function information.
      <br/>
      If both contents of information are coincident with each other at the step S323 (YES), the routine goes to a step S325.
      <br/>
      If both contents of information are not coincident with each other (NO) at the step S323, the routine returns to repeat the step S320.
    </p>
    <p num="52">At the step S325, the equipment managing apparatus 11 transmits the registration instruction information to one of the connected making-use-of function pieces of electronic equipment 31 or 33 (or 31A) to register the one of the function serving pieces of electronic equipment 21 or 23 (or 21A) from which the corresponding function serving information is transmitted into the making-use-of function source list.</p>
    <p num="53">Referring back to a step S140 of the flowchart shown in FIG. 2, the equipment managing apparatus 11 detects whether any one electronic equipment is disconnected from the common communication bus 1.</p>
    <p num="54">If disconnected (YES) at the step S140, the routine goes to a step S145.</p>
    <p num="55">If NO (not disconnected) at the step S140, the routine returns to the step S110 for the managing apparatus 11 to wait for the subsequent receipt of the information described above.</p>
    <p num="56">FIG. 5 shows the detailed routine at the step S145 of FIG. 2 to process the disconnection of any one of the pieces of electronic equipment.</p>
    <p num="57">That is to say, at a step S410, upon detection of the disconnection of any one electronic equipment from the bus 1 the connection managing block 17 searches the information stored in the information storing block 13 for the function serving information.</p>
    <p num="58">
      If all searches of the function serving information are not ended at the step S410 (NO), the routine goes to a step S412.
      <br/>
      If all of the searches for the function serving information are ended (YES) at the step S410, the routine goes to a step S420.
    </p>
    <p num="59">At the step S412, the comparing block in the equipment managing apparatus 11 determines whether the content of the searched function serving information is coincident with that of the information on the disconnected electronic equipment.</p>
    <p num="60">
      If both contents of the information are coincident with each other (YES) at the step S412, the routine goes to a step S414.
      <br/>
      If both contents of information are not coincident with each other (NO) at the step S412, the routine returns to the step S410.
    </p>
    <p num="61">At the step S414, the making-use-of function information is searched from among the information stored in the information storing block 13.</p>
    <p num="62">If (NO), namely, the search for the making-use-of function information is ended at the step S414, the routine goes to a step S416.</p>
    <p num="63">If YES, namely, the search for the making-use-of function information is ended at the step S414, the routine returns to the step S410.</p>
    <p num="64">At the step S416, the equipment managing apparatus 11 determines whether the content of the searched making-use-of function information is coincident with that of the function serving information of the disconnected one of the function information serving electronic equipment pieces 21 or 23 (21A).</p>
    <p num="65">If both contents of the information is coincident with each other at the step S416 (YES), the routine goes to a step S418.</p>
    <p num="66">If both contents of the information is not coincident with each other (NO) at the step S416, the routine returns to the step S414.</p>
    <p num="67">At the step S418, the managing apparatus 11 transmits a deletion instruction information to one of the making-use-of function pieces of electronic equipment 31 or 33 (31A) which has transmitted the making-use-of function information to delete the disconnected one of the function serving pieces of electronic equipment 21 or 23 from its making-use-of function source list.</p>
    <p num="68">On the other hand, at the step S420, the equipment managing apparatus 11 searches the information stored in the information storing block 13 for the making-use-of function information.</p>
    <p num="69">
      If all of searches for the making-use-of function information is not ended at the step S420 (NO), the routine goes to a step S422.
      <br/>
      If all of the searches for the making-use-of function information are ended (YES) at the step S420, the routine returns to the step S110 of FIG. 2.

    <p num="97">
      As described above, in the first embodiment, the equipment managing apparatus 11 is connected to the common communication bus 1.
      <br/>
      When each of the function serving pieces of electronic equipment 21, 23, (or 21A) is connected to the common communication bus 1, the function serving information is stored in the information storing block 13 of the equipment managing apparatus 11.

      Thereafter, when the equipment managing apparatus 11 detects that the electronic equipment has been connected to the common communication bus 1, the managing apparatus 11 determines whether the connected equipment is either such a function serving electronic equipment or such a making-use-of function electronic equipment as described above.
      <br/>
      If the managing apparatus 11 determines that the connected electronic equipment is the function serving electronic equipment 21, 23, (or 21A), the function serving information is stored in the information storing block 13.

    </p>
    <p num="101">
      On the other hand, if the connected electronic equipment is the corresponding making-use-of function electronic equipment, the making use-of function information is stored in the information storing block 13.
      <br/>
      Then, the managing apparatus 11 searches for the making-use-of function information from among the stored information in the information storing block 13.
    </p>
    <p num="102">If the function serving information is searched out from among the information stored in the information storing block 13, the corresponding making-use-of function electronic equipment 31, 33, (or 31A) makes use of the function of the corresponding one of the function serving pieces 21, 23, (or 23A) of electronic equipment.</p>
    <p num="103">When the equipment managing apparatus 11 detects that any piece of electronic equipment is disconnected from the common communication bus 1, the managing apparatus determines if the disconnected electronic equipment 21, 23, (or 23A) or the making-use-of function electronic equipment 21, 33, (or 31A).</p>
    <p num="104">
      If the disconnected electronic equipment is the function serving electronic equipment 21, 23, (or 23A), the managing apparatus 11 searches for the making-use-of function information from among the information stored in the information storing block 13.
      <br/>
      If the making-use-of information is searched, the corresponding making-use-of function electronic equipment 31, 33, (or 31A) suspends the making use of the disconnected function serving electronic equipment.
    </p>
    <p num="105">If the disconnected electronic equipment is the corresponding making-use-of function electronic equipment 31, 33, (or 31A). the managing apparatus 11 searches for the function serving a information from among the information stored in the information storing block 13.</p>

    <p num="107">Consequently, it is possible to make an effective use of the function that each electronic equipment has since the function of each function serving electronic equipment 21, 23, (or 21A) can be made use of via the common communication bus 1.</p>
    <p num="108">
      Furthermore, even if either the function serving electronic equipment 21, 23, (or 21A) or the making-use-of function electronic equipment 31, 33, (or 31A) is connected with the pieces of electronic equipment connected to the communication bus 1 operated, it is possible to make use of the function that the newly connected function serving electronic equipment 21, 23, (or 21A) has and for the newly connected making-use-of function electronic equipment 31, 33, (or 31A) to make use of the function of the function serving electronic equipment 21, 23, (or 21A) connected to the common communication bus 1.

      Thus, degrees of freedom when the electronic equipment is made use of and the electronic equipment architecture can be improved.

    <p num="296">If the equipment managing apparatus 61 compares the searched function serving information with the received making-use-of function information and both arguments of the information are coincident with each other, the managing apparatus 61 transmits the registration instruction information to the navigation system 81 which has transmitted the making-use-of function information to the managing apparatus 61 to register the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch into its function making-use-of function source list and transmits the registration instruction information to the mobile telephone 83 to register the searched monitor 73 with the rear occupant seat positioned switch into its making-use-of function source list.</p>
    <p num="297">Hence, the navigation system 81 can become making-use-of the dial type switch function and the wide type monitor function of the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch and making use of the dial type switch function and the wide type monitor function of the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch.</p>
    <p num="298">In addition, the mobile telephone 83 can become making use of the joystick type switch function and the normal type monitor function of the monitor 73 with the rear occupant seat positioned switch.</p>
    <p num="299">As shown in FIG. 16B, when the equipment managing apparatus 61 detects that any one electronic equipment is disconnected from the common communication bus 51, the managing apparatus 61 searches for the function serving information from among the information stored in the information storing block 63.</p>
    <p num="300">It is herein noted that the equipment managing apparatus 61 searches for the function serving information on the monitor 71 with the front seat positioned switch and the monitor 73 with the rear occupant seat positioned switch.</p>
    <p num="301">In the case of FIG. 15, since the disconnected equipment information is coincident with the function serving information of the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch stored in the information storing block 63, the managing apparatus 61 transmits the deletion instruction information to the navigation system 81 which can make use of the function of the monitor 71 with the front seat positioned switch, as shown in FIG. 16C, to delete the disconnected monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch from its making-use-of function source list of the car navigation system 81.</p>
    <p num="302">Next, an initialize processing of the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch, the monitor 73 with the rear occupant seat positioned switch, the navigation system 81, and the mobile telephone 83 will be described below.</p>
    <p num="303">First, each electronic equipment is initialized.</p>
    <p num="304">Each electronic equipment searches whether the function serving information is present or not according to the content of command in its information.</p>
    <p num="305">If the function serving information is present (the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch and the monitor 73 with the rear occupant seat positioned switch), the corresponding electronic equipment transmits the making-use-of function information to the equipment managing apparatus 61 via the common communication bus 51.</p>
    <p num="306">Next, the receive processing of the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch will be described below.</p>
    <p num="307">If the making-use-of function request information is received from the navigation system 81 and the mobile telephone 83, the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch registers the navigation system 81 and the mobile telephone 83 which has transmitted the making-use-of function information into the function serving information into the function serving source list and provides the navigation system 81 with the dial type switch function and the wide type monitor function and the monitor 73 provides the mobile telephone 83 with the joystick type switch function and the normal type monitor function.</p>
    <p num="308">Next, the receive processing of the car navigation system 83 will be described below.</p>
    <p num="309">The car navigation system 83 registers the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch into its making-use-of function source list in response to the registration instruction information when the registration instruction information is received, transmits the making-use-of function requesting information requesting the serving of the dial type switch function and the wide type monitor function to request the provision of the dial type switch function and the wide type monitor for the monitor 71 with the front seat positioned switch, and makes use of the dial type switch function and the wide type monitor function of the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch.</p>
    <p num="310">However, since the deletion instruction information is received from the managing apparatus 61 that the monitor 71 has disconnected from the bus 51, the car navigation system 81 deletes the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch from its making-use-of function source list, when the deletion instruction information is received, and is operated without making use of the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch.</p>
    <p num="311">In FIG. 15, when, with the equipment managing apparatus 61 connected to the common communication bus 51, the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch and the monitor 73 with the rear occupant positioned switch are connected to the common communication bus 51, the function serving information is stored in the function storing block 63 and the making-use-of function information is stored in the information storing block 63 when each of the navigation system 81 and the mobile telephone 83 is connected to the common communication bus 51.</p>
    <p num="312">Thereafter, when the equipment managing apparatus 61 detects that a certain electronic equipment is disconnected from the common communication bus 51, the equipment managing apparatus 61 determines whether the disconnected electronic equipment is the equipment which can serve another electronic equipment with the function that the disconnected electronic equipment has.</p>
    <p num="313">If the disconnected electronic equipment is the equipment which can serve another equipment with the function that the disconnected electronic equipment has (the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch), the managing apparatus 61 searches for the information of the pieces of electronic equipment which can make use of the function (the navigation system 81) with which the other electronic equipment can serve from among the information stored in the information storing block 63.</p>
    <p num="314">If the corresponding information is searched out, each navigation system 81 suspends the making-use-of functions of the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch.</p>
    <p num="315">
      Consequently, even when, with each electronic equipment connected to the common communication bus 51 operated, the connected monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch is disconnected from the common communication bus 51, it is possible for each electronic equipment still connected to the bus 51 to be operated without making use of the switch and monitor functions of the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch.
      <br/>
      It is noted that if the disconnected equipment is one of the pieces of function making-use-of equipment 81 or 83, the managing apparatus 61 only deletes the corresponding stored making-use-of function information and does not inform the corresponding one of the pieces of the function serving equipment 71 or 73 whose functions have been made use of by the disconnected equipment 81 or 83 that the corresponding one of the pieces of the function making-use-of equipment has disconnected from the bus 51.

    <p num="317">FIG. 17 shows a system configuration of the in-vehicle information communication system in a sixth preferred embodiment according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="318">Since the same reference numerals as those described in the second embodiment correspond to the like elements, the detailed explanation thereof will be omitted herein.</p>
    <p num="319">In FIG. 17, the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch, the monitor 73 with the rear occupant seat positioned switch, the car navigation system 81, and the mobile telephone 83 are interconnected to the communication bus 51 to form the bus type networking architecture.</p>
    <p num="320">Next, the operation of the in-vehicle information communication system 50 will be described below, with the mobile telephone 83 disconnected.</p>
    <p num="321">FIGS. 18A, 18B, and 18C show the explanatory views for explaining the operation of the in-vehicle communication apparatus 50.</p>
    <p num="322">As shown in FIGS. 18A, 18B, and 18C, the equipment managing apparatus 61 is initialized and waits for the receipt of the information from each of the monitor 71 with the front seat positioned switch, the monitor 73 with the rear seat positioned switch, the navigation system 81, and the mobile telephone 13.</p>
    <p num="323">When the equipment managing apparatus 61 receives the information from the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch, the monitor 73 with the rear occupant seat positioned switch, the navigation system 81, and the mobile telephone 83.</p>
    <p num="324">When the equipment managing apparatus 61 receives the information from the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch and from the monitor 73 with the rear occupant seat positioned switch, the managing apparatus 61 determines whether the received information is the function serving information or not according to the content of command in the information communication message.</p>
    <p num="325">If the received information is the function serving information, the managing apparatus 61 stores the received function serving information into the information storing block 63 within the equipment managing apparatus 61.</p>
    <p num="326">The managing apparatus thereafter searches for the making-use-of function information from among the information stored in the information storing block 63.</p>
    <p num="327">At this time, since no electronic equipment which can make use of the function of another electronic equipment is connected, the managing apparatus 61 does not search for the making-use-of function.</p>
    <p num="328">When the equipment managing apparatus 61, thereafter, receives the information from the navigation system 81 and the mobile telephone 83, the managing apparatus 61 determines whether the received information is the making use of function information according to the content of command in the information communication message.</p>
    <p num="329">If it is the making-use-of function information, the managing apparatus 61 stores the received making-use-of function information in the information storing block 63 within the equipment managing apparatus 61.</p>
    <p num="330">The managing apparatus 61 searches for the function serving information from among the information stored in the information storing block and searches for the function serving information from among the information stored in the information storing block 63.</p>
    <p num="331">The information storing block 63 searches for the information serving information from among the information stored in the information storing block 63.</p>
    <p num="332">
      It is noted that the information storing block 63 stores the information of the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch, viz.,
      <br/>
      resource (address, monitor, switch joystick)
    </p>
    <p num="333">
      and the information of the monitor 73 with the rear occupant seat positioned switch, viz.,
      <br/>
      resource (address, monitor, switch dial)
    </p>
    <p num="334">When the searched function serving information and the received making-use-of function information are compared with each other,</p>
    <p num="335">Then, when the searched function serving information is compared with the received making-use-of function information and both arguments of the information is coincident with each other, the equipment managing apparatus 61 transmits the registration instruction information to the navigation system 81 from which the above-described making-use-of function information has transmitted to register the searched monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch and the searched monitor 73 with the rear occupant seat positioned switch into the making-use-of function source list and to the mobile telephone 83 to register the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch into its making-use-of function source list.</p>
    <p num="336">Hence, the navigation system 81 can make use of both of the joystick type switch function of the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch and the dial type switch function of the monitor 73 with the rear occupant seat positioned switch and the mobile telephone 83 can make use of the joystick type switch function of the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch.</p>
    <p num="337">Next, as shown in FIG. 18B, when the equipment managing apparatus 61 detects that the equipment is disconnected from the common communication bus 51, the equipment managing apparatus 61 searches for the function serving information from among the information stored in the information storing block 63.</p>
    <p num="338">Then, the managing apparatus 61 compares the searched function serving information with the information on the disconnected equipment.</p>
    <p num="339">
      In this case, the two pieces of function serving information are searched but are not coincident with the information of the disconnected equipment.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the managing apparatus 61 searches for the making-use-of function +information whose content of command is (search)}. In this case, the information in the car navigation system 81 and mobile telephone 83 is searched.
    </p>
    <p num="340">Then, when both arguments of the information on the disconnected equipment and the information on the mobile telephone 83 are coincident with each other, the managing apparatus 61 transmits the deletion instruction information to the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch to delete the disconnected mobile telephone 83 from the making-use-of function source list, as shown in FIG. 18C. Thereafter, the equipment managing apparatus 61 deletes the information on the disconnected mobile telephone 83 stored in the information storing block 63.</p>
    <p num="341">Next, the initialize processing of the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch, the monitor 73 with the seat occupant seat positioned switch, the navigation system 81, and the mobile telephone 83 will be described below.</p>
    <p num="342">
      First, each electronic equipment described above is initialized.
      <br/>
      Each electronic equipment, thereafter, determines whether the function serving information is present in itself.
    </p>
    <p num="343">In the case where the function serving information is present (the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch and the monitor 73 with the rear occupant seat positioned switch), each of the monitors 71 and 73 transmits its function serving information to the equipment managing apparatus 61 via the communication bus 51.</p>
    <p num="344">On the other hand, in the case where the making-use-of function information is present (navigation system 81 and the mobile telephone 83), the managing apparatus 61 transmits the making-use-of function to the equipment managing apparatus 61 via the communication bus 51.</p>
    <p num="345">The receive processing of the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch will be described below.</p>
    <p num="346">When the making-use-of function request information is received from the mobile telephone 83, the mobile telephone 83 is registered into the function serving source list of the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch and the monitor 71 serves the mobile telephone 83 with the joystick type switch function.</p>
    <p num="347">On the other hand, when the equipment managing apparatus 61 receives the deletion instruction information from the equipment managing apparatus 61, the monitor 71 deletes the mobile telephone 83 in response to the deletion instruction information source list to suspend the serving of the joystick type switch function.</p>
    <p num="348">Next, the receive processing of the mobile telephone 83 will be described below.</p>
    <p num="349">
      If the mobile telephone 83 receives the registration instruction information from the equipment managing apparatus 61, the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch is registered into its making-use-of function serving source list in response to the registration instruction information.
      <br/>
      The making-use-of function request information is transmitted to request that the joystick type switch function is to be served to the mobile telephone 83 itself to the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch.
      <br/>
      Then, the mobile telephone 83 makes use of the joystick type switch function via the common communication bus 51.
    </p>
    <p num="350">As described above, in the fifth embodiment, when, with the equipment managing apparatus 61 connected to the communication bus 51, the monitor 71 with the front seat positioned switch and the monitor 73 with the rear seat positioned switch are connected to the common communication bus 51, the managing apparatus 61 stores their function serving information into the information storing block 63.</p>
    <p num="351">In addition, when the navigation system 81 and the mobile telephone 83 are connected to the common communication bus 51, the managing apparatus 61 stores the making-use-of function information into the information storing block 63.</p>
    <p num="352">Thereafter, when the managing apparatus 61 detects that the certain electronic equipment is disconnected from the common communication bus 51, the managing apparatus 61 determines whether the disconnected electronic equipment is the function serving (enabling) electronic equipment or the making-use-of function (enabling) electronic equipment.</p>
    <p num="353">If the disconnected electronic equipment is the making use of function (enabling) equipment, the managing apparatus 61 searches for the information on the electronic equipment (the monitors 71 and/or 73) which is enabled to serve the function of which another equipment can be made use from among the information stored in the information storing block 63.</p>
    <p num="354">If the corresponding information is searched out, each or one of the monitors 71 and/or 73 suspends the serving of its function or functions to the navigation system 81 and the mobile telephone 83.</p>
    <p num="355">Consequently, even when, with each electronic equipment which is interconnected to the communication bus 51 operated, the mobile telephone 83 is disconnected from the communication bus 51, it is possible for the managing apparatus 61 to inform the monitor 71 with the front occupant seat positioned switch which has provided its function for the disconnected mobile telephone 83 that the mobile telephone 83 has been disconnected from the communication bus 51.</p>
    <p num="356">The advantages of the sixth embodiment are generally the same as those described in the second embodiment.</p>
    <p num="357">It is noted that the information format of the registration instruction information is answer(resource name, address �,address, - - - �) and the registration instruction information including the address or addresses of the function serving electronic equipment whose function (resource) is desired to be made use of is transmitted to the making-use-of function equipment or pieces of electronic equipment which is desired to make use of that function (resource), the-address indicating an address number of the electronic equipment having the resource and the address numbers being arranged continuously if a plurality of pieces of electronic equipment have the same resource and the resource name being exemplified by monitor or switch joystick or so on.</p>
    <p num="358">It is also noted that the information format of the deletion instruction information is delete (resource name, address) and the deletion instruction information including the resource name and the address number of the electronic equipment which cannot be made use of any more is transmitted to any one or more of the pieces of electronic equipment which have made use of the function (resource) that the disconnected electronic equipment has served.</p>

      <br/>
      The third electronic equipment 131 and the fourth electronic equipment 132 are constituted by, for example, the car navigation system, an audio/video equipment, an air conditioner, and/or the mobile telephone with the automotive adapter.
    </p>
    <p num="367">Next, the operation of the third embodiment will be described with reference to the flowcharts in FIGS. 18 through 25.</p>
    <p num="368">FIGS. 18, 19, 20, and 21 show respective flowcharts executed by the equipment managing apparatus 110.</p>
    <p num="369">FIGS. 22 and 23 show the flowcharts executed by each of the first electronic equipment 121 and the second electronic equipment 122.</p>
    <p num="370">FIGS. 22 and 24 show the flowcharts executed by each of the third electronic equipment 131 and the fourth electronic equipment 132.</p>
    <p num="371">At a step F120 of FIG. 18, the managing apparatus 110 is initialized and, at a step F130, waits for the receipt of the information from the network connected one of the first, second, third, and fourth pieces of electronic equipment 121, 122, 131, and 132.</p>
    <p num="372">On the other hand, at a step of F520 in FIG. 22, each of the electronic equipment is initialized and, at steps of F531 and F541, transmits the large classification data of the function which can be served to any other electronic equipment or the large classification data of the function of which any other electronic equipment can be made use.</p>
    <p num="373">
      Referring to FIG. 18, when the managing apparatus 110 receives the information on the large classification of the function with which the first or second electronic equipment 121 or 122 can serve the other electronic equipment at a step F140, the managing apparatus 110 stores the received information as the large classification registration data of the electronic equipment connected to the network 100 into the storing block 111 at a step F220.
      <br/>
      Then, the managing apparatus 110 compares the received information with the registration information on the function of which the other electronic equipment is requested to be made use using the comparing block 112 at a step F231.
    </p>
    <p num="374">If both are coincident with each other, at a step F232, the managing apparatus 110 determines that there is an equipment which is desired to make use of the large classification function presently received and tells the equipment which has been registered as the equipment which has requested to make use of the large classification of the added function (the third electronic equipment 131 or the fourth electronic equipment 133) the equipment (specifically the address) which has transmitted the information which has presently been received by the managing apparatus 110 (corresponds to the first electronic equipment 121 or the second electronic equipment 122) at a step F332.</p>
    <p num="375">At a step F720, when the third or fourth electronic equipment 131 or 132 is told by the managing apparatus 110 that there is the electronic equipment having the large classification function to be desired to be made use of (first electronic equipment 121 and the second electronic equipment 122), the third or fourth electronic equipment 131 or 132 makes an inquiry of detailed function whether the equipment having the large classification of the function of which the other electronic equipment is desired to be made use has a function of which is desired to be actually made use at a step F721.</p>
    <p num="376">
      When, at a step F730, the third or fourth electronic equipment receives a reply to the inquiry of the detailed function, the third or fourth electronic equipment 131 or 132 determines whether the received reply indicates that the inquired function can be made use of at a step F731.
      <br/>
      If the inquired function can be made use of, the third or fourth embodiment 131 or 132 registers the equipment having the inquired detailed function into its making-use-of function source list in order to make use of the function that the corresponding inquired electronic equipment has at a step F732.
    </p>
    <p num="377">
      On the other hand, when, at a step F620, the first or second electronic equipment 121 or 122 receives the inquiry of the detailed function from the third or fourth electronic equipment, the first or second electronic equipment 121 or 122 determines whether the detailed function is provided in itself at the step F630.
      <br/>
      If it is provided in itself at the step F630, the first or second electronic equipment 121 or 122 replies the inquired third or fourth electronic equipment 131 or 132 that the detailed function is provided in itself and can be made use of.
    </p>
    <p num="378">However, if the detailed function is not provided in itself, the first or second electronic equipment 121 or 122 replies the third or fourth electronic equipment 131 or 132 that the detailed function is not provided therein so as to be impossible to be made use of at a step F632.</p>
    <p num="379">Furthermore, when, at a step F160, the managing apparatus 110 detects that a certain electronic equipment is disconnected from the network 100, the managing apparatus 110 determines whether the disconnected electronic equipment has the function of which the other connected electronic equipment can be made use from the large classification registration information of the functions stored in the information storing block 111 at steps F420 and F410.</p>
    <p num="380">If the disconnected electronic equipment has the function with which the disconnected electronic equipment can serve the connected electronic equipment, the managing apparatus 110 compares the large classification function information on the function with which the disconnected electronic equipment can serve the connected electronic equipment with the large classification of the function registration information stored in the information storing block 111 using the comparing block 112 at steps F422 and F423.</p>
    <p num="381">If there is the electronic equipment which has registered to make use of the large classification function that the disconnected equipment has, the managing apparatus 110 tells that equipment that there is the equipment which has been disconnected from the network 100 at a step F424.</p>
    <p num="382">When, at a step F740, the third or fourth electronic equipment 131 or 132 is told by the managing apparatus 110 that the electronic equipment having the function for the third or fourth electronic equipment 131 or 132 to make use of at a step F740, the third or fourth electronic equipment 131 or 132 deletes the disconnected electronic equipment from its making-use-of function source list at a step F741 and is operated without making use of the function.</p>
    <p num="383">Next, when the managing apparatus 110 detects that the certain electronic equipment which has been connected to the network 100 is disconnected from the network 100 at the step F160, the managing apparatus 110 compares that function information with the registered information on the function of which the other electronic equipment is desired to be made use using the comparing block 112 at steps of F422 and F423.</p>
    <p num="384">If there is the registration information that the corresponding electronic equipment has registered that the function of the disconnected equipment is desired to be made use of, the managing apparatus 110 tells the latter equipment that the corresponding electronic equipment has been disconnected (omitted) from the network 100.</p>
    <p num="385">Then, the managing apparatus 110 deletes the registration data of the large classification of the function with which the disconnected electronic equipment can serve and of the large classification of the function of which the other electronic equipment is desired to be made use from the information storing block 110 at a step F440.</p>
    <p num="386">Next, a specific example of the operation in the third embodiment will be described below.</p>
    <p num="387">That is to say, the first electronic equipment 121 is constituted by the monitor with the front occupant seat positioned switch and the second electronic equipment 122 is constituted by the monitor with the rear occupant seat positioned switch.</p>

    <p num="395">In TABLE 2, 1 denotes the information of the large classification function serving information and 2 denotes the information of the large classification making-use-of function information.</p>
    <p num="396">
      In the initialize processing of each of the monitors 121 and 122 at the step F531, the monitor 121 with the front occupant seat positioned switch transmits the information of the large classification functions thereof, viz., the normal type monitor (monitor) and (switch) corresponding to the joystick type switch to the managing apparatus 110.
      <br/>
      In addition, the monitor 122 with the rear occupant seat positioned switch transmits the information of the large classification functions thereof, viz., the normal type monitor (monitor) and (switch) corresponding to the dial type switch to the managing apparatus 110.
    </p>
    <p num="397">When the managing apparatus 110 receives the information such as (monitor) and (switch) as the functions with which either the first or second electronic equipment 121 or 122 can serve from either the first or second electronic equipment at the step F140, the managing apparatus 110 stores its information into the information storing block 111 at the step F220.</p>
    <p num="398">Next, in the case where the navigation system 131 is desired to make use of the normal type monitor, the navigation system 131 transmits (monitor) as the large classification of the function to the managing apparatus 110 at the step F541.</p>
    <p num="399">When the managing apparatus 110 receives the large classification of the function to be desired to be made use of at the step F150, the managing apparatus 110 stores the information that the navigation system 131 is desired to make use of (monitor) into the information storing block 111 at the step F320.</p>
    <p num="400">At the steps F330 and F331, since the function serving (enabling) information is previously stored, the managing apparatus 110 searches for the registration list which indicates the function serving (enabling) equipment.</p>
    <p num="401">
      When (monitor) can be served by each of the monitors 121 and 122, the managing apparatus 110 informs the navigation system 131 that both of the monitors 121 and 122 can serve the navigation system 131 with the function of (monitor).
      <br/>
      When the navigation system 131 receives the information of the large classification of the function to be made use of at the step F720, the navigation system 131 makes the inquiry of the detailed function to each of the monitors 121 and 122 in the form of (normal monitor) at the step F721.
    </p>
    <p num="402">When each of the monitors 121 and 122 receives the inquiry of detailed functions of (normal monitor) at the step F620, each of the monitors 121 and 122 determines that each monitor has its own (normal monitor) function at the step F630, and replies the navigation system 131 that the inquired detailed function is provided therein and is enabled to be served at the step F631.</p>
    <p num="403">The navigation system 131 receives the reply for the inquiry of the detailed function from each of the monitors 121 and 122 at the step F730 and the detailed function is enabled to be served at the step F731.</p>
    <p num="404">Hence, the navigation system 131 registers the respective monitors 121 and 122 into its making-use-of function source list at the step F732.</p>
    <p num="405">For the navigation system 131, the same sequence of inquiry and reply, as described in the case of the normal monitor is applicable to the joystick type switch.</p>
    <p num="406">The navigation system 131 registers the monitor 121 with the front occupant seat positioned switch into the making-use-of function source list as the joystick type switch being made use of.</p>
    <p num="407">Thereafter, the navigation system 131 makes use of both functions of the normal monitor and joystick type switch with which the monitor 121 with the front occupant switch can serve the navigation system 131.</p>
    <p num="408">Since the electronic equipment which can add the new function thereinto utilizing another electronic equipment can utilize the electronic equipment which can serve another electronic equipment with the function with which the electronic equipment itself is provided via the network, the effective use of a resource such as the function that each electronic equipment has becomes possible.</p>
    <p num="409">In addition, it is possible to connect a new electronic equipment to the network 100, with the pieces of electronic equipment constituting the networking architecture operated.</p>
    <p num="410">It is also possible for the other electronic equipment to use the function that the newly connected electronic equipment has, and for the newly connected electronic equipment to use the function that the other electronic equipment on the network has.</p>
    <p num="411">The advantages of the third embodiment are generally the same as those described in each of the previously described embodiments.</p>
    <p num="412">(Fourth Embodiment)</p>

    <p num="419">The audio equipment 1100 is a modular acoustic equipment in which audio functions such as a radio receiver, CD (Compact Disc) drive, and a cassette tape deck are integrated.</p>
    <p num="420">The above-described pieces of electronic equipment 3000, 5000, 7000, 9000, and 1100 are respectively called slave stations.</p>
    <p num="421">In addition to the functions that the respective slave stations themselves have, the respective slave stations can make use of the functions that the master station 1700 have by communicating with the master station 1700.</p>
    <p num="422">The master station 1700 have the monitor function and switch function and serves each slave station with each function in accordance with the operation by the vehicular occupant.</p>
    <p num="423">An operation switch 1300 positioned on the rear occupant seat is operated by the vehicular occupant generally seated on the rear occupant seat of the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="424">The master station 1700, each slave station and the operation switch 1300 are interconnected to the common communication bus 1500 and transmit the communication information mutually to each other via the common communication bus 1500.</p>
    <p num="425">Next, FIG. 26 shows a detailed structure of the in-vehicle information communication system in the eighth embodiment.</p>
    <p num="426">It is noted that each slave station shown in FIG. 25 has common essential elements as shown in the slave station 2100 of FIG. 26 and only a respective one of the slave stations will be described in details below.</p>
    <p num="427">The slave station 2100 includes: an information transfer controller 2300; an execution function memory unit 2500; and an operation menu memory unit 2900.</p>
    <p num="428">The slave station 2100 belongs to a group of the same structured slave stations not shown.</p>
    <p num="429">An execution function information representing a function that the corresponding slave station 2100 itself is executable is previously stored thereinto.</p>
    <p num="430">The execution function is a function of the corresponding slave station 2100 which can be executed therein by a control of the master station 1700.</p>
    <p num="431">For example, the execution function of the car navigation system 3000 shown in FIG. 25 is a road map function for displaying the road map information on a screen of a display unit.</p>
    <p num="432">The execution function of the TV tuner 5000 is a television function for receiving a broadcasting wave from a television broadcasting station and for displaying a television image on the screen of the display unit.</p>

    <p num="643">At the sequence T813, when the "DOWN" operation of the joystick switch of the operation switch 1300 is carried out, the display response information representing that the lower item has been selected is transmitted to the navigation system 3000 at the sequence T814.</p>
    <p num="644">
      The information transfer controller 2300 of the navigation system 3000 when receiving the display response information changes the position of the cursor to a lower item.
      <br/>
      The joystick switch is operated once toward the lower direction to move the position of cursor to "DISPLAY CHANGE".

    <p num="649">At a sequence of T816, when the information transfer controller 3100 receives the operation information, the display controller 4100 determines that "DISPLAY CHANGE" in presently selection state has been selected and transmits the display response information representing that the display change function has been selected in the navigation system 3000 from which the operation information is transmitted.</p>
    <p num="650">Next, at the sequence of T817, when the car navigation system 3000 receives the display response information, the operation menu information on the display change is transmitted to the master station 1700.</p>
    <p num="651">When the information transfer controller 3100 receives the operation menu information, the information transfer controller 3100 transmits the operation menu information to the display information memory unit 3700 to store it thereinto.</p>
    <p num="652">Then, the display controller 4100 carries out the display processing of the operation menu information and displays the operation menu information on the screen of the display unit 4300.</p>

    <p num="655">Hence, when the vehicular occupant operates the joystick switch vertically to move the position of cursor onto a desired item and makes the PUSH operation for the joystick switch, thus a desired operation being achieved.</p>
    <p num="656">
      In the fourth embodiment, the display controller 4100 of the master station 1700 carries out the determination of the operation information and transmits the display response information to the slave station 2100, the information transfer controller 2300 of the slave station 2100 repeats the selection and transmission of the operation menu.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the display information memory unit 3700 of the master station 1700 does not store all of the information in the operation menu information memory unit 2700 of the slave station 2100 but store only the necessary information, thus the capacity of memory to store the operation menu information can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="657">Consequently, the slave station can be located at an arbitrary position without limit of the slave station in a range by which the operator can be operated.</p>
    <p num="658">In addition, even if the plurality of slave stations are connected to the master station, the particular slave station can directly be selected.</p>
    <p num="659">Furthermore, the slave station can be added after the whole connection of the stations to the common communication bus.</p>
    <p num="660">(Fifth Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="661">FIG. 37 shows the in-vehicle information communication system in a fifth preferred embodiment according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="662">The detailed explanation of the same reference numerals as those described in the fourth embodiment will be omitted herein.</p>
    <p num="663">The whole system configuration of the in-vehicle information communication system is the same as in FIG. 25.</p>
    <p num="664">The detailed configuration of the in-vehicle information communication system 100 will be described with reference to FIG. 37.</p>
    <p num="665">The master station 10300 includes: the information transfer controller 3100; the execution function information memory unit 3300; the operation function information memory unit 3500; the display information memory unit 3700; the selection menu generating block 3900; the display controller 105001 the display unit 4300; a vehicular information determining block 10700; and the operation switch 5100 positioned on the front occupant seat.</p>
    <p num="666">The master station 10300 is provided with the display controller 10500 and the vehicular information determining block 10700.</p>
    <p num="667">The display controller 10500 performs the display, its updating, and the response processing to the display.</p>
    <p num="668">
      The vehicular information determining block 10700 determines whether the vehicle is running or not.
      <br/>
      When the vehicle stops and determines that the switch operation is possible, the vehicular information determining block 10700 transmits the operation enabled state information indicating that the operation is enabled to the display controller 10500.
    </p>
    <p num="669">Next, FIG. 38 shows an operation flowchart for explaining the operation of the display controller 10500.</p>
    <p num="670">It is noted that the steps S21000 through the steps S23000 have the same processing as steps described in the fourth embodiment.</p>
    <p num="671">If the operation information is received, the routine goes to the step S23200.</p>
    <p num="672">At the step S23200, the display controller 10500 transmits the received information representing that the operation information has been received to the vehicular information determining block 10700.</p>
    <p num="673">
      When the received information has been received, the vehicular information determining block 10700 upon receipt of the operation information determines the running situation of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      When the vehicle stops, the vehicular information determining block 10700 transmits the operation enabled information.
      <br/>
      The display controller 10500 determines that the operation enabled information has been received from the vehicular information determining block 10700.
    </p>
    <p num="674">If the operation enabled information is received, the routine goes to a step S24000.</p>
    <p num="675">If not received (NO) the routine goes to a step S23400.</p>
    <p num="676">At the step S23400, the display controller 10500 determines whether the received operation information is that transmitted from the switch except the switch 5100 positioned on the front occupant seat.</p>
    <p num="677">
      If the received operation information is that transmitted from the switch except the switch positioned on the front occupant seat 5100, the routine goes to a step S24000.
      <br/>
      If it is the information transmitted from the operation switch except the switch 5100 positioned on the front occupant seat, the routine goes to a step S21000 to repeat the routine of FIG. 38.
    </p>
    <p num="678">It is noted that the steps of S24000 through S43000 are the same as those shown in FIGS. 29 through 31 of the eighth embodiment and its modifications and these steps S24000 through S43000 are repeated.</p>
    <p num="679">As described above, since the vehicular information determining block 10700 determines whether the switch operation by the vehicular occupant particularly the vehicular driver is enabled.</p>
    <p num="680">
      The display controller 10500 determines whether the switch except the operation switch 5100 has been operated when the switch operation by the vehicle driver is not enabled.
      <br/>
      When the switch described above has been operated, the switch operation is accepted so that the switch operation by the vehicular occupant except the vehicular driver can be carried out.
      <br/>
      Consequently, even if the vehicular driver is driving the vehicle, the operation by the occupant seated on the rear occupant seat can be carried out.
    </p>
    <p num="681">Thus, the fifth embodiment can contribute to the improvement of operability.</p>
