      A collaborative navigation server is able to share network navigation information among a group of user terminals.
      <br/>
      The server can designate one of the user terminals as a leading terminal, so that the location information of information pages are relayed to all following terminals of the group, while a leading terminal is navigating through the information pages by using its browser.
      <br/>
      The server is also able to revoke the current leading terminal and designate a following terminal as a new leading terminal and re-designate the previous leading terminal as a following terminal.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates generally to a method for getting access to web sites via the Internet by a group of users.</p>
    <p num="2">
      It is known that users can retrieve information from World Wide Web sites (or web sites) via the Internet.
      <br/>
      The basic current model for retrieving information from web sites is a user initiated information searching.
      <br/>
      A user uses web browser software to request a web page from a web server software to locate the information relating to that web page.
      <br/>
      Very much like finding desired Internet bulletin boards, the person seeking information actively searches for it.
      <br/>
      One of the unique features of this model is the notion of "hyper-text," or links, embedded in web pages that have been retrieved.
      <br/>
      This feature enables the person in search for information to "navigate" from one web page to another.
      <br/>
      The tremendous popularity of World Wide Web sites and Internet attests to the effectiveness of this model.
    </p>
    <p num="3">However, with the current model, users at different user terminals are not able to exchange the information retrieved from web sites with each other via the Internet while they are individually surfing through the web sites.</p>
    <p num="4">Therefore, there is a need for a method by which a group of user terminals can exchange the information retrieved from web sites with each other while they are individually surfing through the web sites.</p>
    <p num="5">The present invention meets this need.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      In one aspect, the invention provides a method for exchanging information retrieved from a plurality of information repositories among a group of terminals.

      As shown in FIG. 9, step 904 defines a session (assuming that session 1 is defined).
      <br/>
      There are two methods to define a session.

      In the first method, a user can use collaborative application program in a user terminal (e.g. 104.1 or 104.2) to define the session, and then send the session definition to collaborative controller program.
      <br/>
      In a second method, a user can use keyboard 525 and mouse 526 to input a session definition to the collaborative controller program (224 or 324) via the user graphical interface (225 or 325).
      <br/>
      In this example, it is assumed that the defined is session definition 1 (804.1)

    <p num="96">In step 1010, the collaborative application program in the user terminal (that has sent the session request) receives the session definitions, responds to each of the prompts in the session definitions and returns the responses to collaborative controller program 224 or 324 to indicate to join which of the sessions.</p>
    <p num="97">In step 1012, collaborative controller program 224 or 324 registers the user terminal into the session list(s) for the respective session(s) to which the user terminal has indicated to join.</p>

      There are two methods to define a session as described in step 904.

      A number of events require to change the leading terminal status within a session.
      <br/>
      For example, a session can be presented by different people having different expertise at different user terminals.
      <br/>
      In this situation, when the user at the current leading terminal has completed his/her presentation, he/she will send a request to end his/her leading status.
      <br/>
      The session may be presented by several people having different available time schedule at different user terminals.
      <br/>
      In this situation, collaborative controller program 224 or 234 will periodically check the leading terminal schedule for the associated session.
      <br/>
      When the time for the current leading terminal expires, collaborative controller program 224 or 234 will find next available leading terminal.
      <br/>
      Or, during a session, a user at a following terminal may have questions and want to navigate the web pages in question to the leading terminal.
      <br/>
      In this situation, the following terminal will send a request to interact with the leading terminal.
