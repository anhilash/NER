      A semiconductor integrated circuit device includes a DLL circuit.
      <br/>
      The DLL circuit includes a frequency divider which frequency-divides an input clock at a frequency dividing ratio which is varied depending on a frequency of the input clock and thus results in a dummy clock and a reference clock.
      <br/>
      A delay system includes a variable delay circuit which delays the dummy clock.
      <br/>
      A control circuit controls a delay amount of the variable delay circuit so that a phase of a delayed dummy clock from the delay system and the reference clock becomes zero.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention generally relates to semiconductor integrated circuit devices, and more particularly, to a semiconductor integrated circuit device equipped with a delayed locked loop (DLL).</p>
    <p num="3">
      Recently, semiconductor integrated circuit devices have been advanced to operate at a high speed and have a high integration density.
      <br/>
      Further, it has been required that a phase-synchronized clock signal is supplied to given circuits in the semiconductor integrated circuit devices.
      <br/>
      More particularly, a synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM) is designed to be equipped with a DLL circuit, which supplies a signal synchronized in phase with an external clock signal to a plurality of output buffer circuits.
      <br/>
      The DLL circuit is required to have a higher precision in order to handle a higher frequency.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a conventional DLL circuit.
      <br/>
      An external clock signal supplied to a clock input pad 150 from the outside of the circuit passes through an input circuit 152 and is supplied, as a real clock, to a delay circuit 154 and a frequency divider 156.
      <br/>
      The frequency divider 156 frequency-divides the external clock signal at a frequency-dividing ratio of 2/8, and outputs a dummy clock Z and a reference clock X. The dummy clock Z is at a high level H during a period equal to two cycles of the external clock signal and is at a low level L during a period equal to six cycles thereof.
      <br/>
      The reference clock X is the inverted version of the dummy clock Z. That is, the reference clock X is at the low level L during the period equal to two cycles of the external clock signal, and is at the high level H during the period equal to six cycles thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The reference clock X is supplied to a phase comparator 158, while the dummy clock Z passes through a dummy delay circuit 160 and a dummy circuit 162, and is then supplied to the phase comparator 158.
      <br/>
      The dummy circuit 162 has the same circuit configurations as those of the input circuit 152 and an output circuit 168.
      <br/>
      The phase comparator 158 compares the phase of the delayed dummy clock Z with the phase of the reference clock X and results in a phase difference signal, which is supplied to the delay control circuit 164.
      <br/>
      The delay control circuit 164 controls, on the basis of the phase difference signal, a delay amount of the dummy delay circuit 160 so that the phase difference becomes zero.
      <br/>
      Thus, the delay amount of the dummy delay circuit 160 is controlled so that the rising edge of the dummy clock Z coincides with the rising edge of the reference clock X, that is, the delayed dummy clock Z lags behind the reference clock X by a delay of time equal to k cycles (k=2 in the case being concerned) of the external clock signal.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The delay circuit 154 supplied with the real clock has the same configuration as the dummy delay circuit 160, and is set to the same delay amount as that of the dummy delay circuit 160 by the delay control circuit 164.
      <br/>
      The real clock delayed by the delay circuit 154 is supplied to the output circuit 168.
      <br/>
      The output circuit 168 buffers data on a data bus in synchronism with the real clock, and outputs buffered data via a data output pad 170.
    </p>

      The dummy circuit 168 has the same configurations as those of the input circuit 152 and the output circuit 168.
      <br/>
      Thus, the data output by the data output pad 170 is in phase with the external clock signal applied to the clock input pad 150 in the state in which the delayed dummy clock Z lags behind the reference clock X by the delay of time equal to k cycles of the external clock signal.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The conventional circuit shown in FIG. 1 employs the frequency divider 156 which has a fixed frequency dividing ratio.
      <br/>
      In case where there is a small variable range of the frequency of the external clock signal, the circuit shown in FIG. 1 will operate properly.
      <br/>
      In contrast, if the external clock signal changes over a wide frequency range, an underflow will occur when the frequency of the external clock signal becomes high.
      <br/>
      The underflow is defined so that the delay control circuit 164 continues to generate the signal which further reduces the delay amount nevertheless the delay circuits 154 and 160 respectively set the minimum delay amounts.
      <br/>
      In this case, the phase difference signal generated by the phase comparator 158 does not become zero, and thus the on-lock state cannot be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      It is conceivable to increase the frequency dividing ratio of the frequency divider 156 and delay the rising edge of the reference clock X. However, in the above case, a situation in which the frequency of the external clock signal becomes low cannot be processed unless the delay circuits 154 and 160 are modified to have an increased number of delay stages in accordance with the delayed rising edge of the reference clock X. This increases the chip area.
      <br/>
      Further, the DLL circuit becomes likely to be affected by power system noise resulting from a variation in the power supply voltage because the above noise results from an accumulation of fine variations in the delay times in the respective delay stages.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="16">
      FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a DLL circuit according to a first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      An external clock externally supplied to a clock input pad 10 passes through an input circuit 20, which functions as a buffer, and is then supplied to a 1/2 frequency divider 30 and a selector circuit 32.
      <br/>
      The 1/2 frequency divider 30 divides the external clock at a frequency dividing ratio of 1/2 and results in two frequency-divided clocks which are accurately 180 degrees out of phase.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The selector circuit 32 has a configuration shown in FIG. 3, and includes transfer gates 55, 56 and 57, and an inverter 58.
      <br/>
      The transfer gate 55 is supplied with the output signal of the input circuit 20.
      <br/>
      The transfer gate 56 is supplied with the frequency-divided signal (0 degree) from the 1/2 frequency divider 30.
      <br/>
      The transfer gate 57 is supplied with the inverted frequency-divided signal (180 degrees) from the 1/2 frequency divider 30.
      <br/>
      The inverter 58 inverts a mode signal DL.
      <br/>
      The mode signal DL and the inverted mode signal thereof are applied to the transfer gates 55, 56 and 57.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The mode signal DL becomes high in a state in which a data latency is equal to 3, and is supplied from a mode register 34 shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The data latency describes an operation speed (operation mode) of an output circuit 50, and becomes larger as the frequency of the external clock becomes higher.
      <br/>
      When the mode signal DL is at the high level H (the external clock has the lowest frequency), the selector circuit 32 operates so that the transfer gate 55 is ON and the transfer gates 56 and 57 are OFF.
      <br/>
      The external clock passing through the input circuit 20 and the transfer gate 55 is output via a terminal 32A of the selector circuit 32, and is then supplied to a 0-degree DLL block 35.
      <br/>
      At that time, no signal is output via a terminal 32B of the selector circuit 32.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      When the mode signal DL is at the low level L, the transfer gates 56 and 57 are ON and the transfer gate 55 is OFF.
      <br/>
      Thus, the frequency-divided clock passing through the transfer gate 56 and the inverted frequency-divided clock passing through the transfer gate 57 are respectively output via the terminals 32A and 32B and are then supplied to the 0-degree DLL block 35.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The signal output via the terminal 32A of the selector circuit 32 (which is the frequency-divided clock when DL=L and is the external clock when DL=H) is supplied to frequency dividers 36 and 38 and a delay circuit 42 of the 0-degree DLL block 35 shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The signal output via the terminal 32B of the selector circuit 32 (which is the inverted frequency-divided clock when DL=L and is nothing when DL=H) is supplied to a delay circuit 41 of the 0-degree DLL block 35.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The frequency divider 36 divides the frequency-divided clock or the external clock at a frequency dividing ratio of, for example, 1/4.
      <br/>
      Hence, the frequency divider 36 generates the dummy clock Z which is at the high level H during the period equal to one cycle of the clock supplied thereto and is at the low level L during the period equal to three cycles thereof.
      <br/>
      Further, the frequency divider 36 generates the reference clock X which is the inverted version of the dummy clock Z. More particularly, the reference clock X is at the low level L during the period equal to one cycle of the clock supplied to the frequency divider 36 and is at the high level H during the period equal to three cycles thereof.
      <br/>
      The dummy clock Z and the reference clock X are then supplied to a selector circuit 40.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The frequency divider 38 divides the frequency-divided clock or the external clock at a frequency dividing ratio of, for example, 2/4.
      <br/>
      Hence, the frequency divider 38 generates the dummy clock Z which is at the high level H during the period equal to two cycles of the clock supplied thereto and is at the low level L during the period equal to two cycles thereof.
      <br/>
      Further, the frequency divider 38 generates the reference clock X which is the inverted version of the dummy clock Z. More particularly, the reference clock X is at the low level L during the period equal to two cycles of the clock supplied to the frequency divider 38 and is at the high level H during the period equal to two cycles thereof.
      <br/>
      The dummy clock Z and the reference clock X are then supplied to a selector circuit 40.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The selector circuit 40 selects the dummy clock Z and the reference clock X output by the frequency divider 36 when a mode signal LF (which is at the high level H when the data latency is equal to six) supplied from the mode register 34 is at the high level H. Also, the selector circuit 40 selects the dummy clock Z and the reference clock X output by the frequency divider 38 when a mode signal HF (which is at the high level H when the data latency is equal to 10 or 12) supplied from the mode register 34 is at the high level H. The reference clock X thus selected is supplied to a phase comparator 44, and the dummy clock thus selected passes through a dummy delay circuit 45 and a dummy circuit 46, and is then supplied to the phase comparator 44.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The dummy circuit 46 has the same configurations as those of the input circuit 20, the 1/2 frequency divider 30 and the output circuit 50 and has the same delay amounts as those thereof.
      <br/>
      The phase comparator 44 compares the phase of the delayed dummy clock dZ from the dummy circuit 46 with the phase of the reference clock X from the phase comparator 44, and results in a phase difference signal, which is supplied to a delay control circuit 47.
      <br/>
      The delay control circuit 47 controls, on the basis of the phase difference signal, the delay amount of the dummy delay circuit 45 so that the phase difference becomes zero.
      <br/>
      Thus, the delay amount of the dummy delay circuit 45 is controlled so that the rising edge of the dummy clock dZ coincides with the rising edge of the reference clock X, that is, the delayed dummy clock dZ lags behind the reference clock X by a delay of time equal to k cycles (k=2 in the case being concerned) of the external clock.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The delay circuit 41 supplied with the inverted frequency-divided clock and the dummy delay circuit 42 supplied with the frequency-divided clock have the same configuration as the dummy delay circuit 45, and are controlled, by the delay control circuit 47, to have the same delay amounts as that of the dummy delay circuit 45.
      <br/>
      The frequency-divided clock (0-degree clock) delayed by 360 degrees by the delay circuit 42 is supplied, as the real clock, to the output circuit 50, and the frequency-divided clock (180-degree clock) delayed by 180 degrees by the delay circuit 41 is supplied, as the inverted real clock, to the output circuit 50.
      <br/>
      The output circuit 50 buffers data on the data bus in synchronism with the real clock and the inverted real clock, and outputs buffered data via a data output pad 52.
      <br/>
      That is, the data output from the output circuit 50 is synchronized with the input clock externally supplied via the clock input pad 10.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The frequency-divided clock (0-degree clock) and the 180-degree-delayed frequency-divided clock (180-degree clock) are generated by the 0-degree DLL block 35 when the mode signal LF is at the high level H (the data latency is equal to 6) and the mode signal HF is at the high level H (the data latency is equal to 10 or 12).
      <br/>
      This is because high-speed access of a doubled access speed can be performed by reading data from a DRAM (from which data is supplied to the output circuit 50) in synchronism with the 0-degree clock and the 180-degree clock in a state in which the external clock of the data latency of 6, 10 or 12 has a high frequency.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The selector circuit 32 selects the external clock which has not been subjected to the 1/2 frequency dividing process and outputs it, via the terminal 32A, to the delay circuit 41 of the 0-degree DLL block 35, while the selector circuit 32 supplies no signal to the delay circuit 42 via the output terminal 32B.
      <br/>
      This is because, in the state in which the data latency is equal to 3 and the external clock has the lowest frequency, the access can be performed well by operating the DRAM (from which data is supplied to the output circuit 50) in synchronism with only the 180-degree clock.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      As described above, the above-mentioned DLL circuit selects, in accordance with the frequency of the input clock, either the input clock or the clock which has been subjected to the 1/2 frequency dividing process by the 1/2 frequency divider.
      <br/>
      The selected clock is supplied to the frequency dividers 36 and 38.
      <br/>
      Hence, it is possible to prevent occurrence of an underflow or overflow even if the frequency of the input clock changes widely.

      As shown in FIG. 4, the 1/2 frequency divider 30 includes NAND gates 61-68 and an inverter 69.
      <br/>
      A signal IN (which is the external clock from the input circuit 10) is supplied to NAND gates 61 and 62 of a first gate part.
      <br/>
      Also, the signal IN is inverted by the inverter 69, and is then supplied to the NAND gates 65 and 66 of a second gate part.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The NAND gates 61 and 62 are supplied with outputs of the NAND gates 68 and 67 of a slave latch part.
      <br/>
      The outputs of the NAND gates 61 and 62 are supplied to the NAND gates 63 and 64 of a master latch part.
      <br/>
      The NAND gates 63 and 64 are respectively supplied with outputs of the NAND gates 64 and 63, and complementary output signals of the NAND gates 63 and 64 are respectively supplied to the NAND gates 65 and 66.
      <br/>
      The NAND gates 67 and 68 are respectively supplied with the outputs of the NAND gates 65 and 66, and the complementary output signals of the NAND gates 67 and 68 are respectively supplied to the NAND gates 68 and 67.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The output terminals of the NAND gates 61-68 respectively correspond to nodes nd2-nd9.
      <br/>
      When the signal available at the node nd5 is taken as the frequency-divided clock, the inverted frequency-divided clock which is 180 degrees out of phase with respect to the frequency-divided clock is available at the node nd4.
      <br/>
      The frequency-divided clock thus obtained is supplied to the delay circuit 42 and the frequency divider 43 shown in FIG. 2, and the inverted frequency-divided clock is supplied to the delay circuit 41.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As described above, the complementary output signals of the slave latch part are gated by the input clock and are latched in the master latch part.
      <br/>
      Further, the complementary output signals of the master latch part are gated by the inverted input clock and are latched in the slave part.
      <br/>
      Then, the complementary output signals of the master latch part are output.
      <br/>
      Hence, it is possible to shift the phases of the first and second frequency-divided signals so that a phase difference of 180 degrees can accurately be obtained.

      The delay control circuit 47 controls the rising edge of the delayed dummy clock dZ obtained by passing through the dummy delay circuit 45 and the dummy circuit 46 to coincide with the rising edge of the reference clock X. When the mode signal HF is at the high level H, the dummy clock Z shown in part (b) of FIG. 8 and the reference clock X shown in part (c) thereof are output from the clock applied to the terminal 305 and shown in part (a).

      Hence, even when the dummy delay circuit 45 is controlled to have the maximum delay amount, an overflow will occur in which the rising edge of the dummy clock dZ delayed by the dummy delay circuit 45 and the dummy circuit 46 and shown in part (d) of FIG. 11 leads to the rising edge of the reference clock X. However, according to the present invention, the frequency dividing ratio is decreased so that the dummy clock Z and the reference clock X respectively shown in parts (b) and (c) of FIG. 10 can be obtained from the clock shown in part (a) of FIG. 10. Hence, it is possible to cause the rising edge of the dummy clock dZ shown in part (d) of FIG. 10 to coincide with the rising edge of the reference clock X (depicted by the broken line).
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      As described above, the frequency dividing ratio is increased so as to prevent the occurrence of underflow when the input clock is relatively high, and is decreased so as to prevent the occurrence of overflow when the input clock is relatively low.

      The output signal OUT of the inverter 403-2 is low and is supplied to the unit delay circuit located at the left-hand side of the central unit delay circuit as the output signal OUT.

      When the set signal  PHI SE switches from the low level to the high level, the node 5a-1 is grounded and becomes low, while the node 5a-2 is switched to the high level.

      When the node 5a-1 is switched to the low level, the enable signal  PHI E-2 is switched to the high level from the low level.

      The frequency divider 36 frequency-divides the external clock with a ratio of 1/4 and results in a dummy clock Z and a reference clock X. The dummy clock Z is at the high level H during the period equal to one cycle of the clock supplied, and is at the low level L during the period equal to three cycles of the clock.

      The reference clock X is the inverted signal of the dummy clock Z. Thus, the reference clock X is at the low level L during the period equal to one cycle of the clock supplied, and is at the high level H during the period equal to three cycles thereof.

      The reference clock X thus selected is supplied to the phase comparator 44.

      The selected dummy clock Z passes through the dummy delay circuit 45 and the dummy circuit 46A, and is then supplied to the phase comparator 44.

      The delay control circuit 47 controls, on the basis of the phase difference signal, the delay amount of the dummy delay circuit 45 so that the phase difference becomes zero.

      The external clock CLK applied to the clock input pad 10 passes through the input circuit 20 functioning as a buffer, and is then supplied to the 1/2 frequency divider 30 and the selector circuit 32.

      The 1/2 frequency divider 30 divides the frequency of the external clock into two (that is, at a frequency dividing ratio of 1/2).
      <br/>
      Hence, the frequency-divided clock (0 degree) and the inverted frequency-divided clock (180 degrees) are generated and supplied to the selector circuit 32.
    </p>
    <p num="117">The selector circuit 32 has the configuration shown in FIG. 3, and is made up of the transfer gates 55, 56 and 57 and the inverter 58.</p>

      In the present case, the frequency dividing ratio setting signal is at the high level H when the external clock CLK has a low frequency and the frequency dividing ratio setting signal indicates a low frequency dividing ratio.

      When the frequency dividing ratio setting signal is at the high level H, the transfer gate 55 is ON and the transfer gates 56 and 57 are OFF.
      <br/>
      Thus, the external clock which passes through the transfer gate 55 from the input circuit 20 is output via the terminal 32A of the selector circuit 32 to the 0-degree DLL block 35.
      <br/>
      At that time, no signal is output via the terminal 32B.

      When the frequency dividing ratio setting signal is at the low level L, the transfer gates 56 and 57 are ON and the transfer gate 55 is OFF.

    <p num="121">
      The frequency divider 36 frequency-divides the frequency-divided clock or the inverted version thereof at a frequency dividing ratio of, for example, 1/4, and thus results in the dummy clock Z and the reference clock X.

      <br/>
      The reference clock X is at the low level L during the period equal to one cycle of the clock, and is at the high level H during the period equal to three cycles thereof.

      The dummy circuit 46 has the same configurations as those of the input circuit 20, the 1/2 frequency divider 30 and the output circuit 50, and has the same delay amounts as those thereof.

      The phase comparator 44 compares the phase of the delayed dummy clock dZ from the dummy circuit 46 with the phase of the reference clock X from the phase comparator 46, and results in the phase difference signal, which is supplied to the delay control circuit 47.

      The delay control circuit 47 controls, on the basis of the phase difference signal, a delay amount of the dummy delay circuit 45 so that the phase difference becomes zero.

      Thus, the delay amount of the dummy delay circuit 45 is controlled so that the rising edge of the dummy clock Z coincides with the rising edge of the reference clock X, that is, the delayed dummy clock Z lags behind the reference clock X by a delay of time equal to k cycles of the external clock.

      <br/>
      This is because, in the state in which the data latency is equal to 3 and the external clock has the lowest frequency, the access can be performed well by operating the DRAM (from which data is supplied to the output circuit 50) in synchronism with only the 180-degree clock.

      The reference clock X is the inverted signal of the reference clock Z. At the frequency dividing ratio of 3/6, the dummy clock Z is at the low level L during the period equal to three cycles of the supplied clock, and is at the high level H during the period equal to three cycles thereof.

      The delay control circuit 47 controls, on the basis of the phase difference signal, the delay amount of the dummy delay circuit 45 so that the phase difference becomes zero.
