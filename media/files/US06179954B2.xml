    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="3">The present invention generally relates to an apparatus and method for etching a printed circuit board, and more particularly to an etching apparatus and method for etching a printed circuit board while the printed circuit board is horizontally transported in a transporting direction so as to keep a height of the printed circuit board at a transport position during etching.</p>
    <p num="4">(2) Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Generally, printed circuit boards are placed on various electronic devices.
      <br/>
      With development of high-performance, miniaturized electronic devices, there is the need for the printed circuit boards with high-density interconnections and with multi-layer printed patterns with thin wiring.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, digital signals, instead of analog signals, are becoming the dominant signals which are delivered through the printed circuits on the printed circuit boards.
      <br/>
      With the use of digital signals, the ratio of high-frequency circuits to the other printed circuits on the printed circuit boards are becoming greater, the high-frequency circuits processing the digital signals.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Therefore, in order to produce the multi-layer printed circuit boards with high-density interconnections, it is necessary that the manufacturing process steps are carried out with accurate widths of the interconnecting wires and with accurate distances between the adjacent wires on the printed circuit boards.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Generally, in order to produce a pattern of a film such as copper deposited over a board which forms a printed circuit on the board, it is necessary to carry out an etching process in which selected areas of the film deposited over the entire surface, as defined by a photoresist, are locally etched away to leave only the metal for interconnections.
      <br/>
      Thus, to realize high accuracy of the multi-layer printed circuit boards with high-density interconnections mentioned above, it is necessary to take into account the following items: 1) uniform the rate of etching a top surface of a printed circuit board and the rate of etching a bottom surface thereof; 2) uniform the rates of etching locally separate portions on the same surface of a printed circuit board; and 3) control the etching quantity in accordance with the thickness of a metal film deposited over the entire surface.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Horizontal-transport type etching machines are frequently used because the etching machines of this type can perform the etching of a printed circuit board with relatively accurate dimensions of the pattern of the film etched away.
      <br/>
      In the horizontal-transport type etching machine, a printed circuit board is horizontally transported so that a height of the printed circuit board during etching is kept at a transport position.
      <br/>
      The etching machine mentioned above includes an upper spray pipe above the transport position on which upper spray nozzles are arranged to inject an etchant into a top surface of the printed circuit board, and a lower spray pipe below the transport position on which lower spray nozzles are arranged to inject an etchant into a bottom surface of the printed circuit board.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The upper spray pipe and the lower spray pipe are connected to a spray pump, and the etchant under pressure is supplied by the spray pump to these spray pipes, so that the etchant is injected by the upper spray nozzles and the lower spray nozzles to the printed circuit board.
      <br/>
      Thus, selected areas of a metal film deposited over the entire surface of the printed circuit board, as defined by a photoresist, are locally etched away.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      A conventional etching machine which is the horizontal-transport type described above comprises the upper spray pipe and the lower spray pipe, wherein the number of the upper spray nozzles on the upper spray pipe and the number of the lower spray nozzles on the lower spray pipe are the same, and the pressures of the etchant injected by each upper spray nozzle and of the etchant injected by each lower spray nozzle are the same.
      <br/>
      Further, in the conventional etching machine, a height of each of the upper spray nozzles above the transport position is substantially equal to a height of each of the lower spray nozzles below the transport position.
      <br/>
      In addition, the conventional etching machine comprises a single etching tank and a plurality of spray pipes within the etching tank, and all the pressures of the etchant injected by the individual spray nozzles are the same, and the pressures of the etchant injected cannot be controlled independently.
    </p>
    <p num="11">The conventional etching machine in which the spray nozzles are thus arranged has a problem in that although the etchant injected by each lower spray nozzle to the bottom surface of the printed circuit board will fall to the bottom of the etching tank, the etchant injected by each upper spray nozzle to the top surface of the printed circuit board will not immediately fall to the bottom of the etching tank but remains on the top surface.</p>
    <p num="12">
      As a certain amount of the etchant remains on the top surface of the printed circuit board, the remaining etchant will become an obstacle to etch the printed circuit board with a new etchant subsequently injected by the upper spray nozzles.
      <br/>
      The metal film at corresponding portions of the printed circuit board is not effectively etched away, and the etching ability will deteriorate and the etching speed will decrease.
      <br/>
      Thus, the efficiency of the etching will be lowered and it is difficult to perform the etching of the printed circuit board with accurate dimensions of the pattern of the film etched away.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      A conceivable method to resolve the above problem is to increase the pressure of the etchant injected by each upper spray nozzle to a high pressure level enough to remove the remaining etchant on the top surface of the printed circuit board, allowing the top surface to be effectively etched with a new etchant subsequently injected by the upper spray nozzles.
      <br/>
      However, the increased pressure level of the etchant injected cannot exceed the strength of the photoresist.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the above method is applied, it is difficult to increase the pressure of the etchant injected by each upper spray nozzle to a sufficiently high pressure level at which the remaining etchant can be completely removed.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Another method to resolve the above problem is to decrease the pressure of the etchant injected by each lower spray nozzle relative to the pressure of the etchant injected by each upper spray nozzle, so as to uniform the rate of etching the top surface of a printed circuit board and the rate of etching the bottom surface.
      <br/>
      However, when this method is applied, the limitation of the decreased pressure level exists, and the etching speed of the entire etching machine will decrease and the efficiency of the etching will deteriorate.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      When the etching of an inside layer of a multi-layer printed circuit board is performed by using a conventional etching machine in which the height of each of the upper spray nozzles above the transport position is substantially equal to the height of each of the lower spray nozzles below the transport position, the etching speed relating to the inner or middle areas on the top of the inside layer becomes lower than the etching speed relating to the outer or peripheral areas on the top of the inside layer.
      <br/>
      For this reason, lines of the pattern of the film in the inner areas on the top of the inside layer become thicker and lines of the pattern of the film in the outer areas on the top of the inside layer become thinner after the etching is performed, even if the thicknesses of photoresists in the inner areas and in the outer areas are the same.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Therefore, it is difficult for the conventional etching machine to realize the etching of the multi-layer printed circuit board with accurate dimensions of the film pattern which dimensions are in accordance with the line width of a desired circuit.</p>
    <p num="17">
      On the other hand, when the etching of an outside layer of a multi-layer printed circuit board is performed by using the conventional etching machine mentioned above, the lines of the film pattern in the outer areas on the outside layer become thicker and the lines of the film pattern in the inner areas thereon become thinner since the film on the outside layer is plated.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the etching speed relating to the inner areas on the outside layer is likely to be higher than the etching speed relating to the outer areas thereon.
      <br/>
      Even if the thicknesses of photoresists in the inner areas and in the outer areas are the same, the widths of the lines in the outer areas will become too great and the widths of the lines in the inner areas will become too small.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Therefore, it is difficult for the conventional etching machine to realize the etching of the multi-layer printed circuit board with accurate dimensions of the pattern of the film which dimensions are in accordance with the line width of a desired circuit.</p>
    <p num="19">
      Further, the conventional etching machine comprises a single etching tank and a plurality of spray pipes within the etching tank, as described above.
      <br/>
      All the pressures of the etchant injected by the individual spray nozzles are the same, and the pressures of the etchant injected cannot be controlled independently.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there are only two methods for controlling the etching quantity in accordance with the thickness of a metal film deposited over the entire surface with the conventional etching machine, that is: one is to control the pressure of the etchant injected by each spray nozzle; and the other is to control the transporting speed of a printed circuit board by the transport mechanism.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The conventional etching machine usually has a single etching tank, and the range of pressures of the etching injected by each spray nozzle which can be suitably controlled by the conventional etching machine is limited and narrow.
      <br/>
      For this reason, in order to change considerably the etching quantity, it is necessary to change considerably the transporting speed of the printed circuit board by the transport mechanism.
      <br/>
      However, when the changing of the transporting speed is applied, a change in the etching quantity responsive to a significantly small change in the transporting speed becomes excessively great.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is very difficult to control the etching quantity in accordance with the thickness of a metal film deposited over the entire surface by changing the pressure of the etchant injected to the printed circuit board or changing the transporting speed of the printed circuit board.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="40">A description will now be given of an etching apparatus in a first embodiment of the present invention with reference to FIGS. 1A and 1B.</p>
    <p num="41">
      In FIGS. 1A and 1B, an etching apparatus 10 includes an etching tank 1 at an upper portion, and a reservoir 2 at a lower portion.
      <br/>
      The reservoir 2 serves to store a remaining etchant after the etching within the etching tank 1 is performed.
      <br/>
      The etching apparatus 10 includes a transport mechanism which horizontally transports a printed circuit board 3 in a transporting direction at a given rate so that a height of the printed circuit board 3 during etching is kept at a transport position.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The transport position is indicated by a one-dot chain line "A" in FIGS. 1A and 1B, and the transporting direction is indicated by an arrow "Y" in FIG. 1A. Hereinafter, the transporting direction is referred to as a longitudinal line of the etching apparatus, and a transverse direction perpendicular to the transporting direction is referred to as a transverse line of the etching apparatus.
      <br/>
      The transverse direction is indicated by an arrow "X" in FIG. 1B.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The transport mechanism includes a plurality of rows of transport rollers 4 on the transport position A and a plurality of rows of pressure rollers 5 on the transport position A, which are opposed to each other.
      <br/>
      The transport rollers 4 in each row and the pressure rollers in each row are longitudinally arranged in the transporting direction.
      <br/>
      The transport rollers 4 are rotated by a drive motor (not shown) so that the printed circuit board 3 is transported at the given rate in a forward transporting direction (or, the right direction in FIG. 1A).
      <br/>
      The pressure rollers 5 opposed to the transport rollers 4 serve to exert downward pressure onto the printed circuit board 3 against the transport rollers 4 during the transporting of the printed circuit board 3.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The etching apparatus 10 further includes a plurality of upper spray pipes 6 above the transport position A and a plurality of lower spray pipes 8 below the transport position A, which are both extending in directions parallel to the transporting direction Y. As shown in FIG. 1B, the upper spray pipes 6 and the lower spray pipes 8 are transversely arranged and opposed to each other.
      <br/>
      The upper spray pipes 6 each have a plurality of upper spray nozzles 7 which are longitudinally arranged at fixed intervals along the upper spray pipe in the transporting direction Y. The lower spray pipes 8 each have a plurality of lower spray nozzles 9 which are longitudinally arranged at the fixed intervals along the lower spray pipe in the transporting direction Y. In this embodiment, the upper spray nozzles 7 above the transport position A and the lower spray nozzles 9 below the transport position A are opposed to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The upper spray pipes 6 and the lower spray pipes 8 are connected to a spray pump (not shown), and a pressure is given by the spray pump to an etchant within the etching tank 1.
      <br/>
      The etchant under the pressure is supplied by the spray pump to the upper spray pipes 6 and to the lower spray pipes 8, so that the etchant is injected from the upper spray nozzles 7 to a top surface of the printed circuit board 3, and the etchant is, at the same time, injected from the lower spray nozzles 9 to a bottom surface of the printed circuit board 3 while the printed circuit board 3 is horizontally transported by the transport mechanism at a given transporting rate.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The etching apparatus 1 includes an exhaust duct 12, a cleaning spray 13, and a mist separator 14.
      <br/>
      The gas within the etching tank 1 is ejected from the exhaust duct 12 through the cleaning spray 13 and the mist separator 14.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      On the printed circuit board 3 which is conveyed from a preceding process step into the etching apparatus 10, a metal film such as copper is deposited over the entire surface, and selected areas of the metal film are defined by a photoresist.
      <br/>
      Thus, as the etchant injected from the upper and lower spray nozzles 7 and 9 is supplied to the printed circuit board 3, unselected areas of the film on the printed circuit board are locally etched away to leave only the metal needed for interconnections so that a pattern for a desired circuit can be produced on the printed circuit board 3.
    </p>
    <p num="48">As shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, in the first embodiment, the upper spray nozzles 7 are arranged at a relatively near position above the transport position A, at which the printed circuit board 3 is horizontally transported, and the lower spray nozzles 9 are arranged at a relatively farther position below the transport position A. That is, the upper spray nozzles 7 and the lower spray nozzles 9 are arranged so that a first height H1 of the upper spray nozzles 7 above the transport position A is smaller that a second height H2 of the lower spray nozzles 9 below the transport position A (H1&lt;H2), so as to make a flow rate of the etchant injected to the top surface of the printed circuit board greater than a flow rate of the etchant injected to the bottom surface of the printed circuit board.</p>
    <p num="49">
      Therefore, since the pressures of the etchant injected by each upper spray nozzle 7 and of the etchant injected by each lower spray nozzle 9 are the same, the first embodiment described above makes it possible to make the flow rate of the etchant injected to the top surface of the printed circuit board 3 greater than the flow rate of the etchant injected to the bottom surface without changing considerably the transporting speed of the transport mechanism or the pressures of the etchant injected by the upper and lower spray nozzles.
      <br/>
      Hence, even if a certain amount of the etchant remains on the top surface of the printed circuit board 3 during etching, it is possible to make the rate of etching the top surface of the printed circuit board 3 equal to the rate of etching the bottom surface thereof.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is possible to realize the forming of selected patterns of metal films with accurate and uniform dimensions on the top and bottom surfaces of the printed circuit board after it is etched.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Next, a description will be given of a second embodiment of the present invention, with reference to FIGS. 2A and 2B. FIGS. 2A and 2B show an etching apparatus 20 in the second embodiment.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 2A and 2B, the parts which are the same as corresponding parts shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B are designated by the same reference numerals, and a description thereof will be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In FIGS. 2A and 2B, the etching apparatus 20 includes the upper spray pipes 6 above the transport position A and the lower spray pipes 8 below the transport position A which are similar to those shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B. Each of the upper spray pipes 6 has a plurality of the longitudinally arranged upper spray nozzles 7, and each of the lower spray pipes 8 has a plurality of the longitudinally arranged lower spray nozzles 9.
      <br/>
      However, in the second embodiment, the number N1 of the upper spray nozzles 7 in each upper spray pipe is greater than the number N2 of the lower spray nozzles 9 in each lower spray pipe (N1&gt;N2), and the first height H1 of the upper spray nozzles 7 above the transport position A is the same as the second height H2 of the lower spray nozzles 9 below the transport position A (H1=H2).
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Therefore, in the second embodiment described above, it is possible to make the flow rate of the etchant injected to the top surface of the printed circuit board 3 greater than the flow rate of the etchant injected to the bottom surface without changing considerably the transporting speed by the transport mechanism or the pressures of the etchant injected.
      <br/>
      In the second embodiment, the pressures of the etchant injected by each upper spray nozzle 7 and of the etchant injected by each lower spray nozzle 9 are the same, and the number of the upper spray nozzles 7 in each upper spray pipe is greater than the number of the lower spray nozzles 9 in each lower spray pipe.
      <br/>
      Hence, even if a certain amount of the etchant remains on the top surface of the printed circuit board 3 during etching, it is possible to make the rate of etching the top surface of the printed circuit board 3 equal to the rate of etching the bottom surface thereof.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is possible to realize the forming of selected patterns of metal films with accurate, uniform dimensions on the top and bottom surfaces of the printed circuit board with no irregularity after it is etched.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Next, a description will be given of a third embodiment, with reference to FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows a transport mechanism of an etching apparatus in the third embodiment.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 3, the parts which are the same as corresponding parts shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B are designated by the same reference numerals, and a description thereof will be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      In FIG. 3, the etching apparatus includes a plurality of ejecting passages 11 which are provided within the transport mechanism.
      <br/>
      The ejecting passages 11 serve to eject the etchant, which has already been injected from the upper spray nozzles 7 to the top surface of the printed circuit board 3 and remains on the top surface, in transverse directions X perpendicular to the transporting direction Y of the printed circuit board transported by the transport mechanism.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The transport mechanism in the third embodiment includes a plurality of longitudinally arranged transport rollers 4 which are rotated to transport the printed circuit board 3 in the transporting direction in contact with the bottom surface of the printed circuit board 3, and a plurality of longitudinally arranged pressure rollers 5 which are opposed to the transport rollers 4 and exert downward pressure onto the printed circuit board 3 against the transport rollers 4 in contact with the top surface of the printed circuit board 3.
      <br/>
      The ejecting passages 11 are arranged at portions of the transport mechanism in which only transport rollers 4 corresponding to the portions are arranged and no pressure rollers 5 opposed to those transport rollers 4 are arranged.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Since the etching apparatus in the third embodiment is provided with the ejecting passages 11, the etchant already injected from the upper spray nozzles 7 to the top surface of the printed circuit board 3 can be ejected in the transverse directions X through the ejecting passages 11 so that the etchant falls to the reservoir 2.
      <br/>
      Therefore, as the quantity of the remaining etchant is reduced in the etching apparatus in FIG. 3, it is possible to cancel the undesired influence on the etching due to the remaining etchant.
      <br/>
      Hence, the third embodiment described above can make the rate of etching the top surface of the printed circuit board 3 equal to the rate of etching the bottom surface by increasing slightly the pressure of the etchant injected by each upper spray nozzle 7.
    </p>
    <p num="57">It should be noted that it is necessary for the third embodiment to increase slightly the pressure of the etchant injected by each upper spray nozzle 7, since a small quantity of the etchant may remain on the top surface of the printed circuit board 3 during etching even with the ejecting passages 11.</p>
    <p num="58">
      In the third embodiment described above, the ejecting passages 11 can be easily provided by modifying the arrangement of the pressure rollers 5, and it is possible to make the rate of etching the top surface of the printed circuit board 3 equal to the rate of etching the bottom surface thereof by use of the ejecting passages 11.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to reduce the quantity of the remaining etchant on the printed circuit board 3 only with a simple modification of the existing etching apparatus in the manufacturing lines.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Next, a description will be given of a fourth embodiment of the present invention, with reference to FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows an etching apparatus in the fourth embodiment.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4, the parts which are the same as corresponding parts shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B are designated by the same reference numerals, and a description thereof will be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      In FIG. 4, the etching apparatus includes a plurality of upper spray pipes 6 each of which has a plurality of upper spray nozzles 7.
      <br/>
      The upper spray pipes 6 are transversely arranged with respect to the transporting direction Y, and the upper spray nozzles 7 comprise inner spray nozzles at inner positions along transverse lines perpendicular to the transporting direction Y, and outer spray nozzles at outer positions along the transverse lines.
      <br/>
      In the fourth embodiment, the upper spray nozzles 7 are arranged so that first heights of the inner spray nozzles above the transport position A are smaller than second heights of the outer spray nozzles above the transport position A.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
