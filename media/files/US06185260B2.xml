    <p num="2">
      Formerly, a radio communication device using a quadrature modulation-demodulation circuit is generally in use for digital communication.
      <br/>
      The current cellular system proceeds to the digital communication system such as the IS-136 system using  PI /4 * DQPSK signal in North America or the GSM system using GMSK signal in Europe and so forth from the analog communication system using FM signal.
      <br/>
      In these digital communication systems, a synchronous detection circuit for reception and a quadrature modulation circuit for transmission are in use universally.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      FIG. 1 shows a configuration of transmitter-receiver circuit of general digital cellular system according to conventional example 1.
      <br/>
      A signal outputted from a base station is inputted to an antenna 1 through a radio line, thus being received at a channel-select circuit 2 in response to an output frequency of a local oscillation circuit 12, then the signal is amplified to be outputted.
      <br/>
      The signal outputted from the channel-select circuit 2 is inputted to a quadrature demodulation circuit 3, thus being subjected to synchronous detection to output both of an in-phase base band signal Sir and a quadrature base band signal Sqr.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Each of the in-phase base band signal Sir and the quadrature base band signal Sqr is inputted to a DC offset adjusting circuit 4, thus causing a DC offset value thereof to be adjusted in response to a reception DC offset adjusting signal Sar set beforehand in the DC offset adjusting circuit 4, before being outputted.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the DC offset adjusting circuit 4 is inputted to an A/D conversion circuit 5, thus being quantized to be outputted.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The in-phase base band signal Sir and the quadrature base band signal Sqr which are quantized in the A/D conversion circuit 5 are subjected to data demodulation in a digital signal processing section 6 respectively, thus also being subjected to processing of error correction and so forth to be outputted.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, transmission data outputted from the digital signal processing circuit 6 is converted into an in-phase base band signal Sit and a quadrature base band signal Sqt in a base band signal generation circuit 8 to be outputted.
      <br/>
      The in-phase base band signal Sit and the quadrature base band signal Sqt are inputted to a DC offset adjusting circuit 9, thus causing a DC offset error to be adjusted based on a transmission DC offset adjusting signal Sat which is set beforehand, before being inputted respectively to a quadrature demodulation circuit 10.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The quadrature demodulation circuit 10 inputs thereto an output of a local oscillation circuit 13, above described in-phase base band signal Sit, and the above described quadrature base band signal Sqt, thus outputting a signal of radio frequency band which is demodulated.
      <br/>
      The output of the quadrature demodulation circuit 10 is subjected to power amplification by a power amplifier 11, before being transmitted through the antenna 1.
      <br/>
      The reception DC offset adjusting signal Sar and the transmission DC offset adjusting signal Sat whose values adjusted in adjusting process at the time of production are stored in memory, are outputted through a CPU 7.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Consequently, when realizing a radio communication device using quadrature modulation-demodulation circuit, the DC offset error involved in the in-phase base band signal Sit and the quadrature base band signal Sqt outputted from the base band signal generation circuit is adjusted to be set in every device in the production process.</p>

      The Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. HEI 08-32462 by way of the conventional example 2 discloses "DC OFFSET CIRCUIT OF CARTESIAN LOOP".
      <br/>
      In the conventional example 2, it causes DC offset of an operational amplifier for demodulation to be implemented in every time transmission starting, so that drift caused by temperature variation or power fluctuation or the like is absorbed to obtain appropriate balance of demodulation-modulation circuit, and fluctuation caused by difference of transmitter is absorbed to obtain appropriate balance of demodulation-modulation circuit at all times.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="16">
      A preferred embodiment of a radio communication device using a quadrature modulation-demodulation circuit according to the present invention will now be described in detail referring to the accompanying drawings.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, one embodiment of the radio communication device using quadrature modulation-demodulation circuit of the present invention is shown.
    </p>
    <p num="17">In FIG. 2, the radio communication device using the quadrature modulation-demodulation circuit of the present invention comprises an antenna 1, a channel-select circuit 2, a quadrature demodulation circuit 3, a DC offset adjusting circuit 4, a switching circuit 14, an A/D conversion circuit 5, a digital signal processing circuit 6, a local oscillation circuit 12, a local oscillation circuit 13, a power amplification circuit 11, a quadrature modulation circuit 10, a DC offset adjusting circuit 9, a base band signal generation circuit 8, a DC offset error detecting means 15, and a CPU 7.</p>
    <p num="18">
      A signal outputted from a base station is inputted by the antenna 1 through a radio line, then in the channel-select circuit 2, the signal is received in answer to an output frequency of the local oscillation circuit 12, thus being amplified to be outputted.
      <br/>
      The signal outputted from the above-described channel-select circuit 2 is inputted to the quadrature demodulation circuit 3, thus being subjected to synchronous detection to output a reception in-phase base band signal Sir and a reception quadrature base band signal Sqr.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Each of the reception in-phase base band signal Sir and the reception quadrature base band signal Sqr is inputted to the DC offset adjusting circuit 4.
      <br/>
      The inputted signals whose DC offset value is adjusted due to a reception DC offset adjusting signal Sar in the DC offset adjusting circuit 4, before being outputted.
      <br/>
      The output of the above-described DC offset adjusting circuit 4 is inputted to the switching circuit 14.
      <br/>
      When the output of the DC offset adjusting circuit 4 which output is the output of the above-described quadrature demodulation circuit 3 is selected in the switching circuit 14, the reception in-phase base band signal Sir and the reception quadrature base band signal Sqr inputted to the A/D conversion circuit 5 are quantized to be outputted respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Each of the reception in-phase base band signal Sir and the reception quadrature base band signal Sqr quantized in the above-described A/D conversion circuit 5 is subjected to data demodulation in the digital signal processing section 6, thus also being subjected to processing of error correction and so forth to be outputted.
      <br/>
      Further, the reception in-phase base band signal Sir and the reception quadrature base band signal Sqr which are quantized in the above-described A/D conversion circuit 5 are also inputted simultaneously to the DC offset error detecting means 15 of the above-described digital signal processing section 6, so that it causes DC offset error information detected due to the DC offset error detecting means 15 to be outputted to the CPU 7 while adding ID capable of being recognized by way of DC offset error information of a reception base band signal.
    </p>
    <p num="21">On the other hand, transmission data outputted from the above-described digital signal processing section 6 is converted into a transmission in-phase base band signal Sit and a transmission quadrature base band signal Sqt to be outputted.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Each of the transmission in-phase base band signal Sit and the transmission quadrature base band signal Sqt is inputted to the DC offset adjusting circuit 9, thus the DC offset error thereof is adjusted based on a transmission DC offset adjusting signal Sat which is set beforehand, before being inputted to the quadrature modulation circuit 10 and the switching circuit 14 respectively.
      <br/>
      The quadrature modulation circuit 10 inputs an output of the local oscillation circuit 13, and the above-described transmission in-phase base band signal Sit and the above-described transmission quadrature base band signal Sqt, thus outputting signal of radio frequency band which is modulated.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The above-described output of the quadrature modulation circuit 10 is subjected to power amplification by the power amplifier 11, before transmitting through the antenna 1.
      <br/>
      In the switching circuit 14 which is the another destination for outputting of the above described DC offset adjusting circuit 9, when the transmission in-phase base band signal Sit and the transmission quadrature base band signal Sqt which are the outputs of the above DC offset adjusting circuit 9 are selected, these signals are inputted to the A/D conversion circuit 5 which is the same case that the output of the DC offset adjusting circuit 4 which is the output of the quadrature demodulation circuit 3 is selected, thus being quantized to be outputted to the digital signal processing section 6.
    </p>
    <p num="24">Each of the transmission in-phase base band signal Sit and the transmission quadrature base band signal Sqt quantized in the above-described A/D conversion circuit 5 is inputted simultaneously to the DC offset error detecting means 15 of the digital signal processing section 6 so that it causes DC offset error information detected due to the DC offset error detecting means 15 to be outputted to the CPU 7 while adding ID capable of being recognized by way of DC offset error information of a reception base band signal.</p>
    <p num="25">The DC offset error information both of the reception base band signal and transmission base band signal which are outputted from the above described digital signal processing section 6 are inputted to the above described CPU 7, thus being converted into a reception DC offset adjusting signal Sar and a transmission DC offset adjusting signal Sat which are the signal causes DC offset error both of the reception base band signal and the transmission base band signal to be denied respectively, before being fed back both to the above-described DC offset adjusting circuit 4 and the above-described DC offset adjusting circuit 9.</p>
    <p num="26">Next, operation of the above-described DC error detecting means 15 which is a feature of the present invention will be described in detail referring to FIG. 3.</p>
    <p num="27">Two-kind of data of "in-phase" and "quadrature" which are quantized with sampling cycle T in the above A/D conversion circuit 5 to be inputted to the above digital signal processing section 6 is integrated during time period of N times of sampling cycle T which is sufficiently larger time than each reception (transmission) base band signal cycle  TAU , thus average value is obtained in an integrating and averaging processing step 21.</p>
    <p num="28">
      If there is no DC offset error in the base band signal, and to be a randomized reception (transmission) base band signal and as long as it continues to be integrated during sufficiently longer time than the cycle, a result of the above integrating and averaging processing step 21 denotes 0 (zero).
      <br/>
      Consequently, the above-described integrating and averaging processing step 21 enables the DC offset errors corresponding to several LSBs of the above-described A/D conversion circuit 5 to be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The output of the integrating and averaging processing step 21 is inputted to a switching switch state flag detecting processing step 22.
      <br/>
      In the switching switch state flag detecting processing step 22, when detecting a selection state of an RX base band signal, it causes an RX address bit to be a DC offset error information of the reception base band signal to be supplemented to append ID in the output processing circuit 23.
      <br/>
      While when detecting a selection state of a TX base band signal, it causes a TX address bit to be a DC offset error information of the transmission base band signal to be supplemented to append ID in the output processing circuit 24.
      <br/>
      Among the above-described explanation, regardless of reception/transmission, the DC offset error of the in-phase base band signal and the quadrature base band signal are processed independently each other.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The output of the DC offset adjusting circuit adjusting the DC offset error involved in the output of the quadrature demodulation circuit and the output of the DC offset adjusting circuit adjusting the DC offset error involved in the transmission base band signal are inputted to the switching circuit.
      <br/>
      In the offset error detecting means for detecting the DC offset error involved in the output of the switching circuit, it causes the DC offset error to be detected, thus correcting both the output of the DC offset adjusting circuit of the above described reception base band signal and the DC offset error involved in the DC offset adjusting circuit of the above described transmission base band signal.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The radio communication device of the present invention corrects the output of the DC offset adjusting circuit of the reception base band signal and the DC offset error involved in the output of the DC offset adjusting circuit of the transmission base band signal at periodic intervals.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it is capable of reducing the DC offset error caused by temperature variation or power source voltage fluctuation.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As described above, the radio communication device using the quadrature modulation-demodulation circuit according to the present invention outputs the analog base band signal and the QPSK signal from the modulated frequency signal, then each one of the signals both of the analog base band signal and the QPSK signal to be selected to output, thus quantizing the output signal so that it causes the DC offset error involved in the analog base band signal and QPSK signal to be corrected.
      <br/>
      According to the processing procedure, it is capable of reducing the DC offset error caused by temperature variation or power source voltage fluctuation even if the present radio communication device is on operation.
