      For prophylaxis, the active compounds are administered to reduce the frequency and severity of manifestations of the diseases.
      <br/>
      Treatment in the manifest stage leads to a shortening thereof and to an alleviation of the symptoms.
    </p>
    <p num="112">Treatment with the active compounds according to the invention also serves to prevent or alleviate side effects and secondary damage which may occur when conventional treatment forms are used, such as, for example, UV treatment of psoriasis forms (PUVA treatment) and of atopic eczema and photodermatoses.</p>
    <p num="113">The active systems according to the invention, as an accompanying treatment form, furthermore allow a reduction in the dosage of conventional pharmacological active compounds, such as, for example, corticoids, for inflammatory dermatoses.</p>
    <p num="114">It is furthermore advantageous also to use the active compounds and formulations according to the invention in combination with conventional active compounds and methods usually used for treatment of the dermatoses mentioned (for example cyclosporin A, corticosteroids, psoralen, UV treatment, PUVA treatment, UVA and/or UVB filters, urea, antibiotics and aciclovir).</p>
    <p num="115">
      The active compounds according to the invention and combinations thereof and the formulations obtained with them, such as pharmaceutical preparations and topical formulations in the form of creams, lotions, gels and sprays, as well as solutions (for example aqueous, alcoholic or aqueous-alcoholic) and other suitable formulations are prophylactically active, in particular, in that they protect sensitive skin predisposed to the dermatoses mentioned under I. to XIII., in particular in the case of atopic dermatitis and photodermatoses, or reduce the development of these.
      <br/>
      For this, the formulations comprising the active compounds are used regularly once and several times daily.
      <br/>
      In the case of the manifest dermatoses mentioned, in particular atopic dermatitis (for example atopic eczema or neurodermatitis), ichthyosis, polymorphic photodermatosis, psoriasis and pruritus, an improvement in the state of the skin, in particular a subsidence in the itching which occurs with these dermatoses, takes place after adequate treatment with the active compounds and formulations according to the invention.
      <br/>
      The diseases can then be further treated prophylactically.
    </p>
    <p num="116">It was surprising and also not to be foreseen by the expert that the active compounds and formulations according to the invention can be used, in particular after topical application to human skin, for prophylaxis and treatment of the dermatoses mentioned under I. to XIII. and of sensitive, hyperreactive skin predisposed to dermatitis, and the combinations according to the invention of flavone glycosides and cinnamic acid derivatives and/or with antioxidant systems and/or active compounds which regulate endogenous energy metabolism, in particular in the skin, and/or antimicrobial active principles can achieve a synergistic action.</p>
    <p num="117">
      The action mechanism of the new active compounds and formulations according to the invention has not yet been clarified completely.
      <br/>
      It is assumed that an increased, oxidative, free-radical stress exists as the cause of the deficiency or pathological states of the skin in question, this being alleviated or even regulated to the normal level of intact and healthy skin by treatment with the active compounds according to the invention.
      <br/>
      It is also advantageous that the active compounds employed according to the invention also assist the enzymatic antioxidant and repair systems and the endogenous energy metabolism of the skin, so that an additive or even synergistic action mechanism exists in the active systems and formulations used according to the invention.
      <br/>
      These active compounds can arise at the site of action on the surface of the skin, mucous membrane and/or integumentary appendages, or by penetration via the sebaceous and sweat glands, and also along hair shafts or through the stratum corneum.
      <br/>
      For this, on the one hand certain active compounds according to the invention (for example antimicrobial active compounds) can be prevented from penetration into the skin in the formulations according to the invention, for example by coupling to specific carriers, so that only a superficial action is achieved on the skin and/or the hair and/or in the sebaceous and/or sweat glands and/or the hair shafts.
      <br/>
      To improve the penetration of certain active compounds into the skin, on the other hand, penetration promoters, such as, for example, dimethyl sulphoxide, azones, unsaturated fatty acids (for example oleic acid or cis-alkene fatty acids), heptadecanoic acid, liposomes, nanosomes, microsomes, niosomes and other encapsulation forms, can be added, or the active compounds can be packaged in these in order to achieve a sustained release and/or preserving effect.
    </p>
    <p num="118">Antimicrobial and/or antiviral active principles in combination with the antioxidant systems according to the invention and/or the systems which regulate endogenous energy metabolism can furthermore be used, in particular, for prophylaxis and treatment of dermatitis, such as, for example, neurodermatitis, atopic eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, rosacea, ichthyosis, and acne and psoriasis forms, and of viral infections, such as, for example, herpes simplex, h. labialis and h. zoster.</p>
    <p num="119">Such active systems or formulations should furthermore comprise active compounds which can be used for immunohomeostasis of diseased skin, and advantageously here also for immunostimulation in the sense of the action which promotes wound healing, especially with decubitus and ulcus cruris.</p>
    <p num="120">The active compounds according to the invention are particularly advantageously chosen from the group consisting of flavonoids and their glucosides, from the group consisting of cinnamic acid derivatives, in particular from the group consisting of ferulic acid derivatives and caffeic acid derivatives, and from the group consisting of antioxidants, in particular the group consisting of tocopherols and their derivatives and imidazoles and derivatives thereof.</p>
    <p num="121">
      Japanese Laid-Open Specification Hei-06-138,941 indeed describes oral formulations having a content of water-soluble glucosides, which can be chosen, for example, from the group consisting of  ALPHA -glucosylrutin,  ALPHA -glucosylmyrictrin,  ALPHA -glucosylisoquercitrin and  ALPHA -glucosylquercitrin.
      <br/>
      Japanese Laid-Open Specification Hei-04-363,395 describes a process for preventing decomposition of perfume constituents which is distinguished, inter alia, by an addition of  ALPHA -glucosylrutin to the corresponding formulations.
      <br/>
      European Laid-Open Specification 586 303 and European Laid-Open Specification 595 694 furthermore describe the use of flavonoids as antioxidants or light protection substances in cosmetics.
      <br/>
      It is furthermore known from U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,144,325 and 4,248,861 and from numerous other documents to employ vitamin E in cosmetic and dermatological light protection formulations.
      <br/>
      The use according to the invention of vitamin E and its derivatives in the combinations according to the invention for cosmetic or dermatological prophylaxis and/or treatment of the dermatoses mentioned and of hyper- and hypoactive states of the skin, however, was not made obvious by the prior art.
