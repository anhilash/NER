      <br/>
      A successive approximation A/D converter which converts an analog signal to a digital signal by carrying out successive A/D conversions of the analog signal.
      <br/>
      It carries out, for a least significant bit of the digital signal, A/D conversion of the analog signal using a reference voltage corresponding to a previous digital signal obtained as a result of a previous A/D conversion, increments a current digital signal, which is obtained as a result of the latest A/D conversion, when the least significant bit of the current digital signal is "1", and decrements the current digital signal when the least significant bit is "0".
      <br/>
      This makes it possible to solve a problem of a conventional successive approximation A/D converter in that the tracking ability of the digital signal to variations of the analog signal is degraded because of the long update period involved in the increasing number of the bits of the A/D converter, if full bit conversion is carried out.

    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a successive approximation A/D (analog-to-digital) converter for carrying out analog-to-digital conversion of a plurality of analog signals in a continuous scanning mode.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">FIG. 8 is a block diagram showing a conventional A/D converter, in which the reference numeral 1 designates a selector for sequentially selecting in response to a select signal output from a controller 5 one of analog signals to be A/D converted; 2 designates a DAC (digital-to-analog converter) for generating a reference voltage in accordance with a value stored in a successive conversion register 4; 3 designates a comparator for comparing the reference voltage generated by the DAC 2 with the voltage of the analog signal selected by the selector 1; 4 designates the successive conversion register for storing a result of the comparison by the comparator 3; 5 designates the controller for producing the select signal and a control signal; and 6 designates a conversion result storing register for storing results of the A/D conversion.</p>
    <p num="5">Next, the operation of the conventional A/D converter will be described.</p>
    <p num="6">
      The A/D converter of FIG. 8 scans n analog signals sequentially so that they are converted into digital signals in order.
      <br/>
      For example, to achieve the A/D conversion of an analog signal AN0, the controller 5 supplies the selector 1 with the select signal instructing the A/D conversion of the analog signal AN0, and the selector 1 selects the analog signal AN0 in response to the select signal.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      When supplying the selector 1 with the select signal, the controller 5 sets the most significant bit of the successive conversion register 4 to "1" (it corresponds to bit 7 in an 8-bit A/D converter, for example.
      <br/>
      The following description will be provided taking an 8-bit A/D converter as an example for convenience sake), and sets the remaining bits (from bit 6 to bit 0) to "0".
    </p>
    <p num="8">The DAC 2 generates, after the controller 5 sets the value of the successive conversion register 4, the reference voltage in accordance with the value stored in the successive conversion register 4, and the comparator 3 compares the reference voltage with the voltage of the analog signal selected by the selector 1.</p>
    <p num="9">
      If the voltage of the analog signal is equal to or greater than the reference voltage (voltage of the analog signal &gt;= reference voltage), the comparator 3 sets the most significant bit of the successive conversion register 4, the bit 7 to "1".
      <br/>
      In contrast, if the voltage of the analog signal is less than the reference voltage (voltage of the analog signal&lt;reference voltage), it sets the most significant bit of the successive conversion register 4, the bit 7 to "0".
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      After completing the conversion of the bit 7, the most significant bit, the controller 5 changes the bit 6 of the successive conversion register 4 from "0" to "1" (thus, the bit 7 is set at the conversion result, the bit 6 is set at "1" and the remaining bits 5-0 are set at "0").
      <br/>
      Then, in the same manner as described above, the DAC 2 generates the reference voltage in accordance with the value stored in the successive conversion register 4, and the comparator 3 compares the reference voltage with the voltage of the analog signal selected by the selector 1.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      If the voltage of the analog signal is equal to or greater than the reference voltage (voltage of the analog signal &gt;= reference voltage), the comparator 3 sets the bit 6 to "1".
      <br/>
      On the contrary, if the voltage of the analog signal is less than the reference voltage (voltage of the analog signal&lt;reference voltage), it sets the bit 6 to "0".
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      After completing the conversion of the bit 6 in this way, the converter carries out the conversion successively of the bits 5-0 in the same manner as described above.
      <br/>
      When the conversion of the bits 5-0 is completed, the A/D conversion of the analog signal AN0 is finished, and the value stored in the successive conversion register 4 is stored in the conversion result storing register 6.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Completing the A/D conversion of the analog signal AN0, the converter starts the conversion of the next analog signal AN1 as illustrated in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      Thus, when there are n analog signals, the update period of each analog signal becomes as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="14">Update period=full bit conversion period * number of the analog signals=conversion period per bit * number of bits to be converted * number of analog signals</p>
    <p num="15">Besides the foregoing conventional example, Japanese patent application laid-open No. 5-14197/1993 discloses a technique, in which the converter compares the voltage of the current analog signal with the voltage of the previous analog signal, and carries out full bit A/D conversion only when they disagree with skipping the A/D conversion when they agree, thereby trying to reduce the update period of the analog signals.</p>
    <p num="16">
      With the arrangement as described above, the conventional A/D converter can convert the analog signal into the digital signal through the full bit conversion (for example, it carries out eight conversion processings in the 8-bit A/D converter).
      <br/>
      The conventional A/D converter, however, has a problem in that the update period of the analog signals will increase with the number of the bits of the A/D converter because of an increase in the number of conversions, thereby degrading tracking ability of the digital signals to the variations of the analog signals.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="35">The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="36">Embodiment 1</p>
    <p num="37">
      FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing an embodiment 1 of an A/D converter in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, the reference numeral 11 designates a selector for sequentially selecting in response to a select signal SL output from a controller 15 one of analog signals to be A/D converted; 12 designates a DAC (digital-to-analog converter) for generating a reference voltage VR in accordance with a value stored in a successive conversion register 14; 13 designates a comparator for comparing the reference voltage VR generated by the DAC 12 with the voltage of the analog signal selected by the selector 11; 14 designates the successive conversion register for storing results of the comparison by the comparator 13; and 15 designates the controller for producing the select signal SL and a control signal CT.
    </p>
    <p num="38">The reference numeral 16 designates an increment/decrement circuit for producing a command signal CM instructing to increment when "1" is stored in the least significant bit of the successive conversion register 14, and to decrement when "0" is stored in the least significant bit; 17 designates an operation circuit for reading the value stored in the successive conversion register 14 to increment or decrement the value in response to the command signal CM supplied from the increment/decrement circuit 16; and 18 designates a conversion result storing register for storing results of the A/D conversion.</p>
    <p num="39">Next, the operation of the present embodiment 1 will be described.</p>
    <p num="40">
      The A/D converter of FIG. 1 scans n analog signals sequentially so that they are converted into corresponding digital signals in order.
      <br/>
      For example, to achieve the A/D conversion of an analog signal AN0, the controller 15 supplies the selector 11 with the select signal SL instructing the A/D conversion of the analog signal AN0, and the selector 11 selects the analog signal AN0 in response to the select signal SL.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      When supplying the selector 11 with the select signal SL, and if it is a first A/D conversion period (a first A/D conversion of the analog signal AN0), the controller 15 sets as in the conventional converter the most significant bit of the successive conversion register 14 to "1" (it corresponds to bit 7 in an 8-bit A/D converter, for example.
      <br/>
      The following description will be provided taking an 8-bit A/D converter as an example for convenience sake), and sets the remaining bits (from bit 6 to bit 0) to "0".
    </p>
    <p num="42">When the controller 15 sets the value in the successive conversion register 14, the DAC 2 generates the reference voltage VR in accordance with the value stored in the successive conversion register 14, and the comparator 13 compares the reference voltage VR with the voltage of the analog signal selected by the selector 11.</p>
    <p num="43">
      If the voltage of the analog signal is equal to or greater than the reference voltage VR (voltage of the analog signal &gt;= reference voltage VR), the comparator 13 sets the most significant bit of the successive conversion register 14, the bit 7 to "1".
      <br/>
      In contrast, if the voltage of the analog signal is less than the reference voltage VR (voltage of the analog signal&lt;reference voltage VR), it sets the most significant bit of the successive conversion register 14, the bit 7 to "0".
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      After completing the conversion of the bit 7, the most significant bit, the controller 15 changes the bit 6 of the successive conversion register 14 from "0" to "1" (thus, the bit 7 is set at the conversion result, the bit 6 is set at "1" and the remaining bits 5-0 are set at "0").
      <br/>
      Then, in the same manner as described above, the DAC 12 generates the reference voltage VR in accordance with the value stored in the successive conversion register 14, and the comparator 13 compares the reference voltage VR with the voltage of the analog signal selected by the selector 11.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      If the voltage of the analog signal is equal to or greater than the reference voltage VR (voltage of the analog signal &gt;= reference voltage VR), the comparator 13 sets the bit 6 to "1".
      <br/>
      In contrast, if the voltage of the analog signal is less than the reference voltage VR (voltage of the analog signal&lt;reference voltage VR), it sets the bit 6 to "0".
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      After completing the conversion of the bit 6 in this way, the converter carries out the conversion of the bits 5-0 in the same manner as described above.
      <br/>
      When the conversion of the bits 5-0 is completed, the A/D conversion of the analog signal AN0 is finished, and the value stored in the successive conversion register 14 is stored in the conversion result storing register 18.
    </p>
    <p num="47">Thus, in the first period of the A/D conversion, the controller 15 outputs a scanning cycle identification signal SCI indicating the first A/D conversion period so that the increment/decrement circuit 16 inactivates the command signal CM to increment or decrement, and the operation circuit 17 stores the value stored in the successive conversion register 14 into the conversion result storing register 18 without change.</p>
    <p num="48">
      Completing the A/D conversion of the analog signal AN0, the converter carries out the A/D conversion of the analog signals AN1-Ann sequentially.
      <br/>
      After completing the first period of the A/D conversion in this way, the second period of the A/D conversion is started.
      <br/>
      The controller 15 has the successive conversion register 14 load one of the previous A/D conversion results (A/D conversion results of the first period) which is stored in the conversion result storing register 18.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      After the successive conversion register 14 loads the previous A/D conversion result, the controller 15 sets "1" to the least significant bit of the successive conversion register 14, and the DAC 12 generates the reference voltage VR in accordance with the value stored in the successive conversion register 14.
      <br/>
      In other word, it generates the reference voltage VR in the same manner as it generates the reference voltage VR in the conversion processing of the bit 0 in the first period.
    </p>
    <p num="50">When the DAC 12 generates the reference voltage VR, the comparator 13 compares the reference voltage VR with the voltage of the analog signal (for example, the analog signal AN0) selected by the selector 11.</p>
    <p num="51">
      If the voltage of the analog signal is equal to or greater than the reference value (voltage of the analog signal &gt;= reference voltage VR), the comparator 13 sets the bit 0, the least significant bit of the successive conversion register 14, to "1".
      <br/>
      In contrast, if the voltage of the analog signal is less than the reference voltage VR (voltage of the analog signal&lt;reference voltage VR), it sets the bit 0, the least significant bit of the successive conversion register 14, to "0".
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      After the conversion of the bit 0 is completed in this way, the controller 15 outputs the scanning cycle identification signal SCI indicating that the current A/D conversion (second one) is not the first A/D conversion so that the increment/decrement circuit 16 activates the command signal CM to increment or decrement the value stored in the successive conversion register 14.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the increment/decrement circuit 16 activates the command signal CM instructing to increment when "1" is stored in the least significant bit of the successive conversion register 14, the bit 0, and to decrement when "0" is stored in the bit 0.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      When the increment/decrement circuit 16 activates the command signal CM instructing to increment, the operation circuit 17 reads the value stored in the successive conversion register 14 to increment it, and the conversion result storing register 18 stores its result.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the increment/decrement circuit 16 activates the command signal CM instructing to decrement, the operation circuit 17 reads the value stored in the successive conversion register 14 to decrement it, and the conversion result storing register 18 stores its result.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      After completing the A/D conversion of the analog signal AN0, the converter carries out the A/D conversion of the analog signals AN1-Ann sequentially.
      <br/>
      The third and successive A/D conversion periods are carried out in the same manner as the second A/D conversion period.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      As described above, the present embodiment 1 is configured such that it carries out the A/D conversion of only the least significant bit of the previous A/D conversion result, and that if the least significant bit is converted to "1", it increments the A/D conversion result, whereas if the least significant bit is converted to "0", it decrements the A/D conversion result.
      <br/>
      This enables the converter to convert the analog signals into their corresponding digital signals by only converting the least significant bits without performing the full bit conversion after the second and successive periods as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      As a result, the present embodiment 1 has an advantage of being able to shorten the update period of the analog signals (it is reduced by a factor of eight in the 8-bit A/D converter, for example), and hence to increase the tracking ability of the digital signals to the variations of the analog signals.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Incidentally, since the present embodiment 1 increments or decrements the previous A/D conversion result without fail, the A/D conversion results change slightly even if the analog signals do not change, resulting in small errors (at the bit 0 level).
      <br/>
      The errors at the bit 0 level, however, are very small within an allowable range of the normal A/D converters.
    </p>
    <p num="57">Embodiment 2</p>
    <p num="58">FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing an embodiment 2 of the A/D converter in accordance with the present invention, in which the same reference numerals designate the same or like portions to those of FIG. 1, and the description thereof is omitted here.</p>
    <p num="59">The reference numeral 19 designates an operation circuit for incrementing the previous A/D conversion result if the bit 0, the least significant bit of that conversion result stored in the conversion result storing register 18 is "1", and for decrementing it if the bit 0 is "0".</p>
    <p num="60">Next, the operation of the present embodiment 2 will be described.</p>
    <p num="61">Although the foregoing embodiment 1 increments or decrements the A/D conversion result immediately after completing the conversion of the bit 0, an advantage similar to that of the embodiment 1 can be achieved by incrementing or decrementing the previous A/D conversion result immediately before the conversion of the bit 0, followed by the generation of the reference voltage in accordance with the conversion result, and by the conversion of the bit 0.</p>
    <p num="62">Embodiment 3</p>
    <p num="63">FIG. 4 is a block diagram showing an embodiment 3 of the A/D converter in accordance with the present invention, in which the same reference numerals designate the same or like portions to those of FIG. 1, and the description thereof is omitted here.</p>
    <p num="64">The reference numeral 20 designates a designation register for specifying the number of bits to be A/D converted; and 21 designates an increment/decrement circuit for activating a command signal to increment the value stored in the successive conversion register 14 if lowest few bits of the successive conversion register 14, which are specified by the designation register 20, are all "1", and for activating a command signal to decrement the value stored in the successive conversion register 14 if the lowest few bits are all "0".</p>
    <p num="65">Next, the operation of the present embodiment 3 will be described.</p>
    <p num="66">
      Although the foregoing embodiment 1 converts only the bit 0 in and after the second conversion period, the lowest few bits can be converted.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the number of bits to be subjected to the A/D conversion can be specified using the designation register 20.
      <br/>
      For example, when the lowest 3 bits are to be A/D converted, the designation register 20 is set to "3".
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      When the designation register 20 is set to "3", bit 2, bit 1 and bit 0 are converted in the second and successive periods in the same manner as they are converted in the first period, and then the increment/decrement circuit 21 checks, after the conversion of the three bits has been completed, whether the values of the bit 2, bit 1 and bit 0 are all "1" or not.
      <br/>
      If they are all "1", the increment/decrement circuit 21 activates the command signal to increment the value stored in the successive conversion register 14, and if they are all "0", the increment/decrement circuit 21 activates the command signal to decrement the value stored in the successive conversion register 14.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, that is, if "1" and "0" bits are mixed, the command signals to increment and decrement are made inactive.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The operation circuit 17 reads, when the increment/decrement circuit 21 activates the command signal to increment, the value stored in the successive conversion register 14 to increment it, and stores its result in the conversion result storing register 18.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the increment/decrement circuit 21 activates the command signal to decrement, the operation circuit 17 reads the value stored in the successive conversion register 14 to decrement it, and stores its result in the conversion result storing register 18.
      <br/>
      When the increment/decrement circuit 21 makes both the command signals inactive, the operation circuit 17 stores the value stored in the successive conversion register 14 into the conversion result storing register 18 without change.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      As described above, the present embodiment 3 is configured such that it carries out the A/D conversion of the lowest few bits of the previous A/D conversion result, and if all the lowest few bits are converted to "1", it increments the updated A/D conversion result, whereas if they are all converted to "0", it decrements the updated A/D conversion result.
      <br/>
      This enables the converter to convert the analog signals into their corresponding digital signals by only converting the lowest few bits without performing the full bit conversion in the second and successive periods as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      As a result, the present embodiment 3 has an advantage of being able to shorten the update period of the analog signals (update period of each analog signal is reduced by a factor of 3/8 when the 8-bit A/D converter carries out 3 bit conversion, for example), and hence to increase the tracking ability of the digital signals to the variations of the analog signals.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      In addition, the present embodiment 3 has an advantage over the foregoing embodiment 1 of being able to adjust the update period of the analog signals or the conversion accuracy of the A/D converter, considering the variation rates of the analog signals.
      <br/>
      Thus, it can offer an optimum A/D converter for individual systems.

    <p num="87">
      Although the foregoing embodiments 1-5 carry out the full bit conversion in the first conversion period, the reference voltage can be initially set before performing the first A/D conversion period by providing an initial voltage setting circuit 30 as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      This offers an advantage of being able to convert the analog signals to the corresponding digital signals without carrying out the full bit conversion from the beginning of the first conversion period.
