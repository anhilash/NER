      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a multi-color toner set comprising a plurality of color toners for developing latent electrostatic images to form multi-color images, with the attainment of substantially the same hot offset initiation temperature, durability, and image transfer performance thereof with respect to each color toner in the multi-color toner set.
      <br/>
      These color toners for the multi-color toner set can be produced by a conventional fusing and kneading method and a conventional pulverizing method.
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention also relates to a method of forming multi-color images, using the multi-color toner set.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Discussion of Background</p>
    <p num="5">In electrophotography, a latent electrostatic image is formed on a photoconductor comprising a photoconductive material, using various means, and the formed electrostatic image is then developed with a toner to a visible toner image, and when necessary, the developed visible toner image is then transferred to a sheet of paper, and fixed thereto with the application of heat and/or pressure thereto, or using a vapor of a solvent, whereby a hard copy can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="6">
      As methods for developing the electrostatic image to the visible image, using the toner, there are known, for instance, magnetic brush development method, cascade development method, and powder cloud development method.
      <br/>
      In any of these development methods, the step of fixing the toner image to a transfer sheet is a very important step.
      <br/>
      In particular, when the toner image is thermally fixed, using heat rollers, the toner image in a fused state comes into contact with the surface of the heat rollers, so that a phenomenon that the toner image adheres to the surface of the heat rollers and is transferred thereto, that is, a so-called offset phenomenon, may take place.
      <br/>
      However, the occurrence of such offset phenomenon should be prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Conventionally, in order to prevent the occurrence of the offset phenomenon, the surface of an image fixing roller is made of a material having excellent releasability with respect to the toner, such as silicone rubber or fluorine-based resin.</p>
    <p num="8">Furthermore, conventionally, in order to prevent the occurrence of the offset phenomenon more effectively, and also to prevent the fatigue of the surface of the image fixing roller, the surface of the image fixing roller is covered or coated with a thin layer of a liquid which has high releasability with respect to the toner, such as silicone oil or a fluorine-based oil, which may be referred to as the offset preventing liquid.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The above-mentioned method is extremely effective for preventing the occurrence of the offset phenomenon, but has a problem that an apparatus for supplying the offset preventing liquid to the image fixing roller is required, which makes the image fixing apparatus complicated in mechanism.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the step of coating the surface of the image fixing roller with the oil has the risk of bringing about the problems that the surface layers of the image fixing roller are separated and accordingly the life of the image fixing roller is significantly shortened while in use.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Instead of using such an oil supplying apparatus, there has been proposed a method of supplying an offset preventing liquid from toner particles themselves in the course of the image fixing step with the application of heat and/or pressure.
      <br/>
      More specifically, a releasing agent such as low-molecular-weight polyethylene, or low-molecular-weight polypropylene, is added to the toner particles and is caused to ooze from the toner particles at the image fixing step while heat and/or pressure is applied thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      By the above-mentioned method, the occurrence of the offset phenomenon can be in fact prevented at the image fixing step when heat and/or pressure is applied.
      <br/>
      However, it has been found that the releasing agent is released from the toner particles and adheres to the surface of carrier particles or a charging member, so that a so-called spent phenomenon takes place by which the charging performance of the carrier particles and the charging member is significantly lowered, as a result, the durability of the toner or the developer is markedly lowered.
    </p>
    <p num="12">It is also known that the presence of the above-mentioned releasing agent within the toner impairs the fluidity of the toner or the transfer performance of the toner to a transfer sheet.</p>
    <p num="13">In order to prevent the toner particles from becoming a film on a development sleeve and/or on a photoconductor, and also to prevent the occurrence of the spent phenomenon on the carrier and the deposition of the toner on a blade, the following proposals have been made so as to control the state of the toner itself and also the state of the releasing agent in the toner: For example, in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 3-243956, there is proposed the use of a toner having a 200 to 5000  Angstrom  average lattice length of a primary peak of a small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS); in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 3-296067, there is proposed a toner at a cross section of which there are formed island-sea structures composed of a binder polymer and polypropylene, with a maximum diameter in a major axis of island portions formed by the polypropylene being in a range of 200 to 3000  Angstrom , and an average interval among the islands being 1  MU m or less; and in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 5-45925, there is proposed a toner comprising toner particles on the surface of which there is deposited a releasing agent with a particle size of 100 to 500  Angstrom , having a fusing initiation temperature--fusing termination temperature difference of 50 (degree)  C. or less, and a melting point of 60 to 180 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="14">In order to maintain the development performance and abrasion resistance of a photoconductor, there is proposed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 5-197199 a toner on the surface of which there are dispersed polyolefin particles with a particle size of 0.01 to 0.5  MU m in an amount of 2 to 20%; in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 7-301951 a toner comprising a binder resin and a releasing agent with an SP value difference thereof being 1.5 or less; and in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 7-271095 a toner comprising a releasing agent with a crystallization degree in a range of 40 to 60% when the releasing agent is in the toner.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The above proposed toners have excellent spent phenomenon prevention effect and improved durability when used alone.
      <br/>
      However, these toners have a significant shortcoming that when used as a set of a plurality of color toners, properties such as hot offset initiation temperature, durability, and image transfer performance thereof differ in each color toner.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">It is therefore a first object of the present invention to provide a multi-color toner set, with each color toner having improved durability and image transfer performance, with a minimized difference in the durability, image transfer performance and hot offset initiation temperature between each of the color toners.</p>
    <p num="17">A second object of the present invention is to provide a method of forming a multi-color image, with each color having improved durability and image transfer performance with a minimized difference in durability, image transfer performance and hot offset initiation temperature between each of the colors in the multi-color image.</p>
    <p num="18">The first object of the present invention can be achieved by a multi-color toner set comprising a plurality of color toners with different colors, each color toner comprising toner particles, each toner particle comprising a binder resin, a pigment and a releasing agent, at least part of the releasing agent being present in the form of domains in the binder resin, with a difference between a maximum content and a minimum content of the releasing agent in the form of domains in the binder resin in each of the color toners being in a range of 20% or less.</p>
    <p num="19">The second object of the present invention can be achieved by forming a multi-color image, using the above-mentioned multi-color toner set.</p>

      <br/>

      <br/>

    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="21">As mentioned above, in the conventional toners, when used as a set of a plurality of color toners, the properties such as hot offset initiation temperature, durability, and image transfer performance thereof differ in each color toner.</p>
    <p num="22">
      The inventors of the present invention have discovered that the differences in the above-mentioned properties are caused, depending upon the state of the presence of a releasing agent in each color toner, more particularly, depending upon the state of the presence of the releasing agent in the form of domains in a binder agent used in the color toner.
      <br/>
      The domain here means a particular island-shaped portion where the releasing agent is present in the binder resin in a state different from the surrounding state thereof with the formation of an interface between the releasing agent and the binder resin.
    </p>
    <p num="23">In other words, the inventors of the present invention have discovered that a plurality of color toners which has the same or substantially the same above-mentioned properties can be obtained by controlling the state of the presence of the releasing agent in the form of domains in the binder resin.</p>
    <p num="24">With reference to FIG. 1, the reason why a plurality of color toners which has the same or substantially the same above-mentioned properties can be obtained by controlling the state of the presence of the releasing agent in the form of domains in the binder resin will now be explained.</p>
    <p num="25">As illustrated in FIG. 1, the releasing agent is considered to be present in the toner in the following three State Modes 1, 2 and 3:</p>
    <p num="26">In State Mode 1, the releasing agent is present in such a state as absorbed by solid materials such as a pigment and a charge controlling agent.</p>
    <p num="27">In State Mode 2, the releasing agent is dispersed in the binder resin in a compatible state therewith at a molecular level.</p>
    <p num="28">In State Mode 3, the releasing agent is present in the form of island-shaped domains in the binder resin with the formation of interfaces between the releasing agent domains and the binder resin.</p>
    <p num="29">The difference between State Mode 1 and State Mode 2 cannot be recognized by a transmission type electron microscope, but the releasing agent, which is present in the form of domains in State Mode 3 can be easily identified by the transmission type electron microscope.</p>
    <p num="30">
      The hot offset initiation temperature is largely controlled by the releasing agent present in the form of domains in State Mode 3.
      <br/>
      It is considered that the releasing agent in State Mode 1 and the releasing agent in State Mode 2 have substantially no function of controlling the hot offset initiation temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="31">When a plurality of different color toners is used, the amount and the kind of the pigments used in each of the color toners differ, so that the amount of the releasing agent in State Mode 1 and that in State Mode 2 differ in each color toner and as a result, the amount of the releasing agent in Mode 3 differs in each color toner.</p>
    <p num="32">
      The pigments used in the color toners are mostly present in an aggregate form of particles with a particle diameter in the order of nano meter, that is, in the form of primary particles at a submicron level, so that a large amount of the releasing agent is absorbed by the pigments.
      <br/>
      This increases the difference in the amount of the releasing agent in State Mode 3 in each color toner.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      For example, even when color toners are prepared using the same releasing agent with the same formulation under the same preparation procedure, the state of the presence of the releasing agent in each of the resultant color toners differs as illustrated in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, SM1 denotes the releasing agent in State Mode 1; SM2, the releasing agent in State Mode 2; and SM3, the releasing agent in State Mode 3.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 2, even though the color toners are prepared using the same releasing agent with the same formulation under the same preparation procedure as in a conventional method, the ratio of the total of the cross section areas of the releasing agent in SM3 to the corresponding cross section of each color toner, and the particle diameters of the dispersed releasing agent in the cross section in SM3 differ in each of the color toner as observed by the transmission type electron microscope.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Furthermore, the releasing agent in SM3 has an effect not only on the durability of the color toner, but also on the transfer performance thereof, so that a different amount of the releasing agent in SM3 in each color toner will result in that each color toner has a different durability and a different transfer performance.
      <br/>
      As a matter of course, the formation of a multi-color image, using a set of such color toners that have a different durability and a different transfer performance will lead to the formation of poor quality multi-color images.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Therefore, when the releasing agent is used in a set of a plurality of color toners, it is required that the formulation of the releasing agent be determined, with the amount of the releasing agent that could be used in SM1 and SM2 taken into consideration, and that a variation in the amount of the releasing agent that would be present in SM3 be minimized as illustrated in FIG. 3.</p>
    <p num="36">The inventors of the present invention discovered that a dispersion in anti-hot-offset performance can be minimized when using a multi-color toner set comprising a plurality of color toners with different colors, each color toner comprising toner particles, each toner particle comprising a binder resin, a pigment and a releasing agent, at least part of the releasing agent being present in the form of domains in the binder resin, with a difference between a maximum content and a minimum content of the releasing agent in the form of domains in the binder resin in each of the color toners being in a range of 20% or less, preferably 15% or less, more preferably 10% or less, for example, when calculating the ratio of the difference based on an average content of the releasing agent in the form of domains in the binder resin in the plurality of the color toners.</p>
    <p num="37">The content of the releasing agent in the form of domains in the binder resin in each toner particle can be determined at a predetermined cross section of the toner particle, for example, by measuring a ratio of a total area of the cross sections of the domains at the predetermined cross section of the toner particle to the cross section of the toner particle.</p>
    <p num="38">More specifically, the content of the releasing agent present in the form of domains in the binder resin for each color toner can be determined by dispersing the color toner in a solvent in which the binder resin is soluble, but the releasing agent is insoluble, for example, THF, and then by measuring an area ratio of the releasing agent in the cross section of the toner in an undried state, using a transmission type electron microscrope.</p>
    <p num="39">The difference between a maximum content and a minimum content of the releasing agent in the form of domains in the binder resin in each of the color toners, as calculated based on an average content of the releasing agent in the form of domains in the binder resin in the color toners, will be hereinafter referred to as "the domain releasing content variation" in the present specification.</p>
    <p num="40">
      When "the domain releasing content variation" exceeds 20%, each color toner comes to have a different a different anti-hot-offset performance.
      <br/>
      The 20% domain releasing content variation means that the content of the releasing agent in each color toner is within  +- 10% with respect to the average content of the releasing agent in each color toner.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      It is preferable that a plurality of the color toners that is to be fixed simultaneously have the same image fixing characteristics.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when such a plurality of the color toners is prepared, the materials and the formulation thereof for each color toner are usually the same other than the pigment for each color toner.
      <br/>
      However, when the charging performance of each pigment for each color toner differs, the kind of the charge control agent will be appropriately selected and the amount thereof will also be adjusted so as to obtain the same charging performance for each color toner.
      <br/>
      Even when each color toner is thus prepared, it may occur that each color toner has a different hot offset initiation temperature.
      <br/>
      This is due to a different state of the releasing agent in each color toner, which controls and determines the hot offset initiation temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="42">According to the present invention, the hot offset initiation temperature of each color toner can be controlled so as to be substantially the same, and an image fixing effective temperature range of each color toner can be significantly broadened by controlling the amount of the releasing agent in each of the color toners so as to be in a range of 2 to 10 wt. % of the entire weight of each of the color toners, and by controlling a ratio of a total content of the releasing agent which is present in the form of domains in the binder resin in SM3 so as to be in a range of 2 to 7%, preferably in a range of 3 to 6%, more preferably in a range of 3 to 4%, in each of the color toners, for example, by measuring a ratio of a total area of the cross sections of the domains at a predetermined cross section of the toner particle to the cross section of the toner particle, using a transmission type electron microscope.</p>
    <p num="43">
      When the ratio of the total content of the releasing agent in SM3 is less than 2%, the hot offset phenomenon is difficult to prevent in a high temperature range even though the releasing agent is used for preventing the hot offset phenomenon, while when the ratio of the total content of the releasing agent in SM3 is more than 7%, the aggregation degree and the image transfer performance of the color toner are apt to be lowered due to the excessive amount of the releasing agent in the color toner.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the spent phenomenon is also apt to occur and accordingly the durability of the developer tends to be lowered.

    <p num="44">Furthermore, the durability of each color toner can be significantly improved by formulating the multi-color toner set of the present invention in such a manner that at least 75% of a total number of the domains of the releasing agent which is in State Mode 3 in the binder resin in each particle of the color toners has a maximum length of 1  MU m or less.</p>
    <p num="45">When the maximum length exceeds 1  MU m, the same adverse effects as caused by the use of the excessive amount of the releasing agent in the color toner, as mentioned above, are caused.</p>
    <p num="46">The maximum length can be measured by dispersing and/or dissolving each color toner, for instance, in a THF solvent at an appropriate concentration and inspecting the state of the releasing agent in an undried state, using an optical microscope.</p>
    <p num="47">
      The releasing agent for use in the multi-color toner set of the present invention may comprises at least two kinds of releasing agents, for instance, a first releasing agent with a melting point T1 and a second releasing agent with a melting point T2 which is lower than said melting point T1 of the first releasing agent. in this case, it is preferable that in releasing agent which is present in the form of domains in the binder resin, that is, in State Mode 3, the amount of the first releasing agent be greater than that of the second releasing agent.
      <br/>
      This is because the higher the melting point of the releasing agent, the greater the pulverizing degree of the releasing agent to obtain a small particle size releasing agent; and the smaller the particle size, the greater the durability of the releasing agent.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      As the releasing agent for use in the present invention, it is preferable to employ, for example, low-molecular-weight polypropylene, low-molecular-weight polyethylene, and carnauba wax.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, there can be employed natural waxes such as candelilla wax, rice wax, and montan wax; low-molecular-weight polyolefin; higher fatty acids such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, and myristic acid; metal salts of higher fatty acid; and higher fatty acid amides.

    <p num="49">
      The content of the releasing agent in the form of domains in the binder resin in SM3, and the dispersed particle diameter of the releasing agent can be controlled not only by adjusting the formulation and amount of the releasing agent to be added to the color toners, but also by adding to the color toners finely-divided particles which are incompatible with the binder resin in each of the particles of said color toners.
      <br/>
      By adding an appropriate amount of such finely-divided particles to the color toners, the content of the releasing agent in SM3 can be controlled.

      The color toners for use in the present invention can be produced by a conventional method of mixing the above-mentioned components and then kneading and fusing the mixture in a kneader.

      However, it is preferable to produce the color toners by a method comprising the steps of having part of the releasing agent absorbed by the pigment or finely-divided metallic oxide particles subjected to hydrophobic treatment, and then kneading the remaining releasing agent and the binder resin together in order to efficiently produce the color toners for use in the present invention.
      <br/>
      In any event, it is preferable to have the releasing agent absorbed by any of the above-mentioned solid materials so as to be in State Mode 1 or 2 in advance, in order to produce the color toners for use in the present invention with high productivity, so as to have a minimum difference in the content of the releasing agent in the form of domains in the binder resin between each of the color toners.
