    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention is an exhaust system for an engine.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention is an exhaust system for an internal combustion engine powering a water propulsion device of a watercraft.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Watercraft are often powered by internal combustion engines.
      <br/>
      This is especially true of the type of watercraft known as personal watercraft.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Personal watercraft have a hull which defines an engine compartment.
      <br/>
      The engine is mounted in the engine compartment and has its output shaft arranged to drive a water propulsion of the watercraft.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The engine produces exhaust products as a by-product of the combustion of fuel.
      <br/>
      It is desirable to route this exhaust from the engine to a point external to the watercraft.
      <br/>
      Generally, an exhaust system is provided for this purpose.
      <br/>
      The exhaust system normally includes at least one exhaust pipe extending from a port through the engine leading from a cylinder to a discharge point.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Many times, little attention is given the exhaust system, with the result being a detrimental affect on engine and/or watercraft performance.
      <br/>
      For example, it is generally desirable to arrange the exhaust system so that it occupies a small amount of space.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the space occupied by the engine is minimized, and the overall size of the watercraft may be minimized lending to a light and maneuverable craft.
      <br/>
      In many instances, however, this compact arrangement results in the exhaust system having sharp turns or bends which restrict the flow of exhaust therethrough.
      <br/>
      The exhaust gas back-pressure reduces engine power, especially in two-cycle engines.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      An associated problem is that when the engine has multiple cylinders, a compact exhaust system may result in the exhaust flow path corresponding to one cylinder to be different than another cylinder.
      <br/>
      When the exhaust flow paths for cylinders vary, the operating temperature of the cylinders tends to vary.
      <br/>
      The cooling and air/fuel charging needs of the cylinders then varies, complicating the design and/or operating conditions of the engine.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Also, exhaust systems for engines powering watercraft are subjected to forces which many other engines are not, especially watercraft vibration.
      <br/>
      These vibration forces have the tendency to reduce the life of the exhaust system, especially exhaust system mufflers.
    </p>
    <p num="9">An exhaust system for an engine powering a watercraft which overcomes the above-stated problems is desired.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The present invention is an exhaust system for an engine powering a watercraft.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the watercraft is of the type having a hull and a front end and a rear end The watercraft has a water propulsion device which is preferably positioned near a rear end of the hull.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The engine is connected to the hull and has an output shaft arranged in driving relationship with the water propulsion device.
      <br/>
      The engine is mounted towards the front end of the hull from the water propulsion device.
      <br/>
      The engine is of the internal combustion type, and is provided with an exhaust system for routing exhaust products to a point external to the watercraft.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In one embodiment, the engine has a body defining at least two cylinders, one of which is closer to the front end of the watercraft, and the other which is closer to the rear end.
      <br/>
      The exhaust system routes exhaust from each cylinder to a discharge at the rear of the watercraft.
      <br/>
      The exhaust system includes a first portion corresponding to the forward-most cylinder, the first portion extending towards the front end of the watercraft before extending to the rear of the watercraft, the exhaust system includes a second portion corresponding to the rear-most cylinder, this portion extending directly rearwardly.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In another embodiment, the engine has a body which is tilted and defines at least one cylinder having an axis which is offset from vertical.
      <br/>
      The engine includes an intake system extending from the body in a direction generally opposite vertical from the axis along which the cylinder(s) extend.
      <br/>
      The exhaust system routes exhaust from each cylinder to a discharge at the rear of the watercraft, and includes a portion which extends under a portion of the engine between the body or intake and a bottom of the hull.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In yet another embodiment, a fuel system associated with the engine includes a fuel tank which is generally positioned forward of the engine.
      <br/>
      A first portion of an exhaust system corresponding to at least one cylinder extends forwardly along a first side of the fuel tank and then rearwardly along a second side of the tank towards the rear of the watercraft, while a second portion of the exhaust system corresponding to one or more other cylinders extends forwardly along the second side of the fuel tank and then rearwardly along the first side of the fuel tank.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">The present invention is an exhaust system for an internal combustion engine arranged to power a watercraft.</p>
    <p num="18">
      A first embodiment exhaust system is illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      As illustrated therein, a watercraft 20 includes a hull 22.
      <br/>
      An internal combustion engine 24 is connected to the hull 22.
      <br/>
      The details of the watercraft 20 are not generally illustrated nor described since they form no part of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As such, the watercraft 20 may be arranged in any number of manners.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the watercraft 20 is of the closed-hull type wherein the engine 24 is positioned in an engine compartment defined by the hull 22.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The watercraft 20 includes a water propulsion device 26 which is powered by the engine 24.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 1, this water propulsion device 26 is a jet-propulsion device having a housing 28 defining a water propulsion passage through which water is drawn by an impeller (not shown) and expelled through an outlet into a steering nozzle 30 positioned at a rear end of the watercraft 20.
      <br/>
      The steering nozzle 30 is moveable, such as with a steering handle, so that the direction of the watercraft 20 may be controlled.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The engine 24 is preferably of the multi-cylinder variety.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the engine 24 includes a body 27 defining a pair of cylinders, preferably arranged in in-line fashion.
      <br/>
      As may be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the engine 24 may operate on a two-cycle or four-cycle principle, may include more than two-cylinders, and may be arranged in other than in-line fashion, such as "V" or opposed.
      <br/>
      The engine 24 may also be of the rotary type.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Though not illustrated, an air intake system is provided for delivering air to each cylinder.
      <br/>
      In addition, a fuel delivery system provides fuel to each cylinder for combustion therein.
      <br/>
      The fuel delivery system preferably includes a fuel tank 32.
      <br/>
      As illustrated, the fuel tank 32 is preferably positioned in front of the engine 24 (at that end of the engine 24 towards the front of the watercraft 20 opposite the steering nozzle 30, in the direction Fr illustrated in FIG. 1).
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A piston (not shown) is positioned in each cylinder and arranged to drive a crankshaft 34 which extends from a rear end of the engine 24 (i.e. the end of the engine 24 generally opposite the fuel tank 32).
      <br/>
      The crankshaft 34 is coupled to a drive shaft 36 by a coupling 38.
      <br/>
      The drive shaft 36 extends rearward from the coupling 38 to drive the impeller or other water propulsion device.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an improved exhaust system which defines an exhaust flow path for routing the products of combustion from the engine 24 to a point external to the watercraft 20.
      <br/>
      Preferably, an exhaust passage (not shown) leads from each cylinder through the engine 24 generally to one side thereof (facing a side of the hull 22).
      <br/>
      A first exhaust pipe 40 is connected to the engine 24 and has a passage therethrough aligned with the passage leading from a first of the cylinders.
      <br/>
      A second exhaust pipe 42 is connected to the engine 24 and has a passage therethrough aligned with the passage leading from a second of the cylinders.
      <br/>
      The first and second exhaust pipes 40,42 preferably extend outwardly from the side of the engine 24 and then curve towards the front of the watercraft 20.
      <br/>
      The first and second exhaust pipes 40,42 are connected to first and second upstream mufflers 44,46 respectively.
      <br/>
      These mufflers 44,46 are elongate and generally extend parallel to the crankshaft 34 along one side of the fuel tank 32.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The upstream mufflers 44,46 preferably extend slightly beyond the fuel tank 32 at a front end of the watercraft 20 and are connected to first and second water locks 48,50 respectively.
      <br/>
      These water locks 48,50 may be of a variety of types known to those skilled in the art and arranged to prevent the backflow of water through the exhaust system to the engine 24.
      <br/>
      The water locks 48,50 are preferably positioned in front of the fuel tank 32 (i.e. towards the front end of the watercraft 20 and on the opposite side of the tank 32 from the engine 24).
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      First and second exhaust pipes or hoses 52,54 lead from the waterlocks 48,50 to first and second downstream mufflers 56,58.
      <br/>
      The downstream mufflers 56,58 are generally elongate and extend towards the rear of the watercraft 20 along a second side of the fuel tank 32 and the side of the engine 24 generally opposite the first and second exhaust pipes 40,42 extending from the engine 24.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      As illustrated, a discharge exhaust pipe 60,62 extends from each downstream muffler 56,58 through the hull 22 of the watercraft 20 to a discharge external to the watercraft.
      <br/>
      As will be understood, the various parts of the exhaust system define a passage therethrough through which exhaust flows and is routed from the passage through the engine 24 corresponding to a cylinder to the discharge point external to the watercraft 20.
      <br/>
      As illustrated, one of the pipes 60 preferably discharges on one side of the steering nozzle 30, while the other pipe 62 discharges on the opposite side of the nozzle 30.
    </p>
    <p num="27">The exhaust system just described thus defines a flow path from the engine 24 towards the front end of the hull 22 along one side of the fuel tank 32, and then along a second side of the fuel tank towards the rear of the watercraft 20 to a discharge.</p>
    <p num="28">
      The exhaust system of the present invention has several distinct advantages over exhaust systems of the prior art.
      <br/>
      First, the exhaust system occupies otherwise unused space within the engine compartment, thereby opening up additional space for the engine and related components.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Second, the exhaust system is arranged so that the exhaust path from the engine 24 to discharge for the exhaust corresponding to each cylinder is nearly equal.
      <br/>
      In this manner, both cylinders have generally the same exhaust system back-pressure associated therewith, whereby the operating conditions of the cylinders are not substantially different.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Further, the exhaust system is generally symmetrically arranged around the engine 24 within the engine compartment.
      <br/>
      Most importantly, the exhaust system follows a path which allows the pathway to be generally unrestricted, i.e. there are no very sharp bends, reducing the exhaust back-pressure and improving engine operating performance.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      FIG. 2 illustrates a watercraft 20a powered by an engine 24a and having an exhaust system in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the illustration and description of this embodiment, like reference numerals have been used with similar parts to those of the first embodiment, except that an "a" designator has been added to all reference numerals of this embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As in the first embodiment, the engine 24a has a crankshaft 34a arranged to drive a drive shaft 36a through a coupling 38a.
      <br/>
      The drive shaft 36a drives an impeller or similar member of a water propulsion device 28a.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The exhaust system of this embodiment of the present invention includes a first exhaust pipe 40a connected to the engine 24a and leading from the exhaust passage leading from a first cylinder, and a second exhaust pipe 42a connected to the engine 24a and leading from the exhaust passage leading from a second cylinder.
      <br/>
      The first exhaust pipe 40a curves outwardly and forwardly from the engine 24a towards a first muffler 44a, which in turn leads to a water lock 48a positioned at the front end of the watercraft 20a in front of the fuel tank 32a.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      An exhaust pipe 52a leads from the water lock 48a along the opposite side of the engine from the first muffler 44a to a secondary water lock 51a near the rear of the watercraft 20a.
      <br/>
      An exhaust pipe 60a extends from this secondary water lock 51a to a discharge at the rear of the watercraft 20a.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The second exhaust pipe 42a preferably leads from the exhaust passage leading from the rear-most cylinder.
      <br/>
      This exhaust pipe 42a extends outwards from the side of the engine before curving around the rear of the engine 22a to a second muffler 46a positioned along the opposite side of the engine 22a (i.e. along the side that the exhaust pipe 52a extends).
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      This muffler 46a extends to a waterlock 50a also positioned at the front of the watercraft 20a in front of the fuel tank 32a.
      <br/>
      An exhaust pipe 54a extends from the water lock 50a along the side of the tank 32a and engine 22a (along the same side of the engine 22a from which the first and second exhaust pipes 40a,42a extend) to a secondary waterlock 53a near the rear of the watercraft 20a.
      <br/>
      An exhaust pipe 62a extends from this secondary waterlock 53a to a discharge.
      <br/>
      This exhaust pipe 62a is arranged in conjunction with the corresponding exhaust pipe 60a leading from the other secondary waterlock 51a to cross.
    </p>
    <p num="37">As illustrated, the paths of the exhaust flow from the front and rear cylinders cross (i.e. flow in opposite directions) at the front of the watercraft 20a and at the rear of the watercraft 20a.</p>
    <p num="38">
      This exhaust system has similar advantages to those of the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      In addition, exhaust system is "balanced" on each side of the engine 24a so as to be generally symmetric with respect to the hull of the watercraft 20a.
      <br/>
      Also, this system includes two water locks along each exhaust path, reducing the probability of water entering the engine 24a, and permitting each individual water lock to be smaller.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      FIGS. 3-5 illustrate a watercraft 20b powered by an engine 24b and having an exhaust system in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the illustration and description of this embodiment, like reference numerals have been used with similar parts to those of the prior embodiments, except that a "b" designator has been added to all reference numerals of this embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      As in the prior embodiment, the engine 24b has a crankshaft 34b arranged to drive a drive shaft 36b through a coupling 38b.
      <br/>
      The drive shaft 36b drives an impeller or similar member of a water propulsion device 28b.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The exhaust system of this embodiment of the present invention includes a first exhaust pipe 40b connected to the engine 24b and leading from the exhaust passage leading from a first cylinder, and a second exhaust pipe 42b connected to the engine 24b and leading from the exhaust passage leading from a second cylinder.
      <br/>
      These exhaust pipes 40b,42b curve outwardly and forwardly from the engine 24b towards first and second mufflers 44b,46b.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      As illustrated, a flexible coupling 64b is provided between the first exhaust pipe 40b and corresponding muffler 44b.
      <br/>
      A similar coupling 66b is provided between the second exhaust pipe 42b and corresponding muffler 46b.
      <br/>
      These couplings 64b,66b, may comprise resilient hoses, metal conduits or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      As in the first embodiment, the mufflers 46b extend towards a front end of the engine 24b along a fuel tank 32b.
      <br/>
      A pair of water locks 48b,50b are positioned near the front end of the watercraft 20b in front of the fuel tank 32b.
      <br/>
      An exhaust pipe or hose 68b extends from a first of the mufflers 44b to a first water lock 48b, while a similar exhaust pipe or hose 70b extends from the other muffler 46b to the other water lock 50b.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      A first discharge exhaust pipe 60b extends from a first of the water locks 48b around the other side of the fuel tank 32b and along the side of the engine 24b opposite the mufflers 44b,46b and through the hull 22b at a rear end of the watercraft 20b.
      <br/>
      A second discharge exhaust pipe 62b extends from a second of the water locks 50b around the same side of the fuel tank 32b and long the side of the engine 24b opposite the mufflers 44b,46b and through the hull 22b at the rear end of the watercraft 20b.
    </p>
    <p num="45">The exhaust flow path of the exhaust system of this embodiment of the invention is similar to the first, flowing from the engine towards the front of the watercraft along one side of the fuel tank, and then along another side of the fuel tank towards the rear of the engine.</p>
    <p num="46">
      This exhaust system generally has the advantages of the exhaust system of the first embodiment and has the added advantage that the transmission of engine vibration to the mufflers 44b,46b is reduced.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 1, in the first embodiment the exhaust pipes are rigidly connected to the upstream mufflers and support them.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the flexible couplings 64b,66b serve to isolate the mufflers 44b,46b from engine vibration transmitted to the exhaust pipes 40b,42b which are coupled to the engine 24b.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Since the exhaust pipes 40b,42b do not support the mufflers 44b,46b, a mounting 72b is provided for removably coupling the mufflers 44b,46b to the watercraft 20b.
      <br/>
      Referring primarily to FIG. 4, a mounting flange 74b extends generally vertically upward from the muffler 44b.
      <br/>
      A bracket 76b is connected to the hull 22b of the watercraft 20b.
      <br/>
      The bracket 76b is preferably connected to the hull 22b via a pair of bolts 78b or similar fasteners.
      <br/>
      The bracket 76b depends downwardly from the hull 22b and has a pair of spaced legs.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      A pin 82b extends through a passage in each leg of the bracket 76b and a passage through the flange 74b when positioned between the legs of the bracket 76b.
      <br/>
      A resilient elastomer 80b is positioned about the pin 82b and separate the pin 82b from the bracket 76b and flange 74b, and the flange 74b from the legs of the bracket 76b.
      <br/>
      A cotter pin 84b is preferably provided for maintaining the pin 82b in position.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      A similar mounting is preferably provided for the other muffler 46b.
      <br/>
      The mounting 72b has the advantage that the muffler 44a is removably connected to the watercraft 20b and yet is supported thereby.
      <br/>
      In addition, the mounting 72b is arranged to prevent the transmission of watercraft 20b vibration to the muffler 44b serving to increase the life of the muffler.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      FIG. 5 illustrates a more specific mounting arrangement for the exhaust pipes extending from the engine 24b and the muffler connected thereto.
      <br/>
      In this Figure, only one exhaust pipe 42b and muffler 46b are illustrated, it being understood that the other exhaust pipe 40b and muffler 44b may be similarly arranged.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      As illustrated, a cooling jacket 110b is provided about the outside of at least a portion of the exhaust pipe 42b.
      <br/>
      Coolant, such as water from the body of water in which the watercraft is operating, is delivered through a supply pipe or hose 112b to the jacket 110b.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Preferably, this same coolant is then routed through a supply hose or pipe 114b to a coolant jacket 116b surrounding at least a portion of the muffler 46b.
      <br/>
      The coolant then passes through one or more drain hoses 118b,120b therefrom.
      <br/>
      The coolant may then be delivered to the engine or to a point external to the watercraft.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      As also illustrated, the exhaust pipe 42b is resiliently coupled to the engine 24b body with one or more springs 122b.
      <br/>
      This permits the exhaust pipe 42b to move to some degree with respect to the engine 24b and watercraft 20b, dampening vibrations and extending the life of the exhaust system.
      <br/>
      Of course, this flexible mounting may be provided along with the resilient mounting illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4 for the muffler 44b so that this entire portion of the exhaust system is resiliently mounted.
      <br/>
      When a catalyst 124b is provided in the muffler 46b, this arrangement also serves to protect the catalyst from damage from vibration.

    <p num="55">
      This embodiment exhaust system is similar to that illustrated in FIG. 3, with first and second exhaust pipes 40c,42c extending from the engine 24c through flexible couplings 64c,66c, to first and second mufflers 44c,46c.
      <br/>
      These mufflers 44c,46c, extend along the side of the engine 24c and fuel tank 24c towards the front of the watercraft 20c.
    </p>

      Connecting pipes 68c,70c connect the mufflers 44c,46c, to a single waterlock 47c positioned at the front end of the watercraft 20c in front of the fuel tank 32c.
      <br/>
      A single exhaust pipe 45c extends from this waterlock 47c along the opposite side of the engine 24c from that which the first and second exhaust pipes 40c,42c extend.
      <br/>
      This exhaust pipe 45c extends towards the rear of the watercraft 20c to a secondary waterlock 49c.
      <br/>
      A discharge exhaust pipe 61c extends from this secondary waterlock 49c to a discharge.
      <br/>
      As illustrated, the discharge exhaust pipe 61c preferably extends from one side of the watercraft 20c where the secondary waterlock 49c is located to the opposite side to discharge.

      This embodiment exhaust system again has the advantageous of having large radius bends thus reducing exhaust gas backpressure.

      The water propulsion unit 26d as arranged in this embodiment has the benefit that the water intake is positioned nearer the rear of the watercraft than in other embodiments.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the watercraft 20d is in its planing position, the possibility of air being introduced into the water propulsion unit is reduced.
      <br/>
      This increases the efficiency of the water propulsion device, allowing the watercraft to achieve a higher speed.
      <br/>
      This propulsion arrangement also results in improve turning ability and handling since the thrust point is moved rearward, and because the mounting 86b is curved on its bottom, the resistance is reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      Because the propulsion unit 26d is moved rearward, the exhaust discharge pipes 60d,62d can advantageously discharge into the housing 28d (instead of through the rear of the hull 22d) without being tightly curved and thus restricting the exhaust flow.

      The air and fuel charge created thereby is supplied to a crankcase 25e portion of the engine 24e (the engine operating on a two-cycle crankcase compression cycle and being appropriately arranged, as well known to those of skill in the art), and connected to the crankcase 25e generally opposite the side thereof to which the cylinders extend.

    <p num="75">
      The exhaust system of this embodiment has the similar advantages to those described above in conjunction with the other embodiments.

      First, because of the layout of the engine 24e resulting in the space S, the exhaust system may have a compact arrangement in conjunction with the engine, minimizing the engine compartment size and lending to a smaller watercraft size.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Another advantage of the invention is that the exhaust path corresponding to each cylinder is nearly equal.

      In this regard, and referring to FIG. 12, the second exhaust pipe 42e preferably extends forwardly of the first exhaust pipe 40e by an amount  DELTA X so that the exhaust paths are of the same length (this compensates for the fact that the exhaust ports are arranged so that one is forward of the other and thus the exhaust pipes 40e,42e are connected to the engine at different locations therealong).
    </p>
    <p num="77">The resilient coupling of the exhaust pipes 40e,42e to the mufflers 44e,44e and the resilient coupling of the mufflers 44e,44e to the water lock 49e advantageously reduces the transmission of engine and watercraft vibration to the mufflers 44e,44e serving to increase the life thereof.</p>
