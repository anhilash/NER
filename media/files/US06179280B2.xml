      <br/>
      An apparatus for automatically closing and/or opening of the envelope closing flap for any sized envelope when stacked together.
      <br/>
      This device makes use of a vacuum transfer device using suction cups along with a drive roller and camming device for selectively gripping and moving individual envelopes through the system.
      <br/>
      The envelopes, if open, will be stacked upright in a feed tray and, if closed, will be stacked inverted in the feed tray and will be passed to two main drive rollers as a burst of air is emitted from a wedge to change the orientation of the closing flap from a first position to a second position.
      <br/>
      This can be used for opening or closing of such flaps.
      <br/>
      The device also includes a housing with multiple rollers powered therein along with a connecting rod assembly and cam member for selectively supplying vacuum to the pivotally movable suction powered vacuum transfer device.
      <br/>
      A delivery assembly preferably including two rollers and a drive belt connected therebetween will transfer the processed envelopes toward an exit station where they will be stacked preferably vertically.

      Often it is desired to print, engrave, stamp or emboss on the closing flap of an envelope.
      <br/>
      When one of these activities is performed while the envelope is in the closed position often there is penetration to the front side of the envelope which is unacceptable.
      <br/>
      As such, it is common that envelope flaps are opened for printing and are then closed after printing for other processing or for distribution.
      <br/>
      This activity is often performed manually.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides a relatively small convenient apparatus which is portable and can be used for opening and/or closing the envelope closing flaps of various sized envelopes at various locations within a printing room.
      <br/>
      This eliminates the necessity of manually opening each flap prior to printing and manually closing each flap after printing or embossing or other marking of the envelope closing flap itself.
      <br/>
      One of the unique aspects of the present design is in the ability to close and/or open the closing flap of an envelope solely by changing the orientation of the stack of envelopes in the feed tray.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="30">
      The present invention provides an apparatus for processing envelopes 10 by changing the orientation of the envelope closing flap 12 between an opened position 14 and a closed position 16.
      <br/>
      This apparatus is operable to change the envelope closing flap 12 from the opened position 14 to the closed position 16 or, alternatively, from the closed position 16 to the opened position 14.
      <br/>
      To change the mode of operation there is no alterations need be performed on the apparatus itself.
      <br/>
      It only is necessary that the envelopes be loaded at a modified orientation.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The processing apparatus includes a housing 18 with a feed tray 20 at the input end thereof and an exit tray 24 at the output end thereof.
      <br/>
      Envelopes 10 to be processed are placed into the feed tray 20 and are picked up by the apparatus with the envelope closing flap 12 being moved to a new position and are then fed to an exit tray 24 for removal.
      <br/>
      Positioning of the feed tray 20 with respect to a housing 18 can be varied by a feed tray adjustment means 22 such as a rack and pinion crank as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Similarly the positioning of the exit tray 24 with respect to the housing 18 can be modified by adjusting of the exit tray adjustment mechanism 26.
      <br/>
      Exit tray adjustment capability 26 is also shown in FIG. 1 as a rack and pinion gear mechanism operable through manual rotation of a handle.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      A main drive 28 is included in the present invention mounted within the housing 18 and includes a main drive pulley 30 rotationally driven thereby.
      <br/>
      A main drive belt 38 extends about the main drive pulley 30 to be driven thereby.
      <br/>
      Main drive belt 38 also extends around other important rollers in the apparatus of the present invention for powering thereof as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      A first drive roller 32 and a second drive roller 34 are positioned adjacent to one another and are rotatably mounted within the housing 18.
      <br/>
      The first drive roller 32 is preferably operatively engaged with respect to the main drive belt 38 to be driven thereby.
      <br/>
      A nip area 36 is defined between the first drive roller 32 and the second drive roller 34 and is adapted to receive and grasp an envelope 10 placed therein for processing.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Envelopes 10 are moved from the feed tray 20 to the nip area 36 by a vacuum transfer assembly 40.
      <br/>
      Vacuum transfer assembly 40 is operable to move the individual envelope 10 from the pick-up position 42 at the feed tray 20 to the release position 44 within the nip area 36.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      To achieve this transfer the vacuum transfer assembly 40 includes preferably a vacuum arm 46 pivotally movable with respect to the housing 18 which includes a vacuum cup or vacuum suction cup device 48 positioned thereon.
      <br/>
      As the vacuum arm 46 moves to the pick-up position 42 the vacuum cup 48 will be brought into abutment with an envelope 10 positioned on the feed tray 20.
      <br/>
      Thereafter vacuum will be supplied to the vacuum cup 48 such that it grasps this envelope.
      <br/>
      Thereafter the vacuum arm 46 will be pivoted to the release position 44 adjacent the nip area 36 with the envelope 10 positioned for insertion between the first drive roller 32 and the second drive roller 34.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Operation of the pivotal movement of the vacuum arm is controlled through a link arm 50 secured thereto.
      <br/>
      Link arm 50 is movably secured with respect to a connecting rod assembly 52 which in turn is operatively and rotatably attached preferably with respect to the main drive pulley 30.
      <br/>
      As the main drive pulley 30 rotates the connecting rod assembly 52 will convert this rotational motion into reciprocating motion through connections of a link arm 50 to urge movement of the vacuum arm 46 between the pick-up position 42 and the release position 44.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The specific preferred configuration for the connecting rod assembly 52 includes a spring 54 for maintaining tension between the link arm 50 and the main drive pulley 30 and a connecting rod member 56 which is pivotally secured to the main drive pulley 30 and is pivotally secured with respect to the link arm 50.
      <br/>
      This connecting rod member 56 is preferably longitudinally extensible and retractable by adjustment to vary the relative operational characteristics between the connecting rod assembly 52 and the vacuum transfer assembly 40 and, in particular, the vacuum arm means 46 thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      A vacuum control means 58 is further included for controlling the application of vacuum to the vacuum cups 48.
      <br/>
      This vacuum control means preferably includes a vacuum valve 60 operatively connected through a vacuum line 66 to the vacuum cup 48.
      <br/>
      Vacuum is selectively applied or denied through the vacuum line 66 based on the positioning of the valve means.
      <br/>
      When the valve means 60 is in the opened position vacuum is applied to the vacuum cups 48.
      <br/>
      When the valve 60 is in the closed position vacuum is not so applied.
      <br/>
      Movement of the valve 60 between the opened and closed positions is controlled by a vacuum cam 68 shown best in FIGS. 3 and 4.
      <br/>
      Cam follower 72 is pivotally movable and is operative to open or close the valve 60.
      <br/>
      Cam follower 72 is in continuous contact with a cam profile 70 defined on the vacuum cam 68 which is fixedly secured to the main drive pulley 30.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      A flap movement means 74 is very important to the present invention and is designed to alter the positioning of the envelope closing flap 12 as the vacuum arm 46 is moved toward the release position 44 thereof.
      <br/>
      This flap movement means 74 preferably includes a wedge 76 which includes a laterally extending protruding edge 78 adapted to contact the envelope closing flap 12 for movement thereof from the first position to the second position.
      <br/>
      To further facilitate changing of positioning of the envelope closing flap 12 an air outlet 80 will be included in the wedge 76 which is adapted to deliver a stream or burst of air against the envelope closing flap 12 to facilitate movement thereof from the first position to the second position.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      As shown in FIG. 1 the laterally extending protruding edge 78 will contact the underside of the envelope closing flap 12 of a closed envelope to initiate opening thereof.
      <br/>
      The burst of air generated through the air outlet 80 will then move the envelope closing flap 12 to the completely opened position by the exertion of a burst of air between the envelope itself and the undersurface of the envelope closing flap 12.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, in the FIG. 2 configuration with the envelope closing flap 12 in the opened position, the laterally extending protruding edge 78 of the wedge 76 and the burst of air from the air outlet means 80 will be exerted upon the outer surface of the envelope closing flap 12 for causing same to move to the closed position 16.
      <br/>
      This is a unique aspect of the present invention wherein the same identical apparatus is useful for performing both the opening and closing operation and wherein the change of mode of operation is achieved solely by modifying the loading orientation from inverted to upright or vice versa.

    <p num="41">
      Once the processed envelope 10 passes between the first drive roller 32 and the second drive roller 34 it is received by a delivery assembly 82.
      <br/>
      Delivery assembly 82 is operative to deliver the processed envelope 10 to the exit tray 24.
      <br/>
      Delivery assembly 82 includes preferably in detail a delivery panel 84 extending slightly downwardly from the location of the first and second drive rollers 32 and 34.
      <br/>
      Delivery assembly 82 preferably also includes a first delivery roller 86 at one end of the panel 84 and a second delivery roller 88 at the opposite end of the delivery panel 84.
      <br/>
      A delivery conveying belt 90 extends around the first delivery roller 86 and the second delivery roller 88 to facilitate the conveying and delivery of envelopes positioned upon the delivery panel 84.
      <br/>
      In the preferred configuration the first delivery roller 86 is positioned closer to the first and second delivery rollers 32 and 34 than the second delivery roller 88.
      <br/>
      Also the second delivery roller 88 is positioned closer to the exit tray 24 than the first delivery roller 86.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      In order to enhance the gathering of the envelopes 10 upon the exit tray 24 a vertical orientation means 92 may be included.
      <br/>
      This vertical orientation means 92 has the purpose of achieving approximately vertical orientation of all envelopes discharged from the delivery assembly 82 onto the exit tray 24.
      <br/>
      In detail preferably the vertical orientation means 92 includes a first vertical roller 94 with a second vertical roller 96 positioned slightly therebelow.
      <br/>
      A vertical belt 96 is connected between the first and second vertical rollers 94 and 96 for interconnecting operative driving therebetween.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      All driving of roller movement in the apparatus of the present invention is achieved through the main drive belt 38.
      <br/>
      This drive belt extends about the main drive pulley 30 as well as the first drive roller 32.
      <br/>
      The first drive roller 32 is in engagement with respect to the second drive roller 34 for driving thereof.
      <br/>
      The main drive belt 38 also drives the first delivery roller 86 of the delivery assembly 82.
      <br/>
      First delivery roller 86 is operative to drive the second delivery roller 88 since the delivery conveying belt 90 extends about both rollers.
      <br/>
      In the preferred configuration of the vertical orientation means the vertical belt 98 extending between the first vertical roller 94 and the second vertical roller 96 will be in engagement with respect to the second delivery roller 88 of the delivery assembly 82 in order to be driven therewith.
