      A video down conversion system compliant with the Advanced Television Systems Standard (ATSC) includes a decoder which decodes a Main Profile, High Level (MP@HL) image and employs a downconversion processor to produce a standard definition video signal.
      <br/>
      The system stores a subsampled image in order to reduce memory requirements and employs an upsampling filter to generate reference image data from the stored. subsampled image.
      <br/>
      The reference image data spatially correspond to the image data produced by the video decoder before it is subsampled.
      <br/>
      The upsampling filter uses different filter coefficients based on the subsampling phase of the stored image and the half-pixel indicator in the motion vector which is used to locate the downsampled reference image data in the stored subsampled image.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">This invention relates to a decoder for receiving, decoding and conversion of frequency domain encoded signals, e.g. MPEG-2 encoded video signals, into standard output video signals, and more specifically to an upsampling and half-pixel generator of a decoder which converts an encoded high resolution video signal to a decoded lower resolution output video signal.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      In the United States a standard, the Advanced Television System Committee (ATSC) standard defines digital encoding of high definition television (HDTV) signals.
      <br/>
      A portion of this standard is essentially the same as the MPEG-2 standard, proposed by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
      <br/>
      The standard is described in an International Standard (IS) publication entitled, "Information Technology--Generic Coding of Moving Pictures and Associated Audio, Recommendation H.626", ISO/IEC 13818-2, IS, 11/94 which is available from the ISO and which is hereby incorporated by reference for its teaching on the MPEG-2 digital video coding standard.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The MPEG-2 standard is actually several different standards.
      <br/>
      In MPEG-2 several different profiles are defined, each corresponding to a different level of complexity of the encoded image.
      <br/>
      For each profile, different levels are defined, each level corresponding to a different image resolution.
      <br/>
      One of the MPEG-2 standards, known as Main Profile, Main Level is intended for coding video signals conforming to existing television standards (i.e., NTSC and PAL).
      <br/>
      Another standard, known as Main Profile, High Level is intended for coding high-definition television images.
      <br/>
      Images encoded according to the Main Profile, High Level standard may have as many as 1,152 active lines per image frame and 1,920 pixels per line.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The Main Profile, Main Level standard, on the other hand, defines a maximum picture size of 720 pixels per line and 567 lines per frame.
      <br/>
      At a frame rate of 30 frames per second, signals encoded according to this standard have a data rate of 720*567*30 or 12,247,200 pixels per second.
      <br/>
      By contrast, images encoded according to the Main Profile, High Level standard have a maximum data rate of 1,152*1,920*30 or 66,355,200 pixels per second.
      <br/>
      This data rate is more than five times the data rate of image data encoded according to the Main Profile Main Level standard.
      <br/>
      The standard for HDTV encoding in the United States is a subset of this standard, having as many as 1,080 lines per frame, 1,920 pixels per line and a maximum frame rate, for this frame size, of 30 frames per second.
      <br/>
      The maximum data rate for this standard is still far greater than the maximum data rate for the Main Profile, Main Level standard.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The MPEG-2 standard defines a complex syntax which contains a mixture of data and control information.
      <br/>
      Some of this control information is used to enable signals having several different formats to be covered by the standard.
      <br/>
      These formats define images having differing numbers of picture elements (pixels) per line, differing numbers of lines per frame or field and differing numbers of frames or fields per second.
      <br/>
      In addition, the basic syntax of the MPEG-2 Main Profile defines the compressed MPEG-2 bit stream representing a sequence of images in five layers, the sequence layer, the group of pictures layer, the picture layer, the slice layer, and the macroblock layer.
      <br/>
      Each of these layers is introduced with control information.
      <br/>
      Finally, other control information, also known as side information, (e.g. frame type, macroblock pattern, image motion vectors, coefficient zig-zag patterns and dequantization information) are interspersed throughout the coded bit stream.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Format conversion of encoded high resolution Main Profile, High Level pictures to lower resolution Main Profile, High Level pictures; Main Profile, Main Level pictures, or other lower resolution picture formats, has gained increased importance for a) providing a single decoder for use with multiple existing video formats, b) providing an interface between Main Profile, high level signals and personal computer monitors or existing consumer television receivers, and c) reducing implementation costs of HDTV.
      <br/>
      For example, conversion allows replacement of expensive high definition monitors used with Main Profile, High Level encoded pictures with inexpensive existing monitors which have a lower picture resolution to support, for example, Main Profile, Main Level encoded pictures, such as NTSC or 525 progressive monitors.
      <br/>
      One aspect, down conversion, converts a high definition input picture into lower resolution picture for display on the lower resolution monitor.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      To effectively receive the digital images, a decoder should process the video signal information rapidly.
      <br/>
      To be optimally effective, the decoding systems should be relatively inexpensive and yet have sufficient power to decode these digital signals in real time.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a decoder which supports conversion into multiple low resolution formats must minimize processor memory.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The MPEG-2 Main Profile standard defines a sequence of images in five levels: the sequence level, the group of pictures level, the picture level, the slice level, and the macroblock level.
      <br/>
      Each of these levels may be considered to be a record in a data stream, with the later-listed levels occurring as nested sub-levels in the earlier listed levels.
      <br/>
      The records for each level include a header section which contains data that is used in decoding its sub-records.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Each macroblock of the encoded HDTV signal contains six blocks and each block contains data representing 64 respective coefficient values of a discrete cosine transform (DCT) representation of 64 picture elements (pixels) in the HDTV image.</p>
    <p num="12">
      In the encoding process, the pixel data may be subject to motion compensated differential coding prior to the discrete cosine transformation and the blocks of transformed coefficients are further encoded by applying run-length and variable length encoding techniques.
      <br/>
      A decoder which recovers the image sequence from the data stream reverses the encoding process.
      <br/>
      This decoder employs an entropy decoder (e.g. a variable length decoder), an inverse discrete cosine transform processor, a motion compensation processor, and an interpolation filter.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      FIG. 1 is a high level block diagram of a typical video decoding system of the prior art which processes an MPEG-2 encoded picture.
      <br/>
      The general methods used to decode an MPEG-2 encoded picture, without subsequent processing, downconversion or format conversion, are specified by the MPEG-2 standard.
      <br/>
      The video decoding system includes an entropy decoder (ED) 110, which may include variable length decoder (VLD) 210 and run length decoder 212.
      <br/>
      The system also includes an inverse quantizer 214, and inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT) processor 218.
      <br/>
      A controller 207 controls the various components of the decoding system responsive to the control information retrieved from the input bit stream by the ED 110.
      <br/>
      For processing of prediction images, the system further includes a memory 199 having reference frame memory 222, summing network 230, and motion compensation processor 206a which may have a motion vector processor 221 and half-pixel generator 228.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The ED 110 receives the encoded video image signal, and reverses the encoding process to produce macroblocks of quantized frequency-domain (DCT) coefficient values and control information including motion vectors describing the relative displacement of a matching marcoblock in a previously decoded image which corresponds to a macroblock of the predicted picture that is currently being decoded.
      <br/>
      The Inverse Quantizer 214 receives the quantized DCT transform coefficients and reconstructs the quantized DCT coefficients for a particular macroblock.
      <br/>
      The quantization matrix to be used for a particular block is received from the ED 110.
    </p>
    <p num="15">The IDCT processor 218 transforms the reconstructed DCT coefficients to pixel values in the spatial domain (for each block of 8 * 8 matrix values representing luminance or chrominance components of the macroblock, and for each block of 8 * 8 matrix values representing the differential luminance or differential chrominance components of the predicted macroblock).</p>
    <p num="16">
      If the current macroblock is not predictively encoded, then the output matrix values provided by the IDCT processor 218 are the pixel values of the corresponding macroblock of the current video image.
      <br/>
      If the macroblock is interframe encoded, the corresponding macroblock of the previous video picture frame is stored in memory 199 for use by the motion compensation processor 206.
      <br/>
      The motion compensation processor 206 receives a previously decoded macroblock from memory 199 responsive to the motion vector, and then adds the previous macroblock to the current IDCT macroblock (corresponding to a residual component of the present predictively encoded frame) in summing network 230 to produce the corresponding macroblock of pixels for the current video image, which is then stored into the reference frame memory 222 of memory 199.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      The present invention is embodied in an upsampling filter for a digital video signal down conversion system.
      <br/>
      The downconversion system decodes a digitally encoded video signal representing a video image and decimates the decoded signal to produce a subsampled image signal.
      <br/>
      This subsampled signal is stored for use in decoding a subsequently received encoded image signal which is encoded as differential pixel values relative to the earlier decoded image.
      <br/>
      When a subsequent image signal representing differential pixel values is received and decoded, segments of the stored image are retrieved and upsampled, using a filter according to the present invention, to produce decoded image pixel values which may be combined with the decoded differential pixel values to produce a decoded image signal.
      <br/>
      The upsampling filter according to the present invention includes an upsampling filter having programmable coefficient values and a plurality of filter coefficient sets, each coefficient set corresponding to a distinct subsampling phase.
      <br/>
      The filter also includes circuitry which receives a motion vector from the encoded image signal, processes the received motion vector to locate the desired segment in the stored image and determines the subsampling phase of the desired segment.
      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="22">The exemplary embodiments of the invention decode conventional HDTV signals which have been encoded according to the MPEG-2 standard and in particular, the Main Profile High Level (MP@HL) and the Main Profile Main Level (MP@ML) MPEG-2 standards, and provides the decoded signals as video signals having a lower resolution than that of the received HDTV signals having a selected one of multiple formats.</p>
    <p num="23">Downconversion Decoder</p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 2 is a high level block diagram of the down conversion system including one exemplary embodiment of the present invention employing such a DCT filtering operation, and which may be employed by an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the down conversion system includes a variable length decoder (VLD) 210, a run-length (R/L) decoder 212, an inverse quantizer 214, and inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT) processor 218.
      <br/>
      In addition, the down conversion system includes a down conversion filter 216 for filtering of encoded pictures and a down sampling processor 232.
      <br/>
      While the following describes the exemplary embodiment for a MP@HL encoded input, the present invention may be practiced with any similarly encoded high-resolution image bit stream.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The upsampling filter and half-pixel generator employed by the down conversion system in accordance with the present invention includes an up-sampling processor 226, half-pixel generator 228, and employs a reference frame memory 222.
      <br/>
      The downconversion system also includes a motion compensation processor 206 including a motion vector MV) translator 220 and a motion block generator 224
    </p>
    <p num="26">The system of FIG. 2 also includes a display conversion block 280 having a vertical programmable filter (VPF) 282 and horizontal programmable filter (HZPF) 284. The display conversion block 280 converts downsampled images into images for display on a particular display device having a lower resolution that the original image.</p>
    <p num="27">
      The down conversion filter 216 performs a low-pass filtering of the high resolution (e.g. Main Profile, High Level DCT) coefficients in the frequency domain.
      <br/>
      The down sampling process 232 eliminates spatial pixels by decimation of the filtered Main Profile, High Level picture to produce a set of pixel values which can be displayed on a monitor having lower resolution than that required to display a MP@HL picture.
      <br/>
      The exemplary reference frame memory 222 stores the spatial pixel values corresponding to at least one previously decoded reference frame having a resolution corresponding to the down-sampled picture.
      <br/>
      For interframe encoding, the MV translator 220 scales the motion vectors for each block of the received picture consistent with the reduction in resolution, and the High Resolution motion block generator 224 receives the low resolution motion blocks provided by the reference frame memory 222, upsamples these motion blocks and performs half-pixel interpolation as needed to provide motion blocks which have pixel positions that correspond to the decoded and filtered differential pixel blocks.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Note that in the down conversion system of FIG. 2 the downsampled images are stored rather than high definition images, resulting in a considerable reduction of memory required for storing reference images.</p>
    <p num="29">
      The operation of an exemplary down-conversion system of the present invention for intra-frame encoding is now described.
      <br/>
      The MP@HL bit-stream is received and decoded by VLD 210.
      <br/>
      In addition to header information used by the HDTV system, the VLD 210 provides DCT coefficients for each block and macroblock, and motion vector information.
      <br/>
      The DCT coefficients are run length decoded in the R/L decoder 212 and inverse quantized by the inverse quantizer 214.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Since the received video image represented by the DCT coefficients is a high resolution picture, the exemplary embodiment of the present invention employs low-pass filtering of the DCT coefficients of each block before decimation of the high resolution video image.
      <br/>
      The inverse quantizer 214 provides the DCT coefficients to the DCT filter 216 which performs a low-pass filtering in the frequency domain by weighting the DCT coefficients with predetermined filter coefficient values before providing them to the IDCT processor 218.
      <br/>
      For one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, this filter operation is performed on a block by block basis.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The IDCT processor 218 provides spatial pixel sample values by performing an inverse discrete cosine transform of the filtered DCT coefficients.
      <br/>
      The down sampling processor 232 reduces the picture sample size by eliminating spatial pixel sample values according to a predetermined decimation ratio; therefore, storing the lower resolution picture uses a smaller frame memory compared to that which would be needed to store the higher resolution MP@HL picture.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The operation of an exemplary embodiment of the down-conversion system of the present invention for predicted frames of the encoding standard is now described.
      <br/>
      In this example, the current received image DCT coefficients represent the DCT coefficients of the residual components of the predicted image macroblocks.
      <br/>
      In the described exemplary embodiment, the horizontal components of the motion vectors for a predicted frame are scaled since the low resolution reference pictures of previous frames stored in memory do not have the same number of pixels as the high resolution predicted frame (MP@HL).
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Referring to FIG. 2, the motion vectors of the MP@HL bit stream provided by the VLD 210 are provided to the MV translator 220.
      <br/>
      Each motion vector is scaled by the MV translator 220 to reference the appropriate prediction block of the reference frame of a previous image stored in reference frame memory 222.
      <br/>
      The size (number of pixel values) in the retrieved block is smaller than block provided by the IDCT processor 218; consequently, the retrieved block is upsampled to form a prediction block having the same number of pixels as the residual block provided by the IDCT processor 218 before the blocks are combined by the summing network 230.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The prediction block is upsampled by the up-sampling processor 226 responsive to a control signal from the MV translator 220 to generate a block corresponding to the original high resolution block of pixels, and then half pixel values are generated--if indicated by the motion vector for the up-sampled prediction block in the Half Pixel Generator 228--to ensure proper spatial alignment of the prediction block.
      <br/>
      The upsampled and aligned prediction block is added in summing network 230 to the current filtered block, which is, for this example, the reduced resolution residual component from the prediction block.
      <br/>
      All processing is done on a macroblock by macroblock basis.
      <br/>
      After the motion compensation process is complete for the current high-resolution macroblock, the reconstructed macroblock is decimated accordingly by the down sampling processor 232.
      <br/>
      This process does not reduce the resolution of the image but simply removes redundant pixels from the low resolution filtered image.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Down Sampling for Low Resolution Formats</p>
    <p num="36">
      Down sampling is accomplished by the down sampling process 232 of FIG. 2 to reduce the number of pixels in the downconverted image.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3A shows the input and decimated output pixels for a 4:2:0 signal format for 3:1 decimation.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3B shows the input and decimated output pixels for 4:2:0 chrominance type 2:1 decimation.
      <br/>
      Table 1 gives the legend identification for the Luminance and Chrominance pixels of FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B. The pixel positions before and after the down conversion of FIGS. 3A and 3B are the interlaced (3:1 decimation) and progressive (2:1 decimation) cases respectively.

    <p num="38">
      For down sampling of the interlaced image, which may be the conversion from a 1920 by 1080 pixel image to a 640 by 1080 pixel horizontally compressed image, two out of every three pixels are decimated on the horizontal axis.
      <br/>
      For the exemplary 3:1 decimation, there are three different macroblock types after the down conversion process.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 3A, original macroblocks were denoted by MB0, MB1, MB2.
      <br/>
      The down sampled luminance pixels in MB0 start at the first pixel in the original macroblock, but in MB1 and MB2 the down-sampled pixels start at the third and the second pixels.
      <br/>
      Also the number of down-sampled pixels in each macroblock are not the same.
      <br/>
      In MB0, there are 6 down-sampled pixels horizontally, but 5 pixels in MB1 and MB2.
      <br/>
      These three MB types are repeating, therefore Modulo 3 arithmetic is to be applied.

      For downsampling of the progressive format image the luminance signal is subsampled for every second sample horizontally.
      <br/>
      For the chrominance signal, the down-sampled pixel has a spatial position that is one-half pixel below the pixel position in the original image.
    </p>
    <p num="41">Macroblock Prediction for Downconversion</p>
    <p num="42">
      For the exemplary downconversion process, since the reference frames of the previous images are down sized in the horizontal direction, the received motion vectors pointing to these frames may also be translated according to the conversion ratio.
      <br/>
      The following describes the motion translation for the luminance block in the horizontal direction.
      <br/>
      One skilled in the art could easily extend the following discussion to motion translation in the vertical direction if desired.
      <br/>
      Denoting x and y as the current macroblock address in the original image frame, Dx as the horizontal decimation factor and mvx as the half pixel horizontal motion vector of the original image frame, the address of the top left pixel of the motion block in the original image frame, denoted as XH in the half pixel unit, is given by (1):
      <br/>
      XH=2x+mvx   (1)
    </p>
    <p num="43">The pixel corresponding to the motion block starts in the down-sampled image, and has an address denoted as x* and y* may be determined using equation (2).  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="44">The division of equation (2) is an integer division with truncation.</p>
    <p num="45">
      Because the exemplary filter 216 and down sampling processor 232 only reduce the horizontal components of the image, the vertical component of the motion vector is not affected.
      <br/>
      For the chrominance data, the motion vector is one-half of a luminance motion vector in the original picture.
      <br/>
      Therefore, definitions for translating the chrominance motion vector may also use the two equations (1) and (2).
    </p>
    <p num="46">Motion prediction is done by a two step process: first, pixel accuracy motion estimation in the original image frame may be accomplished by upsampling of down-sampled image frame in the Up Sampling processor 226 of FIGS. 2A and 2B, then the half pixel Generator 228 performs a half pixel interpolation by averaging of nearest pixel values.</p>
    <p num="47">
      The reference image data is added to output data provided by the IDCT processor 218.
      <br/>
      Since the output values of the summing network 230 correspond to an image having a number of pixels consistent with a high resolution format, these values may be downsampled for display on a display having a lower resolution.
      <br/>
      Downsampling in the down sampling processor 232 is substantially equivalent to subsampling of an image frame, but adjustments may be made based upon the conversion ratio.
      <br/>
      For example, in the case of 3:1 downsampling, the number of horizontally downsampled pixels are 6 or 5 for each input macroblock, and the first downsampled pixels are not always first pixel in the input macroblock.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      After acquiring the correct motion prediction block from the down-sampled image, upsampling is used to get the corresponding prediction block in the high resolution picture.
      <br/>
      Consequently, subpixel accuracy in motion block prediction is desirable in the down sampled picture.
      <br/>
      For example, using 3:1 decimation, it is desirable to have 1/3 (or 1/6) subpixel accuracy in motion prediction for the downconverted picture.
      <br/>
      The subpixel which is a first pixel required by the motion vector, in addition to the down-sampled motion block, is determined.
      <br/>
      Then, subsequent subpixel positions are determined using modulo arithmetic as described in the following.
      <br/>
      The subpixel positions are denoted as xs as given in equation (3):  (Equation image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="49">where "%" represents modulo division.</p>
    <p num="50">
      For example, the ranges of xs are 0, 1, 2 for 3:1 upsampling and 0, 1 for 2:1 upsampling.
      <br/>

      For example, in the case of 3:1 decimation, a maximum of 6 horizontally downsampled pixels are produced for each input macroblock.
      <br/>
      However, when upsampling, 9 horizontal pixels are used to produce the corresponding motion prediction block values because an upsampling filter requires more left and right pixels outside of the boundary for the filter to operate.
      <br/>
      Since the exemplary embodiment employs half pixel motion estimation, 17 pixels are needed to get 16 half pixels which are the average values of nearest two pixel samples.
      <br/>
      A half pixel interpolator performs the interpolation operation which provides the block of pixels with half-pixel resolution.
      <br/>
      Table 7A illustrates an exemplary mapping between subpixel positions and polyphase filter elements, and shows a number of left pixels which are needed in addition to the pixels in the upsampled block for the upsampling process.

      At step 312, the motion vector is translated to correspond to the downsampled reference frame in memory.

    <p num="67">DCT Domain Filtering Employing Weighting of DCT Coefficients</p>
    <p num="68">
      The exemplary embodiment of the present invention is employed with the DCT filter 216 of FIG. 2 which processes the DCT coefficients in the frequency domain, replacing a low-pass filter operation in the spatial domain.
      <br/>
      There are several advantages in DCT domain filtering instead of spatial domain filtering for DCT coded pictures, such as contemplated by the MPEG or JPEG standards.
      <br/>
      Most notably, a DCT domain filter is computationally more efficient and requires less hardware than a spatial domain filter applied to the spatial pixel sample values.
      <br/>
      For example, a spatial filter having N taps may use as many as N additional multiplications and additions for each spatial pixel sample value.
      <br/>
      This compares to only one additional multiplication in the DCT domain filter.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The simplest DCT domain filter of the prior art is a truncation of the high frequency DCT coefficients.
      <br/>
      However, truncation of high frequency DCT coefficients does not result in a smooth filter and has drawbacks such as "ringing" near edges in the decoded picture.
      <br/>
      The DCT domain low-pass filter of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention is derived from a block mirror filter in the spatial domain.
      <br/>
      The filter coefficient values for the block mirror filter are, for example, optimized by numerical analysis in the spatial domain, and these values are then converted into coefficients of the DCT domain filter.
    </p>
    <p num="70">Although the exemplary embodiment shows DCT domain filtering in only the horizontal direction, DCT domain filtering can be done in either horizontal or vertical direction or both by combining horizontal and vertical filters.</p>
    <p num="71">Derivation of the DCT Domain Filter Coefficients</p>
    <p num="72">One exemplary DCT filter as employed with the present invention is derived from two constraints: first, that the filter process image data on a block by block basis for each block of the image without using information from previous blocks of a picture; and second, that the filter reduce the visibility of block boundaries which occur when the filter processes boundary pixel values.</p>
    <p num="73">
      According to the first constraint, in the DCT based compression of an MPEG image sequence, for example, N X N DCT coefficients yield N X N spatial pixel values.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the exemplary embodiment of the present invention implements a DCT domain filter which only processes a current block of the received picture.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      According to the second constraint, if the filter is simply applied to a block of spatial frequency coefficients, there is a transition of the filtering operation at the block boundary which is caused by an insufficient number spatial pixel values beyond the boundary to fill the residual of the filter.
      <br/>
      That is to say, coefficient values at the edge of a block cannot be properly filtered because the N-tap filter has values for only N/2 taps, the remaining values are beyond the boundary of the block.
      <br/>
      Several methods of supplying the missing pixel values exist: 1) repeat a predetermined constant pixel value beyond a boundary; 2) repeat the same pixel value as the boundary pixel value; and 3) mirror the pixel values of the block to simulate previous and subsequent blocks of pixel values adjacent to the processed block.
      <br/>
      Without prior information on the contents of the previous or subsequent block, the mirroring method of repeating pixel values is considered as a preferred method.
      <br/>
      Therefore, one embodiment of the present invention employs this mirroring method for the filter and is termed a "block mirror filter."

      The following describes an exemplary embodiment which implements a horizontal block mirror filter that low-pass filters 8 input spatial pixel sample values of a block.
      <br/>
      If the size of input block is an 8 * 8 block matrix of pixel sample values, then a horizontal filtering can be done by applying the block mirror filter to each row of 8 pixel sample values.
      <br/>
      It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the filtering process can be implemented by applying the filter coefficients columnwise to the block matrix, or that multidimensional filtering may be accomplished by filtering the rows and then filtering the columns of the block matrix.

      Therefore, X'(k), the DFT of x'(n), can be weighed with a real number H'(k) in the DFT frequency-domain instead of 2N multiplication and 2N addition operations in the spatial domain to implement the filtering operation.

      The values of X'(k) are very closely related to the DCT coefficients of the original N-point x(n), because an N-point DCT of x(n) is obtained by the 2N-point DFT of x'(n) which is the joint sequence composed of x(n) and its minor, x(2N-1-n).

      <br/>
      As is known in the digital signal processing art, such processing can be extended to two-dimensional systems.
      <br/>
      Equation (12) illustrates the IDCT for the one-dimensional case, consequently, equation (12') gives the more general two dimensional IDCT:  (Equation image '10' not included in text)   (Equation image '11' not included in text)

    <p num="103">
      where f(x,y) is the spatial domain representation, x and y are spatial coordinates in the sample domain, and u,v are the coordinates in the transform domain.
      <br/>
      Since the coefficients C(u), C(v) are known, as are the values of the cosine terms, only the transform domain coefficients need to be provided for the processing algorithms.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      For a two-dimensional system, the input sequence is now represented as a matrix of values, each representing the respective coordinate in the transform domain, and the matrix may be shown to have sequences periodic in the column sequence with period M, and periodic in the row sequence with period N, N and M being integers.
      <br/>
      A two-dimensional DCT can be implemented as a one dimensional DCT performed on the columns of the input sequence, and then a second one dimensional DCT performed on the rows of the DCT processed input sequence.
      <br/>
      Also, as is known in the art, a two-dimensional IDCT can be implemented as a single process.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      FIG. 6 shows an exemplary implementation of the filter for down-conversion for a two-dimensional system processing the horizontal and vertical components implemented as cascaded one-dimensional IDCTs.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 6, the DCT filter Mask 216 and IDCT 218 of FIG. 2 may be implemented by a Vertical processor 510, containing a Vertical DCT filter 530 and a Vertical IDCT 540, and a Horizontal processor 520, containing a horizontal DCT filter and horizontal IDCT which are the same as those implemented for the vertical components.
      <br/>
      Since the filtering and IDCT processes are linear, the order of implementing these processes can be rearranged (e.g, horizontal and vertical DCT filtering first and horizontal and vertical IDCTs second, or vise-versa, or Vertical processor 520 first and Horizontal processor 510 (second)).
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      In the particular implementation shown in FIG. 6, the Vertical processor 510 is followed by a block Transpose Operator 550, which switches the rows and columns of the block of vertical processed values provided by the Vertical processor.
      <br/>
      This operation may be used to increase the efficiency of computation by preparing the block for processing by the Horizontal processor 520.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      The encoded video block, for example an 8 * 8 block of matrix values, is received by the Vertical DCT filter 530, which weights each row entry of the block by the DCT filter values corresponding to the desired vertical decimation.
      <br/>
      Next, the Vertical IDCT 540 performs the inverse DCT for the vertical components of the block.
      <br/>
      As described previously, since both processes simply perform a matrix multiplication and addition, the DCT LPF coefficients can be combined with the vertical DCT coefficients for matrix multiplications and addition operations.
      <br/>
      The Vertical processor 510 then provides the vertically processed blocks to the Transpose Operator 550, which provides the transposed block of vertically processed values to the Horizontal processor 520.
      <br/>
      The Transpose Operator 550 is not necessary unless the IDCT operation is only done by row or by column.
      <br/>
      The Horizontal processor 520 performs the weighting of each column entry of the block by the DCT filter values corresponding to the desired horizontal filtering, and then performs the inverse DCT for the horizontal components of the block.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      As described with reference to equation (12'), only coefficients in the transform domain are provided to the processing algorithms; and the operations are linear which allows mathematical operations on these coefficients only.
      <br/>
      The operations for the IDCT, as is readily apparent from equation (12'), form a sum of products.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a hardware implementation requires known coefficients to be stored in memory, such as a ROM (not shown), and a group of multiply and add circuits (not shown) which receives these coefficients from the ROM as well as selected coefficients from the matrix of input transform coordinates.
      <br/>
      For more advanced systems, a ROM-accumulator method may be used if the order of mathematical operations is modified according to distributed arithmetic to convert from a sum of products implementation to a bit-serial implementation.
      <br/>
      Such techniques are described in, for example, Stanley A. White, Applications of Distributed Arithmetic to Digital Signal processing: A Tutorial Review, IEEE ASSP Magazine, July, 1989, which take advantage of symmetries in the computations to reduce a total gate count of the sum of products implementation.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the DCT filter operation may be combined with the inverse DCT (IDCT) operation.
      <br/>
      For such an embodiment, since the filtering and inverse transform operations are linear, the filter coefficients may be combined with the coefficients of the IDCT to form a modified IDCT.
      <br/>
      As is known in the art, the modified IDCT, and hence the combined IDCT and DCT downconversion filtering, may be performed through a hardware implementation similar to that of the simple IDCT operation.
