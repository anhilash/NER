      In evaporation of an organic hard tissue, a damage of a light emitting face of an optical fiber composing a laser probe is suppressed.
      <br/>
      A laser light source 13 outputs pulsate laser light of a wavelength of 1.0 mum to 5.5 mum and an output energy of 1 mJ to 2,500 mJ.
      <br/>
      The laser light is guided to a contact type handpiece 15 via a waveguide 14.
      <br/>
      The operator makes a light emitting face 17 of an optical fiber 9 of a probe 16 which is detachably attached to the tip end of the handpiece 15 contact with the surface of an organic hard tissue.
      <br/>
      In the optical fiber 9, an intermediate layer exists between a core 25 and a clad 26.
      <br/>
      The refractive index of the intermediate layer is smaller than that of the clad.
      <br/>
      In the refractive index distribution of the core 25, the refractive index is increased as moving from the center axis to the periphery.
      <br/>
      The laser light guided to the handpiece 15 passes through the optical fiber 9 of the probe 16 and is then emitted from a light emitting face 17.
      <br/>
      A diseased part is irradiated with the laser light, and an organic hard tissue of the portion is evaporated.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a laser probe which is to be attached to the tip end of a laser handpiece grasped by an operator, and which is made contact with a diseased part of an organic hard tissue such as a bone so as to irradiate the diseased part with laser light.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In laser treatment performed in various medical fields, a diseased part is irradiated with laser light in order to carry out vaporization, dissection, coagulation, or hemostatis of an organic soft tissue such as epithelium, musculus, or nervus, and vaporization of an organic hard tissue such as a bone or a tooth bud.
      <br/>
      For example, an Nd:YAG solid-state laser is used for the purpose of coagulation and hemostatis of the organic soft tissue.
      <br/>
      A laser light is condensed at the tip end of a conical laser probe made of quartz or sapphire, and the organic soft tissue is irradiated with the laser light to perform treatment such as vaporization, dissection, coagulation, or hemostatis.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      As a laser treatment apparatus for treatment of the organic hard tissue, a laser treatment apparatus using an Er:YAG solid-state laser of a wavelength of 2.94  MU m is known.
      <br/>
      In the apparatus, a laser probe comprising an optical fiber is detachably attached to the tip end of a handpiece, and laser light guided to the handpiece is emitted from the optical fiber of the laser probe.
      <br/>
      According to the apparatus, treatment is performed by irradiating a diseased part of the organic hard tissue with the laser light so as to vapor the diseased part of the organic hard tissue.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Generally, an optical fiber has a three-layer structure consisting of a core, a clad, and a jacket.
      <br/>
      The core which is at the center has a refractive index which is higher than that of the clad covering the core.
      <br/>
      The jacket covers the core and the clad so as to protect them.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the refractive index distribution in a radial direction of a section of the core, optical fibers are roughly classified into two kinds; a step index optical fiber in which the refractive index is uniform in the refractive index distribution along the direction; and a graded index optical fiber in which the refractive index is gradually reduced as moving from the center of the core to the clad along the direction.
      <br/>
      In the step index optical fiber, light is propagated with being totally reflected at the interface between the core and the clad.
      <br/>
      By contrast, in the graded index optical fiber, light is propagated while meandering in the core.
      <br/>
      A energy density in the irradiation plane of laser light emitted from the light emitting end of such the step index optical fiber is often distributed in accordance with a Gaussian distribution centered at the vicinity of an extension line of the center axis of the optical fiber.
      <br/>
      In other words, the energy density is higher in the vicinity of an extension of the center axis of the optical fiber, and lower in the vicinity of an extension of the interface between the core and the clad.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In a prior art laser probe used in the above-mentioned laser treatment apparatus for the organic hard tissue, such the step index optical fiber is mainly used.
      <br/>
      In the laser probe using such the step index optical fiber, when laser light in the form of continuous pulses is emitted for about 5 minutes, the light emitting face is damaged and peeled off, with the result that the vaporization efficiency of the organic hard tissue is lowered.
      <br/>
      Owing to such a damage or peeling off, the durability of the probe is very low.
      <br/>
      It is considered that this phenomenon takes place because of the following reason.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In such the laser treatment apparatus, laser light is guided from a laser light source to the body of the handpiece via a guide optical fiber of laser light guiding means, and then enters the optical fiber of the laser probe having a center optical axis which coincides with that of the guide optical fiber.
      <br/>
      In the guide optical fiber of the laser light guiding means, for example, the laser light is guided in such a manner that the energy level becomes higher as moving toward the center axis of the fiber.
      <br/>
      The optical fiber of the prior art laser probe to which laser light is guided from such the guide optical fiber has no function of changing the energy distribution of laser light so as to be uniform.
      <br/>
      When laser light enters as it is the optical fiber of the laser probe, therefore, the energy density of the laser light at the center of the core in the light emitting face of the optical fiber is larger than that in the periphery of the core.
      <br/>
      This causes the center of the core in the light emitting face to be peeled off or damaged, thereby impairing the durability of the probe.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In the above-described laser treatment apparatus for the organic hard tissue, when the apparatus is to be used for evaporating the organic hard tissue, a laser probe which uses the conventional step optical fiber is mainly used as described above, and the laser probe is attached to the tip end of the handpiece body.
      <br/>
      The laser probe is made contact with the organic hard tissue, and then the tissue is irradiated with laser light.
      <br/>
      At this time, organic components of the evaporated organic hard tissue, such as phosphorus, sulfur, and calcium are deposited on the light emitting face of the optical fiber of the laser probe.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      When such organic components are deposited on the light emitting face of the optical fiber of the laser probe, heat is generated by laser light absorbed by the deposition and the heat elevates the temperature of the light emitting face.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the deposition of such organic components causes the melting point of quartz glass (SiO2) which is a principal material of the core, to be lowered.
      <br/>
      As a result, the light emitting end of the optical fiber of the laser probe is melted at a temperature lower than the melting point of quartz glass, and the light emitting face of the laser probe is peeled off or damaged.
      <br/>
      This damage proceeds vigorously, particularly in the vicinity of the center axis of the core where the energy density is high.
      <br/>
      When the organic hard tissue is treated by using such a laser treatment apparatus as described above, furthermore, water is usually supplied in a mist form to a diseased part.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a thermal stress is produced in the light emitting face of the optical fiber of the laser probe, thereby causing the light emitting face to be further easily peeled off or damaged.
    </p>

      FIG. 17 is a section view showing an optical fiber 1 of a laser probe of the prior art, and more specifically a section view showing the state of the light emitting end of the optical fiber 1 obtained after the laser probe is attached to the above-mentioned laser treatment apparatus of the prior art and the organic hard tissue is continuously irradiated for 20 to 30 seconds with laser light pulses to be vapored.
      <br/>
      For the sake of convenience in description, a jacket is not illustrated.
      <br/>
      The optical fiber 1 comprises a core 4 and a clad 5.
      <br/>
      When the optical fiber 1 is attached to the laser treatment apparatus having the laser probe, and the organic hard tissue is irradiated with continuous pulses of laser light to be vapored, as shown in FIG. 17, for example, the core 4 is cut away after a lapse of 20 to 30 seconds, from the light emitting face 6 before the use and indicated by the two-dot chain line, and the current light emitting face 2 is retracted.
      <br/>
      When the core 4 is cut away in this manner, the light emitting face 2 has a concave shape or is not flat, so that laser light is scattered by the light emitting face 2, and a gap is formed between the light emitting face and a diseased part.
      <br/>
      As a result, the vaporization amount of the organic hard tissue per unit time is largely reduced and it is impossible to treat the diseased part.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      When continuous pulses are applied via the optical fiber 1 of the laser probe for 20 to 30 seconds so as to vapor the organic hard tissue, for example, the vaporization ability is lowered up to about one-third on average.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is difficult to continuously conduct vaporization while uniformly maintaining the vaporization efficiency.
      <br/>
      In order to maintain the vaporization ability in the laser treatment apparatus, the laser probe comprising the optical fiber 1 must be frequently replaced with a fresh one.

      An irradiation apparatus which converts laser light emitted from a laser generator so as to have a laser beam intensity with a Gaussian distribution, into laser light of uniform laser beam intensity, and transmits and applies the converted laser light is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication JP-A 2-297986 (1990).
      <br/>
      In the irradiation generator, a polygon prism is interposed between the laser device and a guide optical fiber through which laser light is transmitted.
      <br/>
      When laser light with a Gaussian distribution in both vertical and lateral directions passes through the polygon prism, for example, the intensity distribution of the laser light is uniformized.
      <br/>
      In the disclosed irradiation apparatus, the strength of laser light emitted from the laser device can be uniformized, but it is difficult to prevent nonuniformity in the laser intensity distribution due to different refractive indices in the optical fiber or the like from occurring in the light emitting end of the optical fiber of the laser probe.

      As another prior art technique there is known an ophthalmological laser treatment apparatus which irradiates a diseased part with laser light by means of a laser probe using an optical fiber.
      <br/>
      The laser treatment apparatus employs pulsate argon laser of a wavelength of 0.514  MU m in order to perform intraocular photocoagulation of a retina.
      <br/>
      When treatment is performed by laser irradiation from the apparatus, the face to be irradiated can be irradiated with laser light from the light emitting end of the optical fiber of the laser probe, with a uniform energy density.
      <br/>
      Therefore, excessive or insufficient coagulation hardly occurs.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In the laser treatment apparatus described above, the eye which is an object to be irradiated with laser light is an organic soft tissue.
      <br/>
      In laser light for intraocular photocoagulation, therefore, a peak value of a pulse (a height of the pulse) which indicates an irradiation energy level is low or about one-thousandth of that of laser light for vaporization of the organic hard tissue.
      <br/>
      When such low level laser light is emitted via a laser probe comprising the above-described optical fiber of the prior art, the light emitting face of the optical fiber of the laser probe is hardly affected by the laser light because the energy level of the laser light is low, and hence the light emitting face of the optical fiber is not damaged.
      <br/>
      By contrast, as described above, the durability of a laser probe for emitting high power level laser light which is used for vaporing the organic hard tissue is low because of a damage of the light emitting face of the optical fiber.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it has been requested to develop a laser probe for organic hard tissues in which the light emitting face of an optical fiber is not damaged and hence the durability is improved.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">It is an object of the invention to provide a laser probe for treating an organic hard tissue and having an optical fiber in which, even in the case of vaporization of the organic hard tissue, a damage of the light emitting face of the optical fiber is suppressed and hence the durability is improved.</p>
    <p num="17">The invention provides a laser probe for outputting from an output face of the laser probe, pulse laser light supplied from a laser light source through laser light guiding means and a handpiece, to irradiate an organic hard tissue,</p>
    <p num="18">the pulse laser light having a wavelength of 1.0  MU m to 5.5  MU m, an output energy of 1 mJ (millijoule) to 2,500 mJ, a pulse width of 1 nS (nanosecond) to 9 mS (milliseconds), and a pulse cycle of 1 pps (pulse per second) to 200 pps,</p>
    <p num="19">the laser probe being detachably attached to a tip end of the handpiece, and comprising an optical fiber including a core and a clad formed on an outer peripheral face of the core, the optical fiber having a refractive index distribution in which a refractive index of a center portion of the core is lower than a refractive index of a portion of the core surrounding the center portion.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The laser probe of the invention is used while being attached to a handpiece of, for example, a laser treatment apparatus which performs vaporization of the organic hard tissue.
      <br/>
      In the laser treatment apparatus, laser light generated in the laser light source is guided to the handpiece via the laser light guiding means.
      <br/>
      The laser probe comprises the optical fiber, and is attached to the tip end of the handpiece.
      <br/>
      The laser light guided to the handpiece enters the optical fiber of the laser probe to pass through the optical fiber, and is then applied from the light emitting end of the optical fiber to a diseased part of an organic hard tissue which is to be treated.
      <br/>
      When the organic hard tissue is irradiated with the laser light, water contained in the organic hard tissue is heated to be rapidly evaporated.
      <br/>
      At this time, organic hard tissue components constituting the organic hard tissue, such as phosphorus, calcium, and sulfur are evaporated together with water.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The evaporated organic hard tissue components are deposited on a light emitting face of the optical fiber from which laser light is emitted.
      <br/>
      When such hard tissue components are deposited on the light emitting face of the optical fiber, the light emitting face of the optical fiber is clouded and the emittance of laser light is impeded.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the deposition of the organic hard tissue components which are organic components causes the melting point of quartz glass (SiO2) constituting the core of the optical fiber, to be lowered.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      When laser light passes through a prior art optical fiber and is then emitted from a light emitting face of the optical fiber, for example, the output is caused by the refractive index of the optical fiber to have an energy density distribution with a Gaussian distribution in which the energy density is higher at the center portion of the optical fiber and lower in the periphery.
      <br/>
      In the light emitting face of the optical fiber, therefore, the center portion has a higher energy density so as to be more easily heated than the periphery.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the center portion of the light emitting face of the optical fiber on which the organic hard tissue components are deposited is damaged and peeled off to form a concave shape.
      <br/>
      As a result, the light emitting face of the optical fiber is not a uniform flat face, so that laser light is scattered, thereby lowering the evaporation ability.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The optical fiber disposed in the laser probe for treating the organic hard tissue according to the invention has a configuration in which the outer periphery of the core is covered by the clad.
      <br/>
      The core has a refractive index distribution in which the refractive index of the center portion is lower than that of a portion surrounding the center portion.
      <br/>
      When laser light enters such the optical fiber, laser light emitted from the optical fiber has an energy density distribution which is substantially uniform along a radial direction of the core.
      <br/>
      In the range corresponding to the whole face of the core, therefore, the energy density distribution of laser light which has passed through the optical fiber and is then emitted there from can be uniformized.
      <br/>
      In the light emitting face of the optical fiber of the laser probe, unlike an optical fiber of the prior art, the energy is not locally concentrated to the vicinity of the center axis.
      <br/>
      Also when organic hard tissue components are deposited on the light emitting face of the optical fiber, the whole of the light emitting face of the optical fiber generates heat so as to be damaged in a substantially uniform manner.
      <br/>
      In the case where an organic hard tissue is vapored by using the laser treatment apparatus, even when organic hard tissue components are deposited on the light emitting face of the optical fiber of the laser probe, therefore, the center portion of the light emitting face of the optical fiber is prevented from being damaged and peeled off to form a concave shape.
      <br/>
      Even when the light emitting face of the optical fiber is damaged, the damage is produced in a substantially uniform manner in the whole of the light emitting face of the optical fiber.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the reduction of the evaporation ability due to local heat generation in the light emitting face of the optical fiber of the laser probe is prevented from occurring.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In a laser treatment apparatus having a handpiece to which a laser probe comprising a prior art optical fiber is attached, since the damage or peeling off of the light emitting face of the optical fiber of the laser probe proceeds at high rate, the laser probe is worn away at high rate.
      <br/>
      In order to maintain a predetermined evaporation ability in the laser treatment apparatus using the laser probe, the laser probe must be frequently replaced with a fresh one.
      <br/>
      In a laser treatment apparatus to which the laser probe of the invention is attached, the concave damage hardly occurs in the light emitting face of the optical fiber of the laser probe.
      <br/>
      Depending on the level of the energy of laser light, such a damage never occurs in the light emitting face of the optical fiber.
      <br/>
      As a result, the damage rate of the laser probe is very lower than that in an apparatus of the prior art, and hence the replacement of the laser probe can be conducted at a reduced number.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In a laser treatment apparatus to which the laser probe is attached, even when the number of replacements of the laser probe attached to the laser treatment apparatus is reduced, therefore, the evaporation ability can be maintained.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the maintenance of the laser treatment apparatus can be easily conducted and the number of consumable parts can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      When the energy level of laser light is selected to be a level at which the organic hard tissue can be evaporated and the light emitting face of the optical fiber of the laser probe does not excessively generate heat, it is possible to substantially prevent the light emitting face of the optical fiber from being damaged.
      <br/>
      Such an energy level of laser light is higher than the energy level of laser light of a laser treatment apparatus of the prior art which is used for coagulation of an organic soft tissue such as an eye.
      <br/>
      Even when the laser probe of a laser treatment apparatus according to the invention is applied to laser light irradiation of such a high energy, the light emitting face of the optical fiber can be prevented from being peeled off or damaged.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In a prior art laser treatment apparatus for treating an organic soft tissue, the durability of a laser probe is not considered.
      <br/>
      In the laser probe of the invention, in order to prevent the light emitting face of the optical fiber from being peeled off or damaged, the energy distribution in the light emitting face of the optical fiber of the laser probe is substantially uniformized.
      <br/>
      Laser light from an argon laser which is used for treating an organic soft tissue has a wavelength of 0.514  MU m and a low energy level.
      <br/>
      Even when the organic hard tissue is irradiated with such laser light, therefore, it is absolutely impossible to evaporate the organic hard tissue.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the laser device to which the invention is directed is entirely different from that used in a laser treatment apparatus of the prior art in function and effect and also in the kind of emitted laser light.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In the laser treatment apparatus having the handpiece to which the laser probe of the invention is attached, laser light to be emitted has a wavelength of 1.0  MU m to 5.5  MU m and is suitable for vaporization of the organic hard tissue.
      <br/>
      The laser light has an output energy of 1 mJ to 2,500 mJ.
      <br/>
      At this energy level, laser light emitted from the laser light source which pulsatively outputs laser light having a pulse width of 1 nS to 9 mS and a pulse cycle of 1 pps to 200 pps can vapor the organic hard tissue, and hardly causes the light emitting face of the optical fiber to be peeled off or damaged.
      <br/>
      When laser light of such energy level is applied to a diseased part via the laser probe, occurrence of peeling of for damage of the light emitting face of the optical fiber can be made very low or perfectly eliminated.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the wear rate of the laser probe can be reduced to a very low level or zero.
    </p>
    <p num="29">The optical fiber in the invention is characterized in that:</p>
    <p num="30">the optical fiber includes an intermediate layer between the core and the clad, having a refractive index lower than a refractive index of the clad,</p>
    <p num="31">the refractive index of the clad is lower than the refractive index of the center portion of the core, and</p>
    <p num="32">the optical fiber has a refractive index distribution in which the refractive index is sharply changed at an interface between the core and the intermediate layer and an interface between the intermediate layer and the clad.</p>
    <p num="33">
      According to the invention, the optical fiber has a three-layer structure in which the intermediate layer exists between the core and the clad.
      <br/>
      The refractive index of the clad is lower than that of the center portion of the core, and the refractive index of the intermediate layer is lower than that of the clad.
      <br/>
      In the refractive index distribution of the whole of the optical fiber, the refractive index is sharply changed at the interface between the core and the intermediate layer and that between the intermediate layer and the clad.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      As described above, when laser light in a laser treatment apparatus for treatment of the organic hard tissue reaches the light emitting face of the laser probe, the laser light preferably has an energy density distribution which is uniform in a radial direction of a section of the core.
      <br/>
      When the intermediate layer is interposed between the core and the clad, the energy density of laser light which has passed through the core of the optical fiber is sharply changed at a position corresponding to the interface with respect to the intermediate layer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the energy is prevented from leaking into portions corresponding to the intermediate layer and the clad, so that the energy loss of laser light emitted from the light emitting face of the optical fiber is small.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the energy level of laser light entering the core of the optical fiber can be lowered by the degree corresponding to the reduction amount of the loss.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In the refractive index distribution of the whole of the optical fiber, in this way, the refractive index is gradually lowered in the sequence of the periphery of the core, the center portion of the core, the clad, and the intermediate layer.
      <br/>
      When the optical fiber is structured in this way, the energy density of laser light passing through the optical fiber is uniformly collected in the range corresponding to the core, thereby preventing the laser light from leaking from the intermediate layer to the outside.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the energy of laser light entering the core of the optical fiber can be concentrated into the range corresponding to the core, and hence the energy level of the entering laser light can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="36">The optical fiber in the invention is characterized in that the core is made of SiO2 to which GeO2 is added in a concentration distribution in which a GeO2 concentration of the peripheral portion of the core is lower than a GeO2 concentration of the center portion of the core,</p>
    <p num="37">the intermediate layer of the optical fiber is made of SiO2 to which fluorine is added, and</p>
    <p num="38">the clad of the optical fiber is made of single SiO2.</p>
    <p num="39">
      According to the invention, the optical fiber of the laser probe is made of SiO2 (quartz glass).
      <br/>
      The refractive index of SiO2 can be easily changed by addition of an additive.
      <br/>
      The additives which are to be added to the core, and the intermediate layer, and the clad are selected so as to establish the above-mentioned level relationships of refractive indices.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      For example, GeO2 which is an additive for increasing the refractive index is added to the core.
      <br/>
      Fluorine which is an additive for decreasing the refractive index is added to the intermediate layer.
      <br/>
      The clad remains to be made of single SiO2.
      <br/>
      As a result, the refractive index is gradually lowered in the sequence of the core, the clad, and the intermediate layer.
      <br/>
      The additive concentration distribution in the core is formed in such a manner that the concentration of the peripheral portion is lower than that of the center portion.
      <br/>
      When the additive concentration is changed in accordance with the distance from the center axis, the refractive index can be continuously changed in the core.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The above-mentioned additives are used also in optical fibers which are currently usually used, and hence can be easily obtained.
      <br/>
      As described above, the optical fiber of the laser probe of the invention is made of SiO2 in which the refractive index is controlled by adding additives that are conventionally used, and hence can be easily realized.
      <br/>
      When the laser probe comprising the optical fiber realized by such materials is attached to the handpiece of the laser treatment apparatus and then used for evaporation of an organic hard tissue, the peeling off or damage of the light emitting face of the optical fiber can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="42">The optical fiber in the invention is characterized in that the core of the optical fiber has a diameter of 0.2 mm to 3.0 mm and the laser light has a wavelength of 2.7  MU m to 3.2  MU m.</p>
    <p num="43">
      According to the invention, since the above-mentioned wavelength range of laser light is included in the range in the vicinity of the maximum value of the light absorption wavelength range of water, laser light satisfying the conditions is particularly suitable for evaporation of an organic hard tissue.
      <br/>
      When laser light of a wavelength in the range is used, the evaporation efficiency is improved and an organic hard tissue can be rapidly evaporated.
      <br/>
      Therefore, treatment can be efficiently performed.
      <br/>
      Since the diameter of the core of the optical fiber is small, a diseased part of a small diameter or a small area can be easily irradiated with laser light.
      <br/>
      When such laser light enters the core of the optical fiber of the above-mentioned configuration, occurrence of peeling off or damage of the light emitting face of the optical fiber can be made very low or perfectly eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="44">The optical fiber in the invention is characterized in that a concave portion is formed in a center of the core of the light emitting face.</p>
    <p num="45">
      According to the invention, in the light emitting face of the optical fiber, the center portion of the core is formed into a concave shape.
      <br/>
      When the laser probe comprising the optical fiber of such a shape is attached to the handpiece of the laser treatment apparatus and then used for evaporation of an organic hard tissue, laser light is regularly scattered to a radially outside portion by the light emitting face of the optical fiber, so that laser light is emitted in a wider range.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the organic hard tissue can be evaporated with a substantially uniform depth.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Therefore, laser light is scattered in the light emitting end portion and the organic hard tissue of a wider range can be evaporated.
      <br/>
      As a result, a range which is irradiated with laser light can be uniformly evaporated.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="48">Now referring to the drawings, preferred embodiments of the invention are described below.</p>
    <p num="49">
      FIG. 1A is a block diagram showing the configuration of a laser treatment apparatus 11 which is a first embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      The laser treatment apparatus 11 is used for evaporation, dissection, or hemostatis of an organic hard tissue such as a bone.
      <br/>
      The laser treatment apparatus 11 comprises a laser light source 13, a waveguide 14, and a handpiece 15.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Laser light generated in the laser light source 13 is guided to the handpiece 15 via the waveguide 14.
      <br/>
      A laser probe 16 is detachably attached to the tip end of the handpiece 15.
      <br/>
      Namely, the handpiece 15 consists of a handpiece body 10 and the laser probe 16, and the laser probe 16 is mounted on the handpiece body 10.
      <br/>
      The operator of the laser treatment apparatus (hereinafter, often referred to as merely as "treatment apparatus") 11 makes a light emitting face 17 of the laser probe (hereinafter, often referred to as merely as "probe") 16 attached to the handpiece 15 contact with a diseased part which is to be irradiated with laser light.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The laser light which is guided to the handpiece 15 passes through the laser probe 16 to be emitted from the light emitting face 17, and then impinges on the diseased part.
      <br/>
      Preferably, water is supplied in a mist form to the surface of the diseased part so that a thin film of water is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      FIG. 1B is a partial section view showing the configuration of an optical fiber 9 of the probe 16, and partially cut away in a virtual plane including the axis.
      <br/>
      The probe 16 is formed by the optical fiber 9.
      <br/>
      The optical fiber 9 of the probe 16 is a column-like member in which the section of a light incident face 19 is congruent with that of the light emitting face 17 of the optical fiber 9 that functions as the light emitting face of the probe 16.
      <br/>
      A center axis 20 of the light incident face 19 of the optical fiber 9 coincides a center axis 18 of the light emitting face 17 of the optical fiber 9.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The organic hard tissue contains a large amount of water.
      <br/>
      When such an organic hard tissue is irradiated with laser light of a wavelength of 1.0  MU m to 5.5  MU m, the laser light is instantaneously absorbed by the water.
      <br/>
      The absorbed light energy is converted into thermal oscillation of water molecules, and elevates the temperature of the water, with the result that the water is instantaneously evaporated.
      <br/>
      This causes the water of the organic hard tissue to be lost, and the organic hard tissue is decomposed and evaporated, with the result that a hole is opened in the organic hard tissue.
      <br/>
      Through this process, the organic hard tissue is evaporated.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The laser light source 13 outputs pulses of laser light with a predetermined pulse width and a predetermined pulse cycle.
      <br/>
      For example, the predetermined pulse width of the laser light is 1 nS to 9 ms, and the predetermined pulse cycle of the laser light is 1 pps to 200 pps (pulses per second).
      <br/>
      The allowable range of the wavelength of the laser light generated by the laser light source 13 is 1.0  MU m to 5.5  MU , and the allowable level of emission energy per pulse of laser light output from the light emitting face 17 of the probe 16 is 1 mJ to 2,500 mJ.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      In the case of normal pulses, the pulse width may be in the range of 20  MU S to 30  MU S to 9 mS.
      <br/>
      When modulation is conducted by an AOQ switch (Acousto-Optical Q-switch), the pulse width may be shortened to 20 nS to 30 nS, and, when modulation is conducted by an EOQ switch (Electro-Optical Q-switch), the pulse width may be shortened to 1 nS.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      As described above, in the laser treatment apparatus 11, the pulse width of the laser light which is to be applied to the diseased part is selected from the range of 1 nS to 9 mS.
      <br/>
      When the diseased part is irradiated with pulsate laser light of a pulse width shorter than 1 nS, for example, the height (peak value) of the pulse must be increased in order to irradiate the diseased part with light of the same energy by one pulse.
      <br/>
      In this case, the vaporization depth due to one pulse becomes larger, with the result that the diseased part may be evaporated with a depth which is larger than a desired one.
      <br/>
      When the peak value is higher, the thermal shock caused in the light emitting face 17 of the optical fiber 9 becomes larger.

      FIG. 2 is a graph showing a relationship between the wavelength of light and the extinction length.

      The range of an organic hard tissue containing water in the inward direction into which laser light of a wavelength in an allowable wavelength range of 1.0  MU m to 5.5  MU m penetrates is shallower than that into which laser light of a wavelength outside the range penetrates.

      The organic hard tissue 21 to be vapored which is used in this experiment is a cattle bone.

      The continuous irradiation time of laser light is converted from the number of pulses of laser light applied to the organic hard tissue 21 after the start of irradiation.

      Therefore, the laser light irradiation position on the organic hard tissue 21 is changed each time when one pulse of laser light is applied, and a new portion of the organic hard tissue 21 is vapored and cut away each time when one pulse of laser light is applied, whereby a vapored portion is formed.

      When the probe 16 of the invention is used as the probe of the laser treatment apparatus 11, therefore, the reduction of the vaporization ability can be suppressed and the number of replacements of the probe can be reduced as compared with the case where the prior art probe is used in place of the probe 16.

      When the diseased part is in a portion where it is difficult to freely move the handpiece 15, for example, it may be difficult to make the direction of the laser light irradiation coincident with the normal direction of the surface of the diseased part.
      <br/>
      In this case, when the handpiece 15 to which the probe comprising the optical fiber 81 of the present embodiment is attached is used, the laser light irradiation direction 86a is deviated by an angle  THETA  from the center axis 84 of the light incident face 83 which coincides with that of the handpiece 15, and hence laser light irradiation can be easily conducted in the normal direction of the surface of the diseased part.
      <br/>
      The handpiece 15 to which the probe comprising the optical fiber 81 is attached is preferably used for irradiating a diseased part in a portion which is difficult to see or is in a small body cavity, with laser light.
