    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to a spray cooled system for the side wall and tap hole cover of an eccentric bottom tap (EBT) electric furnace, e.g. an electric arc furnace having a generally circular hearth portion, below one or more electrodes, in which steel scrap is melted, and an adjacent eccentrically configured relatively shallow portion which has a valved, bottom tap-hole through which molten steel can exit the furnace upon opening of the valve and tilting of the furnace.</p>
    <p num="2">
      The most common configuration of an EBT furnace comprises a main, "tall" section, which is spray or water-cooled, and positioned above the circular portion of the fiurnace and, an adjacent lower EBT (eccentric) extension that includes the "sand hole" through which sand is poured to cover and protect the tap hole valve of the fuxnace.
      <br/>
      The "tall" section is provided with a removable, circular water-cooled or spray cooled roof and scrap metal is charged to the furnace and melted beneath the roof.
      <br/>
      Upon completion of melting the entire furnace is tilted toward the eccentric (tap) portion with the tap valve is open to allow molten steel to be discharged from the furnace into a ladle positioned below the furnace.
      <br/>
      When tapping is completed, the taphole valve is closed and the furnace is leveled.
      <br/>
      Sand is then poured through the sand hole in the cover and into the tap-hole in the refractory hearth below to protect the underlying tap-hole valve.
      <br/>
      The furnace is then ready for melting and tapping the next charge.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The cover for the EBT (eccentric) portion is customarily a pressurized water-cooled panel or a separate spray cooled panel.
      <br/>
      The water-cooled panel is usually flat and horizontal and includes a sand hole.
      <br/>
      The separate spray cooled panel is a combination of a sloping plate and a conical portion which allows effective flow of water onto and off the plate.
      <br/>
      The spray-cooled panel also contains a sand hole and has a spray cooled chamber.
      <br/>
      In use, the separate spray cooled panel is bolted to the "tall" spray cooled section with each section having it's own coolant supply and independent drains for spent coolant.
      <br/>
      This type of spray cooled configuration is subject to fume and flame discharge at the joint between the main "tall" section and the EBT cover, and spent coolant can not equalize between the sections.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Another prior commercial arrangement included an egg-shaped roof which covered both the circular and EBT portions of the furnace which resulted in a single, very heavy "tall" section with the sand-hole located in the roof, high above the tap-hole which complicates filling of the tap-hole.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      In accordance with the present invention, a spray cooled, hollow side wall is provided for the circular portion of an EBT furnace and a hollow EBT cover portion is integrally attached to the side wall, e.g. by welding to provide a unitary, i.e. one piece side-wall and tap-hole cover.
      <br/>
      The EBT cover portion is attached at a lateral mid-section of the side-wall and is vertically extending but to a much lesser extent than the side-wall, e.g. about 1/4 to 1/3 the height of the side wall.
      <br/>
      The EBT cover portion is hollow and has an upper cover and a lower arched plate; the lower arched plate is spray cooled by nozzles within the EBT cover.
      <br/>
      The nozzles receive coolant, e.g. water, from a conduit which is connected to the water conduit in the spray cooled side-wall, and spent coolant can drain from the EBT cover to the side-wall, and, when the furnace is tilted, from the side-wall to the EBT cover.
      <br/>
      The lower plate of the EBT cover is shaped to conformally contact the inner spray cooled wall of the side-wall and this conformal contact is shielded by a metal strip which is welded to the inner wall of the side-wall and the lower plate and the weld area and metal strip are easily cooled by coolant from nozzles in the EBT cover.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      With reference to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the integral side wall and tap-hole cover of the present invention is indicated at 10 having a vertical circular hollow side wall 20 overlying the circular hearth 42 of furnace 41 Hollow side wall 20 comprises outer metal covering member 22, inner metal base member 24 and upper and lower metal flanges 26, 28, which join the metal covering member 22 and inner metal base member 24 and close the enclosed space 30 within side wall 20.
      <br/>
      Coolant header 32 is positioned in the uppermost portion of chamber 30 and extends peripherally along outer metal covering member 22.
      <br/>
      Coolant, e.g. water, is provided to coolant supply header 32 at coolant supply inlet 34 and coolant flows downwardly to vertical spray bars 36 which are located peripherally in enclosed space 30.
      <br/>
      Nozzles 38 spray droplets of water onto the surface of inner metal base member 24 in an amount sufficient to maintain an acceptable temperature in the inner metal base member 24 which is exposed to heat generated by electrode 40 in the course of arc melting scrap (not shown) in the hearth 42 shown FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      A spray cooled furnace roof 39, of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,715,042-Heggart et al, can be provided as indicated schematically in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Spent coolant from nozzles 38 descends to channel 44 at the lowermost portion of chamber 30 and exits at openings 46 in outer metal covering member 22.
      <br/>
      The integral tap-hole cover 50 of the present invention, with further reference to FIGS. 4, 5, 6 and 7, comprises an upper metal cover member 52, having a horizontal portion 51, an upwardly slanting portion 53, vertical sides 56, 58, and vertical front portion 59.
      <br/>
      The tap hole cover 50 is welded to upper cover flange 26 side wall 20 at locations indicated at 54.
      <br/>
      With additional reference to FIGS. 3, 3(A) and FIGS. 5 and 6, the vertical sides 56, 58 and front portion 59 of upper metal cover member, 52 are welded at 60 to arched lower metal panel 62 to form EBT cover member drain 63 which communicates with enclosed space 30 of side wall 20 as indicated at 33 in FIG. 1 and FIGS. 4, 4(A) and 4(B).
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 4, 4(A), lower metal plate 62 is affixed to the inner metal base member 24 by means of weld 29 and weld 31 at metal strip 64.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 9 and 10, metal strip 64, suitably steel; is shaped to cover the conformal contact 37 between cover plate 62 of tap hole cover 50 and inner metal base member 24 of side wall 20 which extends tangentially and convergingly from tangent points 90, 92 on metal base member 24.
      <br/>
      Metal strip 64 is suitably chamferred or beveled at its outer surface 65 and has sufficient mass to act as a heat-sink and protect the contacting edges of lower plate 62 and metal base member 24 at 37 from excessive heating due to the arc melting of scrap in hearth 42 of furnace 41 (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      Metal strip 64 is welded at its back surface 67 to metal base member 64 and at its lower surface 71 to lower metal plate 62.
      <br/>
      In addition to acting as a heat sink, metal strip 64 acts as a seal to prevent the escape of furnace fumes and flame at conformal contact region 37.
      <br/>
      Metal strip 64 provides a dust and flame preventing peripheral seal at metal base member 24 and lower metal plate 62.
      <br/>
      With referance to FIGS. 1, 2 and 8, the joining of lower metal plate 62 to cover member 52 provides a hollow chamber 70 within tap-hole cover 50 which contains coolant conduit means 74 connected to coolant supply header 32 of side wall 20.
      <br/>
      Horizontally disposed spray bars 71 receive coolant from coolant conduit means 72 which is sprayed in droplets from nozzles 73 onto lower metal plate 62 and metal strip 64 as shown in FIG. 4 and FIG. 8 and also from nozzles 36 at 85 and 87.
      <br/>
      Spent coolant descends to drain 63 of tap-hole cover 50 and can exit drain openings 66 and also drain openings 46 of side-wall 20.
      <br/>
      A sand hole, i.e 72 is provided between the horizontal portion 51 of upper cover member 52 and lower metal plate 62 and is located generally over and relatively close to tap-hole 75 in hearth 77.
      <br/>
      The sand 99 in tap-hole 75 protects tap-hole valve 80.
      <br/>
      Inspection covers 90 and hatches 95 can be readily provided for ease of inspection and relocation.
      <br/>
      Lifting lugs 100, shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 are provided and the unitary side wall and cover can be lifted in one piece.
