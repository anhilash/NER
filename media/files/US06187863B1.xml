    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Polysiloxane polyols are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Japanese Patent Publication 48-19941 describes polysiloxane polyols which are obtained by the dehydrogenation reaction between a polysiloxane hydride and an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol or polyoxyalkylene alcohol to introduce the alcoholic hydroxy groups onto the polysiloxane backbone.
      <br/>
      In practice, however, it is difficult to obtain an industrially significant yield of such polysiloxane polyols because such a hydrosilylation reaction readily gels.
      <br/>
      Another problem encountered with this hydrosilylation reaction is the difficulty in obtaining a solvent capable of dissolving both reactants.
      <br/>
      Strongly hydrophilic alcohols such as polyglycerols are highly soluble in alcohols and water, but insoluble in hydrocarbon solvents.
      <br/>
      Polysiloxanes, however, are generally only soluble in hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene or n-hexane.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,431,789 to Okazaki et al. discloses a polysiloxane polyol which is obtained by the hydrosilylation reaction between a polysiloxane containing silicon hydride and a polyglycerol compound having an aliphatically unsaturated linkage in the molecule.
      <br/>
      Examples of such polyglycerol compounds are those obtained by the reaction of allyl alcohol and glycidol or by the reaction of diglycerin and allyl glycidyl ether.
      <br/>
      This reaction, a so-called hydrosilylation reaction, is the addition reaction between an organosilicon compound having a hydrogen atom directly bonded to the silicon atom, i.e., a polysiloxane hydride, and an organic compound having aliphatic unsaturation in the molecule carried out in the presence of a catalytic amount of a Group VIII noble metal.
      <br/>
      The hydrosilylation reaction can proceed readily in the presence of an alcoholic solvent which can dissolve both reactants.
      <br/>
      The resulting polysiloxane polyols are useful as non-ionic surface active agents.
      <br/>
      However, the polysiloxane polyols have limited compatibility with organic resins and solvents which restricts their use in solvent-borne coatings.
    </p>
    <p num="4">U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,469 discloses butoxylated polysiloxane polyols which are disclosed as being useful in cosmetics. U.S. Pat. No. 5,248,789 discloses epoxy functional polysiloxanes which are formed by reacting a polysiloxane-containing silicon hydride with allyl glycidyl ether.</p>
    <p num="5">
      The prior art references do not teach further reacting the hydroxyl groups of the polysiloxane polyols with other groups to provide various reactive functional groups pendant from the polysiloxane backbone.
      <br/>
      Such reactive functional groups allow incorporation of the polysiloxane moiety into curable compositions which can contain a variety of reactive components, including a variety of curing agents.
      <br/>
      There is no indication in the references of using either the polysiloxane polyols or their derivatives as major components in curable compositions.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      Generally, the curable composition of the present invention comprises:
      <br/>
      (a) an organic polysiloxane containing reactive functional groups, the polysiloxane having the formula (II) or (III), where m, m', n, R, Ra and X are as described above; and
      <br/>
      (b) a curing agent which contains functional groups reactive with the functional groups of (a).
    </p>
    <p num="13">It should be appreciated that the various R groups can be the same or different, and it is usually the case that the R groups will be mixed groups or entirely monovalent hydrocarbon groups.</p>
    <p num="14">
      By monovalent hydrocarbon groups is meant organic groups containing essentially carbon and hydrogen.
      <br/>
      The hydrocarbon groups may be aliphatic, aromatic, cyclic or acyclic and may contain from 1 to 24 (in the case of aromatic from 3 to 24) carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the hydrocarbon groups may be substituted with heteroatoms, typically oxygen.
      <br/>
      Examples of such monovalent hydrocarbon groups are alkyl, alkoxy, aryl, alkaryl or alkoxyaryl groups.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      By alkylene is meant acyclic or cyclic alkylene groups having a carbon chain length of from C2 to C25.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable alkylene groups are those derived from propene, butene, pentene, 1-decene, isoprene, myrcene and 1-heneicosene.
      <br/>
      By oxyalkylene is meant an alkylene group containing at least one ether oxygen atom and having a carbon chain length of from C2 to C25, preferably of from C2 to C4.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable oxyalkylene groups are those associated with trimethylolpropane monoallylether, pentaerythritol monoallylether, trimethylolpropane diallylether, polyethoxylated allyl alcohol and polypropoxylated allyl alcohol.
      <br/>
      By alkylene aryl is meant an acyclic alkylene group containing at least one aryl group, preferably phenyl, and having an alkylene carbon chain length of from C2 to C25.
      <br/>
      The aryl group may optionally be substituted.
      <br/>
      Suitable substituent groups may include hydroxyl, benzyl, carboxylic acid and aliphatic groups.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable alkylene aryl groups include styrene and 3-isopropenyl- ALPHA ,  ALPHA -dimethylbenzyl isocyanate.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Formulae (II) and (III) are diagrammatic, and it is not intended to imply that the parenthetical portions are necessarily blocks, although blocks may be used where desired.
      <br/>
      In many cases the compound is more or less random, especially when more than a few siloxane units are employed and when mixtures are used.
      <br/>
      In those instances where more than a few siloxane units are used and it is desired to form blocks, oligomers are first formed and then these are joined to form the block compound.
      <br/>
      By judicious choice of reactants, compounds having an alternating structure or blocks of alternating structure may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Preferably, the curable composition comprises:
      <br/>
      (a) an organic polysiloxane containing reactive functional groups, the polysiloxane having the formula (II) or (III), where m, m', n, R, Ra and X are as described above;
      <br/>
      (b) a polymer which contains reactive functional groups; and
      <br/>
      (c) a curing agent containing functional groups which are reactive with the functional groups of (a) and (b).
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment n+m and n+m' is 2 or 3.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      It should be mentioned that when both (a) and (b) are present, the reactive functional groups of (a) and (b) can be the same or different, but both must be reactive with the functional groups of the curing agent.
      <br/>
      Examples of such reactive functional groups include OH, COOH, NCO, carboxylate, primary amine, secondary amine, amide, carbamate and epoxy functional groups.

      The coating composition of the invention can be applied to the substrate by any conventional method such as brushing, dipping, flow coating, roll coating, conventional spraying and electrostatic spraying.

      Typically, they are most often applied by spraying.
      <br/>
      Usual spray techniques and equipment for air spraying and electrostatic spraying and either manual or automatic methods can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="66">The compositions can be applied by conventional methods over a wide variety of primed and unprimed substrates such as wood, metal, glass, cloth, leather, plastics, foams and the like; however, they are particularly useful over metal substrates.</p>
    <p num="67">
      The ambient temperature curable compositions such as those using polyisocyanate or polyanhydride curing agent can be cured at elevated temperatures to hasten the cure.
      <br/>
      An example would be forced air curing in a down draft booth at about 40 (degree)  to 60 (degree)  C. which is common in the automotive refinish industry.
      <br/>
      The ambient temperature curable compositions are usually prepared as a two (2) package system in which the curing agent is kept separate from the polysiloxane containing the reactive functional group.
      <br/>
      The packages are combined shortly before application.

      <br/>
      Dwell time (i.e., time that the coated substrate is exposed to elevated temperature for curing) is dependent upon the cure temperature used as well as wet film thickness of the applied coating composition.
      <br/>
      For example, coated automotive elastomeric parts require a long dwell time at a lower cure temperature (e.g., 30 minutes/250 (degree)  F. (121 (degree)  C.)), while coated aluminum beverage containers require a very short dwell time at a very high cure temperature (e.g., 1 minute/375 (degree)  F. (191 (degree)  C.)).

      The compositions of the invention in the pigmented form can be applied directly to a substrate to form a color coat.
      <br/>
      The color coat may be in the form of a primer for subsequent application of a top coat or may be a colored top coat.
      <br/>
      Alternately, the coating composition of the invention can be unpigmented, in the form of a clear coat for application over a color coat (either a primer coat or a colored top coat).
      <br/>
      When used as a primer coating, thicknesses of 0.4 to 4.0 mils are typical.
      <br/>
      When used as a color top coat, coating thicknesses of about 0.5 to 4.0 mils are usual, and when used as a clear coat, coating thicknesses of about 1.5 to 4.0 mils are generally used.

      In applying composite coatings using the coating composition of the present invention, the initially applied coating can be cured prior to the application of the second coat.

      To a suitable reaction vessel equipped with a means for maintaining a nitrogen blanket, Charge I and an amount of potassium acetate equivalent to 50 ppm of total monomer solids were added at ambient conditions and the temperature was gradually increased to 80 (degree)  C. under a nitrogen blanket.
      <br/>
      At that temperature, about 10% of Charge II was added under agitation, followed by the addition of Charge III, equivalent to 2.5 ppm of active platinum based on total monomer solids.
      <br/>
      The reaction was then allowed to exotherm to 85 (degree)  C. at which time the remainder of Charge II was added at a rate such that the temperature did not exceed 85.5 (degree)  C. After completion of this addition, a second charge of chloroplatinic acid equivalent to 2.5 ppm of active platinum based on total monomer solids was added and a minor additional exotherm to about 92 (degree)  C. was observed.
      <br/>
      The reaction temperature was maintained at 85 (degree)  C. for eight hours and monitored by silver nitrate testing for the disappearance of Si--H.

      An acrylic basecoat, commercially available as DELTRON.RTM. Universal Basecoat from PPG Industries, Inc., was spray applied to primed panels using conventional spray equipment and allowed to flash at ambient conditions for 20 minutes.

      To evaluate pot-life of the two-component clearcoats, Brookfield viscosities, reported in centistokes per second (cps), were measured using a -3 spindle at 60 revolutions per minute, immediately after the two components were co-blended and again after one hour.
      <br/>
      Tack time, that is the time from initial spray application to the test panel to the time at which the applied coating is no longer sticky or tacky to the touch, was measured for each of the clearcoat compositions of Example 7 and Comparative Example 8.
      <br/>
      The 20 degree gloss was measured after one week cure at ambient temperatures using a Glossgard Ia gloss meter from Pacific Scientific.

      Panels were tested for 20 degree gloss, pencil hardness, adhesion, gasoline resistance and mar resistance.
      <br/>
      The 20 degree gloss was measured as in Example 7; pencil hardness was measured in accordance with ASTM D3363-92a; adhesion was measured in accordance with ASTM D3359; gasoline resistance was determined as in Example 7.
      <br/>
      Mar resistance was determined by marring coated panels with a wool felt cloth moving across an abrasive powder which has been applied to the surface of the coating.
      <br/>
      Gloss measurements are made on marred and unmarred areas and the mar resistance is determined as percent retention of the original gloss.
      <br/>
      The basic apparatus for testing for mar resistance is an Atlas AATCC Mar Tester Model CM-5 available from Atlas Electrical Devices Company.
      <br/>
      The abrasive powder which is used is commercially available Bon-Ami brand (Feldspar/Calcite).
      <br/>
      The Bon-Ami cleanser is applied to approximately one-half of the coated panel.
      <br/>
      Excess cleanser is removed so only a thin film of cleanser remains on the panel.
      <br/>
      Using the mar tester, the cleanser-coated panel is rubbed with a wool cloth ten times (10 double rubs).
      <br/>
      After marring, the panel is washed with water to remove the cleanser, then the panel is dried with a paper cloth.
      <br/>
      The 20 degree gloss is measured in several places on both the marred and unmarred areas of the painted surface.
      <br/>
      The maximum and minimum gloss values are taken and the mar resistance is determined as follows:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
