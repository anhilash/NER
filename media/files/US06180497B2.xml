      To produce an SOI wafer, it is necessary to prepare a base member having a porous layer upon which a non porous layer is formed.
      <br/>
      To make the pore size distribution of a porous layer uniform, a surface comprising atom steps and terraces is formed on the surface of a silicon base material and made porous without eliminating the steps and terraces, and then a nonporous semiconductor single-crystal film is formed thereon.

    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a method of producing a semiconductor base member having a nonporous layer formed on a porous layer and a method of using this semiconductor base member to produce a semiconductor member such as an SOI wafer.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">In order to manufacture a light emitting element or an SOI wafer, it is necessary to prepare a semiconductor base member having a porous layer and a nonporous layer formed thereon.</p>
    <p num="5">An example of preparation of the semiconductor base member will be described with reference to FIGS. 9A to 9F.</p>
    <p num="6">As shown in FIG. 9A, a silicon base material 1 such as a CZ silicon wafer having a polished surface is prepared and at least its surface is made porous by anodization or the like.</p>
    <p num="7">After the inner wall surfaces of pores in a porous layer 2 are oxidized, the silicon base material is cleaned with a dilute hydrofluoric acid to remove an oxide film from the surface of the porous layer 2.</p>
    <p num="8">As shown in FIG. 9B, the porous layer 2 is subjected to a heat treatment in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere, and a silicon-containing gas is then introduced to epitaxially grow a nonporous layer 3.</p>
    <p num="9">As shown in FIG. 9C, the surface of the nonporous layer 3 is oxidized to form an insulating film 4.</p>
    <p num="10">As shown in FIG. 9D, a first member comprising a silicon base material 1 having the porous layer 2, the nonporous layer 3, and the insulating layer 4 is bonded to a second member 5 separately prepared to form a multilayer structure having the nonporous layer 3 inside.</p>
    <p num="11">
      As shown in FIG. 9E, the silicon base material 1 is removed.
      <br/>
      The method for removing the silicon base material 1 includes a method of eliminating the silicon base material 1 itself by grinding, polishing, or etching from the back surface and a method of cracking the inside of the porous layer 2 and/or its interface to separate and remove the silicon base material 1.
    </p>
    <p num="12">As shown in FIG. 9F, the porous layer 2 remaining on the surface of the second member 5 is removed to obtain an SOI wafer having the nonporous layer 3 formed on the second member 5 via the insulating layer 4.</p>
    <p num="13">
      The above method is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 5-21338 (Japanese Patent No. 2608351), U.S. Pat. No. 5,371,037, U.S. Pat. No. 5,856,229, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 9-102594, and Appl.

      Phys. Lett. 64, 1994, p. 2108, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="14">However, there is a demand for further improvement of the quality of the nonporous layer formed on the porous layer, in particular, surface smoothness and crystal defects.</p>
    <p num="15">For example, in the above method for producing an SOI wafer, when the surfaces to be bonded are not smooth, a void, that is, a non-bonded area which is observed by ultrasonic waves or infrared transmitted light is easily generated in bonding.</p>
    <p num="16">
      In addition, in producing a device such as an MOS transistor using the nonporous layer, metal impurities may be conventionally segregated into crystal-defect sites.
      <br/>
      When metal impurities are segregated into crystal-defect sites, the device characteristics is easily degraded.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">An object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a semiconductor base member which can improve the surface quality of a thin nonporous film formed on a porous layer to reduce the crystal defect density.</p>
    <p num="18">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a semiconductor base member which can make the pore size distribution of the porous layer uniform to efficiently seal the pores in the surface of the porous layer and at the same time improve the surface smoothness and which can reduce the crystal defect density in the nonporous film formed on the porous layer.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="21">FIGS. 1A to 1D are schematic views for showing the method for producing a semiconductor base member according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="22">
      As shown in FIG. 1A, a silicon base material 1 is prepared which has a surface 10 exhibiting a granular morphology.
      <br/>
      This base material is generally a commercially available silicon wafer.
    </p>
    <p num="23">As shown in FIG. 1B, a surface of the silicon base material is treated by means of hydrogen annealing as described below to change the surface 10 exhibiting a granular morphology to a surface substantially comprising atom steps 11 and terraces 12.</p>
    <p num="24">The surface comprising the steps 11 and the terraces 12 is made porous by means of anodization to form a porous layer 2 on at least the top surface of the silicon base material 1 as shown in FIG. 1C.</p>
    <p num="25">As shown in FIG. 1D, a nonporous layer 3 is formed on the surface of the porous layer 2 by means of CVD or the like.</p>
    <p num="26">
      Compared to the conventional method of making porous layer on a surface having no steps and terraces, the present invention can reduce the pore size distribution of the porous layer 2 to increase the crystallinity of the nonporous layer 3 formed on the porous layer.
      <br/>
      That is, the present invention can reduce the crystal defect density of stacking defects, dislocations, or twins that may be introduced into the nonporous layer 3.
    </p>
    <p num="27">The pore size of a pore in the surface of porous silicon can be evaluated by means of a gas adsorption method or observations using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (HRSEM).</p>
    <p num="28">
      The measurement method using the gas adsorption method is disclosed in, for example, R. Herino et al. J. Electrochem.
      <br/>
      Soc., vol. 134, p. 1994 (1987).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in the HRSEM method, obtained HRSEM images are processed to calculate the pore size distribution.
    </p>
    <p num="29">In this case, the brightness and contrast of the SEM images must be prevented from varying among the photographs.</p>
    <p num="30">Observations using an atomic force microscope indicate the surface of a commercially available silicon wafer prepared as the silicon base material 1 exhibits a granular morphology, as schematically shown in FIG. 1A. The commercially available silicon wafer is finished by chemically mechanically polishing (CMP) a surface obtained by means of grinding and sufficiently cleaning it.</p>
    <p num="31">
      On the other hand, instead of the granular morphology, a striped morphology is observed in both a surface obtained immediately after hydrogen annealing (AS ANNEAL) and a surface obtained immediately after the epitaxial growth (AS EPI) of a single-crystal layer on the surface of the silicon base material, as typically shown in FIG. 1B. This striped morphology is formed of a step-shaped surface and differences in height between these steps correspond to the lattice distances of silicon.
      <br/>
      In addition, the step cycle increases or decreases depending on the offset of a face orientation from a low-order face.
      <br/>
      If a silicon surface of a face orientation (100) is hydrogen-annealed, a step-terrace structure comprising a (2 * 1) reconfigured surface and a (1 * 2) reconfigured surface, that is, a face comprising atom steps and terraces is observed.
      <br/>
      An atomic force microscope shows that the surface roughness of the exposed surface of such a step-terrace structure is better than that of the commercially available wafer.
      <br/>
      For example, while a commercially available wafer exhibits a mean square roughness of 0.13 nm in a 1  MU m * 1  MU m area of its surface, the step-terrace structure has a mean square roughness of 0.09 nm under the same conditions.
      <br/>
      The method for forming such a step-terrace structure is not limited to the one described above, but cleaning with a special chemical or gas etching can be used under appropriate conditions to form the structure.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 shows schematically enlarged view of a step terrace structure.
    </p>
    <p num="32">The step 11 may be shaped like a straight line, a circular arc, a vortex, or a curve as schematically shown in FIG. 2.</p>
    <p num="33">
      The step-terrace structure is disclosed in, for example, "The effect of H2 Annealing on the Si surface and its use in the study of roughening during wet chemical cleaning," Proc of the 7th Int.
      <br/>
      Symposium on Silicon Materials Science Technology (The Electrochemical Society, 1994), pp.1170-1181. This shows the formation of the step-terrace structure by means of hydrogen annealing prior to epitaxial growth.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Many of steps or terraces, however, is eliminated by cleaning after hydrogen annealing or epitaxial growth.
      <br/>
      In general, silicon wafers used to manufacture LSIs are carefully cleaned using various chemicals as in RCA cleaning, thereby removing particles attached to the surface of the wafer, removing organic substances or oxides, or preventing metal contamination.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In particular, cleaning with an aqueous solution containing ammonia and hydrogen peroxide, which is called SC-1 or APM, is important in eliminating metal contamination.
      <br/>
      This cleaning is carried out by removing foreign matter while etching silicon.
      <br/>
      Thus, after cleaning for long time or cleaning with highly ammonia concentration solution, the surface of the silicon wafer has been etched by more than 20 nm easily.
    </p>
    <p num="36">Commercially available CZ wafers or hydrogen-annealed CZ wafers all exhibit a granular morphology.</p>
    <p num="37">FIG. 3A is a photograph of a wafer surface exhibiting such a granular morphology, which has been taken using an atomic force microscope (AFM).</p>
    <p num="38">On the other hand, both a CZ wafer immediately after hydrogen annealing and a wafer immediately after epitaxial growth exhibit a striped morphology.</p>
    <p num="39">FIG. 3B is a photograph of a wafer surface exhibiting such a striped morphology, which has been taken using the atomic force microscope (AFM).</p>
    <p num="40">When a wafer exhibiting the morphology shown in FIG. 3B is subjected to a cleaning treatment to be etched by more than 20 nm, it exhibits the morphology shown in FIG. 3A.</p>
    <p num="41">
      In addition, the amount of etched silicon increases in a linear-function manner with the actual cleaning time during the SC-1 cleaning, that is, the time during which the wafer remains immersed in the aqueous solution of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide.
      <br/>
      Although this etching amount also depends on other conditions such as the temperature and the concentration of ammonia/hydrogen peroxide, reduction of the etching amount is controlled to approximately 20 nm or less, more preferably, 10 nm or less, whereby a surface comprising atom steps and terraces which is suited to be made porous can be maintained.
      <br/>
      This tendency applies to cleaning methods other than the SC-1 cleaning as long as a cleaning liquid providing an etching effect is used.
    </p>
    <p num="42">As described above, in the present invention, it is important to, after formation of a surface comprising atom steps and terraces, carry out a treatment for forming a porous structure while the step-terrace structure is maintained without eliminating it by cleaning.</p>
    <p num="43">For example, when cleaning is executed for about 10 minutes using a mixture of aqueous ammonia and hydrogen peroxide at 80 (degree)  C., the amount of etched silicon is about 4 nm and the step-terrace structure can be prevented from being eliminated unless this cleaning is repeated 5 times or more.</p>
    <p num="44">Next, an example of chemical cleaning treatment, which is one of the methods for forming a surface comprising atom steps and terraces, will be described.</p>
    <p num="45">
      A silicon wafer of a face orientation (111) or a silicon wafer (an off substrate) having a surface with a face orientation inclined at 0 to 4 (degree)  from the face orientation (111) is prepared.
      <br/>
      The wafer is treated for about 30 seconds or more with 1 mol/liter solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) (Extended abstracts for the Applied Physics Society, Autumn 1994, vol. 2, p. 762, 29a-PA-11).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the wafer is treated with ammonium fluoride as described in G. S. Higashi et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 58, (1991) p.1656. These treatments enable a surface comprising atom steps and terraces to be exposed.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Another method comprises oxidizing a surface of a silicon wafer of a face orientation (100) and then removing the oxide film formed with an aqueous solution of hydrogen fluoride (HF) and hydrogen chloride (HCl) (Extended abstracts for the Applied Physics Society, Spring, 1995, vol. 2, p. 602, 19p-ZB-8).
      <br/>
      Yet another method comprises a treatment with an aqueous solution of HF and hydrogen peroxide.
    </p>
    <p num="47">In each of these methods, steps and terraces should be carefully prevented from being eliminated by controlling cleaning conditions after the formation of surface comprising the steps and terraces.</p>
    <p num="48">
      When a surface comprising steps and terraces is to be formed by means of heat treatment, oxygen near a surface of a substrate can be diffused to the exterior to reduce the concentration of oxygen.
      <br/>
      Certain heat treatment can eliminate oxygen deposits present near a surface of a CZ silicon wafer substrate.
      <br/>
      The oxygen deposits are removed by means of etching with HF used for anodization, and therefore pores in the porous silicon may be enlarged.
      <br/>
      The heat treatment can prevent such local enlargement of the pores.
      <br/>
      In particular, heat treatment in a hydrogen atmosphere or an inert gas atmosphere containing, for example, argon can reduce the concentration of oxygen and the density of oxygen deposits and is preferably used for the present invention.
      <br/>
      The heat treatment in hydrogen is typically carried out with 100% hydrogen at 1200 (degree)  C. for 1 hour.
      <br/>
      Similar effects can be obtained even at about 1100 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      In addition, when a surface comprising steps and terraces is formed by means of epitaxial growth, the concentration of oxygen in an epitaxial silicon layer can be reduced down to the order of 1017 cm-3 by controlling the amount of oxygen and moisture remaining in the furnace during epitaxial growth.
      <br/>
      The concentration of oxygen in a CZ silicon wafer is on the order of 1018 cm-3.
      <br/>
      These concentrations of oxygen can be measured using SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry).
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      When the heat treatment in hydrogen is used to form as a substrate surface a surface comprising steps and terraces, external diffusion during the treatment reduces the concentration of impurities such as boron and phosphorus near the surface.
      <br/>
      Since, however, the epitaxial growth can generate a surface comprising steps and terraces at a lower temperature than the heat treatment, it is unlikely to be subjected to the decrease in the concentration of impurities and enables the formation of the step-terrace structure to be controlled independently of the control of the concentration of impurities.
      <br/>
      That is, the epitaxial growth method provides a high controllability.
    </p>
    <p num="51">When the epitaxially grown layer is not thick, the impurities added to this layer are not particularly added during the epitaxial growth but may be diffused from the substrate by means of heat treatment during or after the epitaxial growth.</p>
    <p num="52">FIGS. 4A to 4I are schematic views for showing a method for producing a semiconductor base member according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="53">As shown in FIG. 4A, a silicon base material 1 is prepared, and as shown in FIG. 4B, a surface treatment is executed so as to form a surface comprising steps 11 and terraces 12.</p>
    <p num="54">As shown in FIG. 4C, the surface comprising the steps 11 and the terraces 12 is made porous to form a porous layer 2.</p>
    <p num="55">As shown in FIG. 4D, a nonporous layer 3 is formed on the surface of the porous layer 2 by means of CVD or the like to obtain a first member.</p>
    <p num="56">As shown in FIG. 4E, an insulating layer 4 is formed as required.</p>
    <p num="57">As shown in FIG. 4F, a second member 5 is prepared separately from the first member having the porous layer 2 and the nonporous layer 3.</p>
    <p num="58">As shown in FIG. 4G, the first member and the second member 5 are bonded together so as to obtain a multilayer structure having the nonporous layer 3 disposed inside.</p>
    <p num="59">
      Subsequently, unnecessary portions such as the porous layer 2 and the like are removed from the multilayer structure to produce a semiconductor base member having the nonporous layer 3 on the second member 5.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4H, the silicon base material 1 not made porous is removed by means of grinding, polishing or etching as described later in details.
      <br/>
      The method for removing the silicon member 1 may comprise separating the multilayer structure into two by the porous layer 2.
    </p>
    <p num="60">Next, as shown in FIG. 4I, the residual porous layer 2 is removed by means of etching, hydrogen annealing or the like.</p>
    <p num="61">Thus, a semiconductor base member preferred for an SOI wafer can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="62">�Effects of COP (crystal originated particle) on the formation of a porous layer�</p>
    <p num="63">
      Recent studies show that COPs exist on the surface of a commercially available CZ silicon wafer that has been polished and cleaned.
      <br/>
      COPs are formed by introducing regular-octahedron-shaped cavities into a bulk silicon when a silicon ingot is produced by drawing silicon out from a melt based on the Czochralski method and manifesting as depressions due to polishing or cleaning after exposure from the surface, and they are detected by a commercially available foreign matter inspection apparatus.
      <br/>
      The size of COPs are from 100 to 300 nm, and the number of COPs existing on the surface is 2 to 4 * 105 /cm3.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, pores of approximately 10 nm are arranged in a porous silicon on a degenerate substrate at an interval of about 20 nm.
      <br/>
      That is, one COP covers approximately 10 pores in the porous silicon.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The COP manifests on the wafer surface as a depression.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the top of the regular octahedron of the COP is exposed form the surface, the COP appears like a pore in the porous silicon and is mistakenly observed as a large pore.
      <br/>
      In addition, even when the COP is not exposed from the surface, the cavity of the COP affects the anodization current density and thus the pore size and distribution.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, in case of the embedded COP portion, in the step of thermally treating the wafer in a reducing atmosphere containing hydrogen after anodization to seal the pores, silicon atoms move so as to reduce the surface energy of the inner surfaces of the regular octahedron of the COP, and as a result, the surface immediately above the COP is sunk so that the pores is not sealed in some cases.
      <br/>
      When a result, when a nonporous single-crystal silicon layer is epitaxially grown thereon, defects may be introduced into this layer.
    </p>
    <p num="65">�Formation of a surface layer free from COPs�</p>
    <p num="66">
      The above problem can be solved by depositing an epitaxial silicon layer on a silicon wafer with COPs to form a surface layer free from COPs and then forming a porous silicon layer thereon.
      <br/>
      The epitaxial silicon layer may be grown by means of the CVD method using a commercially available epitaxial growth apparatus, and a source gas is not limited to SiCl4, SiHCl3, SiH2 Cl2, and SiH4.
      <br/>
      In addition, a carrier gas is not particularly limited but is preferably hydrogen.
      <br/>
      In addition, this layer may be grown at a low temperature using ultra-high-vacuum CVD (UHV-CVD) or in a batch heat treatment furnace in which wafers are arranged on a boat, a source gas may be supplied using hydrogen or nitrogen as a carrier gas.
    </p>
    <p num="67">Although the film thickness of the epitaxial silicon layer is not particularly limited, it is desirably larger than 100 to 300 nm, which is equal to the size of the COP.</p>
    <p num="68">
      In the case of forming a porous silicon used for a method for producing a semiconductor base member by bonding, the concentration of impurities in the surface layer is desirably in a degenerate state (p+ or n+).
      <br/>
      The structure of a porous layer formed on a degenerate semiconductor significantly differs from the structure of a porous layer formed on a non-degenerate semiconductor.
      <br/>
      The former porous layer has a pore size from about 10 nm to about 50 nm and a pore density from 1010 /cm2 to 1011 /cm2, while the latter porous layer has a structure obtained by proportionally contracting the former porous layer so that its pore size is from 2 nm to 10 nm.
      <br/>
      Thus, the latter porous layer has a smaller pore wall thickness and a lower mechanical strength.
      <br/>
      When the porous layers are formed under the same conditions, the porous layer formed on the non-degenerate substrate tends to have a higher porosity.
      <br/>
      Thus, during the process, the porous layer may be collapsed or the crystallinity of the epitaxial silicon layer formed on the porous layer may be degraded.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The addition of impurities may be executed by using a p+ or n+ substrate as the semiconductor base member for forming the epitaxial silicon layer thereon, growing the epitaxial silicon layer, and then increasing the concentration of the impurities in the epitaxial silicon layer by thermal diffusion.
      <br/>
      In addition, the epitaxial silicon layer may be doped with impurities while the epitaxial silicon layer is grown.
      <br/>
      In the latter case, an inexpensive dummy wafer can be selected for producing a semiconductor base member, thereby reducing manufacturing costs.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, by forming a high-concentration doped epitaxial silicon layer on a low-concentration substrate and then making porous the layer down to a depth larger than the thickness of the epitaxial silicon layer to form a porous silicon layer, a low-porosity layer is formed on the high-concentration doped epitaxial silicon layer while a high-porosity layer is formed on the low-concentration substrate.
      <br/>
      This configuration enables separation at the high-porosity layer.
    </p>
    <p num="70">According to the present invention, the concentration of elements (impurities) which are contained in the surface area of a silicon base material to be made porous and which can control the conductivity type is generally from 5.0 * 1016 /cm3 to 5.0 * 1020 /cm3, preferably from 1.0 * 1017 /cm3 to 2.0 * 1021 /cm3, more preferably from 5.0 * 1017 /cm3 to 1.0 * 1020 /cm3 in view of the porous structure formation step and the characteristics of the epitaxial film formed on the porous silicon layer.</p>
    <p num="71">The thickness of the epitaxial layer is preferably from 0.2  MU m to 30  MU m, more preferably from 0.2  MU m to 15  MU m.</p>
    <p num="72">
      The COP density can also be reduced by thermally treating a commercially available silicon wafer in a hydrogen containing reducing atmosphere.
      <br/>
      The hydrogen containing reducing atmosphere contains only hydrogen or is a mixed atmosphere containing hydrogen and a rare gas (He, Ne, Ar, Xe or the like).
      <br/>
      The heat treatment temperature is preferably from about 900 (degree)  C. to about 1200 (degree)  C. Although the pressure is not particularly limited, a preferable temperature region can be reduced by reducing the pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      The porous layer 2 used in the present invention can be formed by anodizing, for example, an Si base material in an HF solution.
      <br/>
      The porous layer has a sponge-like structure in which pores of diameter from about 10-1 nm to about 101 nm are arranged at an interval from about 10-1 nm to about 101 nm.
      <br/>
      The density is smaller than the single-crystal Si density of 2.33 g/cm3. The density can be varied from 2.1 to 0.6 g/cm3 by varying the concentration of the HF solution from 50% to 20%, varying the ratio of alcohol added to the HF solution, or varying the current density.
      <br/>
      In addition, by previously modulating the resistivity and electric conductivity type of a portion to be made porous, the porosity can be varied based on the modulated resistivity and the conductivity type.
      <br/>
      In the p type and under the same anodization conditions, the non-degenerate substrate (p- or n-) has a smaller pore size but a larger pore density by about one order and thus a larger porosity than the degenerate substrate (p+ or n+).
      <br/>
      That is, the porosity can be controlled by varying these conditions, so the porosity control is not limited to one of these methods.
      <br/>
      The porous layer may have either a single layer structure or a stacked structure comprising layers of different porosities.
      <br/>
      By forming an epitaxial silicon layer of a degenerate concentration on a degenerate substrate, a low-porosity layer can be formed in the epitaxial silicon layer at the surface side while a high-porosity layer can be formed in the non-degenerate portion at the substrate side.

      This phenomenon is considered to be the reconfiguration of the surface rather than etching.

      Consequently, the surface energy is high.
      <br/>
      The heat treatment in a hydrogen containing reducing atmosphere removes a naturally oxidized film from the surface due to, for example, the reduction of oxide, and the naturally oxidized film is not generated during the heat treatment by the reduction action.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the energy barrier against the movement of surface Si atoms is lowered to allow surface Si atoms induced by heat energy to move, thereby forming a flat surface with a low surface energy.
      <br/>
      The conditions for this hydrogen baking may be the same as in the heat treatment for the surface treatment of the silicon base material.
      <br/>
      The pores can be effectively sealed by executing a heat treatment in which the surface of the porous silicon is opposed to a member comprising a material containing as a main component, silicon or silicon and carbon or nitrogen and not containing oxygen as a main component, thereby restraining the etching of the silicon.

    <p num="91">The following two method are described below as representative methods of removing the porous layer from the multilayer structure to expose the nonporous layer, but this invention is not limited to these methods.</p>
    <p num="92">
      The first method comprises using grinding, polishing, or etching to remove the first member from the back surface to expose the porous layer.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the porous layer is removed to expose the nonporous single-crystal silicon layer.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      The second method comprises cracking the inside of the porous layer of a multilayer structure and/or the upper and lower interfaces of the porous layer to separate the multilayer structure.
      <br/>
      Specific methods include a method of applying a tensile force perpendicular to the bonded surface of the multilayer structure; a method of applying a force to the ends of the multilayer structure such that the first and second members are separated from each other; a method of applying a shearing stress to the bonded surface in the direction parallel with this surface (for example, moving the first and second members in opposite directions within a face parallel with the bonded surface or rotating the members in opposite circumferential directions); a method of pressurizing the bonded surface in the direction perpendicular to this surface; a method of applying a wave energy such as ultrasonic waves to the separation area; a method of inserting a peeling member (for example, a sharp blade like a knife) and/or a fluid into the separation area in the direction parallel with the bonded surface from a side of the multilayer structure; a method of utilizing the expanding energy of a substance infiltrated into the porous layer acting as the separation area; a method of bonding to the substrate the porous layer acting as the separation area and thermally oxidizing the substrate from its side to expand the volume of the porous layer, thereby executing the separation; and a method of using as the separation area a layer having microcavities formed by ion-implantation and heating this layer by laser irradiation, thereby executing the separation.
      <br/>
      A method of pulse-heating followed by the application of thermal stress or softening of the porous layer can also be used, but this invention is not limited to these methods.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, after the porous layer acting as the separation area has been bonded to the substrate, the substrate can be selectively etched from its side without cracking the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="94">Of these methods, the separation using a fluid will be specifically described.</p>
    <p num="95">
      The flow of a fluid required for separation according to this invention can be implemented by injecting from a thin nozzle a pressurized fluid comprising a gas or liquid.
      <br/>
      To convert an injected flow into a high-speed and high-pressurization beam, the water jet method can be used which is introduced by "Water Jet," vol. 1, no. 1, p. 4.
      <br/>
      The water jet which can be used in the present invention can be obtained by jetting from a thin nozzle a pressurized water of 100 to 8000 kgf/cm2 pressurized by a high-pressure pump.
      <br/>
      By using the water jet, it is possible to cut or process ceramics, metal, concrete, resin, rubber, or woods (an abrasive material is added to water when a material to be cut is hard) or to remove a paint film from a surface layer or to clean wash the surface of a member.
      <br/>
      The main effect of the conventional water jet is the removal of a part of the material.
      <br/>
      That is, the water jet cutting removes a cut portion from a main member, and the removal of a paint film and the cleaning of a member surface remove the unnecessary portions.
      <br/>
      When a fluid jet such as the water jet is used as a fluid flow formation method in the present invention, the multilayer structure can be separated from its side by aligning the separation area with the side of the bonded surface and injecting a fluid jet to this area.
      <br/>
      In this case, the fluid jet is first injected directly to the separation area exposed from the side of the multilayer structure as well as parts of the first and second members around the separation area.
      <br/>
      Then, the fluid jet breaks only the separation area having a low mechanical strength to separate the structure into two without damaging the first and second members.
      <br/>
      In addition, even if the separation area is not exposed but is covered with a thin layer for any reason, the fluid jet first removes or destroys the layer covering the separation area and then continuously removes the exposed separation area.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      A fluid jet can be injected to a narrow gap (a recess) in the side of a multilayer structure comprising bonded wafers so as to push the bonded wafers away from each other and destroy the separation area having a fragile structure to separate the wafers, though this effect is not often used conventionally.
      <br/>
      Since the object of this method is not cutting or removal, cutting chips are not scarcely generated from the separation area, and the multilayer structure can be separated without using an abrasive material or damaging the separating surface even when the material of the separation area does not removed by the fluid jet.
      <br/>
      Thus, this effect is considered to be obtained by a kind of wedge action by the fluid without the action of cutting or polishing.
      <br/>
      Thus, this effect can be enhanced when there is a narrow recessed gap in the side of the bonded substrate and when the injection of the fluid jet applies a force in a direction in which the separation area is peeled off.
      <br/>
      To sufficiently provide this effect, the side of the bonded substrate is preferably shaped like a recess instead of a projection.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      The porous layer exposed from the multilayer structure can be selectively removed by utilizing the low mechanical strength and very large surface area of the porous layer.
      <br/>
      The selective removal method includes a mechanical method using polishing or lapping, and a method of utilizing chemical etching with an etchant or chemical dry etching.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      When the porous layer is to be selectively wet-etched with an etchant, the etchant may be a mixture of hydrofluoric acid of 49 wt. % HF and hydrogen peroxide solution of 30 wt. % H2 O2 ; hydrofluoric acid; a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and alcohol; a mixture of hydrofluoric acid, alcohol and hydrogen peroxide solution; buffered hydrofluoric acid; a mixture of buffered hydrofluoric acid and alcohol; a mixture of buffered hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen peroxide solution; a mixture of buffered hydrofluoric acid, alcohol and hydrogen peroxide solution; or a mixture of hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid and acetic acid.
      <br/>
      The mixture of HF and H2 O2 is preferred because in use of this mixture, the etching selection ratio of porous Si to nonporous Si is 105 or more.

      In addition, when the epitaxial silicon layer and the porous silicon are formed in this order, the surface layer of the semiconductor base member with the porous layer formed thereon contains no depletion that may become a COP, thereby contributing to further improving the crystallinity and surface property.

      Furthermore, when the high-concentration-doped epitaxial silicon layer is formed on the low-concentration substrate before the porous silicon layer is formed, then the low-porosity layer is formed on the high-concentration-doped epitaxial silicon layer, while the high-porosity layer is formed on the low-concentration substrate.

      Consequently, the nonporous single-crystal semiconductor film can be formed and bonded to the second member, and the resulting multilayer structure can be separated at the high-porosity layer to transfer the non-porosity single-crystal semiconductor film to the second member.

    <p num="201">
      Furthermore, the epitaxial silicon layer can be formed on the separated dummy wafer for reuse.
      <br/>
      Besides, since most layers transferred to the second member have been formed by epitaxial growth, the amount of decrease in the film thickness of the dummy wafer is very small, and therefore the decrease in strength caused by the decrease in wafer thickness does not pose a problem in repeated reuse.

    <p num="202">Furthermore, the separating surface is very smooth due to the alteration of the porous structure at the interface between the epitaxial layer and the substrate, and therefore the separated wafer is suitable for a surface smoothing treatment for reuse.</p>
