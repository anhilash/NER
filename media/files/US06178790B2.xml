      As assembly is provided for securing a door to a fixed object which allows the door to be locked from the outside with a conventional padlock, but which allows the door to be opened from the interior while the padlock is in place.
      <br/>
      The door has a first face, a second face and an edge.
      <br/>
      The fixed object typically includes an abutment.
      <br/>
      Means are provided for engaging the door to the abutment.
      <br/>
      The engaging means are disposed on the first face of the door proximate to the edge and are movable from an engaged position in which the door is engaged to the abutment, to a released position in which the door is disengaged from the abutment.
      <br/>
      Means are also provided for biasing the engaging means toward the engaging position.
      <br/>
      A flexible cord is attached to the engaging means.
      <br/>
      An active hasp is connected to the flexible cord distal to the engaging means and is disposed on the second face of the door.
      <br/>
      Means are provided for securing the active hasp in fixed position on the second face of the door when the engaging means is in the engaged position.
      <br/>
      When the active hasp is displaced, the flexible cord actuates the engaging means, overcoming the bias of the biasing means and displacing the engaging means toward the released position.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the door can be opened from the interior while the padlock is in place.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention is related to the field of locking mechanisms.
      <br/>
      In particular, the invention is directed to a safety lock assembly for a door which can be locked externally and still allow a person on the interior of the door to open the lock assembly and thus the door.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      It is common to provide doors with a lock to prevent unauthorized access.
      <br/>
      One such lock, which is readily available and simple to use, is a padlock latch assembly.
      <br/>
      Padlock latch assemblies include two hasps: one that is attached to the exterior of the door to be locked, and one that is attached to a fixed object, such as the door jam or the mating door of a two-door closure.
      <br/>
      The padlock is slipped through openings in the hasps, preventing them from being moved apart to any great degree.
      <br/>
      This provides a cost-effective locking mechanism that can be readily opened from the exterior of the door by one having a key.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, once locked, there is no mechanism to open the lock from the interior of the door.
      <br/>
      This is not only inconvenient but can be particularly dangerous should there be a need to evacuate a building through the door quickly, such as during a fire.
      <br/>
      A person would need to wait until the padlock was opened before exiting.
      <br/>
      Obviously, in certain instances, this added delay could be critical.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Various lock mechanisms have been developed in the past.
      <br/>
      None of these address the problems resolved by the instant invention. U.S. Pat. No. 2,007,854 is directed to a lock for doors such as on refrigerators.
      <br/>
      A bolt positioned on the exterior of the door is biased by a spring outward to an extended position.
      <br/>
      In this extended position, the bolt engages an undersurface of a head.
      <br/>
      The head is mounted to the exterior of one door while the bolt and related parts are mounted to the exterior of the other door.
      <br/>
      A lever is pivotally mounted to a lock casing.
      <br/>
      The lever is operably engaged to the bolt such that, when the lever is rotated to an open position, the bias of the spring is overcome and the bolt is retracted, disengaging the head.
      <br/>
      An aperture in the casing is provided to receive a padlock and thus prevent the lever from being moved to the open position.
      <br/>
      A cable is attached to the bolt and extends through a passageway in the door.
      <br/>
      A ring may be provided at one end of the cable.
      <br/>
      When the cable is pulled, the bolt overcomes the bias of the spring and disengages the head.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      U.S. Pat. No. 1,167,011 is directed to a door lock for barn doors.
      <br/>
      A bolt is slidingly mounted within an edge of a door.
      <br/>
      A spring biases the bolt into an extended position such that it engages a cavity in a doorpost.
      <br/>
      Handles are pivotally mounted to the door and to the bolt.
      <br/>
      One handle is positioned on the interior of the door; the other handle is positioned on the exterior of the door.
      <br/>
      When either handle is rotated outwardly, it causes the bolt to be retracted overcoming the spring bias.
      <br/>
      Once retracted, the door can be swung to an open position.
      <br/>
      A hasp is provided at the exterior of the door to receive a pad lock and thus prevent the exterior handle from rotating.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      U.S. Pat. No. 1,763,694 is directed to a deadbolt intended particularly for doors or windows that swing open from the top.
      <br/>
      A hollow bolt member cooperates with a catch to engage an angled piece.
      <br/>
      The catch is biased to a forward or locked position by a spring.
      <br/>
      A rod is pivotally mounted to the catch at one end and connected to a pull chain at the other.
      <br/>
      The pull chain is connected to an arm, which is positioned in a slot in the door.
      <br/>
      The arm is connected to an exterior handle.
      <br/>
      When the handle is pulled, the arm is displaced.
      <br/>
      The displacement of the arm causes the pull chain to move, overcoming the bias of the spring and retracting the catch thereby disengaging the angled piece.
      <br/>
      One the interior of the door, a thumb piece is pivotally mounted to the door proximate the arm.
      <br/>
      When the thumb piece is rotated, it also causes the displacement of the arm and the disengagement of the catch.
      <br/>
      There is no teaching of using a padlock with this door assembly.

    <p num="12">It is an object of another aspect of the invention to provide a locking assembly which includes a limited number of moving parts which can be readily replaced as they become worn over time, and which is simple to use and install.</p>
    <p num="13">It is an object of another aspect of the invention to provide a lock assembly that allows the replacement of the lock, whether for security purposes or simple maintenance, without requiring a locksmith.</p>
    <p num="14">
      In accord with an aspect of the invention, a lock assembly is provided for securing a door to a fixed object.
      <br/>
      The door has an interior face, an exterior face and an edge.
      <br/>
      The fixed object has an aperture.
      <br/>
      A mounting bracket is attached to the interior face of the door near the edge.
      <br/>
      A casing is mounted to the mounting bracket.
      <br/>
      A collar is disposed within the casing.
      <br/>
      A latch rod is slidingly mounted in the casing and journaled within the collar for movement along a latch rod axis.
      <br/>
      A latch tip is mounted to the latch rod near the edge.
      <br/>
      A spring is disposed in the casing between the collar and the latch tip, such that the latch tip is normally biased outward from the casing in a position to engage the aperture of the fixed object when the door is in a closed position (thus preventing the door from rotating).
      <br/>
      An anchor is mounted to the latch rod distal to the latch tip.
      <br/>
      A mooring is disposed on the anchor.
      <br/>
      A flexible release cord is attached to the mooring and directed over a guide pin away from the door at least substantially along the latch rod axis.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a flexible hasp cord is attached to the mooring and is directed over a guide pin and through the door at least substantially along the latch rod axis.
      <br/>
      An active hasp with an opening is connected to the flexible hasp cord distal to the mooring and is disposed at the exterior face of the door.
      <br/>
      A stationary hasp is fixedly attached to the door on the exterior face proximate to the active hasp.
      <br/>
      When the active hasp is displaced, the flexible hasp cord pulls on the anchor, overcoming the bias of the spring and disengaging the latch tip from the aperture.
      <br/>
      The door is thus free to rotate away from the fixed object.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In accord with another aspect of the invention, A lock assembly is provided for securing a door to a fixed object.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      The fixed object having an aperture.
      <br/>
      The door is movable from a closed position in which the edge is proximate to the aperture, to an open position in which the edge is remote from the aperture.
      <br/>
      A casing is mounted to the interior face of the door near the edge.
      <br/>
      A latch rod is slidingly mounted to the casing for movement along a latch rod axis.
      <br/>
      A latch tip is disposed on the latch rod near the edge.
      <br/>
      A spring is disposed in the casing and operably engaged to the latch rod, such that the latch tip is normally biased outward from the casing in a position to engage the aperture of the fixed object when the door is in the closed position.
      <br/>
      An anchor is mounted to the latch rod distal to the latch tip.
      <br/>
      A flexible release cord is attached to the anchor and directed, at least substantially, along the interior face of the door and along the latch rod axis.

      <br/>
      Means are provided for securing the active hasp in fixed position on the second face of the door when the engaging means is in the engaged position.
      <br/>
      When the active hasp is displaced, the flexible cord actuates the engaging means, overcoming the bias of the biasing means and displacing the engaging means toward the released position.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Certain implementations of this aspect of the invention provide that: the engaging means includes a mounting bracket mounted to the interior face of the door near the edge; a casing is mounted to the mounting bracket; a collar is disposed within the casing; a latch rod is slidingly mounted to the casing and journaled within the collar for movement along a latch rod axis; a latch tip is mounted to the latch rod near the edge; an anchor is mounted to the latch rod distal to the latch tip; the biasing means includes a spring disposed in the casing between the collar and the latch tip, such that the latch tip is normally biased outward from the casing in a position to engage the abutment of the fixed object; the securing means comprises a stationary hasp fixedly attached to the door at the exterior face proximate to the active hasp; a flexible release cord is attached to the anchor and directed substantially along the latch rod axis.</p>
    <p num="22">
      In accord with yet another aspect of the invention, a padlock assembly is provided for securing a movable door to fixed object.
      <br/>
      The door defines an interior region and an exterior region, and has a side edge.
      <br/>
      The fixed object has an abutment.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="25">
      Referring to FIGS. 1, 2 and 3, a lock assembly 100 in accord with one aspect of the invention is shown.
      <br/>
      Generally, the assembly is used to lock a door 20 in a closed position with respect to a fixed object 50, such as a door jam.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that the apparatus can also be used to lock two doors together, such as in a double door configuration, wherein one of the two doors would be deemed the "fixed object" for these purposes.
      <br/>
      Further, the lock assembly can be employed on gates, truck doors, or similar applications and still practice the invention.
      <br/>
      For clarity's sake, this patent application will refer to the "interior region" 300 and the "exterior region" 200 defined by the door.
      <br/>
      The interior of the door includes the latch mechanism and the pull release while the exterior includes the active hasp and the padlock.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that generally the locking assembly may be positioned on either side of the door and practice the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Referring to FIGS. 1-3, a mounting bracket 10 is mounted to the interior face 21 of the door 20 near its side edge 22 (see also FIGS. 4, 5 and 7).
      <br/>
      The mounting bracket may be welded, bolted or otherwise secured to the door.
      <br/>
      A hollow, cylindrical casing 11 is mounted to the bracket distal to the door.
      <br/>
      A flat circular plate 12 forms a collar near one end of the casing distal to the side edge of the door.
      <br/>
      A central opening 13 is provided in the collar.
      <br/>
      A lubricant may be supplied along the interior of the casing but this is not required.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the axis of the cylindrical casing is parallel to the interior surface 21 of the door.
      <br/>
      Of course, the casing can be angled and still practice the invention, as a particular application dictates.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      A latch rod 30 is positioned within the casing 11 and extends along the axis of the casing through the central opening 13 of the collar 12.
      <br/>
      The latch rod is movable along a latch rod axis 301.
      <br/>
      A latch tip 31 with a beveled end 32 (see also FIG. 8) is attached at the end of the latch rod proximate to the side edge 22 of the door 20.
      <br/>
      An anchor 33 is attached to the opposite end of the latch rod, on the opposite side of the collar.
      <br/>
      A coil spring 34 is disposed between the collar 12 and the latch tip 31, operably engaged to the latch rod and the casing, such that the latch tip is biased outward from the casing.
      <br/>
      Guides can be provided within the casing or on the opening of the collar to maintain the latch rod 30 (and thus the beveled end 32) at a selected orientation.
      <br/>
      This can be particularly useful when closing the door 20, as discussed more fully below.
      <br/>
      The latch rod can be a commercial bolt, such as one of the chain bolts available from The Stanley Works of New Britain, Conn.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Referring still to FIGS. 1-3, an abutment 51 (see also, FIG. 8) is provided on a fixed object 50 to engage the latch tip 31 when the door 20 is closed.
      <br/>
      As currently preferred, especially for retrofitting existing doors, a clip 55 is mounted to the fixed object, such as a door jam (or other door, etc.), opposite the mounting bracket 10 when the door 20 is in a closed position.
      <br/>
      An aperture 56 is provided in the clip.
      <br/>
      When the door is closed, the latch tip 31 extends into and engages the aperture.
      <br/>
      The aperture creates a lip 57 that contacts the latch tip, preventing its movement and, thereby locking the door in a closed position.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that the aperture can be located directly in the door jam or opposite door itself.
      <br/>
      A separate clip is not required to practice the invention.
      <br/>
      Further, the function of the aperture can be served by any abutment or other structure that impedes the movement of the latch tip in the extended position and still practice the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Referring to FIG. 8, the clip 55 may be mounted to the door frame or other fixed object 50 to thereby define the lip 57.
      <br/>
      When closing the door, the beveled end 32 of the latch tip 31 slides over the end of the lip, causing the coil spring 34 to be compressed.
      <br/>
      Once the latch tip has cleared the tip, the coil spring biases the latch tip outward such that it extends beyond the edge of the lip.
      <br/>
      The clip shown in FIG. 8 can be easily mounted to existing door frames or mating doors to allow use of the lock assembly 100 with previously installed doors.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The anchor 33 is provided with a mooring 35, such as a hole.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, a flexible member, such as a release arm or cord 60, is connected to the anchor at the mooring and directed over a guide pin 61 such that the release cord extends substantially, at least in part, along the latch rod axis 301.
      <br/>
      The guide pin can be mounted to the door 20 by a guide bracket 66.
      <br/>
      A hand grip, such as a finger ring 63, is attached at the end of the release arm distal to the anchor.
      <br/>
      When the finger ring is tugged, the release arm 60 is pulled over the guide pin 61, overcoming the bias of the spring 34 and moving the anchor away from the collar 12.
      <br/>
      As the anchor is moved, the latch rod 30 and the latch tip 31 are also displaced away from the clip 55 such that the latch tip disengages the aperture 56, allowing the door 20 to open freely.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      A second flexible member, such as a hasp arm or cord 70, is also connected to the anchor 33 at the mooring 35.
      <br/>
      The hasp arm extends over the opposite side of the guide pin 61 and is connected to an active hasp 80 such that the hasp cord extends substantially, at least in part, along the latch rod axis 301.
      <br/>
      Referring particularly to the views of FIGS. 9A-D and 10A-B, the active hasp includes a base 81 which is internally threaded and which has an internal cable seat 82.
      <br/>
      The end of the hasp arm 70 distal to the anchor 33 is secured to the base at the cable seat.
      <br/>
      A disc or other enlargement may be provided at the end of the hasp arm to engage the cable seat, preventing the hasp arm from slipping completely through the base.
      <br/>
      The base fits snugly into an opening 24 in the door 20.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The active hasp 80 has an L-shaped profile including a base leg 83 and a side leg 84.
      <br/>
      The base leg has a bore hole 85 for receiving a permanent screw 86.
      <br/>
      The screw extends through the bore hole and engages the internal threads of the base 81, thereby securing the base to the base leg.
      <br/>
      Of course, the screw could be integrally formed with the base leg but this would make assembly more difficult.
      <br/>
      Further, other means, such as a stud, could be used to attach the base leg to the base.
      <br/>
      The side leg has an opening 87 to receive the U-shaped member 111 of a padlock 110, as in traditional hasps.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      A stationary hasp 90 is mounted to the exterior face 22 of the door 20 and positioned proximate the active hasp 80.
      <br/>
      The stationary hasp also has an opening 91 to receive the U-shaped member 111 of the padlock 110.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In accord with another aspect of the invention shown in FIGS. 6-7, two distinct guide pins 67, 68 are provided.
      <br/>
      The upper guide pin 68 directs the hasp arm 70 toward the active hasp 80.
      <br/>
      The lower guide pin 6 directs the release arm 60 toward the finger ring 63.
      <br/>
      These pins can be formed by a loop 69 mounted on the interior face 21 of the door 20 by a guide bracket 66.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      To operate the lock assembly 100 of the instant invention, the door 20 is rotated to a closed position about a hinge 130, such that the latch tip 31 engages the aperture 56 of the fixed object 50 (see FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      The U-shaped member 111 of the padlock 110 is slipped through the openings 87, 91 in the active hasp 80 and the stationary hasp 90, receptively.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the active hasp cannot be moved away from the door, the hasp cord 70 cannot be pulled and the door is locked from external to the door.
      <br/>
      The padlock must be removed before the active hasp can be displaced to unlock the door.
      <br/>
      However, even when the padlock is locked, on the interior 300 of the door, the finger ring 63 can be pulled, displacing the flexible release cord 60 which, in turn, pulls on the latch rod 30.
      <br/>
      The latch rod overcomes the bias of the spring 34 and the latch tip 31 is disengaged from the aperture 56 and allowing the door to be opened (see FIG. 2).
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      From the exterior 200, the padlock 110 must be unlocked and removed from the active hasp 80 and the stationary hasp 90.
      <br/>
      The user then grasps the active hasp.
      <br/>
      A finger grip or knob may be provided to make this gripping easier.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the user may simply grasp the active hasp by the opening 87 in the side leg 84 and pull the active hasp away from the door.
      <br/>
      This causes the hasp arm 70 to move over the guide pin 61 and pull on the anchor 33, in turn, overcoming the bias of the spring 34 and displacing the latch rod 30 away from the fixed object 50.
      <br/>
      The latch 31 tip is thus disengaged from the aperture 56, allowing the door 20 to be opened.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In the embodiments shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the hasp arm 70 and the release arm 60 include a single flexible cord attached to the anchor 33.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, two distinct flexible cords or cables can be used if preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      While it is preferred that the lock assembly 100 be opened from the interior by pulling the finger ring 63, it will be appreciated that other means can also be provided for disengaging the latch tip from the interior 300.
      <br/>
      In particular, a handle can be attached to the anchor 33.
      <br/>
      This handle can be readily grasped on the interior 300 of the door and moved laterally, thereby disengaging the latch tip from the abutment 51.
      <br/>
      However, such a handle would be inaccessible from the exterior 200 of the door.
      <br/>
      Other means for displacing the abutment such that it disengages the latch tip may be provided (for example, by mounting the clip 55 to the door jam on rails so that it can slide away from the door 20).
      <br/>
      Again, this will permit the user on the inside to disengage the latch while preventing the person at the exterior from opening the door without first opening the padlock.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      While this invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments disclosed herein, it is not confined to the details set forth and the patent is intended to include modifications and changes which may come within and extend from the disclosed embodiments.
      <br/>
      In particular, while a stationary hasp 90 is currently preferred, it will be understood that any structure that permits the securement of the active hasp 80 in a non-moving condition can be employed.
      <br/>
      For example, a swing bar can be used to cover the base leg 83, which swing bar is then separately locked in place.
      <br/>
      The swing bar will effectively prevent movement of the active hasp until that separate lock is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Currently, it is preferred that the hasp arm 70 be attached to the active hasp 80.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the free end of the hasp arm can be formed into a loop that can be engaged by the U-shaped member 111 of the padlock 110.
      <br/>
      As such, it will be difficult to move the loop, and thus the hasp arm, when the padlock engages the loop.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The spring bias is currently overcome by a directed pull on the anchor 33, via the release arm 60 or the hasp arm 70.
      <br/>
      Of course, various lever mechanisms and the like may be employed to provide an additional mechanical advantage if desired.
      <br/>
      In particular, a panic bar or push button can be used to actuate the release arm from the interior with a simple pushing movement, as one skilled in the art would appreciate.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      As currently preferred, the engaging means includes a latch rod moving linearly along a latch rod axis and biased by a coil spring.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that the engaging means may include other locking mechanisms that employ a rotational or other movement.
      <br/>
      Further, other biasing means, such as magnets, gravity and the like may be employed and still practice the invention that is defined by the following claims:
