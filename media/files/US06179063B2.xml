      <br/>
      The present invention relates to an impulse wrench for use in conjunction with a fastener engaging tool and a power supply to selectively rotate threaded fasteners.
      <br/>
      The wrench comprises a housing and an impulse manifold rotatably mounted within the housing.
      <br/>
      An impulse piston is mounted inside a impulse piston receiving space for reciprocating movement and has an impulse delivering surface and a pressurizing surface.
      <br/>
      The piston and the piston receiving space are constructed and arranged such that the pressurizing surface and an outer end portion of the piston receiving space cooperate to define at least a portion of a high pressure chamber which is filled with a substantially incompressible fluid.
      <br/>
      An impulse receiving portion of an output spindle and the impulse delivering portion of the impulse piston are constructed and arranged with respect to one another such that the motor rotates the manifold relative to the spindle so as to engage the impulse delivering surface of the impulse piston with the impulse receiving portion of the spindle so that (a) an impulse is delivered to the spindle to turn the spindle and the fastener engaging tool and (b) the impulse receiving portion cams the impulse delivering surface so as to move the impulse piston outwardly to increase the fluid pressure inside the high pressure chamber to a level which is related to the torsional resistance offered by the fastener.
      <br/>
      A pressure responsive shut-off structure is communicated with the high pressure chamber and movable between (a) a power communicating position and (b) a power shut-off position.
      <br/>
      The shut-off structure moves from the power communicating position thereof to the power shut-off position thereof in response to fluid pressure in the high pressure chamber reaching a predetermined level, thereby preventing power from being communicated from the power supply to the motor when the torsional resistance of the fastener has reached a predetermined level.

    <p num="1">The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Appln. of Borries, et al., Ser. No. 60/132,202, filed May 3, 1999, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated in the present application by reference.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a power-operated wrench for rotating threaded fasteners and, more particularly, to a wrench that tightens fasteners to a predetermined torque.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Impulse wrenches are known in the art for tightening threaded fasteners.
      <br/>
      Certain types of wrenches heretofore known have a rotating manifold with a large bore formed therein, and a rotating spindle having a set of spring-biased vanes mounted thereon.
      <br/>
      The bore inside the manifold is provided with a pair of diametrically opposed lands.
      <br/>
      During operation, the manifold rotates relative to the spindle so that the vanes sweep along the interior of the manifold bore.
      <br/>
      This sweeping action creates a pressure differential on opposing sides of the vanes.
      <br/>
      When the vanes contact the lands, the spindle and manifold are momentarily coupled together in a force transmitting relationship and a rotary impulse is transmitted to the spindle through the vanes, thereby affecting a turning movement of the spindle and the fastener to which it is engaged.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      These types of wrenches require extremely tight tolerances when forming the bore inside the manifold to ensure the vanes can sweep properly along the bore interior.
      <br/>
      As a result of such tolerances requirements, the cost of manufacturing such wrenches is relatively high.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Other types of arrangements for delivering impulses to the spindle have also been provided in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 3,210,959 to Brown discloses an arrangement wherein the manifold carries a single-acting piston that slides in a reciprocating manner within a radial bore formed in the impulse manifold.
      <br/>
      The output spindle has an eccentric portion disposed adjacent the radial piston.
      <br/>
      During a fastener tightening operation, the manifold rotates relative to the spindle such that the piston engages the spindle once each rotation to deliver a rotary impulse to the spindle.
      <br/>
      An overflow chamber is communicated to a chamber defined in part by the radial piston via a restricted orifice.
      <br/>
      As the eccentric portion of the spindle contacts the piston, the piston is cammed radially outwardly and pressurized fluid is forced through the restricted orifice.
      <br/>
      As a result, the piston rides over the eccentric spindle portion and then a return spring forces the piston back towards the spindle.
      <br/>
      When the torsional resistance of the fastener reaches a selected maximum level, a sufficient amount of fluid is forced out through the restricted orifice during each rotation to enable the piston to ride over the eccentric spindle portion without delivering sufficient force to further tighten the fastener.
      <br/>
      The maximum level for the torsional resistance of the fastener can be adjusted by turning a screw to vary the restriction of the orifice.
    </p>
    <p num="6">U.S. Pat. No. 5,735,354 discloses a piston-type arrangement that uses a single double-acting piston, and in another embodiment a piston-type arrangement using a pair of diametrically opposed pistons.</p>
    <p num="7">
      The advantage of a piston-type arrangement is that the high manufacturing expenses associated with machining the manifold bores for the vane-type arrangements within close tolerances are avoided.
      <br/>
      However, neither of the radial piston arrangements disclosed in the patents mentioned above have a suitable mechanism for shutting off the flow of power to the tool.
      <br/>
      In the '959 patent, the maximum torque level is set by varying the restriction of the aforementioned orifice by tightening or loosening a screw.
      <br/>
      The wrench of the '959 patent itself, however, continues to run after the threshold torque level has been reached.
      <br/>
      Thus, a user must visually verify that the maximum torque level has been reached by watching to see if the fastener is continuing to be tightened.
      <br/>
      As a result, the user may have a tendency to keep running the wrench more than necessary during each operation to ensure that the fastener is tightened.
      <br/>
      It can be appreciated that in high usage applications, such as in automobile assembly plants, extra running of the wrench can quickly add up over time and cause unnecessary premature wear on the wrench components.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The '354 patent does not disclose any mechanism for shutting off the power to the wrench or for ensuring that the torque applied by the fastener does not exceed a predetermined level.
      <br/>
      However, the applicants of the present application are aware of a commercially available impulse mechanism (the mechanism includes the manifold and the spindle, not the entire wrench) available from Robert Bosch GmbH, the assignee of the '354 patent, that is similar to the double-acting piston arrangement disclosed in the '354 patent.
      <br/>
      The Bosch mechanism uses a deceleration-sensitive shut-off structure for stopping the flow of power to the wrench.
      <br/>
      Deceleration-sensitive shut-off structures are problematic because they often measure the torque applied to the fastener inaccurately.
      <br/>
      Specifically, deceleration-sensitive shut-off structures measure the rotational deceleration of the wrench components to determine the torque being applied to the fastener.
      <br/>
      This method of measuring torque is inaccurate when tightening fasteners and using fastener engaging tools (i.e., the sockets used for engaging threaded bolts) of varying weights because these weights will affect the overall deceleration of the wrench components, thus resulting in inconsistent measurements and inconsistent torque delivery between fasteners of varying weights.
      <br/>
      In addition, these deceleration-sensitive mechanisms must be periodically adjusted to ensure the proper torque is being delivered.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Thus, there exists a need for a piston-type wrench that has a shut-off structure that functions effectively and consistently to shut-off power to the wrench when a fastener has been tightened to a preset torque.
      <br/>
      To meet this need, the present invention provides an impulse wrench for use in conjunction with a fastener engaging tool and a power supply to selectively rotate threaded fasteners.
      <br/>
      The wrench comprises a housing and an impulse manifold rotatably mounted within the housing.
      <br/>
      The manifold has a spindle receiving space and an impulse piston receiving space.
      <br/>
      An impulse delivering piston is mounted inside the impulse piston receiving space for reciprocating movement and has an impulse delivering surface and a pressurizing surface.
      <br/>
      The piston and the piston receiving space are constructed and arranged such that the pressurizing surface and an outer end portion of the piston receiving space cooperate to define at least a portion of a high pressure chamber which is filled with a substantially incompressible fluid.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      An output spindle is rotatably mounted within the spindle receiving space and has an impulse receiving portion positioned adjacent the impulse delivering surface of the impulse piston.
      <br/>
      The output spindle connects with the fastener engaging tool such that rotation of the spindle rotates the fastener engaging tool.
      <br/>
      A power-operated motor is operatively connected to the impulse manifold.
      <br/>
      The motor is constructed and arranged to rotate the manifold about the driving axis thereof using power from the power supply.
      <br/>
      An actuator is selectively movable between (a) an actuated position enabling the power supply to communicate power to the motor and (b) a non-actuated position preventing the power supply from communicating power to the motor.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The impulse receiving portion of the output spindle and the impulse delivering portion of the impulse piston are constructed and arranged with respect to one another such that, when the motor is connected with the power supply and the fastener engaging tool is connected with the spindle and engaged with a threaded fastener, movement of the actuator to the actuated position thereof communicates power from the power supply to the motor to cause the motor to rotate the manifold relative to the spindle, thereby momentarily engaging the impulse delivering surface of the impulse piston with the impulse receiving portion of the spindle so that (a) an impulse is delivered to the spindle to apply torque to the spindle which in turn transmits the torque to the fastener engaging tool and the fastener engaged therewith and (b) the impulse piston moves such that the pressurizing surface thereof increases the fluid pressure inside the high pressure chamber to a level which is related to the torsional resistance to tightening offered by the fastener.
      <br/>
      An adjustable pressure responsive shutoff structure is communicated with the high pressure chamber and is movable between (a) a power communicating position wherein the shut-off structure permits the power supply to communicate power to the motor and (b) a power shut-off position wherein the shut-off structure prevents the power supply from communicating power to the motor.
      <br/>
      The shut-off structure moves from the power communicating position thereof to the power shut-off position thereof in response to fluid pressure in the high pressure chamber reaching a shut-off initiating level that is related to a selected maximum amount of torsional resistance to which the fastener is to be tightened, thereby preventing power from being communicated from the power supply to the motor when the torsional resistance of the fastener has reached the selected maximum amount.
      <br/>
      This prevents power from being communicated from the power supply to the motor when the torsional resistance of the fastener has reached the maximum amount.
    </p>
    <p num="12">The shut-off structure is constructed and arranged such that the shut-off initiating level of the fluid pressure in the high pressure fluid chamber at which the shut-off structure moves to the power shut-off position can be adjusted, thereby allowing for selective control of the maximum torsional resistance for the fastener.</p>
    <p num="13">
      The use of a pressure-sensitive shut-off structure that responds to pressure created as a result of the piston engaging the engaging portion of the spindle provides a consistent and accurate measurement of fastener torque, which in turn provides a consistent and accurate shut-off of power to the motor.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the pressure created by the piston moving outwardly is directly related to the amount of torsional resistance offered by a fastener.
      <br/>
      An increase in torsional resistance of the fastener results in an increase of pressure in the high pressure chamber during each piston movement.
      <br/>
      The pressure created by the piston is not affected by the weight of the fastener or other such variable factors, as is the problem with measuring deceleration of wrench components.
      <br/>
      Thus, measuring the pressure ensures a direct and accurate measurement of the fastener's torsional resistance without the inconsistencies created by other indirect torque measuring methods, such as deceleration measurements.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      It is to be understood that this aspect of the present invention is not limited to the single-acting piston arrangement disclosed herein and may be practiced with any of the arrangements shown in the aforementioned '354 patent, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated into the present application.
      <br/>
      However, its is preferred to practice the principles of the present invention using a single-acting piston arrangement because a single-acting piston takes up less volume than a double-acting piston, which in turn allows more oil or another substantially incompressible fluid to be used in the manifold.
      <br/>
      Because of this increased fluid capacity in a single-piston arrangement, a greater volume of fluid can be used and thus the fluid temperature will increase less rapidly during operation than in comparison to a lower volume of fluid.
      <br/>
      As a result, the fluid in the single-acting piston design will need to be changed less often.
      <br/>
      Further, this aspect of the invention may be practiced with power-operated motors other than the air-powered motor disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      The motor may be powered by pressurized liquid or by electricity.
      <br/>
      In the case of using pressurized liquid as the power supply, a valve mechanism would still be suitable.
      <br/>
      However, a switch would be used when an electric power supply is used.
      <br/>
      Further, the principles of the present invention may also be practiced with the axial piston arrangement shown in EP 0631851 to Robert Bosch GmbH, the entirety of which is incorporated into the present application by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Another aspect of the present invention relates specifically to fluid powered wrenches that use a movable valve to shut-off power to the motor.
      <br/>
      These valves reciprocate between open and closed positions to allow and prevent the flow of fluid to the motor.
      <br/>
      However, most of these wrenches use a complicated mechanism for moving the valve to its closed position.
      <br/>
      In such mechanisms, the fluid pressure usually resists such movement of the valve and thus the mechanism must actively move the valve.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,082,066, discloses an arrangement wherein pressurized air flowing from the power supply biases the valve towards its closed position.
      <br/>
      The valve is maintained in its open position during normal operation, and then allowed to move to its closed position under the force of the pressurized air.
      <br/>
      This arrangement is advantageous because it obviates the need for the complicated mechanisms required to force the valve against the resistance of pressurized air used in some wrenches.
      <br/>
      The problem with the arrangement disclosed in the '066 patent is that movement of the valve therein to its closed position is affected by a declaration-sensitive arrangement for measuring fastener torque.
      <br/>
      As discussed above, declaration-sensitive mechanisms may be inaccurate and inconsistent.
      <br/>
      As a result, the timing of the valve's movement to its closed position for power shut-off will also be inaccurate and inconsistent.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Thus, there exists a need for an impulse wrench in which the need for complicated mechanisms that move a valve against the resistance of pressurized fluid is obviated and also which is provided with an improved mechanism for measuring fastener torque.
      <br/>
      To meet this need, another aspect of the present invention provides an impulse wrench for use in conjunction with a fastener engaging tool and a supply of pressurized fluid to selectively rotate threaded fasteners.
      <br/>
      The wrench comprises a housing and an impulse transmitting mechanism mounted in the housing.
      <br/>
      The mechanism comprises a driven component, an output spindle, and surfaces defining a high pressure chamber filled with a substantially incompressible fluid.
      <br/>
      The output spindle is mounted for rotation with respect to the housing and connectable with the fastener engaging tool such that rotation of the spindle rotates the fastener engaging tool.
      <br/>
      A fluid-driven motor is operatively connected to the driven component.
      <br/>
      The motor is constructed and arranged to rotate the driven component using pressurized fluid from the supply.
      <br/>
      The driven component is rotatable with respect to the housing and the output spindle such that rotation of the driven component rotates the spindle to affect a fastener tightening operation wherein the threaded fastener is tightened in such a manner that its torsional resistance to tightening increases throughout the operation.
      <br/>
      The impulse mechanism is constructed and arranged such that the pressure of the fluid in the chamber increases to a level that is related to the torsional resistance offered by the fastener increases during the fastener tightening operation.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      An adjustable pressure responsive shut-off structure is communicated with the high pressure chamber.
      <br/>
      The shut-off structure has a shut-off valve that moves between (a) a power communicating position wherein the shut-off valve permits the pressurized fluid to flow from the supply thereof to the motor and (b) a power shut-off position wherein the shut-off valve prevents the pressurized fluid from flowing from the supply thereof to the motor.
      <br/>
      The shut-off valve is positioned between the motor and the supply of pressurized fluid such that the pressurized fluid flows against the valve so as to apply a biasing force that urges the valve towards the power shut-off position thereof.
      <br/>
      The shut-off structure maintains the shut-off valve in the power communicating position thereof while the pressure of the fluid in the high pressure chamber is below a selected shut-off initiating level that is related to a selected maximum amount of torsional resistance to which the fastener is to be tightened and thereafter allows the valve to move to the power shut-off position thereof under the biasing force applied by the pressurized fluid flowing from the supply thereof in response to the pressure of the fluid in the high pressure chamber reaching the shut-off initiating level, thereby preventing the pressurized fluid from being communicated from the supply thereof to the motor when the torsional resistance of the fastener has reached the selected maximum amount.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="22">
      FIG. 1 shows an impulse wrench, generally indicated at 10, constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The wrench 10 is used for rotatably tightening and loosening threaded fasteners (not shown) and includes an impulse transmitting mechanism, generally indicated at 12, that enables the wrench 10 to tighten such fasteners to a pre-determined maximum torque.
      <br/>
      The wrench 10 includes a housing 14 which has a generally cylindrical forward housing portion 16 and a rear housing portion 18.
      <br/>
      The forward housing portion 16 a machined component and the rearward housing portion 18 is a one-piece molded component or a one-piece casting that is machined to its final configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The forward housing portion 16 has a hollow interior and a nose portion 20 mounted thereto with a tapered forward end.
      <br/>
      The impulse transmitting mechanism 12 is positioned inside the forward housing portion 16 with an output spindle 22 thereof extending forwardly from the mechanism 12.
      <br/>
      A forward end portion of the output spindle 22 is connected with a tool mounting portion 26 disposed forwardly of the nose portion 20.
      <br/>
      A motor connecting portion 24 of the mechanism 12 extends rearwardly therefrom.
      <br/>
      The tool mounting portion 26 is configured to have a fastener engaging tool (not shown) removably mounted thereto.
      <br/>
      The fastener engaging tool may be of any kind which is suitable for engaging and rotating a threaded fastener.
      <br/>
      A typical example of such a tool is a socket wrench-type tool suitable for rotating lug nuts, such as those which fasten structural components in an automobile together and those which fasten the rim of an automobile wheel in place.
      <br/>
      The fastener engaging tool may be selected from a kit having fastener engaging tools of varying sizes.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The rearward housing portion 18 has a hollow cavity 27 and a pistol grip portion 28 formed integrally therewith.
      <br/>
      The pistol grip portion 28 is covered with a deformable material 30, such as foamed rubber, to provide for suitable non-slip grasping.
      <br/>
      A series of indentations (or ribs) 32 may be formed on the material 30 to enhance such non-slip grasping.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      A power-operated motor, generally indicated at 34, is mounted inside the hollow interior of the rearward housing portion 16.
      <br/>
      In the disclosed embodiment, the motor 34 is powered by pressurized air.
      <br/>
      However, the principles of the present invention may be practiced using electricity, pressurized fluids, or any other suitable source of power.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The motor 34 has a generally cylindrical tubular casing 38 and a rotatable shaft 36 mounted inside the casing 38.
      <br/>
      The shaft 36 has a plurality of vanes which are not shown for clarity reasons.
      <br/>
      However, it is well known in the art to rotate a shaft with vanes thereon using pressurized air.
      <br/>
      Forward and rearward shaft supporting blocks 40,42 each having generally cylindrical configurations and central bores formed therethrough are positioned adjacent to and in abutting relation with the forward and rearward ends of the casing 38.
      <br/>
      The central bore of the rearward shaft supporting block 40 has a wider diameter portion opening rearwardly and in which a ball bearing assembly 44 is received.
      <br/>
      The ball bearing assembly 44 rotatably supports the rearward end portion 46 of the shaft 36.
      <br/>
      The central bore of the forward shaft supporting block 42 has a wider diameter portion opening forwardly and in which a ball bearing assembly 48 is received.
      <br/>
      The ball bearing assembly 48 rotatably supports a portion of the shaft 36 spaced rearwardly of the forward end thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The motor 34 also includes a valve supporting structure 50 that is connected rearwardly of the casing 38 and the supporting block 40.
      <br/>
      The valve supporting structure 50 has a central bore with a frustroconical forward portion 52, a frustroconical rearward portion 54, and a central passage 56 communicating the two portions 52, 54.
      <br/>
      A rearward end portion 58 of a valve actuating rod 60 extends from the shaft 36 and through the central bore in valve supporting structure 50.
      <br/>
      The shaft 36 has a bore that extends throughout the length thereof and the rod 60 is slidably mounted inside the bore.
      <br/>
      A forward end portion of the rod 60 extends forwardly from the shaft 36 and is engaged with a plunger 62 that that is located within the impulse transmitting mechanism 12.
      <br/>
      The interaction between the transmitting mechanism 12 and the rod 60 will be described in further detail later in the application.
      <br/>
      A sealing element in the form of an annular rubber O-ring 64 is disposed inside the connecting passage 56 and sealingly engaged with the rod 60 to prevent pressurized air from flowing through the central bore of valve supporting structure 50.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The valve supporting structure 50 has a fluid passageway 66 formed therethrough beneath its central bore and opening to the forwardly and rearwardly facing surfaces of the structure 50 of the block 40.
      <br/>
      The shaft support block 40 also has a fluid passageway 68 formed therethrough beneath its central bore and opening to the forwardly and rearwardly facing surfaces of the structure 50 of the block 40.
      <br/>
      When the support block 40, the valve supporting structure 50, and the casing 38 are assembled together, the fluid passageways 66, 68 are fluidly communicated with one another and with the interior of the tubular casing 38.
      <br/>
      A disc-shaped valve member 70 is fixed to the rearward end portion 58 of rod 60.
      <br/>
      The valve member 70 and the rod 60 move together between (a) an open position (shown in FIG. 1) wherein the valve member 70 is spaced from passageway 66 to allow air to flow through the passageways 66, 68 and into the casing interior and (b) a closed position (as shown in FIGS. 9-12) wherein the valve member 70 engages the rearwardly facing surface of valve supporting structure 50 and closes the passageway 66 in a sealing manner to prevent air from flowing through passageways 66, 68 and into the casing interior.
      <br/>
      The valve member 70 and actuating rod 60 may be considered part of a shut-off structure 102 whose full function and construction will be explained in further detail later in the application.
      <br/>
      These open and closed positions may be considered to provide the power communicating and the power shut-off positions of the shut-off structure.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The motor 34 is assembled together and positioned inside the cavity 27 of the rearward housing portion 18.
      <br/>
      A sealing element in the form of an annular rubber O-ring 72 is received within a groove which extends around the periphery of the valve supporting structure 50.
      <br/>
      The O-ring 72 engages the interior surfaces defining cavity 27 in sealed relation to prevent air from flowing around the exterior of the valve supporting structure 50.
      <br/>
      Sufficient space is provided between the rear surface of the valve supporting structure 50 and the rear wall of the housing 14 to allow for movement of the valve member 70 between its open and closed positions.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      An air supply connecting portion 74 is provided at the lower end of the pistol grip portion 28 and is adapted for connection to a supply of pressurized air (not shown).
      <br/>
      A fluid passageway 76 fluidly communicates the air supply connecting portion 74 (and hence the pressurized air supply when connected) to the rear end of the interior cavity 27.
      <br/>
      When the valve member 70 is in its open position, fluid communication is established between the fluid passageways 66, 68, the interior of casing 38, and fluid passageway 76, thereby allowing pressurized air to flow from the air supply and into the casing interior.
      <br/>
      An actuator in the form of a throttle mechanism, generally indicated at 78, is provided on the pistol grip portion 28 for controlling the flow of air through fluid passageway 76.
      <br/>
      The throttle mechanism 78 has a manually engageable trigger 80 which is spring-biased forwardly towards a non-actuated position.
      <br/>
      Manually depressing the trigger 80 moves it rearwardly against its spring bias towards and into an actuated position.
      <br/>
      When the trigger 80 is moved to its actuated position, the throttle mechanism 78 allows air to flow from the air supply through the fluid passageway 76.
      <br/>
      When the trigger 80 is released and spring-biased to its non-actuated position, the throttle mechanism 78 prevents air from flowing from the air supply through fluid passageway 76.

      The tubular casing 38 has a plurality of exhaust holes 82 formed along the top portion thereof.

      As can be appreciated from FIG. 1, the fluid passageways 66, 68 are communicated to the casing interior beneath the motor shaft 36 and its associated vanes.

      A recessed slot 84 is formed in the lower portion of the casing 38 to allow air to the flow beneath the shaft 36.

      The fluid exhaust passageway communicates with the housing cavity 27 via opening 88.
      <br/>
      As a result of this construction, when the trigger 80 is depressed and the valve member 70 is open, pressurized air flows through fluid passageway 76, then fluid passageways 66, 68, 70 into the casing interior beneath the motor shaft 36, and then out the exhaust holes 82 and out through the opening 88.

      This air is then exhausted out the bottom of handle portion 28 via the exhaust passageway.

      <br/>
      An O-ring 216 is received within a groove on the needle valve 212 and forms a seal between the valve 212 and the chamber surface to prevent fluid flow therebetween.
      <br/>
      Chamber 130 has a wider diameter than passageway 126 and the needle valve 212 is disposed in the chamber 130 with a part of the conical end portion 214 extending into passageway 126.
      <br/>
      A low pressure fluid passageway 218 communicates the needle valve chamber 130 with the piston receiving bore 114.
      <br/>
      As a result of this construction, fluid is permitted to flow from passageway 122, through passageway 126, into chamber 130, and then into bore 114 through passageway 218.
      <br/>
      The conical end portion 214 of the valve obstructs the flow in a restricting manner so that pressure build-up in passageways 122 and 126 "bleeds" into chamber 130 and then flows on into bore 114.
      <br/>
      This prevents transient pressure increases in passageways 116 and 122 from forcing fluid out through passageway 218 in an unrestricted manner and instead causes such transient pressure increases to bleed off in a restricted manner.

      The end portion 219 of the needle valve 212 opposite conical end portion 214 is threaded and the end of the chamber 130 is also threaded.

      By turning the needle valve 212, these threads cooperate to move the needle valve 212 towards the point and away from the point where passageway 126 opens to chamber 130.
      <br/>
      Moving the needle valve 212 in such a manner varies the amount of restriction created by the conical end portion 214 and thus provides the needle valve 212 with adjustability to control the rate of pressure bleed.

      A coil spring 228 disposed between the valve 220 and the adjustment member 226 biases the valve 220 away from the member 226 to a closed, sealing position, as shown in FIG. 5C. When the fluid pressure in passageway 122 reaches a predetermined level, the pressure forces the valve 220 away from opening 124 against the bias of spring 228 to establish fluid communication between shut-off piston chamber 134 and passageway 122 via passageway 132.
      <br/>
      The pressure at which the valve 220 opens can be adjusted by turning the adjustment member 226 so as to compress or relax the spring 228.
      <br/>
      The more the spring 228 is compressed, the more pressure required to move valve 220; the less the spring 228 is compressed, the less pressure required to move valve 220.

      Turning now to FIGS. 15-20, these Figures illustrate the components of an optional expansion reservoir assembly 230.
      <br/>
      Although it is preferred, this assembly 230 is optional and not shown in FIGS. 1-13. The assembly 230 includes a cylindrical plug 232 with an annular groove on the exterior thereof and a rubber O-ring 234 received within the groove.
      <br/>
      The plug 232 is slidably mounted in an overflow chamber 236 formed in the impulse manifold 100.
      <br/>
      The chamber 236 is spaced axially forwardly of the piston receiving bore 114.
      <br/>
      A small orifice 238 communicates the spindle receiving bore 112 and the overflow chamber 236.
      <br/>
      The plug 232 has an outwardly extending projection 240.
      <br/>
      An annular retaining ring 242 is removably mounted within a groove outwardly of the plug 232.
      <br/>
      The ring 242 has an opening 244 formed therethrough and the projection 240 extends through the opening 244.
      <br/>
      A spring 246 is disposed between the plug 232 and the ring 242 and biases the plug 232 inwardly toward an unexpanded position (shown in FIG. 15).
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      When the plug 232 is in its unexpanded position, the inner surface 248 of the plug 232 engages the outwardly facing surface 250 of the overflow chamber 236.
      <br/>
      During operation of the wrench 10, the fluid pressure inside bore 112 will be subject to transient increases.
      <br/>
      Because the orifice 238 has such a narrow diameter in relation to the sizes of bore 112 and chamber 236, little or no pressure will be communicated to chamber 236.
      <br/>
      However, as the temperature of the fluid increases over time (usually as a result of extended periods of operation), the pressure likewise increases in a steady, non-transient manner.
      <br/>
      This non-transient pressure increase is communicated to chamber 236.
      <br/>
      As a result, the plug 232 is forced radially outwardly against the bias of spring 246 and fluid will flow from bore 112 into chamber 236.
      <br/>
      This overflow keeps the pressure in bore 112, and hence all the other interior passageways, relatively constant during such non-transient pressure increases.
      <br/>
      This is particularly advantageous in view of the manner in which the pressure relief valve 220 functions.
      <br/>
      Specifically, if the overall, normal pressure were increased, then the difference between the normal pressure and the pressure at which the relief valve 220 unseals would be decreased and thus the maximum torque applied by the mechanism 12 would vary during operation.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      This expansion chamber assembly 230 can also be used as storage for extra fluid which will compensate for any fluid leakage which may occur over time.
      <br/>
      To do this, the manifold 100 is filled beyond its maximum normal capacity until the pressure increases and a certain amount of fluid flows into chamber 236 forcing plug 232 against the bias of spring 246.
      <br/>
      If any fluid leaks from the manifold 100 through one of its sealed points, the fluid pressure in the manifold decreases correspondingly.
      <br/>
      As a result, the spring 246 forces the plug 232 inwardly so that fluid from chamber 236 flows through orifice 238 and into bore 112, thereby replenishing the lost fluid.

    <p num="51">
      To begin a fastener driving operation, the air supply connecting portion 74 is connected to a supply of pressurized air and the fastener engaging tool is engaged with a threaded fastener.
      <br/>
      The trigger 80 is manually depressed so that the throttle mechanism 78 supplies pressurized air through passageway 76.
      <br/>
      At this point, the valve 70 is in its normal, open position and the shut-off piston 188 is in its power supplying position to prevent forward movement of the rod 60 and valve 70.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the pressurized air flows through passageways 66 and 68 into the casing interior to cause rotation of shaft 36 and thereafter exhaust through openings 82 and 38.
      <br/>
      Rotation of the shaft 36 rotates the manifold 100 about its rotational axis as a result of the interconnection between connecting portions 24 and 90.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      During the initial phases of the fastener tightening operation, the fastener offers little or no torsional resistance and the spindle 22 rotates along with the manifold 100 to rotate the fastener.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the impulse piston 140 engages the cam 166 on the impulse receiving portion 156 of the spindle 22 and causes the spindle 22 to rotate along with the manifold 100.
      <br/>
      Because the fastener offers little or no torsional resistance to rotation of the spindle 22, the return spring 142 causes the piston 140 and spindle 22 to remain engaged and prevents the spindle 22 from camming the piston 140 outwardly.
      <br/>
      This phase of the operation continues until the fastener begins to become snug and offer more than a nominal amount of torsional resistance.
      <br/>
      The point at which this begins is called the "snug point".
      <br/>
      The use of a single-acting piston 140 with a return spring 142 is particularly advantageous during this initial tightening phase of the operation because the spring 142 biases the piston 140 into engagement with the cam 66.
      <br/>
      As a result, the piston 140 is "pre-loaded" by the spring 142 and the spindle 22 and manifold 100 will rotate together longer than if the spring 142 were not provided.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      At this snug point, the fastener is offering more than a nominal amount of resistance, but less than the predetermined maximum amount of torque which is to be applied to the fastener.
      <br/>
      During this snugging phase of the tightening operation, the manifold 100 rotates relative to the spindle 22 so that the impulse piston 140 engages the camming portion 166 of the impulse receiving portion 156.
      <br/>
      The engagement causes two actions: (a) the piston 140 delivers an impulse to the camming portion 166 of impulse receiving portion 156 to thereby turn the spindle 22 and fastener in the tightening direction, and (b) the impulse delivering surface 168 is cammed by the camming portion 166 to thereby move the piston 140 radially outwardly against the bias of spring 142.
      <br/>
      The point at which the snug point begins can be varied by using springs 142 of varying spring constants.
      <br/>
      This radially outward movement causes the spring bearing surface 170 to function as a pressurizing surface and increase the fluid pressure inside the radially outer end portion 120 of piston bore 114 and the longitudinal and transverse high pressure passageways 116 and 122.
      <br/>
      These passageways 116, 122 and outer end portion 120 may be considered together as a high pressure chamber.
      <br/>
      As the pressure in the high pressure chamber increases, a certain amount of the pressure bleeds off through passageway 126 via the needle valve 212.
      <br/>
      During this snugging phase, the spindle 22 is turned a sufficient amount during impulse so that the camming between surface 168 and camming portion 166 moves the piston 140 outwardly at a speed insufficient to cause the fluid pressure in the high pressure chamber to reach its predetermined maximum.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the needle valve 212 bleeds off enough pressure to ensure that the maximum pressure is not attained.
      <br/>
      This phase continues with the piston 140 repeatedly impulsing the spindle 22 until the torsional resistance offered by the fastener reaches its maximum value.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      FIGS. 6-13 illustrate the manner in which the impulse transmitting mechanism 12 operates once the maximum torsional resistance of the fastener is reached.

      FIGS. 6a-d shows the positions of the transmitting mechanism and shut-off structure components when the manifold 100 has rotated 5 (degree)  from the initial position of FIG. 5 relative to the spindle 22.
      <br/>
      In this position, the impulse delivering surface 168 initially engages the camming portion 66 of the spindle 22 and the piston 140 begins moving radially outwardly as a result of the camming action.
      <br/>
      The pressure relief valve 220 is closed and the shut-off piston 188 is in its power supplying position maintaining the valve 70 in its open position.
      <br/>
      The high pressure chamber is substantially sealed, and thus fluid pressure builds therein as the piston 140 begins moving radially outwardly.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that, although there are no seals between piston 140 and the surface of bore 114, the clearance between the piston 140 and bore 114 is sufficiently tight to prevent fluid from flowing therethrough during transient pressure increases.

      FIGS. 7a-d show the components when the manifold 100 has rotated approximately 10 (degree)  from its initial position relative to the spindle 22.
      <br/>
      Note that the spindle 22 itself has not rotated.
      <br/>
      Instead, the pressure builds up in the high pressure chamber at a fast enough rate to open the pressure relief valve 220.
      <br/>
      Opening of the pressure relief valve 220 communicates the chamber with the upper end of the shut-off piston chamber 134 and allows fluid to flow from the high pressure chamber.
      <br/>
      As a result, the piston 140 continues to move outwardly and further rotation of the manifold 100 causes the piston 140 to ride over the camming portion 166 in an outward camming manner.
      <br/>
      With the pressure relief valve 220 open, the fluid from the high pressure chamber now flows into the shut-off piston chamber 134 to move the piston 188 therein against the bias of spring 200 to its power shut-off position.
      <br/>
      It should be noted the projection 198 prevents the piston 188 from bottoming out and pinching against the plunger 62.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      FIGS. 8a-d show the components of the transmitting mechanism 12 and the shut-off structure 102 with the manifold 100 rotated approximately 27 (degree)  from its initial position.
      <br/>
      The air pressure behind valve member 70 forces the valve member 70 forwardly towards its closed position with rod 60 likewise being forced forwardly against the bias of spring 208.
      <br/>
      Also, high pressure chamber begins communicating with the piston receiving bore 114 via passageway 118 at point 252 to allow fluid flow therebetween.
      <br/>
      The flat surface 160 of spindle 22 cooperates with the interior surface of bore 112 to define bypass passageway 254 for establishing fluid communication between passageway 118 and the portion of the piston receiving bore 114 opposite piston 140.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      FIGS. 9a-d shows the components of the transmitting mechanism 12 and the shut-off structure with the manifold 100 rotated approximately 56 (degree)  from its initial position.
      <br/>
      Fluid is free to flow from the high pressure chamber into the spindle receiving bore 112 through passageways 118 and 254.
      <br/>
      Thus, the pressure in the high pressure chamber decreases and the relief valve 220 returns to its closed position under the bias of spring 228.
      <br/>
      The piston 140 continues to move radially outwardly against the bias of return spring 142, forcing fluid through passageway 118 into the spindle receiving bore 112.
      <br/>
      Also, the valve member 70 at this point is forced forwardly under air pressure to its closed position, thereby preventing airflow to the casing interior and hence shutting off communication between the motor 34 and the power supply (i.e., the pressurized air source).
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      FIGS. 10a-10d show the components of the transmitting mechanism 12 and the shut-off structure 102 with the manifold 100 rotated 123 (degree)  from its initial position.
      <br/>
      At this point, the piston 140 has already been moved to its radially outermost point and the return spring 142 biases it back inwardly towards bore 112.
      <br/>
      During this movement, fluid in the end of piston receiving bore 114 opposite the piston 140 is permitted to flow back into the high pressure chamber via bypass passageway 254 and passageway 118.
      <br/>
      This prevents pressure build-up in the end of bore 114 opposite the piston 140.
      <br/>
      Spring 200 biases shut-off piston 188 back towards its power-supplying position.
      <br/>
      However, the piston 188 does not reach that position because it abuts against the plunger 62.
      <br/>
      The fluid displaced by piston 188 during this movement flows through the clearance defined between the piston exterior and the surface defining chamber 134 and then into the end of the piston receiving bore 112 opposite the piston 140 via passageway 136.
      <br/>
      Because the high pressure relief valve 220 is closed, fluid is prevented from flowing back through passage 132.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that as long as the user keeps the trigger 80 depressed, the throttle remains open and the pressurized air will keep valve member 70 in its closed position.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      FIGS. 11a-d show the components of the transmitting mechanism 12 and the shut-off structure 102 with the manifold 100 rotated approximately 185 (degree)  from its initial position.
      <br/>
      At this point, communication through passageway 254 is closed.
      <br/>
      However, radial and axial grooves 162, 164 (FIG. 3b) cooperate with the interior surface of bore 112 to define another bypass passageway 256 which, at this point of rotation, establishes communication between the high pressure chamber and the portion of bore 112 adjacent piston 140 via passageway 118.
      <br/>
      As a result, this arrangement provides further pressure relief for bore 114 by allowing fluid to flow therefrom into the high pressure chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      FIGS. 12a-d show the components of the transmitting mechanism 12 and the shut-off structure 102 with the manifold 100 again rotated to 5 (degree)  past its initial position.
      <br/>
      Since the power supply to the motor 34 has been cut-off, the manifold 100 continues to rotate only under its own inertia.
      <br/>
      As a result, the shut-off cycle described above will be repeated a few more times until the manifold 100 comes to a complete stop.
      <br/>
      No additional tightening of the fastener occurs during these additional rotations.

    <p num="61">
      FIGS. 13a-d show the components of the transmitting mechanism 12 and the shut-off structure 102 back at their initial position.
      <br/>
      The trigger 80 has been released, causing the throttle mechanism 78 to cut-off the air supply, and allowing the air trapped between the valve 70 and the throttle 78 to vent to the atmosphere so that the valve member 70 returns to its open position with the assistance of spring 208.
      <br/>
      Spring 200 then biases shut-off piston 188 fully to its power supplying position.
      <br/>
      The wrench 10 is now ready for another fastener tightening operation.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      It should be noted that the symmetrical configuration of the piston 140 and eccentric impulse receiving portion 156 allows the wrench 10 to rotate fasteners in the opposite direction.
      <br/>
      Thus, the wrench 10 can be used for tightening or loosening fasteners.
      <br/>
      Of course, once the fasteners have been tightened to their predetermined torque, the wrench 10 cannot be used to loosen the fasteners unless the mechanism 12 is set for shut-off at a higher torque.
      <br/>
      This method of construction and operation is within the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferred to provide a bypass passageway (not shown) that bypasses the shut-off valve to communicate pressurized air to the motor when the valve is closed.
      <br/>
      The direction of fluid flow through this bypass passage also affects reverse rotation of the motor.
      <br/>
      A secondary switch is typically used to control fluid flow through this passage.
      <br/>
      The construction of such a passage is well known to those skilled in this art and thus will not be described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      It can thus be seen that the objectives of the present invention have been fully and effectively accomplished.
