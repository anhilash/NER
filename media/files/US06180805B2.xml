      A photochemical process for the production of previtamin D3 or a derivative thereof from 7-dehydrocholesterol is disclosed.
      <br/>
      The process includes irradiating the 7-dehydrocholesterol in a reactor with a UV radiation source, wherein the UV source includes an excimer or exciplex emitter which emits quasi-monochromatically according to the corona discharge mechanism in the UV range, and recovering previtamin D3 or a derivative thereof.
      <br/>
      Previtamin D3 compositions and derivatives made from this process are also provided.

    <heading>FIELD OL THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a photochemical process for the production of previtamin D3 or a derivative thereof from 7-dehydrocholesterol in a reactor having a UV radiation source.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to the production of previtamin D3 or a derivative thereof from 7-dehydrocholesterol using an excimer or exciplex emitter that emits photons at an optimal wavelength for such a process.
      <br/>
      Products formed by such a process are also provided.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Reportedly, previtamin D3 may be obtained from 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) by irradiation.
      <br/>
      This previtamin may be converted by thermal rearrangement into vitamin D3, which is thermally more stable.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Various sources of irradiation have been considered to drive the 7-DHC to previtamin D3 reaction.
      <br/>
      For example, the process of forming photons from excimer or exciplex reactions is known from laser technology.
      <br/>
      Laser photon sources, however, are not suitable for photochemical synthesis of previtamin D3 because of their high technical complexity and the fact that their radiation geometry has little suitability for preparative photochemistry and the associated radiation density is insufficient over a large area.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventional photochemical synthesis of previtamin D3 on an industrial scale reportedly has been effected by irradiation of 7-DHC using medium-pressure mercury lamps.
      <br/>
      Because the starting material (7-DHC), the primary product (previtamin D3) as well as byproducts, absorb with different efficiency in the same wavelength range, polychromatic radiation of the kind supplied by these lamps favours the formation of photochemical byproducts which are inactive and in some cases toxic.
      <br/>
      Therefore, with the present state of the art, it is necessary to interrupt the irradiation after relatively low conversion of the 7-DHC to previtamin to D3.
      <br/>
      The unconverted 7-DHC is recycled while the primary product (previtamin D3) must be purified in an expensive working up procedure.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Filter effects are a further consequence of substrates and products which absorb in the same wavelength range.
      <br/>
      For example, when the absorption spectrum of previtamin D3 overlaps completely with that of 7-DHC, the previtamin absorbs a continuously increasing proportion of the light as the conversion proceeds.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Another reason for interrupting the conventional reaction after a relatively low conversion (10-20%) of 7-DHC to previtamin D3 is the fact that the quantum yield (i.e., the efficiency) of the subsequent photochemical reaction of previtamin D to, e.g. tachysterol, is greater than the quantum yield of the formation of the desired product (previtamin D3).
      <br/>
      Thus, in conventional reactions, the efficiency of the reaction is decreased while the cost of production of the end product is increased.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Another significant problem during conventional production of previtamin D3 is the poor correlation between the emission spectrum of medium-pressure mercury lamps and the absorption spectrum of 7-DHC.
      <br/>
      Thus, in conventional processes using medium-pressure mercury lamps only about 1% of the radiation radiating therefrom is in the desired range, i.e., between about 280 and about 300 nm.
      <br/>
      Moreover, because the radiation spectrum produced by a conventional medium-pressure mercury lamp is not optimized for the 280-300 nm wavelength, a large amount of undesired byproducts are produced by irradiation outside this optimum wavelength region.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">In the present invention, significantly improved levels of previtamin D3 production from 7-DHC are achieved by using as the radiation source an excimer or exciplex emitter which emits quasi-monochromatic radiation according to the `corona` discharge mechanism in the UV region.</p>
    <p num="14">As used herein, an excimer emitter is a device that is capable of causing the formation of a substance by the joining of two atoms (or two molecules of the same chemical composition) in an excited state.</p>
    <p num="15">For purposes of the present invention, an exciplex emitter is a device, which is capable of forming an electronically excited molecular complex, i.e., an excited state complex formed from different molecules, which is unstable in the ground state.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The emission wavelength of these emitters is determined by the composition of excimer-forming or exciplex-forming gas(es) contained therewithin.
      <br/>
      Excimer and exciplex emitters have the special property that they are very variable as to their shape and dimension and emit over a very narrow wavelength range.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, such emitters may therefore be selected and constructed in an optimum manner corresponding to the required reaction conditions in the context of the available gases and materials.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      As a consequence of using the emitters of the present invention, the amount of electric power required per kg of product is considerably reduced compared to conventional processes.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the monochromatic radiation of excimer or exciplex emitters leads to a considerable improvement in the purity of the product.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      With the emitters used in accordance with the present invention there are accordingly employed for the first time radiation sources which emit almost exclusively in the optimum wavelength range for the photochemical synthesis of previtamin D3.
      <br/>
      Such emitters are therefore well-suited light sources for the synthesis of previtamin D3 on an industrial scale.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In the present invention, excimer emitters may be filled with rare gas atoms or a mixture of rare gas atoms and halogen atoms, such as for example, XeBr or Br2 which emit photons at a wavelength of about 285 or about 292 nm.
      <br/>
      Such gasses are typical examples of emitters having an emission wavelength which lies in the optimum wavelength range required for the synthesis of previtamin D3 (i.e., about 280 to about 300 nm).
      <br/>
      The emission spectrum of the XeBr lamp is shown by way of example in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The exemplification of the XeBr lamp, however, is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any way.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In the case of the emitters that may be used in accordance with the invention, there are formed excimers (Br2) or exciplexes (XeBr) which on disintegration emit photons having the desired wavelength.
      <br/>
      Both types of emitters have been found to be good and efficient sources of radiation when used for photochemical synthesis of previtamin D3.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The process in accordance with the present invention may also be used to produce derivatives of previtamin D3 including hydroxylated or acylated forms thereof, such as for example, 1-hydroxy, or 25-hydroxy, or acyloxy previtamin D3.</p>
    <p num="22">The invention will now be further illustrated in the following non-limiting example representing presently preferred embodiments of the invention.</p>
    <p num="23">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="24">
      A 3.5% solution of 7-Dehydrocholesterol in a methanol/hexane mixture was irradiated with a XeBr lamp at 284 nm in a falling-film reactor as described in more detail below.
      <br/>
      The composition of the reaction system was determined at regular time intervals by high performance liquid chromatography.
      <br/>
      At this wavelength (284 nm) over 93% of the reaction mixture obtained consisted of the desired previtamin D3, with a conversion of about 50%.
      <br/>
      The starting material could be separated readily according to known methods.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Turning now to the figures, the apparatus shown in FIG. 1 includes a falling-film reactor 1 with an output line 2 directly connected to a receiver 3.
      <br/>
      The receiver contains most of the reaction mixture.
      <br/>
      A feed line 4 for the reaction mixture leads from the receiver to the falling-film reactor via a pump 5 and a heat exchanger 6.
      <br/>
      The falling-film reactor is equipped with lines for continuously flushing its interior with nitrogen.
    </p>
    <p num="26">The output line 2 is provided with a connection for continuous sampling of the reaction mixture.</p>
    <p num="27">
      The construction of the falling-film reactor 1 will be evident from the larger scale sectional view of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In particular, the falling film reactor has an outer cylindrical jacket 7 and a cylindrical quartz downpipe 8 coaxially disposed in the interior thereof.
      <br/>
      An excimer emitter 9 is placed in the middle of the reactor, also coaxially.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The reaction mixture enters the reactor from below and is conveyed upwards as a volume flow in the annular space between the jacket and the downpipe.
      <br/>
      From there, the mixture flows downwards as a film on the inside of the downpipe.
      <br/>
      The film is exposed to radiation 10 emitted by the emitter.
    </p>
    <p num="29">In the emission spectrum of the xenon bromide (XeBr) excimer emitter used in the apparatus and shown in FIG. 3, the abscissa axis gives the wavelength in nm of emitted radiation and the ordinate axis gives the relative intensity.</p>
    <p num="30">
      The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways.
      <br/>
      Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention and, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.
