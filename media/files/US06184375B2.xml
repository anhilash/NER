  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <p num="1">The invention relates to novel compounds of the hydroxyphenyl-s-triazine type containing one blocked and 2 free o-hydroxyl groups, to the use of these compounds for stabilizing organic material, especially in plastics, coating materials, cosmetic preparations, sun screen lotions or photographic material, against damage by light, oxygen and/or heat, and to correspondingly stabilized organic material.</p>
    <p num="2">
      When it is desired to increase the stability of an organic material, especially a coating, to light, it is common to add a light stabilizer.
      <br/>
      One very frequently employed class of light stabilizers are the UV absorbers, which protect the material by absorbing the harmful radiation via chromophores.
      <br/>
      One important group of UV absorbers are the triphenyl-s-triazines, as are described, inter alia, in the publications U.S. Pat. No. 3,118,887, U.S. Pat. No. 3,242,175, U.S. Pat. No. 3,244,708, GB-A-1 321 561, EP-A-0 434 608, U.S. Pat. No. 4,619,956, U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,749, U.S. Pat. No. 5,461,151, EP-A-0 704 437 and WO-96/28431.
    </p>
    <p num="3">Also known are individual compounds of the hydroxyphenyl-s-triazine type some or all of whose hydroxyl groups in ortho position are blocked (U.S. Pat. No. 3,113,940, U.S. Pat. No. 3,113,941, U.S. Pat. No. 3,113,942, GB-A-975 966, U.S. Pat. No. 3,249,608: U.S. Pat. No. 5,597,854, WO-94/05645).</p>
    <p num="4">
      Specific compounds from the class of the trisaryl-s-triazines have now been found which, surprisingly, possess particularly good stabilizer properties.
      <br/>
      The invention therefore provides a compound of the formula I  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)

      R1 -Hal can also be a mixture of reagents.

      Instead of the halide R1 -Hal it is also posisble to use one equivalent of a sulfate (1/2 R1 --O--SO2 --O--R1).

      If the intention is to introduce not only the radical --R1 but also another, different radical (R2 in the definition of --OR3) then it is judicious first of all to carry out reaction with the required number of equivalents of R3 -Hal, where R3 embraces the definitions given for R1, and base and then reaction with one equivalent of R1 -Hal.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The reaction is preferably carried out in an organic solvent, for example an aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon, alcohol, ether, ester or amide of appropriate boiling range; preferred solvents are toluene, xylene, propanol, butanol, 2-methoxyethanol, 2-ethoxyethanol, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
      <br/>
      Suitable bases are organic or, preferably, inorganic bases such as hydroxides, oxides or carbonates; important examples are alkali metal hydroxides and carbonates, such as KOH, NaOH, K2 CO3, Na2 CO3.
      <br/>
      The reaction temperature is usually in the range 80-180 (degree)  C., preferably in the range 100-150 (degree)  C. The reaction can also be carried out as a 2-phase reaction in the presence of phase transfer catalysts such as tetraalkylammonium salts, for example; in this case the halide or sulfate is usually-- and especially when it is employed as a pure alkylating reagent--present in the organic phase and the triazine precursor in the aqueous phase.

      These metal complexes may be in the free form or fixed on substrates, typically on activated magnesium chloride, titanium(III) chloride, alumina or silicon oxide.
      <br/>
      These catalysts may be soluble or insoluble in the polymerisation medium.
      <br/>
      The catalysts can be used by themselves in the polymerisation or further activators may be used, typically metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkyl halides, metal alkyl oxides or metal alkyloxanes, said metals being elements of groups Ia, IIa and/or IIIa of the Periodic Table.
      <br/>
      The activators may be modified conveniently with further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups.
      <br/>
      These catalyst systems are usually termed Phillips, Standard Oil Indiana, Ziegler (-Natta), TNZ (DuPont), metallocene or single site catalysts (SSC).

      The polymers of component (A) can be linear or branched.
      <br/>
      The shaping of these polymers takes place at a relatively high temperature; polycarbonate, for example, is injection molded at 220-330 (degree)  C. At these temperatures the majority of the customary light stabilizers and antioxidants are unstable and begin to break down.
      <br/>
      The abovementioned mixtures, however, are extremely temperature-stable and are therefore particularly suitable for stabilizing the polymers mentioned.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      Use in multicoat systems is also of interest.
      <br/>
      In this case a novel polymer composition having a relatively high content of novel stabilizer, for example 5-15% by weight, is applied in a thin coat (10-100  MU m) to a shaped article comprising a polymer which contains little or no stabilizer of the formula I. Application can take place at the same time as the shaping of the base structure, for example by coextrusion.
      <br/>
      Application can also be made, however, to the ready-shaped base structure, for example by lamination with a film or by coating with a solution.
      <br/>
      The outer coat or coats of the finished article have the function of a UV filter which protects the interior of the article against UV light.
      <br/>
      The outer coat contains preferably 5-15% by weight, in particular 5-10% by weight, of at least one compound of the formula I. The polymers stabilized in this way are notable for high weathering stability, and especially by high resistance to UV light.
      <br/>
      As a result, even when used outdoors, they retain their mechanical properties and their colour and their gloss over a long period.
    </p>
    <p num="156">Likewise particularly preferred organic materials are coating compositions and photographic material.</p>
    <p num="157">
      The invention therefore preferably also provides a composition in which the novel compound is incorporated in a thermoplastic polymer, a film-forming binder, especially one based on acrylic, alkyd, polyurethane, polyester or polyamide resin or appropriately modified resins, a photographic material or a cosmetic preparation, including a cosmetic hair preparation, for example a cosmetic or a suncream.
      <br/>
      The material to be protected (component A) can in this case be, for example, a thermoplastic polymer, a film-forming binder, especially one based on acrylic, alkyd, polyurethane, polyester or polyamide resin or appropriately modified resins, a photographic material, or human or animal skin or hair.
    </p>
    <p num="158">
      The use of the novel compounds as stabilizers for coatings, for example for paints, is of particular interest.

      The invention also therefore provides those compositions whose component A is a film-forming binder.
    </p>
    <p num="159">The novel coating composition contains preferably 0.01-10 parts by weight, especially 0.05-10 parts by weight and, in particular, 0.1-5 parts by weight of the novel stabilizer B per 100 parts by weight of solid binder A.</p>
    <p num="160">Multicoat systems are also possible here, in which the concentration of the compound of the formula I (component B) in the top layer can be higher, for example from 1 to 15 parts by weight, especially 3-10 parts by weight of B per 100 parts by weight of solid binder A.</p>
    <p num="161">
      The use of the compound of the formula I as a stabilizer in coatings brings with it the additional advantage that delamination, i.e. the flaking of the coating from the substrate, is prevented.
      <br/>
      This advantage is particularly manifest in the case of metallic substrates, even in the case of multicoat systems on metallic substrates.

      In this case the binder consists essentially of monomeric or oligomeric compounds having ethylenically unsaturated bonds (prepolymers), which after application are cured, i.e. converted into a crosslinked, high molecular mass form, by actinic radiation.
      <br/>
      Where the system is a UV-curing system, it generally also includes a photoinitiator.
      <br/>
      Appropriate systems are described in the abovementioned publication Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th ed., Vol. A18, pages 451-453.

    </p>
    <p num="183">The coatings obtained in accordance with the invention possess an outstanding resistance to the damaging effects of light, oxygen and heat; particular mention should be made of the good light stability and weathering stability of the resulting coatings, for example paints.</p>

      The invention in addition comprises a process for stabilizing a coating based on organic polymers against damage by light, oxygen and/or heat, which comprises mixing with the coating composition a compound of the formula I, and provides for the use of compounds of the formula I in coating compositions as stabilizers against damage e by light, oxygen and/or heat.

      The novel compounds of the formula I are also particularly suitable as UV filters for protecting the skin and the hair of humans and animals against the damaging action of UV radiation.

The insoluble novel UV absorbers can be brought to the desired particle size by customary methods, for example grinding with, for example, a jet, ball, vibration or hammer mill.

      Grinding is preferably carried out in the presence of from 0.1 to 30, preferably from 0.5 to 15% by weight, based on the UV absorber, of a grinding assistant such as, for example, an alkylated vinylpyrrolidone polymer, a vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, an acylglutamate or, in particular, a phospholipid.

      In addition to the novel UV absorbers, the cosmetic compositions may also include one or more other UV protection agents, for example triazines, oxanilides, triazoles or vinyl-containing amides or cinnamamides.

      Such protectants are described, for example, in GB-A-2,286,774 or else are known from Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries (107), 50 ff (1992).

      <br/>
      As a water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsion the cosmetically compatible auxiliary contains preferably from 5 to 50% of an oil phase, from 5 to 20% of an emulsifier and from 30 to 90% of water.

    <p num="199">
      Other materials to be stabilized with the novel compositions are recording materials.

    <p num="202">
      The novel recording materials have a structure which is known per se and which corresponds to the utility.
      <br/>
      They consist of a base, for example paper or plastic film, on which one or more coatings are applied.
      <br/>
      Depending on the type of material, these coats contain the suitable components required, in the case of photographic material for example silver halide emulsions, colour couplers, dyes and the like.
      <br/>
      The material intended especially for ink-jet printing has a customary base on which there is an absorption layer suitable for ink.
      <br/>
      Uncoated paper can likewise be employed for ink-jet printing; in this case, the paper functions simultaneously as a base and has the absorbent for the ink.
      <br/>
      Suitable material for ink-jet printing is described, inter alia, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,448, the disclosure content of which is regarded as part of the present description.

    <p num="203">The recording material can also be transparent, for example in the case of projection films.</p>
    <p num="204">
      The compound or compounds of the formula I can be incorporated into the material even in the course of manufacture; in papermaking, for example, by addition to the pulp.

      Another method of use is the spraying of the material with an aqueous solution of compound(s) of the formula I, or the addition thereof to the coating.

    <p num="207">The coating is usually prepared as follows:</p>
    <p num="208">
      The water-soluble components, for example the binder, are dissolved in water and mixed.
      <br/>
      The solid components, for example fillers and other additives as already described, are dispersed in this aqueous medium.
      <br/>
      Dispersion is advantageously brought about with the aid of equipment such as ultrasonic devices, turbine agitators, homogenizers, colloid mills, bead mills, sand mills, high-speed stirrers and the like.

      A particular advantage of the compounds of the formula I is their ease of incorporation into the coating.

    <p num="211">The compounds of the formula I can also be employed in recording materials which are based on the principle of photopolymerization, photosoftening or the rupture of microcapsules, or when heat-sensitive or photosensitive diazonium salts, leuco dyes with oxidizing agent or colour lactones with Lewis acids are used.</p>
    <p num="212">
      Heat-sensitive recording material exploits the colour-imparting reaction between a colourless or weakly coloured base dye and an organic or inorganic colour developer, the recorded image being produced by heat-induced contact of the two materials.
      <br/>
      This type of heat-sensitive recording material is very widespread, not only as the recording medium for faxes, computers, etc., but also in many other fields, for example in label printing.
    </p>
    <p num="213">
      The heat-sensitive recording material according to the present invention is composed of a base, a heat-sensitive colour-forming recording layer on this base, and, optionally, a protective layer on the heat-sensitive, colour-forming recording layer.
      <br/>
      The heat-sensitive, colour-forming recording layer contains as its principal constituent a colour-imparting compound and a colour-developing compound, and also a compound of the formula (I).
      <br/>
      If the said protective layer is present, the compound of the formula (I) can also be incorporated into the protective layer.
    </p>
    <p num="214">Heat-sensitive recording materials are described, for example, in JP-A 8-267 915.</p>
    <p num="215">
      Further fields of use are recording materials for dye diffusion transfer printing, thermal wax transfer printing and dot matrix printing, and for use with electrostatic, electrographic, electrophoretic, magnetographic and laser-electrophotographic printers, recorders or plotters.
      <br/>
      Of the materials mentioned, preference is given to recording materials for dye diffusion transfer printing, as are described, for example, in EP-A-507,734.
    </p>
    <p num="216">
      Compounds of the formula I can also be employed in inks, preferably for ink-jet printing, for example those as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,098,477, the disclosure content of which is regarded as part of the present description.
      <br/>
      The invention therefore also provides an ink comprising at least one compound of the formula I as stabilizer.
      <br/>
      The ink, especially for ink-jet printing, contains preferably water.
      <br/>
      Inks contain the stabilizer of the formula I usually in a concentration of from 0.01 to 20% by weight, in particular from 0.5 to 10% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="217">
      The novel recording materials, for example photographic recording materials, also offer the advantage over materials comprising conventional UV absorbers that the UVAs of the formula (I) are required in a comparatively small amount, meaning also that the thickness of the UVA-containing layer remains low, a factor which has a positive effect, inter alia, on the imaging properties.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of the novel stabilizers is their heightened inherent stability under extreme climatic conditions, especially at high humidity and high temperature.
      <br/>
      The novel photographic material can be a black and white or a colour photographic material; colour photographic material is preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="218">Examples of colour photographic materials are colour negative films, colour reversal films, colour positive films, colour photographic paper, colour reversal photographic paper, colour-sensitive materials for the dye diffusion transfer process or the silver dye bleach process.</p>
    <p num="219">
      Examples of suitable bases for the production of colour photographic materials are films and sheets of semisynthetic and synthetic polymers, such as cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate, cellulose butyrate, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate and polycarbonate, and paper laminated with a barytes layer or an a-olefin polymer layer (e.g. polyethylene).
      <br/>
      These bases can have been coloured with dyes or pigments, for example titanium dioxide.
      <br/>
      They can also have been coloured black for the purposes of light shielding.
      <br/>
      The surface of the base is generally subjected to a treatment for improving the adhesion of the photographic emulsion layer, for example corona discharge with subsequent application of a substrate layer.
    </p>
    <p num="220">
      The novel material preferably comprises the silver halide emulsion layers starting from the base, in the sequence blue-sensitive, green-sensitive and red-sensitive layer.
      <br/>
      In the novel colour photographic material the UV absorber is preferably in a layer above the green-sensitive layer, particularly preferably in a layer above the silver halide emulsion layer(s).
    </p>
    <p num="221">The novel UV absorber is preferably present in the photographic material in an amount of from 0.001 to 10 g per m2, for example from 0.1 to 8 g/m2, especially from 0.005 to 6 and, in particular, from 0.01 to 4 g/m2.</p>
    <p num="222">The novel colour photographic recording material is preferably a material having the following layer sequence:</p>
    <p num="223">
      --
      <br/>
      -- a                       a: Protective layer

      -- b                       b: Interlayer (may be absent)
      <br/>
      -- c                       c: Red-sensitive layer

    </p>
    <p num="224">
      Another example is a material having a similar layer structure but in which layer a is absent.
      <br/>
      The novel UV absorber of the formula (I), in the layer sequence depicted, is present judiciously, for example, in at least one of layers a-e, preferably in layer a, b, c and/or d, especially in a, b and/or c, and in particular in a and/or b.

      Very particularly preferred photographic recording material comprises at least one each of a red-sensitive, a green-sensitive and a blue-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and also at least two interlayers between the aforementioned layers and a protective layer, where at least one compound of the formula (I) is present in at least one layer above the green-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, and the silver halide emulsion layers contain dark-storage stabilizers and/or light stabilizers.
    </p>
    <p num="226">Essential constituents of the colour-photographic emulsion layers are binders, silver halide particles and colour couplers.</p>
    <p num="227">Of especial interest, for example, is a colour photographic recording material comprising. on a base, at least one blue-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing at least one yellow coupler, at least one green-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing at least one magenta coupler, at least one red-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing at least one cyan coupler, and customary top layer(s) and interlayer(s), at least one of the layers comprising a compound of the formula (I).</p>
    <p num="228">
      The photographic emulsions can be spectrally sensitized using methine dyes or other dyes.
      <br/>
      Particularly suitable dyes are cyanine dyes and merocyanine dyes, including complex merocyanine dyes.
    </p>
    <p num="229">An overview of the polymethine dyes which are suitable as spectral sensitizers, their appropriate combinations and supersensitizing combinations is given in Research Disclosure 17643 (Dec. 1978), Chapter IV.</p>
    <p num="230">
      The differently sensitized emulsion layers are allocated non-diffusing monomeric or polymeric colour couplers, which may be located in the same layer or in an adjacent layer.
      <br/>
      It is common to assign cyan couplers to the red-sensitive layers, magenta couplers to the green-sensitive layers and yellow couplers to the blue-sensitive layers.

    <p num="281">The present invention additionally provides a method of stabilizing photographic recording material comprising, on a base, at least one silver-halide emulsion layer and, if desired, at least one interlayer and/or one protective layer, which comprises adding a UV absorber of the formula (I) to at least one of the said layers.</p>
    <p num="282">The present invention also provides for the use of compounds of the formula (I) for stabilizing photographic recording material comprising, on a base, at least one silver halide emulsion layer and, if desired, at least one interlayer and/or one protective layer.</p>
    <p num="283">The preferences described earlier above in connection with the novel compounds of the formula (I) apply analogously to the novel compositions, the novel method and the novel use.</p>
    <p num="284">
      Incorporation into the organic material to be stabilized can take place, for example, by mixing or applying the compounds of the formula I and any other additives by methods customary in the art.
      <br/>
      Where the materials are polymers, especially synthetic polymers, incorporation can take place prior to or during shaping, or by applying the dissolved or dispersed compound to the polymer, with or without subsequent evaporation of the solvent.
      <br/>
      In the case of elastomers, these can also be stabilized as latices.
      <br/>
      A further option for incorporating the compounds of the formula I into polymers is to add them prior to, during or directly after the polymerization of the corresponding monomers and/or prior to crosslinking.
      <br/>
      In this context the compounds of the formula I can be added as they are or else in encapsulated form (for example in waxes, oils or polymers).
      <br/>
      In the case of addition prior to or during polymerization the compounds of the formula I may also act as a regulator of the chain length of the polymers (chain terminators).
    </p>
    <p num="285">The compounds of the formula I can also be added in the form of a masterbatch which contains this compound, for example, in a concentration of from 2.5 to 25% by weight, to the polymers that are to be stabilized.</p>
    <p num="286">
      The compounds of the formula I can judiciously be incorporated by the following methods:
      <br/>
      as an emulsion or dispersion (e.g. to latices or emulsion polymers),
      <br/>
