      A method and apparatus prints copies of internet pages from the worldwide web, in accordance with operator-selected formatting instructions.
      <br/>
      A plurality of internet page record locators are selected and recorded in memory of the data processing system, preferably grouped in a directory such as a Bookmark, Favorite, or Hotlist directory.
      <br/>
      Operator-specified formatting instructions are then obtained.
      <br/>
      The formatting instructions may relate to attributes such as page headers, page footers, page break location, pagination, cover sheets, table of contents, the content allocation and placement among the printed pages, as well as the presence or absence of internet identification titles, and the presence or absence of visually perceptible internet links or internet icons from the Internet pages.
      <br/>
      Finally, the formatted internet pages are printed, utilizing the printer associated with the data processing system, in accordance with the particular operator-selected format requirements which are associated with the selected internet pages.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates in general to the utilization of data processing systems for generating printed materials, and in particular to the utilization of data processing systems for generating printed copies of worldwide web pages.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Commercial use of the worldwide web (www) is likely to increase considerably as greater numbers of computer users subscribe to on-ramp and other service providers.
      <br/>
      The web is now widely regarded as the most important new frontier in advertising and marketing, principally due to the beneficial integration of text and graphics available through the web, and to the emergence of relatively low cost web browser software and plug-in software that facilitate searching, retrieving, and sorting of web materials, including the text and graphics.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      However, the web is not likely to supplant entirely the use of printed advertising, promotional, proposal, and sales materials.
      <br/>
      Presently, the web does not readily accommodate such a commercial reality.
      <br/>
      A few web sites dually maintain a postscript duplication of the HTML file for the purpose of allowing printing by web users.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a few plug-in modules provide high quality printing formats which facilitate the printing of the HTML files.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The principal problem with both of these prior art approaches is that each assumes that every user wants the same document in exactly the same format and with the same contents.
      <br/>
      Currently, using a web browser, it is possible to dynamically build a custom document whose table of contents is defined (depending upon the particular browser) by a hot list file, a quick list file, or a bookmark file, etc.
      <br/>
      This list of bookmarks may reference remote data on the internet or local data on a drive or other memory media.
      <br/>
      However, this approach has two significant disadvantages: (1) printing documents is currently quite time-consuming, (2) the finished printouts lack continuity from one page to the next page, and (3) the images and text of the internet pages may be broken or separated, rendering the printed document unprofessional looking.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">It is one objective of the present invention to combine advantageously the beneficial integration of text and images available through the worldwide web with the powerful and commonly available web-browsers and other software, in order to facilitate the generation of printed ("hard copy") advertising, promotional, proposal, business, and sales documents.</p>
    <p num="8">It is another objective of the present invention to allow for the generation of such printed material without the lengthy delays associated with printing operations of the prior art, and without the pagination and format problems of the prior art.</p>
    <p num="9">
      These and other objectives are achieved as is now described.
      <br/>
      A method and apparatus is provided for generating printed copies of internet pages from the worldwide web, using a data processing system and an associated printer, in accordance with operator-selected formatting instructions.
      <br/>
      A plurality of internet page record locators are selected and recorded in memory of the data processing system.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the internet page record locators are grouped in a directory in a graphical user interface for the data processing system, such as the "Bookmark", "Favorite", and "Hotlist" functions currently available in the commercially available web browsers.
      <br/>
      A computer program is provided which receives operator input for selection for printing of particular internet pages, which are associated with corresponding particular ones of the plurality of internet page record locators.
      <br/>
      The data processing system is utilized for retrieving particular internet pages, utilizing the corresponding particular ones of the plurality of internet page record locators.
      <br/>
      The pages may be retrieved from the worldwide web, a local or wide area network, or the local memory media associated with the particular data processing system being utilized by the operator.
      <br/>
      Next, operator input is received for determining operator-selected format requirements.
      <br/>
      The format requirements may relate to any one of a number of predetermined print format attributes, such as page headers, page footers, page break location, pagination, cover sheets, table of contents, the content allocation and placement among the printed pages, as well as the presence or absence of internet identification titles, and the presence or absence of visually perceptible internet links or internet icons within the internet pages.
      <br/>
      Of course, any other conventional or novel format attribute can also be set or determined by the operator-selected format requirements.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the operator interacts with the data processing system in order to determine what particular format he or she desires for the particular printed pages.
      <br/>
      Finally, the formatted internet pages are printed, utilizing the printer associated with the data processing system, in accordance with the particular operator-selected format requirements which are associated with the selected internet pages.

      FIG. 3 is a block diagram and pictorial representation of the method and apparatus of the present invention for generating hard copy printouts of worldwide web pages, shown in broad overview.
      <br/>
      Graphical user interface directory file 202 is provided as a component of a graphical user interface in the data processing system 110 of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      It includes a plurality of internet page record locators 212.
      <br/>
      In accordance with one particular embodiment of the present invention, the internet page record locators 212 may comprise universal record locators (URLs).
      <br/>
      URLs are commonly used through commercially available web browsers, and are utilized to allow internet users to assemble a directory of their favorite or most commonly used internet sites.
      <br/>
      Typically, the directory is visible in the graphical user interface of the web browser, and provides a graphical or iconographical representation of the particular web sites selected by the operator.
      <br/>
      The operator need only "click on" a particular one of the universal record locators, and the web browser will quickly and automatically access and display the particular web page or pages associated with the URL.
      <br/>
      The most popular web browser software packages utilize different names to describe the graphical user interface directory file 212.
      <br/>
      In the web browser distributed under the name INTERNET EXPLORER, the interface directory file is described as a "Favorites" file.
      <br/>
      In the browser software distributed under the registered trademark NETSCAPE, the interface directory file is identified as a "Bookmarks" file.
      <br/>
      In the browser software package distributed under the name MOSAIC, the interface directory file is identified as a "Hotlist" file.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the present invention, there is a software connection 203 between graphical user interface directory file 202 and the formatter program 204 of the present invention, which allows the user to utilize the listing of the graphical user interface directory file 202 as a directory of pages that are available for hard copy printout in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The formatter program 204 is communicatively connected through output link 205 and input link 207 to internet page source 206.
      <br/>
      Internet page source 206 may comprise the worldwide web 40, the hard disk or other memory media of data processing system 110, or any other memory media within any local area network, or wide area network, that data processing system 110 is communicatively connected to (which can be identified as "intranet sources 8").
      <br/>
      The formatter program 204 of the present invention is adapted to receive operator input for selection for printing of particular internet pages which are associated with corresponding particular ones of the plurality of internet page record locators 212 of graphical user interface directory file 202.
      <br/>
      Formatter program 204 is also adapted to retrieve the particular internet pages utilizing the corresponding particular ones of the plurality of internet page record locators 212 from the internet page source 202.
      <br/>
      An example of the format and content of a universal record location is as follows: http://www.AS400.ibm.com. An example of a record locator that may be utilized on the hard disk or other memory media of data processing system 110 is as follows: File///c:.backslash.windows.backslash.html.backslash.fancy.htm. Formatter program 204 is also utilized to receive the operator input for operator-selected format requirements.
      <br/>
      The operator-selected format requirements may constitute any format decision which would affect the appearance of the internet pages.
      <br/>
      This allows the operator to utilize internet pages to create printed materials, which may be utilized in any number of conventional business activities, such as generating sales, promotional, or proposal materials.
      <br/>
      As is shown, the formatter program 204 is connected through printing link 209 to printer 208.
      <br/>
      Printer 208 is utilized to print hard copies of the reformatted or altered internet pages.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the present invention, this process is repeated for all of the internet pages desired for printing.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      FIG. 4 is a block diagram and flowchart representation of the formatter program 204 of FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The process begins at software block 211, wherein data processing system 110 prompts the operator for selection of internet pages desired for hard copy printing.
      <br/>
      In response to the prompt, the operator selects one or more of the internet page record locators 212 of the graphical user interface directory file 202.
      <br/>
      The record locators are communicated via communication link 203 to the formatter program 204.
      <br/>
      Next, in accordance with software block 214, the data processing system 110 prompts the operator for the selection or creation of a cover page.
      <br/>
      The operator may create his/her cover page from scratch or may utilize one or more exemplary cover pages which may be modified and then used.
      <br/>
      Software block 216 represents the one or more exemplary cover pages which are provided to the operator for review.
      <br/>
      Once the user has completed the task of creating or modifying the cover page, in accordance with software block 220, the cover page is added to the graphical user interface directory file 202.
      <br/>
      As is shown in FIG. 4, a brief text component is added to the graphical user interface directory file 202, such as text 221.
      <br/>
      The process continues in software block 222, wherein the operator is prompted to add user-defined headers and footers to the selected internet page.
      <br/>
      A library of headers 224 and a library of footers 226 are provided to the operator for use and modification.
      <br/>
      Then, in accordance with software block 228, the operator is prompted to insert any page breaks.
      <br/>
      The operator-determined page breaks are recorded in the graphical user interface directory file 202.
      <br/>
      For example, the group 212 of internet page record locators (URL 2, URL 2.1, and URL 2.2) define three separate pages for printing which have been derived from a single internet page, which is formally identified as "URL 2".
      <br/>
      The graphical user interface directory file 202 is modified to provide visual feedback to the user that a single internet page has been separated into two or more internet pages for printing.
      <br/>
      Next, in accordance with software block 232, the formatter program 204 of FIG. 3 is utilized to automatically extract all worldwide web titles, such as "HTML" titles, to recalculate the page numbers and to generate a table of contents 234.
      <br/>
      The graphical user interface directory file 202 is modified to include an identification 236 of the table of contents 234.
      <br/>
      Once this process has been repeated for all internet pages selected by the user, the data processing system 110 may print the hard copies of the internet pages in accordance with software block 238.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
