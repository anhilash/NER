    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a heat transport system, which can be used as refrigerant circuitry for an air conditioning system, for example.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to a heat transport system for transporting heat by circulating a heat transport medium without requiring a driving source such as a pump.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      As refrigerant circuitry for an air conditioning system, two-system refrigerant circuitry, such as that disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 62-238951, has conventionally been known.
      <br/>
      Refrigerant circuitry of this type includes: a primary refrigerant circuit in which a compressor, a heat exchanger on a first heat source side, a pressure reducing mechanism and a heat exchanger on a first application side are sequentially connected to each other through a refrigerant pipe; and a secondary refrigerant circuit in which a pump, a heat exchanger on a second heat source side and a heat exchanger on a second application side are connected to each other through a refrigerant pipe.
    </p>
    <p num="4">And, heat is exchanged between the heat exchanger on the first application side of the primary refrigerant circuit and the heat exchanger on the second heat source side of the secondary refrigerant circuit, and the heat exchanger on the second application side is disposed within a room to be air-conditioned.</p>
    <p num="5">
      In this refrigerant circuitry, during the room cooling running, a refrigerant is evaporated in the heat exchanger on the first application side and is condensed in the heat exchanger on the second heat source side.
      <br/>
      In the heat exchanger on the second application side, the condensed refrigerant exchanges heat with the indoor air and is evaporated, thereby cooling the indoor air.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      On the other hand, during the room heating running, a refrigerant is condensed in the heat exchanger on the first application side and is evaporated in the heat exchanger on the second heat source side.
      <br/>
      In the heat exchanger on the second application side, the evaporated refrigerant exchanges heat with the indoor air and is condensed, thereby heating the indoor air.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In this way, the piping length of the primary refrigerant circuit is intentionally shortened, thereby trying to improve the refrigerating capacity.</p>
    <p num="8">
      However, in such an arrangement, a pump is required as a discrete driving source for circulating the refrigerant in the secondary refrigerant circuit.
      <br/>
      As a result, the power consumption and the like are increased.
      <br/>
      In addition, since such a driving source is required, the number of parts having such factors as to cause some failure is increased and thus the reliability of the entire system is adversely deteriorated.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      As refrigerant circuitry for overcoming these problems, there exists a heat transport system of a so-called "non-powered" heat transport type, in which no driving source is provided for a secondary refrigerant circuit.
      <br/>
      The heat transport systems of such a type include a system disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 63-180022. In the heat transport system, the secondary refrigerant circuit is constructed such that a heater, a condenser and a sealed container are sequentially connected to each other through a refrigerant pipe and that the sealed container is disposed at a position higher than that of the heater.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the heater and the sealed container are connected to each other through an equalizer pipe including an opening/closing valve.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In such an arrangement, during the room heating running, the opening/closing valve is first closed.
      <br/>
      The gaseous refrigerant heated by the heater is condensed in the condenser so as to be liquefied.
      <br/>
      Then, the liquid refrigerant is recovered into the sealed container.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the opening/closing valve is opened, the pressure in the heater is equalized by the equalizer pipe with the pressure in the sealed container, and then the liquid refrigerant is recovered from the sealed container, disposed at a position higher than that of the heater, to the heater.
    </p>
    <p num="11">By repeating this operation, the circulation of the refrigerant is enabled without providing any driving source such as a pump for the secondary refrigerant circuit.</p>
    <p num="12">(Problems to be solved)</p>
    <p num="13">
      However, in such a heat transport system, if the gaseous refrigerant flows from the condenser into the sealed container, then the pressure in the sealed container rises, As a result, there is some possibility that the operation of circulating the refrigerant cannot be performed satisfactorily.
      <br/>
      Thus, the condenser is required to excessively cool the refrigerant so that the gaseous refrigerant does not flow out from the condenser.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Moreover, the heat transport system ameliorates the inner structure of the sealed container so as to suppress a rise in pressure within the sealed container.
      <br/>
      However, the system cannot be regarded as attaining sufficient reliability.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Furthermore, if the liquid refrigerant is to be introduced into the sealed container with certainty in this manner, then the condenser is required to be disposed at a position higher than that of the sealed container.
      <br/>
      Thus, since undue restriction is imposed on the positions where the respective units are disposed, it has been difficult to apply such a system to a large-scale system or a system having a long pipe.
    </p>
    <p num="16">In view of this point, the present invention has been made in order to accomplish an objective of alleviating the restriction on the positions where units are disposed and attaining high reliability and universality for a heat transport system of a non-powered heat transport type requiring no driving source.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      In order to accomplish the above-described objective, according to the present invention, a refrigerant in a refrigerant circuit on an application side is pressurized, and is circulated in the refrigerant circuit on the application side by utilizing this pressure.
      <br/>
      In addition, the direction in which the refrigerant circulates is controlled such that heat exchange means on the application side can perform a predetermined operation.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Specifically, as shown in FIG. 1, the first solution provided by the present invention includes a refrigerant circuit (B) constituted such that heat exchange means (1) on a heat source side is connected to heat exchange means (3) on an application side through a gas pipe (6) and a liquid pipe (7) so as to circulate a refrigerant therein, the heat exchange means (1) on the heat source side exchanging heat with heat source means (A).</p>
    <p num="19">
      And tank means (T) for communicating with the liquid pipe (7) and reserving a liquid refrigerant therein is also provided.
      <br/>
      And pressure regulating means (18) for alternately performing a pressurizing operation for raising an internal pressure of the tank means (T) and a pressure reducing operation for lowering the internal pressure is further provided.
    </p>
    <p num="20">In addition, refrigerant control means (H) is further provided for allowing only a supply of the liquid refrigerant from the tank means (T) to any of the heat exchange means to be an evaporator during the pressurizing operation of the pressure regulating means (18) and allowing only a recovery of the liquid refrigerant from any of the heat exchange means to be a condenser to the tank means (T) during the pressure reducing operation thereof, thereby circulating the refrigerant of the refrigerant circuit (B) and making the heat exchange means (3) on the application side absorb or radiate heat.</p>
    <p num="21">
      In the first solution, the liquid refrigerant is supplied from the tank means (T) to the heat exchange means to be an evaporator during the pressurizing operation of the pressure regulating means (18).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, during the pressure reducing operation of the pressure regulating means (18), the liquid refrigerant is recovered from the heat exchange means to be a condenser to the tank means (T).
      <br/>
      Thus, the refrigerant is circulated in a predetermined direction between the heat exchange means (1) on the heat source side and the heat exchange means (3) on the application side and the heat absorption or radiation is caused in the heat exchange means (3) on the application side.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In this manner, the refrigerant is circulated by utilizing the pressure applied from the pressure regulating means (18) to the tank means (T).
      <br/>
      Also, the recovery of the liquid refrigerant from the heat exchange means to be a condenser to the tank means (T) is performed by a low pressure generated in the tank means (T).
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Thus, in accordance with the first solution, since a high-pressure state and a low-pressure state are alternately and switchably established in the tank means (T) connected to the liquid pipe .(7) and the refrigerant is circulated between the heat exchange means (1) on the heat source side and the heat exchange means (3) on the application side by utilizing this pressure, special transport means, such as a refrigerant circulating pump for circulating the refrigerant is no longer necessary.
      <br/>
      As a result, the power consumption and the number of parts having such factors as to cause a failure can be reduced and the reliability of the entire system can be ensured.
    </p>
    <p num="24">In addition, since the liquid refrigerant in the heat exchange means to be a condenser is sucked by utilizing the low pressure of the tank means (T), the conventional restriction on the positions where units are disposed, such as disposing the tank means (T) at a lower position than that of the heat exchange means, can be eliminated, thereby improving the practicality.</p>
    <p num="25">
      Moreover, since the refrigerant circulation operation in the refrigerant circuit (B) can be performed stably, the refrigerant can be circulated satisfactorily even when the entire circuitry is formed in a large size.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the system can be enlarged.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In the second solution provided by the present invention, the first solution is modified such that the heat exchange means (3) on the application side functions as an evaporator for absorbing heat as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The refrigerant control means (H) allows the liquid refrigerant to be supplied from the tank means (T) to the heat exchange means (3) on the application side and prevents the liquid refrigerant from being supplied from the tank means (T) to the heat exchange means (1) on the heat source side during the pressurizing operation of the pressure regulating means (18), and allows the liquid refrigerant to be recovered from the heat exchange means (1) on the heat source side to the tank means (T) and prevents the liquid refrigerant from being recovered from the heat exchange means (3) on the application side to the tank means (T) during the pressure reducing operation of the pressure regulating means (18).
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In the second solution, during the heat absorption running of the heat exchange means (3) on the application side, the liquid refrigerant is supplied from the tank means (T) to the heat exchange means (3) on the application side, and is evaporated in the heat exchange means (3) on the application side.
      <br/>
      And the gaseous refrigerant is condensed in the heat exchange means (1) on the heat source side and then recovered into the tank means (T).

      Thus, in such a case, respective units can be disposed without receiving such restriction as disposing the tank means (T) at a position lower than that of the condenser.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      In addition, the internal pressure of the tank means (T) can be changed only by switching the communication/non-communication states between the pressure reducing means (60) and the tank means (T).
      <br/>
      Thus, if a solenoid valve or the like is employed for a closed circuit formed by the pressure reducing means (60) and the tank means (T), the refrigerant circulation operation can be performed only by opening/closing the valve.
      <br/>
      As a result, high reliability is realized and the number of parts having such factors as to cause some failure can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="86">In the twenty-seventh solution provided by the present invention, the first solution is modified such that, firstly, the pressure regulating means (18) includes: pressurizing means (50) for performing a pressurizing operation of pushing the liquid refrigerant in the tank means (T) to the liquid pipe (7) by raising the internal pressure of the tank means (T); and pressure reducing means (60) for performing a pressure reducing operation of recovering the liquid refrigerant from the liquid pipe (7) to the tank means (T) by lowering the internal pressure of the tank means (T), as shown in Figure 23.</p>
    <p num="87">
      And, the pressurizing means (50) includes a circulating evaporator (51), which is connected to the tank means (T) and which raises the internal pressure of the tank means (T) by evaporating the refrigerant.
      <br/>
      An evaporating pressure of the circulating evaporator (51) is set higher than an evaporating pressure of the heat exchange means to be the evaporator.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      In the twenty-seventh solution, owing to the evaporation of the refrigerant in the circulating evaporator (51), a high pressure is built up inside the tank means (T).
      <br/>
      And, since this pressure is higher than the evaporating pressure of the heat exchange means to be an evaporator, the liquid refrigerant is supplied from the tank means (T) to the evaporator.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      In accordance with the twenty-seventh solution, by evaporating the refrigerant in the circulating evaporator (51) of the pressurizing means (50) connected to the tank means (T), a high pressure for supplying the liquid refrigerant from the tank means (T) to the evaporator can be generated.
      <br/>
      Thus, in such a case, restriction on the installation positions of the tank means (T) and the evaporator can be eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      In addition, according to this invention, the internal pressure of the tank means (T) can also be changed only by switching the communication/non-communication states between the pressurizing means (50) and the tank means (T).
      <br/>
      As a result, high reliability is realized and the number of parts having such factors as to cause some failure can be reduced.

    <p num="91">In the twenty-eighth solution provided by the present invention, the twenty-seventh solution is modified such that, firstly, auxiliary tank means (ST) is provided above the circulating evaporator (51) as shown in FIG. 26. And selector means (I) is also provided for recovering the liquid refrigerant in the liquid pipe (7) to the auxiliary tank means (ST) by making the auxiliary tank means (ST) communicate with the pressure reducing means (60) and the liquid pipe (7) during the pressure reducing operation of the pressure reducing means (60) and for dripping and supplying the liquid refrigerant in the auxiliary tank means (ST) to the circulating evaporator (51) by making the auxiliary tank means (ST) communicate with the pressurizing means (50) during the pressurizing operation of the pressurizing means (50).</p>
    <p num="92">
      In the twenty-eighth solution, if the auxiliary tank means (ST) of a relatively small size is disposed above the circulating evaporator (51), the liquid refrigerant can be supplied to the circulating evaporator (51).
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to eliminate a situation where the circulation of a refrigerant is disabled by the exhaustion of the liquid refrigerant in the circulating evaporator (51).
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      In accordance with the twenty-eighth solution, the auxiliary tank means (ST) is provided above the circulating evaporator (51) and the liquid refrigerant to be supplied to the circulating evaporator (51) is temporarily reserved in the auxiliary tank means (ST).
      <br/>
      Thus, a sufficient amount of liquid refrigerant can be supplied to the circulating evaporator (51) without receiving any restriction on the installation positions of the tank means (T) and the circulating evaporator (51) in the vertical direction.

    <p num="94">In the twenty-ninth solution provided by the present invention, the twenty-seventh solution is modified such that, firstly, at least one first auxiliary tank means (ST1) and at least one second auxiliary tank means (ST2) are provided above the circulating evaporator (51) as shown in FIG. 27. And, a selector means (I) is also provided for selecting a first selection state in which the liquid refrigerant in the liquid pipe (7) is recovered to the first auxiliary tank means (ST1) by making the first auxiliary tank means (ST1) communicate with the pressure reducing means (60) and the liquid pipe (7) and in which the liquid refrigerant in the second auxiliary tank means (ST2) is dripped and supplied to the circulating evaporator (51) by making the second auxiliary tank means (ST2) communicate with the pressurizing means (50) or a second selection state in which the liquid refrigerant in the liquid pipe (7) is recovered to the second auxiliary tank means (ST2) by making the second auxiliary tank means (ST2) communicate with the pressure reducing means (60) and the liquid pipe (7) and in which the liquid refrigerant in the first auxiliary tank means (ST1) is dripped and supplied to the circulating evaporator (51) by making the first auxiliary tank means (ST1) communicate with the pressurizing means (50).</p>

      As indicated by the one-dot-chain arrows in FIG. 22, the liquid refrigerant in the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side is recovered into the tank (T) through the liquid pipe (7).

      When the pressurizing operation is started by the above-described pressurizing circuit (50) from such a state, the pressure in the entire pressurizing circuit (50) is equalized.

      The refrigerant circuit of this embodiment is applied to an air conditioning system exclusively used for heating.
      <br/>
      The arrangement of the primary refrigerant circuit (A) and the arrangement of a check valve provided for the liquid pipe (7) are different from the counterparts of the eleventh embodiment described above.
    </p>
    <p num="333">
      Specifically, as shown in FIG. 23, the heating heat exchanger (71) and the heat exchanger (12) on the primary heat source side are connected in this order to the outlet side of the compressor (11) in the primary refrigerant circuit (A).
      <br/>
      The liquid side of the heat exchanger (12) on the primary heat source side is branched into a first branch pipe (16c) and a second branch pipe (16d).

      <br/>
      The gas sides of the outdoor heat exchanger (14) and the cooling heat exchanger (72) are combined with each other and connected to the inlet side of the compressor (11).
    </p>
    <p num="334">
      On the other hand, a first check valve (CV3) allowing only the liquid refrigerant to flow from the tank (T) into the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side is provided between the tank (T) and the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side in the liquid pipe (7) in the secondary refrigerant circuit (B).
      <br/>
      A second check valve (CV4) allowing only the liquid refrigerant to flow from the indoor heat exchanger (3) into the tank (T) is provided between the tank (T) and the indoor heat exchanger (3) in the liquid pipe (7).
    </p>
    <p num="335">It is noted that the pressurizing circuit (50) and the pressure reducing circuit (60) of this embodiment are the same as those of the eleventh embodiment described above.</p>
    <p num="336">
      By serially connecting the heating heat exchanger (71) for exchanging heat with the circulating evaporator (51) to the heat exchanger (12) on the primary heat source side for exchanging heat with the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side in this manner, the evaporating temperature in the circulating evaporator (51) becomes higher than the evaporating temperature in the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side.
      <br/>
      That is to say, owing to the difference in evaporating temperatures, the internal pressure of the circulating evaporator (51) becomes higher than the internal pressure of the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side.
    </p>
    <p num="337">Next, the room heating running operation in this embodiment will be described.</p>
    <p num="338">
      During the heating running, the compressor (11) is driven in the primary refrigerant circuit (A).
      <br/>
      As indicated by the solid-line arrows in FIG. 23, a high-temperature, high-pressure gaseous refrigerant discharged from the compressor (11) sequentially flows through the heating heat exchanger (71) and the heat exchanger (12) on the primary heat source side, exchanges heat with the refrigerant in the circulating evaporator (51) and the refrigerant in the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side, and is condensed, thereby applying heat to the refrigerant in the circulating evaporator (51) and the refrigerant in the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the liquid refrigerant is distributed into the respective branch pipes (16c, 16d) and the pressure of the refrigerant is reduced in the respective outdoor electrically motorized expansion valves (EV-C, EV-D).
      <br/>
      Then, the refrigerant flows through the cooling heat exchanger (72) and the outdoor heat exchanger (14).
      <br/>
      The liquid refrigerant exchanges heat with the circulating condenser (61) in the cooling heat exchanger (72) and with the outdoor air in the outdoor heat exchanger (14) and is evaporated, thereby extracting heat from the refrigerant in the circulating condenser (61).
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the gaseous refrigerants, which have flowed through the cooling heat exchanger (72) and the outdoor heat exchanger (14), are combined to return to the compressor (11).
      <br/>
      This circulation operation is repeated.
    </p>
    <p num="339">
      On the other hand, in the secondary refrigerant circuit (B), the switching operations of the respective solenoid valves (SV1, SV2) are performed in the pressurizing circuit (50) and the pressure reducing circuit (60) in the same way as in the eleventh embodiment described above, thereby alternately switching a state where a high pressure is applied to the inside of the tank (T) and a state where a low pressure is applied to the inside of the tank (T).
      <br/>
      In the state where a high pressure is applied to the tank (T), since the evaporating temperature of the circulating evaporator (51) is higher than the evaporating temperature of the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side as described above, the internal pressure of the circulating evaporator (51) becomes higher than the internal pressure of the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side.
      <br/>
      Thus, a high pressure is built up in the tank (T).
      <br/>
      As indicated by the broken-line arrows in FIG. 23, the liquid refrigerant pushed out from the tank (T) exchanges heat with the heat exchanger (12) on the primary heat source side and is evaporated in the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side.
      <br/>
      The evaporated gaseous refrigerant flows into the indoor heat exchanger (3) through the gas pipe (6), exchanges heat with the indoor air and is condensed, thereby heating the indoor air.
    </p>
    <p num="340">
      In the state where a low pressure is applied to the inside of the tank (T), the liquid refrigerant in the indoor heat exchanger (3) is recovered into the tank (T) through the liquid pipe (7) as indicated by the one-dot-chain arrows in FIG. 23. In this operation, during the pressure reducing operation of the pressure reducing circuit (60), the gaseous refrigerant sucked into the circulating condenser (61) is condensed to be a liquid refrigerant, which is recovered into the tank (T) through the liquid supply pipe (63).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, during the pressurizing operation of the pressurizing circuit (50), a part of the liquid refrigerant in the tank (T) is recovered into the circulating evaporator (51) and is used as a refrigerant for generating a high pressure.
      <br/>
      This operation is repeated, thereby heating the indoor air.
    </p>
    <p num="341">
      Thus, in this embodiment, since the liquid refrigerant in the indoor heat exchanger (3) is recovered by utilizing the suction force generated in the tank (T), it is no longer necessary to dispose the tank (T) at a position lower than that of the indoor heat exchanger (3).
      <br/>
      As a result, the restriction on the installation positions of units can be alleviated and the universality can be improved.

      <br/>
      Consequently, as indicated by the solid-line arrows in FIG. 26, the liquid refrigerant pushed out from the main tank (T) is evaporated in the indoor heat exchanger (3) and then condensed in the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side.

      When the solenoid valves are switched again and the pressure in the sub-tank (ST) is equalized with the pressure in the circulating evaporator (51), the liquid refrigerant recovered into the sub-tank (ST) is supplied to the circulating evaporator (51) and functions as a refrigerant for driving.

      <br/>
      As a result, as indicated by the solid-line arrows in FIG. 27, a state, in which one sub-tank (ST1) communicates with the circulating condenser (61) to recover a part of the liquid refrigerant in the liquid pipe (7) and the other sub-tank (ST2) communicates with the circulating evaporator (51) to drip and supply the liquid refrigerant to the circulating evaporator (51), is established.

      Next, the twentieth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 33 to 35. It is noted that this embodiment is also applied to an air conditioning system of a heat pump type and that main arrangements are the same as those of the nineteenth embodiment.
      <br/>
      Thus, only the difference from the nineteenth embodiment will be described hereinafter.

    <p num="433">
      The primary refrigerant circuit (A) includes not only an electrically motorized expansion valve (EV-C) but also a bypass pipe (BPL) for by-passing the electrically motorized expansion valve (EV-C) between the heating heat exchanger (71) and the first solenoid valve (SV1).
      <br/>
      A capillary tube (CT) is provided for the by-pass pipe (BPL).
      <br/>
      The capillary tube (CT) is provided for the liquid side of the heat exchanger (12) on the primary heat source side, instead of the electrically motorized expansion valve (EV-B).
      <br/>
      The other arrangements are substantially the same as those of the nineteenth embodiment described above.

    <p num="434">
      On the other hand, in the secondary refrigerant circuit (B), the upper end of the first sub-tank (ST1) is connected to the upper end of the first main tank (T1) and the upper end of the first sub-tank (ST1) is connected to the upper end of the first main tank (T1).
      <br/>
      Only by performing the switching operations of the solenoid valves (SV-P1, SV-P2, SV-V1, SV-V2) for switching the connection states of the circulating evaporator (51) and the circulating condenser (61) to the respective main tanks (T1, T2), the connection states of the circulating evaporator (51) and the circulating condenser (61) to the respective sub-tanks (ST1, ST2) are switched.
      <br/>
      The connecting pipes (17a, 17b) coupled to the respective main tanks (T1, T2) are partially branched into the branch pipe (17a-A, 17b-A) and are connected to the first liquid pipe (7A) through the check valves (CV9, CV9).

      The other arrangements are substantially the same as those of the nineteenth embodiment described above.

    <p num="435">
      The refrigerant circulates as indicated by the arrows in FIG. 34 to perform the room cooling during the cooling running of the refrigerant circuit of this embodiment, and circulates as indicated by the arrows in FIG. 35 to perform the room heating during the heating running thereof.
      <br/>
      Since these refrigerant circulation operations are substantially the same as those of the nineteenth embodiment described above, the details thereof will be omitted herein.
      <br/>
      It is noted that during the cooling running, the electrically motorized expansion valve (EV-C) is closed and the pressure of the refrigerant is reduced by the capillary tube (CT) in the primary refrigerant circuit (A).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, during the heating running, the electrically motorized expansion valve (EV-C) is opened and the refrigerant flows through the heat exchanger (12) on the primary heat source side without reducing the pressure thereof.

      In the secondary refrigerant circuit (B), the refrigerant condensed in the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side is recovered into the main tank (T2) through the first liquid pipe (7A) and the branch pipe (17b-A) during the cooling running.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, during the heating running, the refrigerant condensed in the indoor heat exchanger (3) is recovered into the main tank (T2) through the first liquid pipe (7A) and the branch pipe (17b-A).

    <p num="437">(Twenty-first Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="438">
      Next, the twenty-first embodiment of the present invention will be described.
      <br/>
      It is noted that this embodiment is also applied to an air conditioning system of a heat pump type and that the main arrangements are the same as those of the twentieth embodiment described above.
      <br/>
      Thus, only the difference from the twentieth embodiment will be described hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="439">
      The primary refrigerant circuit (A) is not provided with the heating gas supply pipe (WGL) unlike that of the twentieth embodiment described above.
      <br/>
      Moreover, no check valve is provided for the pipe connecting the heat exchanger (12) on the primary heat source side and the four-position selector valve (22).
    </p>
    <p num="440">In the secondary refrigerant circuit (B), as for the connection states of the circulating evaporator (51) and the circulating condenser (61) to the upper ends of the respective main tanks (T1, T2) and the respective sub-tanks (ST1, ST2), those of the nineteenth embodiment described above are also employed herein.</p>
    <p num="441">
      Furthermore, in this embodiment, the evaporating temperature of the circulating evaporator (51) is set higher than the evaporating temperature of the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side during the heating running.
      <br/>
      That is to say, in the same way as setting the condensing temperature of the circulating condenser (61) lower than the condensing temperature of the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side in the first embodiment, the powers of the heat exchangers are differentiated.
    </p>
    <p num="442">
      Specifically, the first gas supply pipe (GL-1) coupled to the heating heat exchanger (71) and the second gas supply pipe (GL-2) coupled to the heat exchanger (12) on the primary heat source side have respectively different pipe diameters, and the flow rate of the first gas supply pipe (GL-1) is set smaller than the flow rate of the second gas supply pipe (GL-2) by a predetermined ratio.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the heat exchange area between the heating heat exchanger (71) and the circulating evaporator (51) is set smaller than the heat exchange area between the heat exchanger (12) on the primary heat source side and the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side, and the ratio is set smaller than the above-described predetermined ratio.
    </p>
    <p num="443">
      Specifically, for example, if the ratio of the flow rate of the first gas supply pipe (GL-1) to the flow rate of the second gas supply pipe (GL-2) is 1:10, then the ratio of the heat exchange area between the heating heat exchanger (71) and the circulating evaporator (51) to the heat exchange area between the heat exchanger (12) on the primary heat source side and the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side is set at 2:10.
      <br/>
      Thus, in respect of the power as a heat exchanger with respect to the flow rate of a refrigerant, the circulating evaporator (51) is superior to the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side.
      <br/>
      Thus, the evaporating temperature of the circulating evaporator (51) becomes higher than the evaporating temperature of the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the internal pressure of the circulating evaporator (51) becomes higher than the internal pressure of the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side.
      <br/>
      During the heating running, the liquid refrigerant is pushed out from the main tanks (T1, T2) toward the heat exchanger (1) on the secondary heat source side.
      <br/>
      The other arrangements are the same as those of the twentieth embodiment described above.
    </p>
    <p num="444">
      And, during the cooling running of the refrigerant circuit-of this embodiment, the refrigerant circulates in the respective refrigerant circuits (A, B) as indicated by the arrows in FIG. 37, thereby cooling the indoor air.
      <br/>
      Since the refrigerant circulation operation is substantially the same as that of the nineteenth embodiment or the twentieth embodiment described above, the details thereof are omitted herein.
    </p>
    <p num="445">
      On the other hand, in the primary refrigerant circuit during the heating running, the refrigerant discharged from the compressor (11) is distributed into and condensed in the heating heat exchanger (71) and the heat exchanger (12) on the primary heat source side as indicated by the arrows in FIG. 38. And, the refrigerant condensed in the heating heat exchanger (71) flows through the branch pipe (LSL-1) and the cooling heat exchanger (72), exchanges heat with the circulating condenser (61) and is evaporated to return to the compressor (11).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the refrigerant condensed in the heat exchanger (12) on the primary heat source side flows through the heating liquid pipe (WLL) and the outdoor heat exchanger (14), exchanges heat with the outdoor air and is evaporated to return to the compressor (11).
