      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention is related to genes encoding novel neutral cellulases and compositions containing the novel neutral cellulases.
      <br/>
      These compositions are especially useful in the textile, detergent and pulp and paper industries.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Cellulose is a linear polysaccharide of glucose residues connected by p-1,4 linkages.
      <br/>
      In nature, cellulose is usually associated with lignin together with hemicelluloses such as xylans and glucomannans.
      <br/>
      The practical use of cellulases has been hampered by the nature of the known cellulases, which are often mixtures of cellulases having a variety of activities and substrate specificities.
      <br/>
      For that reason, it is desirable to identify sources from which cellulases having only the desired activities may be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A wide variety of cellulases are known in the art, most of which are acid cellulases.
      <br/>
      However, some neutral and alkaline cellulases have also been identified.
      <br/>
      Celluzyme.RTM. is a commercially-available cellulase preparation from Humicola insolens (Novo Nordisk, A/S).
      <br/>
      GB 2,075,028 and EP 406,314 describe the use of a Humicola insolens cellulase as an enzymatic additive in a wash detergent to reduce the harshness (stiffness) of cotton-containing fabrics.
      <br/>
      The cloning of a cellulase containing endoglucanase activity from Humicola insolens is described in WO 93/11249 and EP 531,372.
      <br/>
      EP 510,091 describes a cellulase from Bacillus spp.
      <br/>
      NCI 40250 that is useful in detergent compositions.
      <br/>
      EP 220,016 describes cellulases that are useful as clarification agents for colored fabrics.
      <br/>
      WO 94/07998 describes modified cellulases that possess an improved alkaline activity.
      <br/>
      WO 95/02675 describes detergent compositions that contain two different cellulases: a first cellulase that is catalytically amenable to particulate soil removal, and a second cellulase that is catalytically amenable to color clarification.
      <br/>
      WO 921/8599 describes a detergent preparation that contains both a cellulase and a protease.
      <br/>
      Cellulases have also been used industrially as an aid for the removal of printing paste thickener and excess dye after textile printing (EP 576,526).
    </p>
    <p num="7">EP 383 828 describes granular detergent compositions, which contain surface-active agent, a fabric-softening clay material, and cellulase granulates containing calcium carbonate. U.S. Pat. No. 5,433,750 describes detergent compositions containing a surface active agent, a builder system, a softening clay, a clay flocculating agent and a high activity cellulase, preferably Humicola insolens cellulase. U.S. Pat. No. 5,520,838 describes granular detergent compositions, comprising surface-active agent, a builder and a cellulase, preferably a Humicola insolens cellulase, said compositions being in a compact form, having a relatively high density and containing a low amount of inorganic filler salt.</p>
    <p num="8">
      Cellulase enzymes are used in a wide variety of industries in addition to the textile industry.
      <br/>
      For example, cellulases are used industrially for the deinking of newspapers and magazines (EP 521,999), for improving the drainage of pulp (WO 91/14822, WO 91/17243), and as a treatment for animal feed.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The unique properties of each cellulase make some more suitable for certain purposes than others.
      <br/>
      While the enzymes differ in a number of ways, one of the most important difference is pH optimum.
      <br/>
      Neutral cellulases have useful cellulase activity in the pH range 6-8, alkaline cellulases have useful cellulase activity in the pH range 7.5-10. Acid cellulases are active in the range of pH 4.5-6, but have little cellulase activity at higher pH values.

When used to treat fabric, cellulases attack the chains of cellulose molecules that form the cotton fibers, thereby affecting the characteristics of the fabric.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Traditionally, in "stonewashing," pumice stones have been used to change the characteristics of the fabric.
      <br/>
      Gradually, cellulases are replacing pumice stones, which also give the fabric its desired final look but can cause damage to the machines, garments and sewage processing equipment. U.S. Pat. No. 4,832,864, U.S. Pat. No. 4,912,056, U.S. Pat. No. 5,006,126, U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,159, U.S. Pat. No. 5,213,581 and EP 307,564 disclose the use of cellulases in biostoning.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Cellulases are especially useful for stonewashing denim dyed with indigo as the dye mostly stays on the surface of the yarn and does not penetrate the fibers well.
      <br/>
      When used to treat cotton fabric, neutral cellulases generally require a longer wash time than do the acid cellulases.
      <br/>
      However, available neutral cellulases are less aggressive (active) against cotton than acid cellulases, and are reported not to compromise the strength of the fabric as readily as acid cellulases.
      <br/>
      Neutral cellulases have a broader pH profile and thus the pH increase that occurs during biostoning has little effect on the activity of the neutral enzyme.
    </p>

      The use of acid cellulases is hampered by their tendency to promote backstaining and a weakening of fabrics.
      <br/>
      In addition, the pH must be adjusted to to a range suitable for the function of the acid cellulases.
      <br/>
      Consequently, there is a clear demand for neutral cellulase enzyme preparations that do not cause backstaining or weakening of fabrics.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      While it has become popular to use cellulases in the textile industry, simply changing the cellulase mixture that is used may produce a different finish.
      <br/>
      These problems have focused increasing attention on the search for reproducible mixtures of cellulases with desired properties.
      <br/>
      Thus there is a clear demand especially in the textile and detergent industry for novel cellulases active at neutral and alkaline pH values, not compromising the strength of fabrics, with good cleaning and/or fabric care and harshness reducing properties.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">Recognizing the importance of identifying enzymes useful in textile biofinishing and biostoning and in detergent applications, the inventors have screened fungal species for neutral and alkaline cellulases with enzymatic characteristics that would be useful in such technologies.</p>
    <p num="16">These studies have resulted in novel cellulases originating from the genera Myceliophthora, Myriococcum, Melanocarpus, Sporotrichum and Chaetomium.</p>
    <p num="17">The invention is further directed to the spent culture medium or enzyme preparations prepared from the native hosts producing such novel cellulases.</p>
    <p num="18">The invention is further directed to the use of such culture medium or the use of such enzyme preparations in the textile and detergent industry and in the pulp and paper industries.</p>
    <p num="19">
      These studies have further resulted in the identification of three novel cellulases that are especially useful in the textile and detergent industry.
      <br/>
      Purified preparations from Melanocarpus sp. or Myriococcum sp. have revealed a 20 kDa cellulase with endoglucanase activity (designated herein as "20K-cellulase"), a 50 kDa cellulase ("50K-cellulase"), and a second 50 kDa cellulase ("50K-cellulase B").
      <br/>
      A novel gene product with high homology to the cellulase family, herein called "protein-with-CBD" (where CBD means "cellulose binding domain") was also discovered.
    </p>
    <p num="20">It is an object of the invention to provide enzyme preparations that contain one or more of the novel cellulases of the invention, especially the 20K-cellulase, the 50K-cellulase, the 50K-cellulase B and/or the protein-with-CBD.</p>
    <p num="21">It is a further object of this invention to provide a method for using such preparations for the finishing of textiles, especially the biostoning of denim, for the use said preparations in detergent compositions, and especially methods that use the 20K-cellulase, the 50K-cellulase, the 50K-cellulase B and/or the protein-with-CBD.</p>
    <p num="22">The invention is also directed to other neutral and/or alkaline cellulases having one or more of the amino acid sequences as described herein.</p>
    <p num="23">The invention is further directed to the genes encoding the 20K-cellulase, 50K-cellulase, 50K-cellulase B and the protein-with-CBD.</p>
    <p num="24">The invention is further directed to novel expression vectors comprising such genes and to novel hosts transformed with the vectors, especially hosts that are capable of high levels of expression of the proteins encoded by such genes.</p>
    <p num="25">The invention is further directed to the spent culture medium of such transformed hosts, the culture medium containing the novel 20K-cellulase, 50K-cellulase, the 50K-cellulase B and/or the protein-with-CBD, or enzyme compositions (enzyme preparations) containing one or more of these proteins that have been prepared from such culture media.</p>
    <p num="26">The invention is further directed to the use of such culture medium or the use of such enzyme preparations in the textile and detergent industry and in the pulp and paper industries.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="37">
      In the description that follows, a number of terms used in textile industry technology are extensively utilized.
      <br/>
      In order to provide a clear and consistent understanding of the specification and claims, including the scope to be given such terms, the following definitions are provided.
    </p>
    <p num="38">Biostoning. "Biostoning" of fabric or garment means the use of enzymes in place of, or in addition to, the use of pumice stones for the treatment of fabric or garment, especially denim.</p>
    <p num="39">Biofinishing. "Biofinishing" refers to the use of enzymes in a controlled hydrolysis of cellulosic fibers in order to modify the fabric or yam surface in a manner that prevents permanently pilling, improves fabric handle like softness and smoothness, clears the surface structure by reducing fuzzing, which results in clarification of colours, improves the drapability of the fabric, improves moisture absorbability and which may improve also the dyeability.</p>
    <p num="40">
      Backstaining.
      <br/>
      Released dye has a tendency to redeposit on the surface of the fabric fibers.
      <br/>
      This effect is termed "backstaining."
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Detergent.
      <br/>
      By "detergent" is meant a cleansing agent that can contain surface active agents (anionic, non-ionic, cationic and ampholytic surfactants), builders and other optional ingredients such as antiredeposition and soil suspension agents, optical brighteners, bleaching agents, dyes and pigments and hydrolases.
      <br/>
      Suitable listing of the contents of detergents is given in U.S. Pat. No. 5,433,750, a suitable list of surfactants is given in U.S. Pat. No. 3,664,961.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Enzyme preparation.
      <br/>
      By "enzyme preparation" is meant a composition containing enzymes.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the enzymes have been extracted from (either partially or completely purified from) a microbe or the medium used to grow such microbe. "Extracted from" means that the desired enzymes are separated from the cellular mass.
      <br/>
      This can be performed by any method that achieves this goal, including breaking cells and also simply removing the culture medium from spent cells.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the term "enzyme preparation" includes compositions containing medium previously used to culture a desired microbe(s) and any enzymes that have been released from the microbial cells into such medium during the culture or downstream processing steps.
    </p>
    <p num="43">By a host that is "substantially incapable" of synthesizing one or more enzymes is meant a host in which the activity of one or more of the listed enzymes is depressed, deficient, or absent when compared to the wild-type.</p>
    <p num="44">
      By an amino acid sequence that is an "equivalent" of a specific amino acid sequence is meant an amino acid sequence that is not identical to the specific amino acid sequence, but rather contains at least some amino acid changes (deletions, substitutions, inversions, insertions, etc) that do not essentially affect the biological activity of the protein as compared to a similar activity of the specific amino acid sequence, when used for a desired purpose.
      <br/>
      The biological activity of a cellulase, is its catalytic activity, and/or its ability to bind to cellulosic material.
      <br/>
      The biological activity of the 50K-cellulase B further includes its ability to act synergistically with the cellulases.
      <br/>
      Preferably, an "equivalent" amino acid sequence contains at least 80%-99% identity at the amino acid level to the specific amino acid sequence, most preferably at least 90% and in an especially highly preferable embodiment, at least 95% identify, at the amino acid level.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Cloning vehicle.
      <br/>
      A cloning vehicle is a plasmid or phage DNA or other DNA sequence (such as a linear DNA) that provides an appropriate nucleic acid carrier environment for the transfer of a gene of interest into a host cell.
      <br/>
      The cloning vehicles of the invention may be designed to replicate autonomously in prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts.
      <br/>
      In fungal hosts such as Trichoderma, the cloning vehicles generally do not autonomously replicate and instead, merely provide a vehicle for the transport of the gene of interest into the Trichoderma host for subsequent insertion into the Trichoderma genome.
      <br/>
      The cloning vehicle may be further characterized by one or a small number of endonuclease recognition sites at which such DNA sequences may be cut in a determinable fashion without loss of an essential biological function of the vehicle, and into which DNA may be spliced in order to bring about replication and cloning of such DNA.
      <br/>
      The cloning vehicle may further contain a marker suitable for use in the identification of cells transformed with the cloning vehicle.
      <br/>
      Markers, for example, are antibiotic resistance.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, such markers may be provided on a cloning vehicle which is separate from that supplying the gene of interest.
      <br/>
      The word "vector" is sometimes used for "cloning vehicle."
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Expression vehicle.
      <br/>
      An expression vehicle is a cloning vehicle or vector similar to a cloning vehicle but which is capable of expressing a gene of interest, after transformation into a desired host.
      <br/>
      When a fungal host is used, the gene of interest is preferably provided to a fungal host as part of a cloning or expression vehicle that integrates into the fungal chromosome, or allows the gene of interest to integrate into the host chromosome.
      <br/>
      Sequences that are part of the cloning vehicle or expression vehicle may also be integrated with the gene of interest during the integration process.
      <br/>
      In T. reesei, sites of integration to which the gene of interest can be directed include the cbh and/or the egl loci.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the gene of interest is directed to replace one or more genes encoding undesirable characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The gene of interest is also preferably placed under the control of (i.e., operably linked to) certain control sequences such as promoter sequences provided by the vector (which integrate with the gene of interest).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the control sequences can be those at the insertion site.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The expression control sequences of an expression vector will vary depending on whether the vector is designed to express a certain gene in a prokaryotic or in a eukaryotic host (for example, a shuttle vector may provide a gene for selection in bacterial hosts).
      <br/>
      Expression control sequences can contain transcriptional regulatory elements such as, promoters, enhancer elements, and transcriptional termination sequences, and/or translational regulatory elements, such as, for example, translational initiation and termination sites.
    </p>
    <p num="49">According to the invention, there are provided neutral and alkaline cellulases, and methods for producing such useful neutral and alkaline cellulases, that are desirable for the treatment of textile materials.</p>

    <p num="59">
      The process for genetically engineering the hosts of the invention is facilitated through the cloning of genetic sequences that encode the desired protein and through the expression of such genetic sequences.
      <br/>
      As used herein the term "genetic sequences" is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule (preferably DNA).
      <br/>
      Genetic sequences that encode the desired protein are derived from a variety of sources.
      <br/>
      These sources include genomic DNA, cDNA, synthetic DNA and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      Vector systems may be used to produce hosts for the production of the enzyme preparations of the invention.
      <br/>
      Such vector construction (a) may further provide a separate vector construction (b) which encodes at least one desired gene to be integrated to the genome of the host and (c) a selectable marker coupled to (a) or (b).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a separate vector may be used for the marker.

    <p num="60">A nucleic acid molecule, such as DNA, is said to be "capable of expressing" a polypeptide if it contains expression control sequences which contain transcriptional regulatory information and such sequences are "operably linked" to the nucleotide sequence which encodes the polypeptide.</p>
    <p num="61">
      An operable linkage is a linkage in which a sequence is connected to a regulatory sequence (or sequences) in such a way as to place expression of the sequence under the influence or control of the regulatory sequence.
      <br/>
      Two DNA sequences (such as a protein encoding sequence and a promoter region sequence linked to the 5' end of the encoding sequence) are said to be operably linked if induction of promoter function results in the transcription of the protein encoding sequence mRNA and if the nature of the linkage between the two DNA sequences does not (1) result in the introduction of a frame-shift mutation, (2) interfere with the ability of the expression regulatory sequences to direct the expression of the mRNA, antisense RNA, or protein, or (3) interfere with the ability of the template to be transcribed by the promoter region sequence.
      <br/>
      Thus, a promoter region would be operably linked to a DNA sequence if the promoter were capable of effecting transcription of that DNA sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The precise nature of the regulatory regions needed for gene expression may vary between species or cell types, but shall in general include, as necessary, 5' non-transcribing and 5' non-translating (non-coding) sequences involved with initiation of transcription and translation respectively.
      <br/>
      Expression of the protein in the transformed hosts requires the use of regulatory regions functional in such hosts.
      <br/>
      A wide variety of transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences can be employed.
      <br/>
      In eukaryotes, where transcription is not linked to translation, such control regions may or may not provide an initiator methionine (AUG) codon, depending on whether the cloned sequence contains such a methionine.
      <br/>
      Such regions will, in general, include a promoter region sufficient to direct the initiation of RNA synthesis in the host cell.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      As is widely known, translation of eukaryotic mRNA is initiated at the codon which encodes the first methionine.
      <br/>
      For this reason, it is preferable to ensure that the linkage between a eukaryotic promoter and a DNA sequence which encodes the protein, or a functional derivative thereof, does not contain any intervening codons which are capable of encoding a methionine.
      <br/>
      The presence of such codons results either in a formation of a fusion protein (if the AUG codon is in the same reading frame as the protein encoding DNA sequence) or a frame-shift mutation (if the AUG codon is not in the same reading frame as the protein encoding sequence).
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      In a preferred embodiment, a desired protein is secreted into the surrounding medium due to the presence of a secretion signal sequence.
      <br/>
      If a desired protein does not possess its own signal sequence, or if such signal sequence does not function well in the host, then the protein's coding sequence may be operably linked to a signal sequence homologous or heterologous to the host.
      <br/>
      The desired coding sequence may be linked to any signal sequence which will allow secretion of the protein from the host.
      <br/>
      Such signal sequences may be designed with or without specific protease sites such that the signal peptide sequence is amenable to subsequent removal.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a host that leaks the protein into the medium may be used, for example a host with a mutation in its membrane.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      If desired, the non-transcribed and/or non-translated regions 3' to the sequence coding for a protein can be obtained by the above-described cloning methods.
      <br/>
      The 3'-non-transcribed region may be retained for its tanscriptional termination regulatory sequence elements; the 3-non-translated region may be retained for its translational termination regulatory sequence elements, or for those elements which direct polyadenylation in eukaryotic cells.
    </p>
    <p num="66">The vectors of the invention may further comprise other operably linked regulatory elements such as enhancer sequences.</p>
    <p num="67">
      In a preferred embodiment, genetically stable transformants are constructed whereby a desired protein's DNA is integrated into the host chromosome.
      <br/>
      The coding sequence for the desired protein may be from any source.
      <br/>
      Such integration may occur de novo within the cell or, in a most preferred embodiment, be assisted by transformation with a vector which functionally inserts itself into the host chromosome, for example, DNA elements which promote integration of DNA sequences in chromosomes.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Cells that have stably integrated the introduced DNA into their chromosomes are selected by also introducing one or more markers which allow for selection of host cells which contain the expression vector in the chromosome, for example the marker may provide biocide resistance, e.g., resistance to antibiotics, or heavy metals, such as copper, or the like.
      <br/>
      The selectable marker gene can either be directly linked to the DNA gene sequences to be expressed, or introduced into the same cell by co-transformation.
    </p>
    <p num="69">Factors of importance in selecting a particular plasmid or viral vector include: the ease with which recipient cells that contain the vector may be recognized and selected from those recipient cells which do not contain the vector; the number of copies of the vector which are desired in a particular host; and whether it is desirable to be able to `shuttle` the vector between host cells of different species.</p>
    <p num="70">
      Once the vector or DNA sequence containing the construct(s) is prepared for expression, the DNA construct(s) is introduced into an appropriate host cell by any of a variety of suitable means, including transformation as described above.
      <br/>
      After the introduction of the vector, recipient cells are grown in a selective medium, which selects for the growth of transformed cells.
      <br/>
      Expression of the cloned gene sequence(s) results in the production of the desired protein, or in the production of a fragment of this protein.
      <br/>
      This expression can take place in a continuous manner in the transformed cells, or in a controlled manner.
    </p>
    <p num="71">Accordingly, the protein encoding sequences described herein may be operably lied to any desired vector and transformed into a selected host, so as to provide for expression of such proteins in that host.</p>

No. 5,298,405, WO 93/24622 and in GenBank submission L25310, each incorporated herein by reference.

      <br/>
      Mannanase has the same domain structure as that of the cellulases: a core domain, containing the active site, a hinge domain containing a serine-threonine rich region, and a tail, containing the binding domain.

      New properties for the 20K- and 50K-cellulases and for the 50K-cellulase B can be created by fusing domains, such as a cellulose binding domain (CBD), preferably with its linker, to the proteins of the invention.

      If desired, such preparations may be lyophilized or the enzymatic activity otherwise concentrated and/or stabilized for storage.

      Non-enzymatic stonewashing has three steps: desizing, abrasion and aftertreatment.
      <br/>
      The first step, desizing, involves the removal of the starch coating, or that of its derivatives, by amylase.
      <br/>
      The second step, abrasion, when performed without cellulase, is generally performed by washing the denim with pumice stones, and, when lightening is desired, bleach.

      The abrasive effect is the result not only of the effect of the stones but also the rubbing together of the denim fabric.

      Abrasion is generally followed by the third step, a washing step to remove excess dye, during which softeners or optical brighteners can be added.

      In enzymatic stonewashing, or biostoning, abrasion with pumice stones is completely or partially eliminated and cellulase is added to facilitate the abrasion of indigo dye from the fiber surface.

      The cellulases of this invention are useful especially to minimize backstaining and enhance lightening (abrasion) in biostoning.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      Biostoning is preferably performed from about pH 4.5-9.5, and most preferably between pH 6.0-8.5. The temperature of the reaction can range from about 40-80 (degree)  C., preferably between 50-70 (degree)  C., and most preferably between 50-60 (degree)  C. The liquid ratio (the ratio of the volume of liquid per weight of fabric) may range from about 2:1-20:1, preferably 4:1-10:1, and most preferably 4:1-7:1.
      <br/>
      The enzyme dosage can range from about 25-1500 nkat/g fabric, preferably 50-500 nkat/g fabric and most preferably 75-300 nkat/g fabric.

      The cellulases of the invention are useful in the textile industry for biofinishing of fabrics or garments e.g. depilling, defuzzing, colour clarification, harshness reduction, the creation of different finishes (for example, a `peach skin,` `worn out,` `sand washed,` or `antique look` effect) and biofinishing of yarn (for example reduction of hairiness, improvement of smoothness).
      <br/>
      The cellulases of this invention can be used in biofinishing in acidic and in neutral conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="103">The cellulases of this invention are useful in detergent compositions to improve the textile cleaning effect e.g. soil removal, to improve the fabric-care properties by reducing the harshness of the textiles, the cellulases having also defuzzing and colour clarification and restoring effects.</p>

      The textile material that is treated with the enzyme preparations of the invention may be manufactured of natural cellulose containing fibers or manmade cellulose containing fibers or mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Examples of natural cellulosics are cotton, linen, hemp, jute and ramie.
      <br/>
      Examples of manmade cellulosics are viscose, cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate, rayon, cupro and lyocell.
      <br/>
      The above mentioned cellulosics can also be employed as blends of synthetic fibers such as polyester, polyamide or acrylic fibers.
      <br/>
      The textile material may be yarn or knitted or woven or formed by any other means.

    <p num="105">
      The cellulases of the invention, besides being especially useful for the treatment of fabric, are useful in general in any area requiring cellulase activity.
      <br/>
      In the pulp and paper industry, neutral cellulases can be used, for example, in deinking of different recycled papers and paperboards having neutral or alkaline pH, in improving the fiber quality, or increasing the drainage in paper manufacture.
      <br/>
      Other examples include the removal of printing paste thickener and excess dye after textile printing, and as a treatment for animal feed.
      <br/>
      For example, if the intended application is improvement of the strength of the mechanical pulp, then the 50K-cellulase, 20Kellulase, 50K-cellulase B or the protein-with-CBD preparations of the invention may provide one or more of these proteins so as to enhance or facilitate the ability of cellulose fibers to bind together.
      <br/>
      In a similar manner, in the application of pulp refining, the 50K-cellulase, 20K-cellulase, 50K-cellulase B or protein-with-CBD preparations of the invention may provide one or more of these proteins at a level that enhance or facilitate such swelling.

      To compare the final look of the denim fabrics after washing with different cellulase preparations, the color from both sides (reverse side and right side) of the fabrics was measured.
      <br/>
      From the results shown in Table I, it can be seen that the lightness and blueness units are clearly increased on the right side of the garments washed with preparations of ALKO4179, ALKO4124, ALKO4237 and ALKO4125 cellulases, showing a good stone-washed effect.

      The blueness unit was also increased on the right side of the fabric washed with the ALKO4265 preparation but there was no increase in the lightness unit.
      <br/>
      This is probably because the enzyme does work at this pH but at the same time causes a lot of backstaining.

      There was no stone washing effect on the fabric with commercial acid product Ecostone L at pH 7 at this ECU activity.

      To quantify the level of backstaining, the color was measured on the reverse side of the fabric before and after the cellulase treatment.

      As shown in Table I, when the ECU amounts are the same, there was practically no backstaining in the fabrics treated with the ALKO4179, ALKO4124, ALKO4237 and ALKO4125 preparations when compared to the fabrics treated with ALKO4265 or Ecostone L (pH 5.2 and 7) preparations.

    <p num="135">When compared with results obtained with the inclusion of Berol (Example 3), the data in Table II show that almost the same stone-washing effect can be achieved with the ALKO4179, ALKO4124, ALKO4237 and ALKO4125 cellulase preparations in the absence of the helping agent Berol.</p>

    <p num="137">Backstaining in Denim Wash with Different Cellulases</p>
    <p num="138">
      In the literature, it is reported that backstaining is dependent on pH and/or the type of enzyme.
      <br/>
      However, as shown herein, it was found that backstaining depends only indirectly on pH (FIGS. 6A and 6B and 7A and 7B).
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      Two neutral cellulase preparations from ALKO4237 and from ALKO4265 and acid cellulase product Ecostone L were studied in small scale denim wash with an equal enzyme dosage at pH 5 and pH 7.
      <br/>
      The stonewash effect was determined by measuring the increase of lightness and blueness as reflectance units on the right side of the fabric and backstaining (redeposition of indigo on the surface of fibers) was determined as blueness increase and lightness decrease on the reverse side.
      <br/>
      At pH 7, the neutral cellulases from ALKO4237 caused a clear increase in lightness and blueness on the right side and no backstaining was observed (FIG. 6A and 6B).
      <br/>
      A similar stonewash effect was found at pH 5 but with a slight backstaining.
      <br/>
      At pH 7, the other neutral cellulase, ALKO4265, brightened blueness on the right side but backstained intensively on the reverse side.
      <br/>
      At pH 5 similar effects were obtained with both ALKO4265 and ALKO4237 preparations.
      <br/>
      At pH 7, the acid cellulase did not backstain or impart a lightness on the right side (when using similar endoglucanase activity dosages as with ALKO4265 and ALKO4237, FIG. 7A and 7B, 1 *  dosage), probably because it did not work at this pH.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, at pH 5, lightness and blueness were increased on the right side and backstaining was clearly perceptible on the reverse side.
      <br/>
      Based on these results, backstaining can occur at both pH values depending on the cellulase preparation used.

      Evaluation of the surface cleaning effect of the enzyme treated fabrics was performed by a panel consisting of three persons.

      The proteins that precipitated between 17 g and 42 g of ammonium sulphate per 100 ml of concentrate were suspended in 0.9 liter of 25 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.2 containing 0.25 mM EDTA and then diluted with water to a conductivity of 4 mS/cm and adjusted with 1M NaOH to pH 8 0 (slashed zero)  The resulting solution (about 45 liters) was pumped at 150 ml/min through a 6.3 liter column of DEAE-Sepharose FF (tm)  at room temperature.
      <br/>
      Peak I endoglucanase activity did not bind under these conditions.
      <br/>
      Bound proteins were eluted at 110 ml/min with a linear gradient from 0.0 to 0.5 M NaCl in 20 liters of 25 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.7 containing 0.25 mM EDTA. Peak II endoglucanase eluted at about 14 mS/cm.
      <br/>
      Instead of the separate Peaks III and IV seen with small scale separations in DEAE in the cold room, a single peak, called Peak III/IV, eluted at about 25 mS/cm.

      Proteins in Peak II (3.5 liters) were precipitated with ammonium sulphate (450 g/liter) and suspended in 170 ml 25 mM PIPES/KOH pH 6.0 containing 1 mM EDTA Portions of this material were transferred to 25 mM sodium acetate pH 4.0 containing 1 mM EDTA by gel-filtration on a 5 * 29 cm column of G25 Sephadex (tm)  (coarse) and then fractionated on SP-Sepharose (tm) . FIG. 8 shows the result that was obtained when 11.7 g of these proteins was applied to a 4.5 * 31 cm column of SP-Sepharose (tm)  in 25 mM sodium acetate pH 4.0 containing 1 mM EDTA at 150 ml/h and the column developed at 75 ml/h with a linear gradient from 0.0 to 0.4 M NaCl in 3.4 liters of the same buffer.
      <br/>
      Most of the endoglucanase eluted at 0.2 M NaCl. The modified assay described in Example 10 was used.
      <br/>
      When active fractions were stored at 7 (degree)  C., a crystalline precipitate appeared in them and contained nearly all the endoglucanase activity.
      <br/>
      Active fractions (15 ml) in which crystallization was slow, were induced to form crystals by seeding with 30  MU l of suspension from fractions already containing crystals.
      <br/>
      After 2 to 3 days, the crystals were collected by centrifugation, washed with 25 mM PIPES/KOH pH 6.0 containing 1 mM EDTA and dissolved in 25 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.2 containing 0.25 mM EDTA. Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed the washed crystals contained a virtually homogenous protein with an apparent molecular mass close to 20 kDa (the error in SDS-PAGE estimations of molecular mass is at least  +- 10%, and may be much greater for unusual proteins).
      <br/>
      This protein is called the 20K-cellulase.
      <br/>
      Contaminating protein could also be removed by gel-filtration on G50 Sephadex (tm)  in 50 mM PIPES/KOH pH 6.0 containing 1 mM EDTA.
      <br/>
      An example of this is shown in FIG. 9, where unwashed crystals were purified by gel-filtration The endoglucanase activity co-eluted with the 20 kDa protein well after the cytochrome c (11.2 kDa) volume, showing that this 20 kDa protein is abnormally retarded by interaction with Sephadex (tm) .
    </p>
    <p num="176">
      Proteins in Peak III/IV were precipitated with ammonium sulphate and transferred to 25 mM sodium acetate pH 4.0 containing 1 mM EDTA in the same way as described for the Peak II proteins.
      <br/>
      Upon transfer to 25 mM sodium acetate pH 4.0, a large precipitate formed and was discarded.
      <br/>
      The active supernatant was fractionated on SP-Sepharose (tm) . At low protein loading (e.g. 200 mg protein to a 2.5 * 11 cm column as shown in FIG. 10, most of the endoglucanase activity bound to the column and was eluted with a NaCl gradient at about 50 mM NaCl.
      <br/>
      This active peak was followed by a second peak of inactive protein.
    </p>
    <p num="177">
      SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the active and inactive peaks both contained several proteins, including proteins with apparent molecular masses close to 50 kDa that could not be distinguished from each other by SDS-PAGE.
      <br/>
      Both peaks were further purified by chromatography on Phenyl Sepharose (tm) .
    </p>
    <p num="178">
      The active fractions (fractions 15 to 18 in FIG. 10) were pooled, adjusted to 50 mM PIPES/KOH pH 6.0 (by addition of 0.25 M PIPES/KOH pH 6.0) and 15 g % ammonium sulphate (by addition of solid ammonium sulphate) and applied to a 1.5 * 8.5 cm column of Phenyl Sepharose (tm)  equilibrated with 25 mM PIPES/KOH pH 6.0 containing 1 mM EDTA and 15 g % of ammonium sulphate.
      <br/>
      The column was developed with a linear gradient from 15 to 0 g % ammonium sulphate in 104 ml of 25 mM PIPES/KOH pH 6 0 (slashed zero)  After the end of the gradient, the column was further washed with 25 mM PIPES/KOH pH 6 0 (slashed zero)  Two protein peaks eluted on the gradient, first a small peak of inactive protein and then a major peak containing most of the endoglucanase activity.
      <br/>
      SDS-PAGE analysis (FIGS. 11A and B) showed that both peaks contained essentially homogenous proteins with apparent molecular masses close to 50 kDa (i.e., they migrate slightly slower than the BioRad prestained ovalbumin standard, which has an apparent molecular mass of 47 kDa).
      <br/>
      These two proteins could not be distinguished by the inventors' SDS-PAGE analyses, even when they were run together as mixtures.
      <br/>
      The protein in the active peak was called 50K-cellulase and the protein in the inactive peak was called 50K-protein B. Larger amounts of 50K-cellulase B were obtained by fractionation of the second (and inactive) peak eluted from SP-Sepharose (tm)  (fractions 19 to 23 in FIG. 10) on Phenyl Sepharose (tm)  in exactly the same way as described above for the active fractions.
    </p>
    <p num="179">
      Production of still larger amounts of 50K-cellulase and 50K-cellulase B was facilitated by overloading the SP-Sepharose (tm)  column.
      <br/>
      For example, when 15 g of protein was applied to a 4.5 * 31 cm column of SP-Sepharose (tm) , instead of binding to the column, the 50K-cellulase was apparently displaced by more strongly bound proteins, and eluted before the NaCl gradient.
      <br/>
      This material was already highly purified, and homogenous 50K-cellulase was isolated from it by chromatography on Phenyl Sepharose (tm)  as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="180">
      In order to speed up the purification of larger amounts of 50K-cellulase the SP-Sepharose and Phenyl Sepharose columns were reversed.
      <br/>
      After adjusting the ammonium sulphate concentration to about 15 g%, the proteins precipitated in Peak III/IV were applied into Phenyl Sepharose as described before.
      <br/>
      With high overloading (e.g. 17 g of protein applied to a 3.2 * 25 cm column of Phenyl Sepharose) most of the total protein ran through the column, but 50K-cellulase (containing most of the endoglucanase activity) was bound and eluted at the end of linear gradient from 15 to 0 g % of ammonium sulphate in 25 mM PIPES/KOH pH 6 0 (slashed zero)  Western analysis with a rabbit antiserum recognizing 50K-cellulase B showed that the 50K-cellulase B eluted just before 50K-cellulase.
      <br/>
      Further purification was achieved by fractionation on SP-Sepharose as described earlier.
      <br/>
      In this reversed order of SP-Sepharose and Phenyl Sepharose the proteins in Peak III/IV precipitated with ammonium sulphate could be applied directly to the next purification step without removing salt.
      <br/>
      The large protein precipitate, which appeared upon transfer of the concentrated proteins in Peak III/IV directly into 25 mM sodium acetate pH 4.0 for SP-Sepharose, could also be avoided this way.
      <br/>
      As the 50K-cellulase only just binds to SP-Sepharose, the preceeding fractionation on Phenyl Sepharose markedly reduced the apparently interfering total protein load on SP-Sepharose.
    </p>
    <p num="181">
      50K-cellulase and 50Kellulase B were each tested in the Launder-Ometer to see if they are responsible for the beneficial effects of Peak IV reported in Example 10.
      <br/>
      Both proteins were found to have beneficial effects (Table VI).
      <br/>
      At the low concentrations used in this experiment, they did not themselves increase the release of indigo dye from the outer face of the denim (i.e., Lright did not increase) but they effectively decreased the back-staining of dye onto the inner face of the denim (Lreverse became more positive and breverse became smaller) especially when used together with 2K-cellulase.
    </p>
    <p num="182">
      The 20K-cellulase performed well in Launder-Ometer tests at pH 5 as well as at pH 7.
      <br/>
      At pH 5, 0.2 mg of 20K-cellulase per g of denim increased Lright from 3.2 to 5.2. Addition of 50K-cellulase at 0.1 mg per gram of denim together with the 20K-cellulase also decreased the backstaining at pH 5 (Lreverse and breverse changed from 0.0 and 2.6 with 2K-cellulase alone to 1.3 and 1.5, respectively, with the mixture of20K- and 50K-cellulases).

      The mixtures of 20K-cellulase with Pools I, III and IV caused more lightening (increased Lright) than either component alone.
      <br/>
      At least for the combination of 20K-cellulase with Pool IV, it is clear that this is because of synergy and not merely an additive effect.
      <br/>
      Further, the backstaining with all mixtures was actually less (Lreverse more positive, breverse less) than the backstaining observed with 20K-cellulase alone.
      <br/>
      The combination of 20K with Pool IV was particularly effective.
      <br/>
      Pool IV contains many proteins, one of which (a 50 kDa polypeptide) copurifies with endoglucanase activity during chromatography of Pool IV on Sephadex G100 and S-Sepharose.
      <br/>
      While good biostoning is achieved with 20K-cellulase alone, better results are possible with 20K-cellulase plus one or more proteins purified from Pool IV.
      <br/>
      Biostoning with mixtures of the 20K-cellulase and the 50K-cellulase and the 50Kellulase B purified from Pool III/IV have already been presented (Table VI in Example 9).
      <br/>
      Therefore, the present invention is not limited to the use of only the 20K-cellulase.
      <br/>
      Other proteins in the ALKO4237 medium are useful alone or in suitable combinations.
    </p>
    <p num="196">In the standard endoglucanase assay described by Bailey et al. (1981, loc. cit.), the enzyme amount is chosen that produces, in 10 min and pH 4.8 (0.05 M Na-citrate buffer), about 0.6 mM reducing equivalents from 1% hydroxyethylcellulose, resulting in a final absorbance change ( DELTA A540) of between 0.2 and 0.25. This far exceeds the range in which  DELTA A540 is proportional to the amount of 20K-cellulase.</p>
    <p num="197">
      Therefore, the procedure was modified as follows.
      <br/>
      Enough enzyme was used to produce about 0.2 mM reducing equivalents in 10 min in 0.05 M HEPES buffer (pH 7.0).
      <br/>
      To reach the threshold concentration of reducing equivalents above which color is formed in the DNS system, 0.12 mM glucose was freshly added to the stock DNS reagent.
      <br/>
      This method (called the "modified" method) was used when characterizing the endoglucanase activity of the 20K-cellulase and also the 50K-cellulase.
      <br/>
      With 1 % hydroxyethylcellulose as substrate, the range in which  DELTA A540 is proportional to the amount of 20- and 50K-cellulase is relatively narrow, and so 2% carboxymethylcellulose was taken as an alternative substrate.
      <br/>
      With 2% carboxymethylcellulose, the range of linear correlation between  DELTA A540 and the amount of 20K- and 50K-cellulase was broader than with 1% hydroxyethylcellulose.
      <br/>
      The endoglucanase activity determined with 2% carboxymethylcellulose was about 8-10-fold for 20K-cellulase and about 50-fold for 50K-cellulase compared with that determined with 1% hydroxyethylcellulose.
    </p>

      No activity of 20K-cellulase was detectable for 4-methylumbelliferyl- BETA -D-lactoside, a characteristic substrate of cellobiohydrolases.

      The 20K-cellulase was relatively heat stable.
      <br/>
      It was incubated at 7  MU g/ml and 100 (degree)  C. in 25 mM Tris-HCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, for 30 or 60 min. and then assayed at pH 7.0 and 50 (degree)  C. 52% and 35% respectively, of the endoglucanase activity remained at pH 7.2. 40% and 22%, respectively, remained at pH 8.8. (These pH values were measured at room temperature; the actual pH at 100 (degree)  C. is somewhat lower.) At 80 (degree)  C., pH 7.2, 70% of the activity remained for 60 min.

      These results indicate that the enzyme is suitable for applications in which it may be (e.g., accidentally) exposed to elevated temperatures.
      <br/>
      As well as being resistant to irreversible inactivation at high temperatures, the enzyme exhibited an optimum temperature of 70 (degree)  C. during 10 min. assays at pH 7.0 (FIG. 15).
      <br/>
      The decreased activity observed above 70 (degree)  C. was mainly due to a reversible change in enzyme conformation: the enzyme recovered most of its activity when returned to 50 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="201">
      At 50 (degree)  C., the 20K-cellulase exhibited 80% or more of its maximum activity throughout the pH range 4 to 9, and nearly 50% at pH 10.
      <br/>
      This was the case in both 10 min. (FIG. 16A) and 60 min. (FIG. 16B) assays.
      <br/>
      These figures also show the pH dependence of the enzyme at 70 (degree)  C. With 10 min. assays, the enzyme was more active at 70 (degree)  C. than it was at 50 (degree)  C. over the range pH 4.5 to 8 and about equally active at pH 10 (FIG. 16A).
      <br/>
      With 60 min. assays (i.e., approaching commercial conditions), the enzyme was more active at 70 (degree)  C. than it was at 50 (degree)  C. between pH 5.5 and 7.5. However, it was only slightly less active at 70 (degree)  C. than at 50 (degree)  C. up to pH 10.
      <br/>
      In practice, this means that the enzyme can be used equally well over a wide range of pH and at temperatures up to at least 70 (degree)  C.

      <br/>
      A sample of the pure enzyme with an A280 of 1.8 contained 2030 ECU/ml and 300 PCU/ml at pH 7.0 and 50 (degree)  C. (one PCU is the amount of activity that liberates 1 nmol of methylumbelliferone per second).

      About 10 g of prewashed (Example 3) unbleached cotton woven fabric swatch was loaded into 1.2 liter container that contained 150 ml of 0.25% detergent solution with or without cellulase.
      <br/>
      Cellulase dosages were based on protein amounts.
      <br/>
      Detergent solutions were OMO.RTM. Total (Lever, UK) and Colour Detergent Liquid (Unilever, The Netherlands).
      <br/>
      A quantity of steel balls were added into each container to increase the mechanical action.
      <br/>
      The Launder-Ometer was run at 42 rpm for 0.5 or 1 hour at 40 (degree)  C. The material was washed 4 times with intermediate rinsing and drying.

      The Melanocarpus albomyces DNA in pALK1221 was sequenced as described in Example 19.
      <br/>
      The DNA sequence encoding the Melanocarpus albomyces 20K-cellulase is shown in FIG. 19(A and B) (SEQ ID NO:30).
      <br/>
      The sequence is 936 bp in length, and has an open reading frame (ORF) coding for 235 amino acids; the gene has two introns.
      <br/>
      The putative signal peptide processing site is after alanine-21, and the N-terminus of the mature protein begins at alanine-22, as suggested by the peptide sequencing results (FIG. 17, peptide -429(SEQ ID NO:1)).
      <br/>
      The ORF predicts a protein with a molecular weight of 25.0 kDa for the full-length preprotein, and 22.9 kDa for the mature protein.
      <br/>
      This is in good agreement with the results obtained from the protein purification work (Example 10).
      <br/>
      These results also verify that the about 35 kDa protein detected previously with the 20K-cellulase antiserum (Example 10) is a different gene product than the 20K-cellulase.

      The 20K-cellulase of Melanocarpus albomyces appears to belong to family K of cellulases and family 45 of glycosyl hydrolases (Henrissat &amp; Bairoch, Biochem. J. 293:781-788 (1993)).
      <br/>
      The 20K-cellulase shows homology (about 76% identify in 235 amino acid overlap) towards the Humicola insolens endoglucanase V (embl:a23635), but the 20K-cellulase has the surprising feature that it does not harbor the cellulose binding domain (CBD) and its linker, which are characteristic of the Humicola insolens endoglucanase V and other related endoglucanases (Schulein et al., 1993, In: Suominen &amp; Reinikainen (eds), Foundation for Biotechnical and Industrial Fermentation Research, Helsinki, vol. 8, 109.; Saloheimo el al., 1994, Mol. Microbiol 13, 219).
      <br/>
      This feature of the 20K-cellulase may account for the excellent performance of the enzyme in biostoning experiments (Example 10).

      <br/>
      Thus the preferred host for 20K-cellulase production for biostoning is an ALKO3269-like strain.

      Although with higher 20K-cellulase concentrations the Trichoderma background has probably only very minor importance.

      An ALKO3269-like background is probably as good for 50K-cellulase and 50K-cellulase B production for biostoning as it is for 20K-cellulase production.

      T. reesei cbh1 (cellobiohydrolase 1) promoter: The promoter is from Trichoderma reesei VTT-D-80133 (Teeri et al. (1983) The molecular cloning of the major cellulase gene from Trichoderma reesei.

      Mol. Gen. Genet. 241: 515.) was used in the construct.
      <br/>
      The sequence of the promoter area preceeding the ATG was published by Shoemaker et al. (1983) Molecular cloning of exo-cellobiohydrolase from Trichoderma reesei strain L27.
      <br/>
      Bio/Technology 1. 691.).
      <br/>
      The last 15 nucleotides of the T. reesei L27 cbh1 promoter (the SacII site is underlined) are CCGCGGACTGGCATC (SEQ ID NO:44) (Shoemaker et al. 1983).
      <br/>
      The cbh1 promoter from the T. reesei strain VTT-D-80133 has been sequenced at Alko Research Laboratories, and an one nucleotide difference in the DNA sequence has been noticed within the above mentioned region.
      <br/>
      In the T. reesei strain VTT-D-80133 the sequence preceeding the ATG is CCGCGGACTG/C/GCATC (SEQ ID NO:45) (the SacII site is underlined, the additional cytosine in the DNA sequence is between the slashes).

    <p num="357">
      The nucleotides missing from the promoter (10 bps after the SacII to the ATG) were added and the exact promoter fulsion to the first ATG of the Melanocarplus 20K-cellulase (see below) was done by using the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) method.
      <br/>
      The fusion and the PCR fragment were sequenced to ensure that no errors had occurred in the reaction.
      <br/>
      In pALK1231 the promoter area is also functioning as a homologous DNA (together with the cbh1 3'-fragment; see below) to target the integration of the transforming DNA into the cbh1 locus.
