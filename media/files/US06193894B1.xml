    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for disinfecting and sterilizing fluids using an ultraviolet light source, and more particularly to a novel ultraviolet lamp which can be used in a water dispenser to kill micro organisms living in the water and on the water dispenser apparatus.</p>
    <p num="3">
      The use of ultraviolet light sources for sterilizing and disinfecting fluids is well-known in the art.
      <br/>
      A typical ultraviolet light source has two primary parts, the tube and the base.
      <br/>
      The tube usually comprises a soft glass or quartz casing which holds a vaporizable material, such as mercury, and a starting gas and/or stabilizing gas, such as argon, neon, zeon or the like.
      <br/>
      The tube also includes one or more electrodes, which when provided with power, excite the gas and the vaporizable material.
      <br/>
      The excited vaporizable material causes a plasma field which generates the ultraviolet light.
    </p>
    <p num="4">In addition to the tube, an ultraviolet light source typically comprises a base, which is designed to hold the tube in place during operation, but which allows the tube to be removed and replaced when necessary.</p>
    <p num="5">
      While ultraviolet light sources have been used for some time for sterilization purposes, a problem with the ultraviolet light sources currently known in the art is that they are fragile and typically cannot handle the harsh environments in which they must be used.
      <br/>
      For example, because the prior art ultraviolet light sources are made of soft glass or quartz, the lamps tend to break easily.
      <br/>
      In addition, because of the adhesive nature of the soft glass or quartz casing, residue and other impurities tend to build up on the lamps over time, affecting the performance of the lamp.
      <br/>
      Finally, the prior art ultraviolet light sources have a tendency to be expensive and difficult to maintain.
      <br/>
      Therefore, what is needed is an inexpensive, impact resistant ultraviolet light source, which can be used for sterilization purposes, can be easily introduced into existing systems, is thermally stable in cold or hot fluids including air, and does not require significant modification of the system.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      According to one embodiment of the invention, an apparatus and methods for sterilizing and/or disinfecting water in a water dispenser.
      <br/>
      The apparatus comprises an ultraviolet light source which includes an ultraviolet light bulb having a protective sleeve, and a power source for providing power to the ultraviolet light bulb.
      <br/>
      The ultraviolet light source generates an ultraviolet light which kills microorganisms in the fluid.
      <br/>
      The ultraviolet light bulb preferably includes a casing for holding a starting gas and a vaporizable material, and at least one electrode electrically coupled to the power source for exciting the starting gas and the vaporizable material within the casing.
      <br/>
      In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the casing is made of soft glass or quartz material, and the protective sleeve is a UV transparent or transmissive material.
      <br/>
      For example, the protective sleeve may comprise a fluoropolymer sleeve which surrounds the soft glass or quartz casing.
      <br/>
      The fluoropolymer sleeve may comprise any suitable fluoropolymer material, such as the Teflon.RTM. family of products like PTFE, FEP, PFA, AF, Tefzel.RTM. ETFE, and all other Teflon.RTM. products developed in the future.
      <br/>
      In addition, some silicone based materials, like silicone polymers, and other IN transmissive non-glass materials can be used for the protective sleeve.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, instead of the casing being a quartz or soft glass casing surrounded by a fluoropolymer sleeve, the casing itself may be made of the fluoropolymer material.
      <br/>
      Thus, instead of two layers for the casing (i.e., the soft glass or quartz, and the fluoropolymer sleeve), a single layer fluoropolymer or other UVC transparent material casing can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In accordance with yet another embodiment in the present invention, the protective sleeve may comprise a permanent sleeve surrounding the ultraviolet light source, or the protective sleeve may comprise a removable container, so that the ultraviolet light bulb can be replaced when it burns out or malfunctions.
      <br/>
      In the case where the protective sleeve is permanent, the sleeve may preferably comprise a fluoropolymer, silicone or other UV transmissive material which is heat shrunk around the ultraviolet light bulb or the entire light source, or the fluoropolymer, silicone or other UV transmissive material is applied by pressing it onto the light source, or dipping the light source into a liquid form of the material.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The protective sleeve seals in the soft glass or quartz casing, protecting it from breakage.
      <br/>
      However, in situations where the glass or quartz does break, the protective sleeve contains the glass particles and harmful mercury vapor material so that the environment in which the lamp is used is not exposed to the glass and mercury materials.
      <br/>
      For example, if the lamp is used in a drinking water supply tank, and the glass or quartz casing of the lamp happens to break, the protective sleeve prevents the glass or quartz particles, as well as the harmful mercury within the lamp from contaminating the drinking water supply.
      <br/>
      In addition, the protective sleeve preferably acts as a thermal insulator, which helps keep the ultraviolet light's plasma thermally stable.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The ultraviolet light source of the present invention may be used for sterilizing and/or disinfecting water, as well as the surfaces of the water dispenser.
      <br/>
      The ultraviolet light which illuminates from the ultraviolet light source may comprise any suitable UV light, such as UVA, UVB, UVC, or the like.
      <br/>
      However, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the light is a UVC light (e.g., light having a wavelength between about 180 nm and about 325 nm), which is good for killing living organisms, such as molds, bacteria, viruses, and the like.
      <br/>
      Because of the resilient nature of the protective sleeve of the present invention, the ultraviolet light source can be used in virtually any environment where it is beneficial to disinfect and/or sterilize a fluid.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="13">
      The present invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for disinfecting and sterilizing fluids and the surfaces of containers, pipes, ducts and other suitable devices with which the fluids contact.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel embodiment of an ultraviolet light source, which performs the disinfecting and sterilizing processes.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In accordance with the present invention, the term fluid means a continuous, amorphous substance whose molecules move freely past one another and that has the tendency to assume the shape of its container; that is, a fluid can be a liquid or gas, including air.
      <br/>
      In addition, the term may refer to plasma type materials.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Referring now to FIG. 1, an apparatus 10 for disinfecting and/or sterilizing a fluid is shown.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the illustrated embodiment, Apparatus 10 preferably comprises an ultraviolet lamp or light bulb 12, a base 22, a power source 24, and a protective coating or sleeve 26.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Ultraviolet lamp 12 preferably comprises a soft glass or quartz tube 14, and at least one filament electrode 16 which preferably is mounted on an end seal 18.
      <br/>
      One or more base pins 20 are connected to end seal 18, and are adapted to insert into base 22 which, as discussed in more detail below, provides power to ultraviolet lamp 12 through end pins 20.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Glass tube 14 preferably is filled with one or more rare gases, such as argon, neon, xenon and/or krypton.
      <br/>
      In addition, a small amount of mercury or other suitable metal element is provided within glass tube 14.
      <br/>
      During operation of ultraviolet lamp 12, electrons are emitted from electrode 16, which is heated when power from base 22 is provided to lamp 12.
      <br/>
      The electrons are accelerated by the voltage across the tube until they collide with the mercury or other metal atoms, causing them to be ionized and excited.
      <br/>
      When the mercury or other metal atoms return to their normal state, spectral lines in both the visible and the ultraviolet regions are generated.
      <br/>
      The low and/or mid pressure within glass tube 14 enhances the ultraviolet radiation.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      As one skilled in the art will appreciate, base 22 may include a ballast which is configured to provide a starting voltage and current for lamp 12, and limit the lamp current to the required value for proper operation.
      <br/>
      In addition, for rapid-start type lamps, the ballast can provide low-voltage cathode heating.
      <br/>
      The ballast may be a fixed-impedance type ballast, a variable-impedance type ballast or any other suitable electronic ballast currently known in the art.
      <br/>
      Preferably, electrical source 24 is configured to provide power to base 22 and the bulbs of which may be configured within the base.
      <br/>
      In addition, while the ballast may be configured within base 22, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the ballast may be separate from base 22, and power is provided from the ballast to base 22 via an electrical lead connection.
    </p>
    <p num="19">In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, base 22 may comprise a metal, a ceramic material, a plastic material, or a material which allows UV light to pass, such as a fluoropolymer material, or a silicon polymer or silicone material.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Protective coating or sleeve 26 may comprise any suitable UV transmissive material.
      <br/>
      In accordance with one embodiment, sleeve 26 comprises a fluoropolymer material, which is transparent to ultraviolet light, such as the Teflon.RTM. family of products like PTFE, FEP, PFA, AF, Tefzel.RTM. ETFE. Alternatively, protective coating of sleeve 26 may comprise a suitable silicon polymer or silicone material, or sleeve 26 may comprise other UV transmissive materials.
      <br/>
      Protective sleeve 26 protects the soft glass or quartz tube 14 from high impact collisions.
      <br/>
      As one skilled in the art will appreciate, fluoropolymer and silicone coatings are resistant to impacts, and therefore will protect the glass tube.
      <br/>
      In addition, in situations in which the soft glass or quartz casing actually breaks from a high impact collision, protective sleeve 26 is adapted so that it contains the glass or quartz particles and harmful mercury material therein, preventing the glass and mercury from getting into the fluid in which the lamp is placed.
      <br/>
      Moreover, protective sleeve 26 acts as an insulating layer, keeping the temperature of the lamp and in particular the temperature of the plasma within tube 14 at a more stable, proper operating temperature.
      <br/>
      In accordance with this particular aspect of the present invention, the insulating protective sleeve can be a single sleeve or a double insulating sleeve.
      <br/>
      In either case, the single or dual layered sleeve acts as a thermal insulator.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Finally, because of the inert nature of the fluoropolymer sleeves, as well as other suitable UV transmissive sleeves, apparatus 10 can be placed in many environments that are not suitable for the quartz or soft glass lamps currently known in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, apparatus 10 having sleeve 26 can be used in medical environments or other industrial environments using caustic chemicals.
      <br/>
      That is, apparatus 10 can be used to disinfect or sterilize pharmaceutical materials or other materials having low and/or high pH levels, because sleeve 26 does not interact with these materials.
      <br/>
      Also, because the fluoropolymer materials and some other UV transmissive materials have inherent anti-adhesion properties, apparatus 10 can be placed in many fluids or fluid environments, such as sewage treatment facilities, or the like, without caustic or corrosive materials adhering to the sleeve.
      <br/>
      As one skilled in the art will appreciate, ultraviolet lamps which merely have a quartz or soft glass tube, often have problems with caustic or corrosive materials adhering to them.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As illustrated in FIG. 1, protective sleeve 26 may comprise a single piece of coating which surrounds ultraviolet lamp 12 and base 22.
      <br/>
      Coating 26 may be formed around lamp 12 and base 22 by any suitable molding technique known in the art.
      <br/>
      In addition, as illustrated in FIG. 2, coating 26 may be configured from multiple pieces.
      <br/>
      For example, as illustrated in FIG. 2, coating 26 preferably comprises a body portion 30 and a cap or lid portion 32.
      <br/>
      Lid portion 32 may be removably attached to body portion 30 so that one can readily access lamp 12.
      <br/>
      In accordance with this aspect of the invention, lamp 12 may be changed in the event of its failure or malfunction, or a different lamp 12, for example a lamp emitting different ultraviolet wave lengths, can be used in different fluid types.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Sleeve 26 may be any shape that is suitable for its intended application.
      <br/>
      For example, sleeve 26 may be cylindrical, spherical, square, or sleeve 26 may be a particular shape to fit into a specific location or to provide specific fluid dynamic characteristics when apparatus 10 is placed in a fluid containing device.
      <br/>
      Moreover, as discussed in more detail below, sleeve 26 may be shrink-wrapped or pressed onto ultraviolet lamp 12 and/or base 22, so that sleeve 26 takes on the shape of the lamp and ballast assembly.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the ultraviolet lamp can be dipped into a liquid fluoropolymer material or other suitable UV transmissive containment material as discussed above in liquid form.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the lamp is removed, a film of the fluoropolymer or other material forms on and to the shape of the lamp assembly.
      <br/>
      As one skilled in the art will appreciate, the lamp assembly can take on any suitable shape or form.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Power source 24 preferably is connected in electrical communication with base 22 and comprises any suitable power source.
      <br/>
      For example, as illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, power source 24 may be an AC or DC power source located a distance from base 22 and lamp 14.
      <br/>
      In this manner, a suitable electrical connector 29 connects power source 24 with base 22.
      <br/>
      If power source 24 comprises a long electrical connector, connector 24 may be covered by a suitable insulating layer, or it may be covered by a fluoropolymer, silicone or other UV transmissive material such as that used for sleeve 26.
      <br/>
      In addition, a seal 28 may be provided around electrical connector 29 for preventing fluids and other materials from seeping through the interface between protective sleeve 26 and electrical connector 29.
      <br/>
      Seal 28 preferably comprises a flexible material so that it can relieve some of the stress put on electrical connector 29 by the movement of apparatus 10.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention, power source 24 may be a battery pack or solar power generator connected directly to base 22.
