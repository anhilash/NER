      The present invention relates to an improved tobacco harvester adaptable to various harvesting conditions without the necessity to manually remove and/or install defoliating blades or harvesting heads.
      <br/>
      The present invention has two harvesting heads including a stationary lower harvesting head with a pair of defoliating paddles to harvest the sand lugs.
      <br/>
      The second harvesting head is a "tipping head" with rotating steel blades or "cutter bars" which is selectively lowered into position over the defoliator to harvest the leaves from the middle and upper portion of the tobacco stalk.
      <br/>
      The elevation of the tipping head may be adjusted from the operator station while the harvester is in service.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to tobacco harvesting and, more specifically, to a tobacco harvester with a stationary head to defoliate the lower tobacco leaves and a remotely controlled, vertically positioned, head to harvest the middle and upper tobacco leaves.</p>
    <p num="2">
      It has long been desired to reduce the amount of manual labor, time and expense associated with the harvesting of tobacco leaves.
      <br/>
      Harvesting of tobacco leaves has progressed significantly through the years.
      <br/>
      In the past, workers typically walked through the tobacco fields hand picking ("cropping" or "priming") the ripe tobacco leaves.
      <br/>
      Tobacco leaves on the stalk ripen at different times.
      <br/>
      The leaves ripen progressively from the bottom to the top of the stalk thereby necessitating multiple passes through the field during the harvesting season in order to remove progressively higher swaths of leaves from each stalk as they ripen.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Mechanized platforms were introduced which carried the tobacco pickers through the field.
      <br/>
      Although the tobacco was still hand picked, the mechanized platform allowed the pickers to complete their several passes through the tobacco fields at a faster rate.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Mechanized platforms gave away to mechanized harvesters which mechanically cut or stripped leaves from the stalk.
      <br/>
      However, the replacement of human pickers by mechanized harvesters has made the selective harvesting of only the ripe tobacco leaves more difficult.
      <br/>
      Additionally, size and shape of tobacco leaves differs as a function of their position on the stalk, making it difficult to use a single cutting mechanism.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Mechanized harvesters with replaceable cutting or defoliating units permitted the harvester to be set up to harvest a specific type leaf from the tobacco stalk.
      <br/>
      For example, the lowest leaves on the tobacco plant, known as "sand lugs", are more efficiently picked with a narrower or shorter size defoliating paddle or blade than are the larger leaves at the top of the tobacco plant.
      <br/>
      The defoliating blades or paddles of the typical harvester used to strip or cut the sandlugs from the tobacco stalk are firm and slender.
      <br/>
      Harvesting of the middle leaves required the manual replacement of the sandlug defoliating paddles with paddles suitable for the harvesting of the broader shape of the middle leaves.
      <br/>
      It was also common to manually replace the defoliating paddles with steel blades to more efficiently remove the middle and upper leaves from the tobacco stalk.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Additionally, the height of the harvesting head which held the defoliating paddles or steel blades had to be raised progressively higher throughout the tobacco harvesting season as the tobacco leaves were harvested higher and higher on the stalk.</p>
    <p num="7">
      The manual installation of the appropriate defoliating paddles or steel blades, combined with the necessary vertical adjustment of the harvesting heads, typically required several hours of preparation prior to harvesting.
      <br/>
      Once harvesting begun, any subsequent vertical adjustment of the harvesting head required stopping the harvester.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The introduction of mechanized tobacco harvesters also required a change in the way tobacco was planted.
      <br/>
      The physical size of the mechanized harvester grew as mechanized harvesters were developed which could harvest more than one row of tobacco in a single pass through the field.
      <br/>
      As a result, the typical tobacco field is planted with every fifth row missing to allow for the passage of the mechanized harvesters through the fields.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The present invention obviates the need to manually replace the defoliating paddles or blades.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the configuration of the present invention allows the harvester to straddle two adjacent rows of tobacco plants, thereby eliminating the necessity of not planting the fifth row of tobacco plants.
      <br/>
      Importantly, the height of the harvesting head can be adjusted remotely from the operator station while the harvester is in motion, thereby quickly adapting the tobacco harvester to harvest any selected portion of the tobacco stalk.
    </p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="16">
      With reference to FIG. 1, a self-propelled tobacco harvester 100 is illustrated.
      <br/>
      While a preferred embodiment of the present invention harvests two rows of tobacco simultaneously, the description is confined to the components necessary to harvest one row of tobacco with the understanding that the components may be replicated for the simultaneous harvesting of additional rows.
      <br/>
      The harvester frame 110 supports the harvesting heads, which may comprise a lower stationary head (the defoliator) 140 and an upper vertically adjustable tipping head 120, the conveyor 160, the elevator 150, and the hydraulic cylinder and piston 105.
      <br/>
      The harvester 100 may be powered by conventional means such as a diesel or gasoline engine, not shown.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The tobacco harvester 100 is operated from the operator's station 190, which in this embodiment is also supported by the harvester frame 110.
      <br/>
      The operator of the tobacco harvester may control the hydraulic cylinder and piston 105 by the remote switch 180 and conventional electro-hydraulic means well known in the tobacco harvesting art.
      <br/>
      It should be understood that any conventional means for providing the motive force to raise and lower the harvesting head may be used in lieu of the hydraulic system illustrated.
    </p>
    <p num="18">With reference to now to FIG. 2, the tipping head 120 may be lowered into position over defoliator 140 by operation of the remote switch 180.</p>
    <p num="19">
      In operation, the operator may raise and lower the tipping head 120 by the remote switch 180, thus allowing the operator to quickly raise the tipping head 120 to an out-of-service position (not shown).
      <br/>
      With the tipping head 120 raised to an out of service position, the stationary defoliator 140 removes only the lower leaves from the stalk as the tobacco harvester passes through the rows of tobacco stalks and the middle and upper tobacco leaves pass undisturbed beneath the tipping head 120 for harvesting at a later time.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      When the operator desires to harvest the middle and upper leaves of the tobacco plant, he can quickly lower the tipping head 120 into service at the desired vertical level using the remote switch 180.
      <br/>
      The tipping head 120 removes a swath of leaves from tobacco stalk at the desired elevation as the tobacco harvester passes through the rows of tobacco stalks.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Remote switch 180 allows the operator to adjust the vertical position of the tipping head 120 while the tobacco harvester is moving and to make any necessary vertical adjustments during the harvesting of the tobacco leaves.</p>
    <p num="22">
      As tobacco leaves are removed from the stalk either by defoliator 140 or tipping head 120, the leaves are directed by the defoliator shield 200, a fan (not shown) and gravity to conveyor 160 which is positioned beneath defoliator 140 and the tipping head 120.
      <br/>
      The conveyor 160 may carry the tobacco leaves aftward to elevator 150.
      <br/>
      The elevator 150 may be a vertically directed conveyor belt which may carries the leaves to a suitable collection container (not shown) which may be carried by tobacco harvester and supported by tobacco frame 110 by any conventional means.
      <br/>
      The use of vertically displaced and horizontally displaced conveyor means to transport the harvested leaves to suitable collection means is well known within the prior art and will not be described further in the present description.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      With reference to FIG. 3, the upper end of the tipping head assembly 300 is pivotally connected to upper and lower support arms 320.
      <br/>
      The opposite ends of support arms 320 are pivotally connected to support frame 340.
      <br/>
      Hydraulic cylinder and piston 105 is attached to the support frame 340 at the cylinder end 350 and attached to the upper support arm 320 at the piston end 360.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In operation, remote switch 180 may cause hydraulic fluid to be directed to the cylinder 350 thereby forcing piston 360 out of cylinder 350.
      <br/>
      Piston 360 raises upper support arm 320 in a vertical direction causing both support arms 320 to pivot about the connections to the support frame 340 thereby raising tipping head assembly 300 in a vertical direction.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In a similar fashion, operation of remote switch 180 may cause hydraulic fluid to be directed to cylinder 350 causing piston 360 to retract into cylinder 350.
      <br/>
      Piston 360 lowers upper support arm 320 causing both support arms 320 to pivot about the connections to support frame 340, thereby lowering tipping head assembly 300.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      With reference to FIG. 4, a tipping head 120 and defoliator 140 are depicted.
      <br/>
      The tipping head 120 may contain cutter bars 400, which may be rotating blades made of steel or other suitable material, used to remove the middle and upper tobacco leaves from the stalk.
      <br/>
      The defoliator 140 may comprise a pair of defoliator paddles 410 made of rubber or other suitable material in conventional shapes and sizes.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In operation, each defoliator paddle 410, when rotated, removes the lower leaves from the tobacco stalk.
      <br/>
      The removed leaves may be directed by conventional defoliator shields (not shown), a fan (not shown) and by gravity to the conveyor 160.
      <br/>
      While the defoliator paddles 410 in one embodiment of the present invention are rotated by a hydraulic motor, it is understood that those skilled in the art will appreciate that the motive force may be provided by any conventional means.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      With continued reference to FIG. 4, the cutter bars 400 are rotated to strip the leaves from the middle and upper region of the tobacco stalk.
      <br/>
      The removed leaves may be directed to the conveyor 160 by a fan (not shown) and gravity.
      <br/>
      Conveyor 160 may transport the leaves to any suitable container for collection.
    </p>
    <p num="29">While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described, it is to be understood that the embodiments described are illustrative only and the scope of the invention is to be defined solely by the appended claims when accorded a full range of equivalence, many variations and modifications naturally occurring to those of skill in the art from a perusal hereof.</p>
