    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to an electronic packaging and interconnection of a contact structure, and more particularly, to an electronic packaging and interconnection for mounting a contact structure on a probe card or equivalent thereof which is used to test semiconductor wafers, semiconductor chips, packaged semiconductor devices or printed circuit boards and the like with increased accuracy, density and speed.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In testing high density and high speed electrical devices such as LSI and VLSI circuits, high performance probe contactors or test contactors must be used.
      <br/>
      The electronic packaging and interconnection of a contact structure of the present invention is not limited to the application of testing and burn-in of semiconductor wafers and die, but is inclusive of testing and burn-in of packaged semiconductor devices, printed circuit boards and the like.
      <br/>
      However, for the convenience of explanation, the present invention is described mainly with reference to a probe card to be used in semiconductor wafer testing.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In the case where semiconductor devices to be tested are in the form of a semiconductor wafer, a semiconductor test system such as an IC tester is usually connected to a substrate handler, such as an automatic wafer prober, to automatically test the semiconductor wafer.
      <br/>
      Such an example is shown in FIG. 1 in which a semiconductor test system has a test head 100 which is ordinarily in a separate housing and electrically connected to the test system with a bundle of cables.
      <br/>
      The test head 100 and the substrate handler 400 are mechanically connected with one another by means of a manipulator 500 and a drive motor 510 shown FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor wafers to be tested are automatically provided to a test position of the test head by the substrate handler.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      On the test head, the semiconductor wafer to be tested is provided with test signals generated by the semiconductor test system.
      <br/>
      The resultant output signals from the semiconductor wafer under test are transmitted to the semiconductor test system wherein they are compared with expected data to determine whether IC circuits on the semiconductor wafer function correctly.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The test head and the substrate handler are connected with an interface component 140 consisting of a performance board 120 which is a printed circuit board having electric circuit connections unique to a test head's electrical footprint, coaxial cables, pogo-pins and connectors.
      <br/>
      The test head 100 includes a large number of printed circuit boards 150 which correspond to the number of test channels.
      <br/>
      Each of the printed circuit boards has a connector 160 to receive a corresponding contact terminal 121 of the performance board 120.
      <br/>
      A "frog" ring 130 is mounted on the performance board 120 to accurately determine the contact position relative to the substrate handler 400.
      <br/>
      The frog ring 130 has a large number of contact pins 141, such as ZIF connectors or pogo-pins, connected to contact terminals 121, through coaxial cables 124.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      FIG. 2 shows, in more detail, a structure of the substrate handler 400, the test head 100 and the interface component 140 when testing a semiconductor wafer.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the test head 100 is placed over the substrate handler 400 and mechanically and electrically connected to the substrate handler through the interface component 140.
      <br/>
      In the substrate handler 400, a semiconductor wafer 300 to be tested is mounted on a chuck 180.
      <br/>
      A probe card 170 is provided above the semiconductor wafer 300 to be tested.
      <br/>
      The probe card 170 has a large number of probe contactors (such as cantilevers or needles) 190 to contact with circuit terminals or contact targets in the IC circuit of the wafer 300 under test.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Electrical terminals or contact receptacles of the probe card 170 are electrically connected to the contact pins 141 provided on the frog ring 130.
      <br/>
      The contact pins 141 are also connected to the contact terminals 121 of the performance board 120 with coaxial cables 124 where each contact terminal 121 is connected to the printed circuit board 150 of the test head 100.
      <br/>
      Further, the printed circuit boards 150 are connected to the semiconductor test system through the cable 110 having several hundreds of inner cables.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Under this arrangement, the probe contactors 190 contact the surface of the semiconductor wafer 300 on the chuck 180 to apply test signals to the semiconductor wafer 300 and receive the resultant output signals from the wafer 300.
      <br/>
      The resultant output signals from the semiconductor wafer 300 under test are compared with the expected data generated by the semiconductor test system to determine whether the semiconductor wafer 300 performs properly.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      FIG. 3 is a bottom view of the probe card 170 of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In this example, the probe card 170 has an epoxy ring on which a plurality of probe contactors 190 called needles or cantilevers are mounted.
      <br/>
      When the chuck 180 mounting the semiconductor wafer 300 moves upward in FIG. 2, the tips of the cantilevers 190 contact the pads or bumps on the wafer 300.
      <br/>
      The ends of the cantilevers 190 are connected to wires 194 which are further connected to transmission lines (not shown) formed in the probe card 170.
      <br/>
      The transmission lines are connected to a plurality of electrodes 197 which contact the pogo pins 141 of FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Typically, the probe card 170 is structured by a multilayer of polyimide substrates having ground planes, power planes, signal transmission lines on many layers.
      <br/>
      As is well known in the art, each of the signal transmission lines is designed to have a characteristic impedance such as 50 ohms by balancing the distributed parameters, i.e., dielectric constant of the polyimide, inductances, and capacitances of the signal within the probe card 170.
      <br/>
      Thus, the signal lines are impedance matched lines to achieve a high frequency transmission bandwidth to the wafer 300 providing current during steady state and high current peaks generated by the device's outputs switching.
      <br/>
      For removing noise, capacitors 193 and 195 are provided on the probe card between the power and ground planes.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      An equivalent circuit of the probe card 170 is shown in FIG. 4 to explain the limitation of bandwidth in the conventional probe card technology.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B, the signal transmission line on the probe card 170 extends from the electrode 197, the strip (impedance matched) line 196, the wire 194 and the needle (cantilever) 190.
      <br/>
      Since the wire 194 and needle 190 are not impedance matched, these portions function as an inductor L in the high frequency band as shown in FIG. 4C. Because of the overall length of the wire 194 and needle 190 is around 20-30 mm, the significant frequency limitation is resulted in testing a high frequency performance of a device under test.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Other factors which limit the frequency bandwidth in the probe card 170 reside in the power and ground needles shown in FIGS. 4D and 4E. If the power line can provide large enough currents to the device under test, it will not seriously limit the operational bandwidth in testing the device.
      <br/>
      However, because the series connected wire 194 and needle 190 for supplying the power (FIG. 4D) as well as the series connected wire 194 and needle 190 for grounding the power and signals (FIG. 4E) are equivalent to inductors, the high speed current flow is seriously restricted.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Moreover, the capacitors 193 and 195 are provided between the power line and the ground line to secure a proper performance of the device under test by filtering out the noise or surge pulses on the power lines.
      <br/>
      The capacitors 193 have a relatively large value such as 10  MU F and can be disconnected from the power lines by switches if necessary.
      <br/>
      The capacitors 195 have a relatively small capacitance value such as 0.01  MU F and fixedly connected close to the DUT.
      <br/>
      These capacitors serve the function as high frequency decoupling on the power lines.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Accordingly, the most widely used probe contactors as noted above are limited to the frequency bandwidth of approximately 200 MHz which is insufficient to test recent semiconductor devices.
      <br/>
      It is considered, in the industry, that the frequency bandwidth be of at least that equal to the tester's capability which is currently on the order of 1 GHz or higher, will be necessary in the near future.
      <br/>
      Further, it is desired in the industry that a probe card is capable of handling a large number of semiconductor devices, especially memories, such as 32 or more, in parallel (parallel test) to increase test throughput.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      To meet the next generation test requirements noted above, the inventors of this application has provided a new concept of contact structure in the U.S. application Ser.

      <br/>
      FIGS. 5 and 6 show the contact structure in the above noted application.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 5, all of the contact structures 30 are formed on a silicon substrate 20 through the same photolithography process.
      <br/>
      When the semiconductor wafer 300 under test moves upward, the contact structures 30 contact corresponding contact targets (electrodes or pads) 320 on the wafer 300.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The contact structure 30 on the silicon substrate 20 can be directly mounted on a probe card such as shown in FIG. 3, or molded in a package, such as a traditional IC package having leads, so that the package is mounted on a probe card.
      <br/>
      However, packaging and interconnection of the contact structure 30 with respect to the probe card or equivalent thereof is not described in the patent application.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="29">
      To establish a packaging and interconnection of a contact structure directly with a probe card or indirectly with a probe card through an IC package, examples of FIGS. 6A-6C show basic three types of electrical path extended from the contact structure to form such interconnections.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6A shows an example in which such an electrical connection is established at the top of the substrate.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6B shows an example in which an electrical connection is established at the bottom of the substrate while FIG. 6c shows an example in which an electrical connection is formed at the edge of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Almost any types of existing IC package design or probe card design can accommodate at least one of the interconnect types of FIGS. 6A-6C.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Each of FIGS. 6A-6C include a contact interconnect trace 32 also designated by a which is to establish electrical connection with a probe card or any intermediate member to a probe card.
      <br/>
      The contact structure 30 has vertical portions b and d and a horizontal beam c and a tip portion e. The tip portion e of the contact structure 30 is preferably sharpened to achieve a scrubbing effect when pressed against contact targets 320 such as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The spring force of the horizontal beam c provides an appropriate contact force against the contact target 320.
      <br/>
      The inventors of this application have provided a detailed description of production process of the contact structure 30 and the contact interconnect trace 32 on the silicon substrate 20 in the above noted U.S. application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/099,614.
    </p>
    <p num="31">In the present invention, the packaging and interconnection of a contact structure is directed to the type of structure having a contact trace at an edge (edge type contact trace) thereof as shown in FIG. 6C. Various embodiments of the present invention on the edge type packaging and interconnection will be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
    <p num="32">
      FIGS. 7-10 show a first embodiment of the present invention wherein the edge type contact trace is coupled to an interconnect pad provided on a printed circuit board.
      <br/>
      In the first example of FIG. 7, a contact structure 30 formed on a contact substrate 20 is electrically connected to a contact trace 32 which is the edge type contact trace noted above.
      <br/>
      Typically, the contact substrate 20 is a silicon substrate although other types of dielectric substrate, such as glass epoxy, polyimide, ceramic, and alumina substrates are also feasible.
      <br/>
      The contact trace 32 is connected at its end with a printed circuit board (PCB) interconnect pad 38 provided on a PCB substrate 62.
      <br/>
      At about the center of FIG. 7, the contact substrate 20 is mounted on the PCB substrate 62 through an elastomer 42 and a support structure 52.
      <br/>
      The contact substrate 20, the elastomer 42, the support structure 52 and the PCB substrate 62 are fixed with one another by, for example, an adhesive (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The electrical connection between the contact trace 32 and the PCB pad 38 will be established by various bonding technologies including thermosonic bonding, thermocompression bonding, and ultrasonic bonding technique.
      <br/>
      In another aspect, such an electrical connection will be established through a surface mount technology (SMT) such as using a screen printable solder paste.
      <br/>
      A soldering process is carried out based on the reflow characteristics of the solder paste and other solder materials well known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The PCB substrate 62 itself may be a probe card such as shown in FIG. 3 or provided separately and mounted directly or indirectly on the probe card.
      <br/>
      In the former case, the PCB 62 may make direct contact with an interface of a test system such as an IC tester in a manner shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In the latter case, the PCB substrate 62 is pinned or in use of a conductive polymer for establishing an electrical contact to the next level of a contact mechanism on the probe card.
      <br/>
      Such types of electrical connection between the PCB substrate 62 and the probe card through pins or conductive polymer would allow for field repairability.

    <p num="75">
      The PCB substrate 625 may be a multiple layer structure which is capable of providing high bandwidth signals, distributed high frequency capacitance and integrated high frequency chip capacitors for power supply decoupling as well as high pin counts (number of I/O pins and associated signal paths).
      <br/>
      An example of material of the PCB substrate 625 is standard high performance glass epoxy resin.
      <br/>
      Another example of material is ceramics which is expected to minimize mismatch in coefficient of temperature expansion (CTE) rates during high temperature application such as a burn-in test of semiconductor wafers and packaged IC devices.

    <p num="76">
      The support structure 52 is to establish a physical strength of the packaging and interconnection of the contact structure.
      <br/>
      The support structure 52 is made of, for example, ceramic, molded plastic or metal.
      <br/>
      The elastomer 42 is to establish flexibility in the packaging and interconnection of the present invention to overcome a potential planarization mechanism.
      <br/>
      The elastomer 42 also functions to absorb a mismatch in temperature expansion rates between the contact substrate 20 and the PCB substrate 625.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      An example of length of the contact trace 32 is from several ten micrometers to several hundred micrometers.
      <br/>
      Because of the short path length, the packaging and interconnection of the present invention can be easily operable in a high frequency band such as several GHz or even higher.
      <br/>
      Moreover, because of the lower total number of components to be assembled, the interconnection and packaging of the present invention can be fabricated with low cost and high reliability as well as high productivity.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      FIG. 18 shows another example of the fourth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      A contact trace 327 is bent downward and is shaped like a gull-wing which is similar to the standard "gull-wing lead" used in a surface mount technology and incorporated in the examples of FIGS. 8, 11 and 14.
      <br/>
      Because of the gull-wing shape of the contact trace 327, a PCB interconnect pad 38 on a PCB substrate 626 is positioned lower than that of FIG. 17. In this example, the PCB substrate 626 has a planer surface throughout and has no step thereon.
      <br/>
      Thus, the example of FIG. 18 provides an additional clearance in a vertical dimension over the contact portion among the PCB interconnect pad 38, the conductive polymer 66, and the contact trace 327.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The lead form of the contact trace 327 noted above (downward bent, gull-wing lead) may require special tooling to produce the same.
      <br/>
      Such tooling may be standardized for a multiple of contact traces with given pitch.
      <br/>
      Because of the extremely small sizes of the components therein and short path length of the contact structure 30 and contact trace 327, the example of FIG. 18 can operate at a high frequency band.
      <br/>
      Moreover, because of the small number and simple structure of components to be assembled, the interconnection and packaging of the present invention can be fabricated with low cost and high reliability as well as high productivity.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      FIG. 19 shows a further example of the fourth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this example, two gull-wing leads A and B are provided to a contact trace 328 connected to the contact structure 30.
      <br/>
      The gull-wing lead A is provided in an upper and outer position of FIG. 15 than the gull-wing lead B. The gull-wing lead A is connected to a PCB interconnect pad 38 through a conductive polymer 66 and the gull-wing lead B is connected to a PCB interconnect pad 39 through the conductive polymer 67.
      <br/>
      To accommodate the PCB interconnect pads 38 and 39 thereon, a PCB substrate 627 is arranged to have an edge portion having a larger thickness, i.e., a step, to mount the PCB pad 38 thereon and an inner portion adjacent to the edge portion having a smaller thickness to mount the PCB pad 39 thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      The lead form of the contact trace 328 noted above (downward bent, gull-wing lead) may require special tooling to produce the same.
      <br/>
      Such tooling may be standardized for a multiple of contact traces with a given pitch.
      <br/>
      The structure of contact trace 328 having the tiered gull-wing leads A and B can establish a fan out in the vertical dimension.
      <br/>
      This is useful in distributing a signal or power to two or more paths.
      <br/>
      Other advantage of the fan out is to increase the number of contact pads, i.e., to decrease the effective pitch (distance) between the contact pads.
      <br/>
      Similar to the example of FIG. 18, the contact trace 328 of FIG. 19 provides an additional clearance in the vertical dimension over the contact portions formed between contact trace 328 and the PCB pads 38 and 39.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      FIG. 20 shows a further example of the fourth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this example, a contact trace 329 is shaped like a J-lead commonly used in the surface mount technology.
      <br/>
      The J-lead is formed at the edge of a contact substrate 202 in a manner to surround the edge thereof.
      <br/>
      The bottom surface of the contact trace 329 (J-lead) is connected to a PCB interconnect pad 38 on a PCB substrate 628 through the conductive polymer 66.
      <br/>
      The shapes of a support structure 525 and the PCB substrate 628 are slightly different from that of the previous examples to meat the shape of the contact trace 329.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      The lead form of the contact trace 329 noted above (J-lead) may require special tooling to produce the same.
      <br/>
      Such tooling may be standardized for a multiple of contact traces with a given pitch.
      <br/>
      The structure of contact trace 329 having the J-lead can establish an improved physical strength because a large portion of which is supported by the contact substrate 202.
      <br/>
      The further advantage of this example is that the length of the contact trace 329 is about the same as that of the contact substrate 202.
      <br/>
      In other words, the lead form and the attachment method to the PCB substrate in FIG. 20 does not consume any additional horizontal area than that consumed by the contact substrate 202.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      According to the present invention, the packaging and interconnection has a very high frequency bandwidth to meet the test requirements in the next generation semiconductor technology.
      <br/>
      The packaging and interconnection is able to mount the contact structure on a probe card or equivalent thereof by electrically connecting therewith through the edge of the contact structure.
      <br/>
      Moreover, because of a relatively small number of overall components to be assembled, the interconnection and packaging of the present invention can be fabricated with low cost and high reliability as well as high productivity.
