      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a precision polishing apparatus and method for very precisely polishing a substrate, such as a semiconductor wafer or the like.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Recently, as semiconductor devices tend to have ultrafine patterns and multilayer interconnections, precision polishing apparatuses for very precisely flattening the surfaces of semiconductor wafers of Si, GaAs, InP, SOI (silicon on insulator) or the like, are being demanded.
      <br/>
      Particularly, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) apparatuses are known as precision polishing apparatuses for very precisely flattening the surfaces of substrates, such as wafers on which semiconductor devices are formed.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Conventional CMP apparatuses can be classified into two types as shown in FIGS. 7 and 8.</p>
    <p num="6">(1) FIG. 7 is a schematic diagram illustrating an external appearance of a polishing processing unit of a CMP apparatus for performing polishing processing in a state in which the surface to be polished of a wafer 100 is downwardly placed.</p>
    <p num="7">
      As shown in FIG. 7, the wafer 100 is held in a state in which its surface to be polished is downwardly placed, and is polished by being pressed against a polishing pad 1011 having a diameter larger than the diameter of the wafer 100 while being rotated.
      <br/>
      While the wafer 100 is polished, an abrasive (slurry) is dripped onto the upper surface of the polishing pad 1011.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In this type of apparatus, the wafer 100 is held by a wafer chuck 1003, for example, by means of vacuum suction, bonding using wax, a solution or pure water.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent displacement of the wafer 100, a guide ring 1004 is, in some cases, provided along the outer circumference of the wafer 100.
      <br/>
      The diameter of the polishing pad 1011 on a table 1001 is 3-5 times the diameter of the wafer 100.
      <br/>
      A suspension obtained by dispersing fine particles of silicon oxide in an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide is used as the slurry.
    </p>
    <p num="9">(2) A method has also been proposed in which, as shown in FIG. 8, a wafer 100 is held on a wafer chuck 1103 having a guide ring 1104 and disposed on a wafer table 1101, in a state in which the surface to be polished of the wafer 100 is upwardly placed, and the wafer 100 is polished using a polishing pad 1111 having a diameter smaller than the diameter of the wafer 100.</p>
    <p num="10">
      These polishing apparatuses and methods can polish substrates, such as currently-used 8-inch semiconductor wafers or the like.
      <br/>
      Recently, however, as semiconductor integrated circuits tend to have fine patterns and adopt wafers having larger diameters, the diameters of wafers are expected to shift from 8 inches to 12 inches.
    </p>
    <p num="11">In order to polish large-diameter wafers, the conventional techniques have the following problems to be solved.</p>
    <p num="12">That is, in the apparatus shown in FIG. 7, the size of the polishing apparatus increases as the diameter of the wafer increases.</p>
    <p num="13">In the apparatus shown in FIG. 8, much time is required for uniformly polishing the entire surface of the wafer.</p>
    <p num="14">
      In the above-described conventional apparatuses, it is attempted to control the polishing property by optimizing the thickness, elasticity and the like of the polishing pad in order to polish an 8-inch wafer.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, it is difficult to assure fine adjustment and uniformity of the material of the polishing pad, and therefore, to very precisely polish a wafer having a larger diameter, such as 12 inches.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In particular, the polishing property of the polishing pad is degraded in the course of time.
      <br/>
      For example, while the life of the polishing pad is as long as hundreds of hours, the polishing property is degraded by tens of % within this time period.
    </p>
    <p num="16">In addition, flexibility is lacking of polishing a plurality of kinds of IC's (integrated circuits) having different chip sizes and different thicknesses and widths of interconnections with a high throughput.</p>

    <p num="20">In another embodiment, the first polishing station is divided into a primary polishing station for performing polishing at a predetermined polishing speed, and a secondary polishing station for performing polishing at a speed lower than the polishing speed of the primary polishing station.</p>

    <p num="22">In yet another embodiment, the first polishing station, the detection station and the second polishing station are provided within corresponding chambers separated by partition means and separated from atmospheric air.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="47">FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a polishing apparatus and method according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="48">
      The apparatus shown in FIG. 1 includes a first polishing station, a second polishing station, and a detection station for detecting a polished state.
      <br/>
      The first polishing station includes a primary polishing station and a secondary polishing station.
      <br/>
      In the primary polishing station, the entire surface to be polished is polished at a relatively high speed.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      A semiconductor wafer 10, serving as a member to be polished, is mounted on a wafer chuck 15, serving as holding means, in a state in which a surface to be polished of the wafer 10 is upwardly placed.
      <br/>
      A polishing pad 21 is mounted on a lower surface of a polishing head 11.
      <br/>
      The diameter of the polishing pad 21 is larger than the diameter of the wafer 10 and is smaller than twice the diameter of the wafer 10.
      <br/>
      The polishing head 11 and the wafer chuck 15 are independently rotatable.
      <br/>
      The polishing pad 21 mounted on the polishing head 11 is also rotated in accordance with the rotation of the polishing head 11, and the wafer 10 mounted on the wafer chuck 15 is also rotated in accordance with the rotation of the wafer chuck 10.
      <br/>
      If the wafer 10 and the polishing pad 21 are rotated in the same direction at substantially the same rotation speed, uniform polishing is performed.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to provide swinging means for swinging at least one of the polishing head 11 and the wafer chuck 15 if necessary.
      <br/>
      By using such swinging means, uniform polishing can be performed even if the rotation speeds do not coincide.
    </p>
    <p num="50">The above-described configuration is common to both of the primary and secondary polishing stations.</p>
    <p num="51">
      When performing lower-speed finishing polishing by the secondary polishing station after performing high-speed rough polishing by the-primary polishing station, the rotation speed of the polishing pad or the wafer may be made to be lower than the rotation speed in the primary polishing station, or the polishing time period may be shortened, or the amount of supply of the polishing slurry used in the secondary polishing may be reduced, or the grain size of the abrasive grain in the slurry may be reduced, or the dispersion density of the abrasive grain in the slurry may be reduced.
      <br/>
      In the polished-state detection station, the state of the surface to be polished of the wafer 10 is detected using detection means 13, such as a thickness measuring apparatus or the like.
      <br/>
      When the detection means 13 detects that the wafer 10 is polished to a surface shape different from a desired surface shape, detected information is transmitted to the secondary polishing station.
      <br/>
      If the setting of the polishing conditions is changed by performing feedback of the information to the first polishing station, accuracy in subsequent wafer polishing is improved.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Finishing polishing is performed in the secondary polishing station.
      <br/>
      A polishing pad 23 having a diameter smaller than the diameter of the wafer 10 is mounted on a polishing head 14 used in the secondary polishing station, so that the surface to be polished of the wafer 10 is selectively polished locally.
      <br/>
      If necessary, the entire surface to be polished of the wafer 10 may be polished by swinging the polishing head 14.
      <br/>
      Since information relating to the polished state detected by the detection station is supplied to the secondary polishing station, a control device provided in the secondary polishing station processes that information to appropriately determine the rotation speeds of the polishing pad 23 and the wafer 10, and the position and the swinging range of the head 14.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      A pad having a polishing surface smaller than the surface to be polished of the wafer is used as the polishing pad 23, and it is desirable that the surface of the polishing head 14 where the polishing pad 23 is mounted has substantially the same diameter as the diameter of the polishing pad 23.
      <br/>
      More specifically, when polishing a wafer having a diameter of 8 inches, a circular pad having a diameter of 10-30 mm is used.
      <br/>
      The polishing pad may be rectangular or fan-shaped instead of being circular.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      It is desirable to provide partition means in the apparatus of the invention such that, for example, partition walls are provided between respective stations, or respective stations are disposed within four independent closable small chambers.
      <br/>
      The entire apparatus shown in FIG. 1 must be placed within a single chamber so as to be separated from the environment within a clean room.

      In the present invention, a semiconductor wafer of Si, GaAs, InP or the like, or a semiconductor wafer of SOI (silicon on insulator) where a semiconductor layer is provided on the surface of an insulator may be used as the member to be polished.
      <br/>
      In particular, the polishing method of the present invention may be used in a process for forming interconnections on a wafer where semiconductor devices, such as transistors or the like, are formed.

    <p num="56">A polishing liquid obtained by dispersing fine particles having relatively uniform diameters within a range between a few millimeters and submicrometers of silicon oxide, cerium oxide, zeolite oxide, chromium oxide, iron oxide, manganese oxide, silicon carbide, boron carbide, carbon, an ammonium salt or the like in a solution, such as an aqueous solution of sodium hydrochloride, an aqueous solution of potassium hydrochloride, an aqueous solution of ammonia, a solution of isocyanuric acid, Br--CH3 OH, an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, or the like may be preferably used as the abrasive used in the present invention.</p>
    <p num="57">
      The combination of fine particles and a solution can be selected in accordance with an object.

      For example, an abrasive obtained by dispersing fine particles of silicon oxide, cerium oxide, an ammonium salt, manganese dioxide or the like in one of the above-described solutions, an abrasive obtained by dispersing fine particles of silicon oxide in an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide, and an abrasive obtained by dispersing fine particles of silicon oxide in an aqueous solution of ammonia containing hydrogen peroxide are suitable for polishing of the surface of Si, polishing of the surface of SiO2, and polishing of a substrate having Al on its surface, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The abrasive may be supplied directly from a nozzle onto the surface to be polished, or via a hole provided in the polishing pad in a state in which the polishing pad presses the wafer.
      <br/>
      The latter method is desirable when performing uniform polishing.
      <br/>
      Most of the abrasive supplied on the wafer does not remain thereon due to a centrifugal force while the wafer is rotated at a high speed, so that only a small amount of abrasive tends to be nonuniformly distributed on the entire surface of the wafer.
      <br/>
      As a result, uniform polishing cannot be performed in that state.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, by supplying the abrasive on the surface to be polished via the polishing pads uniform polishing can be easily performed.

      <br/>
      The scrubbing washer 106a and the washing device 107a are preferably used as cleaning units because they can clean the wafer effectively without causing scratches.
      <br/>
      At that time, the scrubbing washer 106a, the washing device 107a and the thickness-distribution measuring device 108 are disposed so as to provide a processing station immediately above the corresponding wafer chuck 103, and the scrubbing washer 106b and the washing device 107b are disposed so as to provide a processing station immediately above the corresponding polishing-pad conditioner 104.

      <br/>
      For example, the diameter of the polishing pad is made to be larger than the radius of the wafer by about tens of millimeters in order to polish the entire surface to be polished of the wafer 100 swinging within a range of tens of millimeters.

      The wafer chuck 103 is rotated or swung by driving means provided within the wafer table 101.

      The primary polishing head 105a includes a polishing unit 209, third driving means 204 and a pressing device 208.

      The polishing unit 209 includes a platen 210 where a polishing pad 111 is mounted, and a supporting member 211 for supporting the platen 210.
      <br/>
      The platen is also called a head.

      As shown in FIG. 4, the wafer chuck 103 includes fourth driving means 301 and fifth driving means 302, and is swung along the surface of the wafer table 101 by the fourth driving means 301 and is rotated around the center of the wafer chuck 103 in a direction indicated by an arrow E by the fifth driving means 302.

    <p num="69">
      Although the primary polishing head 105a has been described with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, the secondary polishing head 105b can also polish the wafer 100 by performing rotation and swinging with the same configuration as that of the primary polishing head 105a.
      <br/>
      Instead of swinging the wafer with the configuration shown in FIG. 4, the primary polishing head 105a, the secondary polishing head 105b and the finishing polishing head 109 may be swung by providing driving means therefor.

      The first driving means 201 includes a guide unit and a power unit.
      <br/>
      The wafer table 101 is swung along the surface of the wafer table 101 in a direction indicated by a two-headed arrow B by the first driving means 201.

      In that case, the swinging is effected within a range of tens of millimeters.

      The polishing property and drive of each polishing pad can be independently changed in accordance with polishing conditions.

      <br/>
      Alternatively, the primary polishing head 105a and the secondary polishing head 105b may have different polishing properties by mounting different polishing pads on the primary polishing head 105a and the secondary polishing head 105b or by changing the rotation speed between the primary polishing head 105a and the secondary polishing head 105b.

    <p num="72">
      Although, in the first embodiment, the wafer chucks 103 and the polishing-pad conditioners 104 are alternately disposed at the same interval, different values may be adopted for some intervals, if necessary.

      <br/>
      Accordingly, if a necessary polished amount can be obtained, only the primary polishing head 105a may be used by omitting the secondary polishing head 105b.

      Alternatively, at least three polishing heads may be used.

      Driving conditions for each of the finishing polishing head 109 and the polishing head 105 comprise the type of the member to be polished, the type of the abrasive, the material and the polishing property of the polishing pad, the polishing pressure, and the rotation speeds of the polishing pad and the polishing head.
      <br/>
      Since the primary polishing head 105a, the secondary polishing head 105b and the finishing polishing head 109 can be independently driven, different driving conditions can be set for the respective heads.
      <br/>
      When setting the same driving conditions, it is also possible to select one of the primary polishing head 105a and the secondary polishing head 105b in accordance with the property of the wafer to be polished in order to adjust the polished amount by using the selected polishing head.

      Furthermore, the numbers of the wafer chucks 103 and the polishing-pad conditioners 104 need not be equal.
      <br/>
      That is, the total number may be 4, 8, 10 or the like, or the numbers of the wafer chucks 103 and the polishing-pad conditioners 104 may, for example, be 2 and 4, respectively.
      <br/>
      In such cases, the rotation angle of the second driving means 202 may be appropriately changed so that the wafer chucks 103 and the polishing-pad conditioners 104 are placed immediately below the primary polishing head 105a, the secondary polishing head 105b and the finishing polishing head 109.

      In such cases, the rotational movement of the wafer table 101 may be appropriately changed.

      The fixed wafer 100 is polished by the primary polishing head 105a after rotating the wafer table 101 in a direction indicated by an arrow A by 60 (degree) .
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      When the wafer 100 has been placed immediately below the primary polishing head 105a, the wafer 100 is polished by pressing the primary polishing head 105a against the wafer 100 by the pressing device 208 of the polishing head 105a, supplying the abrasive from the small hole 205 onto the wafer 100, rotating and swinging the wafer chuck 103, and rotating the polishing pad 111.
      <br/>
      Very precise polishing is performed by setting in advance the above-described initial driving conditions for the respective movements at that time.
      <br/>
      An example of detailed driving-conditions will now be shown.

    <p num="83">
      The same speed and direction of rotation are provided for the wafer chuck 103, the polishing pad 111 and the primary polishing head 105 during polishing.

    <p num="84">The pressure of the primary polishing head 105a to be applied to the wafer 100 may be within a range of 0-1 kg/cm2.</p>

      <br/>
      The same polishing method as in the case of the primary polishing head 105a is adopted.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      At that time, the polishing-pad conditioner 104 is placed immediately below the primary polishing head 105a, and another wafer is fixed to the wafer chuck 103 from the wafer bringing-in/out position 102.

      At that time, the primary polishing head 105a supplies pure water instead of the abrasive from the small hole 205 of the polishing pad 111, and slidably moves in cooperation with the polishing-pad conditioner 104 to remove residuals remaining on the surface of the polishing pad 111, i.e., the waste after polishing and the abrasive.
      <br/>
      The polishing pad 111 is thereby recovered to the polishing property before the polishing process.

    <p num="87">
      By thus conditioning the polishing pad at every polishing operation, the problem of a decrease in the polishing property due to the continuous use of the polishing pad is solved.

      <br/>
      In this state, the abrasive and the waste of polishing on the surface of the wafer 100 are rubbed with the brush of the scrubbing washer 106a and are washed off by water to remove the residuals.

      In the first embodiment, since the wafer chucks 103 and the polishing-pad conditioners 104 are alternately disposed, and the polishing pad is conditioned after polishing the wafer, a high polishing property of the polishing pad is always maintained.

      Furthermore, since the thickness-distribution measuring device 108 performs feedback of the result of measurement, and the polishing property of each of the polishing heads can be independently controlled based on that information, variations in the polished amount between the polished wafer and the succeeding wafer are reduced.

      After washing the wafer 100 polished by the secondary polishing head 105b, the thickness of the wafer 100 is measured by the thickness-distribution measuring device 108 and is compared with the target value of the amount to be removed, to obtain the removed amount or the distribution of the removed amount at finishing polishing.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      The relationship between the removed amount per unit time (i.e., the polishing speed) and various kinds of parameters is stored in a memory of the control device in the form of a table or a calculation formula.
      <br/>
      Optimum polishing conditions for the amount to be removed and the distribution of the amount to be removed in finishing polishing are determined based on the information stored in the memory, and optimum driving conditions for the finishing polishing head 109 are selected and executed.

    <p num="99">
      When the result of the thickness measurement indicates a great deviation from the amount to be removed by each of the primary polishing head 105a and the secondary polishing head 105b, which amounts are determined when starting the driving of the apparatus, a data base for driving the rough polishing head, which is similar to the above-described table or calculation formula, may be provided and subjected to feedback to at least one of the primary polishing head 105a and the secondary polishing head 105b by selecting optimum conditions from the data base, and rough polishing conditions may be newly set in order to efficiently perform polishing of the succeeding wafer.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable to store the amount to be removed for each wafer, and to determine conditioning conditions and the time of exchange for the polishing pad from the rate of change of the amount to be removed.

      By thus sequentially transmitting and applying information, it is possible to control the time period of operation processes.

      <br/>
      In the third embodiment, two wafer chucks 103 and two detachably mountable polishing-pad conditioners 104 are disposed on the wafer table 101, and entire polishing, partial finishing polishing, washing and bringing-in/out processes are performed in four processing stations divided by partition plates 1201.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      In the apparatus shown in FIG. 6, the wafer chucks 103 and the polishing-pad conditioners 104 are alternately disposed with an interval of 60 (degree)  at the same distance from the center of the wafer table 101.
      <br/>
      A wafer bringing-in/out device 112 having arms for bringing in/out a wafer 100 is disposed at a wafer bringing-in/out position 102.
      <br/>
      A diamond abrasive grain is fixed on the polishing-pad conditioner 104.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      As in the first embodiment, the wafer table 101 is rotated around its center in a direction indicated by an arrow A by second driving means 202 (not shown), to move the wafer.
      <br/>
      An entire-surface polishing head 801, a scrubbing washer 106a, a washing device 107a, a thickness-distribution measuring device 108, a finishing polishing head 109, a scrubbing washer 106a and a washing device 107a are disposed above the wafer table 101 in the direction indicated by the arrow A starting from the wafer bringing-in/out position 102 so as to face the wafer chucks 103 and the polishing-pad conditioners 104 and to provide four processing stations as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      As in the case shown in FIG. 4, the wafer chuck 103 includes sixth driving means 302 and fifth driving means 301, and performs rotation and swinging.
      <br/>
      The diameter of the entire-surface polishing head 801 is larger than the diameter of the wafer 100 by about 10 millimeters, because swinging is performed within a range of about 10 millimeters.
    </p>
    <p num="109">As in the first embodiment, the scrubbing washer 106a, the washing device 107a and the thickness-distribution measuring device 108 are disposed so as to provide a processing station immediately above the corresponding wafer chuck 103, and the scrubbing washer 106b and the washing device 107b are disposed so as to provide a processing station immediately above the corresponding wafer chuck 103.</p>
    <p num="110">
      The methods for driving the finishing polishing head 109, the wafer table 101, the wafer chucks 103 and the polishing-pad conditioners 104 are the same as in the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      The method for driving the entire-surface polishing head 801 is the same as the method for driving the primary polishing head 105a or the secondary polishing head 105b in the first embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="111">Devices which are desirably added depending on the operation process will now be described.</p>
    <p num="112">Although the entire-surface polishing head 801 and the finishing polishing head 109 are rotatable, these heads may be swung by providing, if necessary, driving means at the head side instead of swinging the wafer, or both of the heads and the wafer may be swung.</p>
    <p num="113">The wafer table 101 may be swung along the surface of the wafer table 101 in a direction indicated by an arrow B by driving means (not shown).</p>
    <p num="114">
      Although, in the third embodiment, the wafer chucks 103 and the polishing-pad conditioners 104 are alternately disposed at the same interval, different values may be adopted for some intervals, if necessary.
      <br/>
      The total number of the wafer chucks 103 and the polishing-pad conditioners 104 may be 1, 2, 3 or at least 5.
      <br/>
      The numbers of the wafer chucks 103 and the polishing-pad conditioners are not necessarily the same.
    </p>
    <p num="115">A number of the entire-surface polishing head 801 may be provided.</p>
    <p num="116">
      The polishing conditions, the polishing method, and the thickness-distribution measuring device are the same as in the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      That is, the wafer 100 brought from the wafer bringing-in/out position 102 to the wafer chuck 103 by the wafer bringing-in/out device 112 is conveyed in a direction indicated by an arrow A by the wafer table 101, is then subjected to entire polishing, washing, finishing partial polishing and washing, and is brought out from the wafer bringing-in/out position 102 by the wafer bringing-in/out device 112.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      In the third embodiment, also, since the wafer chucks 103 and the polishing-pad conditioner 104 are alternately disposed, and the polishing pad is conditioned after polishing the wafer, a high polishing property of the polishing pad is always maintained.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, since the thickness-distribution measuring device 108 performs feedback of the result of measurement, and the polishing property of each of the polishing heads can be independently controlled based on that information, variations in the polished amount between the polished wafer and the succeeding wafer are reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      By providing a plurality of wafer chucks and a plurality of polishing-pad conditioners on the same surface, and sequentially transferring the wafer chucks and the polishing-pad conditioners to the processing station where a polishing head is provided by transfer means, the processing time period can be reduced.
      <br/>
      For example, in the first embodiment, if the time period for rotating the wafer table 101 by 60 (degree)  (index time) is assumed to be 1 minute, each wafer starting from the fifth wafer brought in from the wafer bringing-in/out position 102 and polished by passing through respective processes can be brought out from the wafer bringing-in/out position 102 at every 1 minute (tact time).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when continuously processing a large amount of wafers in a semiconductor manufacturing process, the present invention is very advantageous.
      <br/>
      Since foreign matter adhering to the polishing pad is removed every time polishing has been completed and therefore, the state of the polishing pad can be maintained constant, it is possible to obtain wafers with a high production yield.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      As described above, by using the precision polishing apparatus of the present invention, it is possible to polish not only conventional 8-inch wafers, but also 12-inch wafers very precisely and with a high throughput.
      <br/>
      This is because, by dividing the polishing process into entire polishing and correction polishing where only a part of the wafer is polished, it is possible to perform polishing by partially correcting concave and convex portions of the wafer itself and concave and convex portions produced when providing multilayer interconnections in the production process due to the use of a large-diameter wafer both in rough polishing and finishing polishing.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      Concave and convex portions produced in patterning in a device forming process have intervals within a range of submicrometers and millimeters, and have a height of about 1 micrometer.
      <br/>
      Concave and convex portions are present in a direction perpendicular to the surface to be polished of a bare wafer.
      <br/>
      Such concave and convex portions are produced by warping of the bare wafer itself or variations in the thickness of the wafer.
      <br/>
      For example, in some cases, a warp of about 75  MU m is generated, or variations in the thickness of the wafer of about 25  MU m are present.
    </p>
    <p num="121">In addition, concave and convex portions within a range of about 10 millimeters are produced in a direction parallel to the surface of the wafer due to warping of the wafer.</p>
    <p num="122">Accordingly, macroscopic concave and convex portions of about 10 millimeters and microscopic concave and convex portions of at least submicrometers are simultaneously present, and concave and convex portions in a direction perpendicular to the surface to be polished of the wafer, such as warping of the wafer itself, or variations in the thickness, are also present.</p>
    <p num="123">In such a case, by combining a process of polishing the entire surface of the wafer using a polishing pad having a diameter slightly larger than the diameter of the wafer and correction polishing of partially polishing the wafer using a polishing pad having a diameter smaller than the diameter of the wafer, it is possible to perform polishing so as to coincide with the target shape of the surface.</p>
    <p num="124">Furthermore, by arbitrarily combining the rotation and swinging of the wafer chuck, the swinging of the wafer table, the rotation and swinging of the polishing pad, and the like, it is possible to assure target polishing conditions and to perform high-quality polishing.</p>
    <p num="125">
      In addition, by performing feedback of the result of measurement of the thickness of the wafer to the finishing polishing process to adjust set conditions for correction polishing, exact finishing polishing can be performed.
      <br/>
      At the same time, by performing feedback of the result of measurement of the thickness of the wafer to the polishing process, it is possible to utilize the result for setting conditions when performing rough polishing of the succeeding wafer, and therefore, to perform more effective polishing.
    </p>
    <p num="126">The individual components shown in outline in the drawings are all well-known in the polishing apparatus and method arts and their specific construction and operation are not critical to the operation or the best mode for carrying out the invention.</p>
    <p num="127">
      While the present invention has been described with respect to what are presently considered to be the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments.
      <br/>
      To the contrary, the present invention is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
