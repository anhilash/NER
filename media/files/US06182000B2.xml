    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      This invention is directed to a control device for an automatic transmission, which has plural and non-continuous gear stages, is controlled based on the information regarding the road condition of the route that the vehicle follows.
      <br/>
      This information is output by a route information detection device.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Generally, the gear stage of an automatic transmission for a vehicle is automatically controlled by the driving condition of the vehicle, which is detected by various sensors.
      <br/>
      Although if sensors are used to detect the vehicle driving condition, they can only detect the change of the vehicle driving condition when the vehicle encounters an actual change in road conditions.
      <br/>
      So, if sensors are used, the driving force is changed by shifting the gear stages after detection of an actual change in the driving condition, which sometimes reduces the drivability and performance of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Recently, it has become possible for a route information detection system, for example, a navigation system, to detect in advance information regarding the road condition, on which the vehicle travels, and this information is used to control shifting of the gear stages of an automatic transmission before the road conditions actually change.
      <br/>
      An example of a vehicle control system is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication No. HEI 7-306998.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In the above mentioned patent, the vehicle control system has a digital map, which stores information on a road map, navigation system, which calculates location of the vehicle on the map, a wheel sensor, which detects the vehicle speed, a predict system, which predicts the route that the vehicle will follow, a driving skills determining system, which determine the driver's skills, an appropriate speed calculating system, which calculates an appropriate speed for the driver based on his driving skills, a comparison system, which compares the calculated appropriate speed and the actual running speed, a vehicle acceleration calculation system that calculates the acceleration that the vehicle should take to make the vehicle travel at said appropriate speed by taking into account the information from the comparison system, continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a transmission control system, which controls a speed ratio of the CVT based on the calculated vehicle acceleration.
      <br/>
      The above mentioned system takes the following steps when the vehicle road conditions where require deceleration, for example, to enable to go through a curve safely.
      <br/>
      First of all, the vehicle control system judges whether the driver will be able to through the curve smoothly through the curve at the present speed, the appropriate speed for going smoothly through the curve is calculated.
      <br/>
      Second of all, the speed plan is determined to decrease the vehicle speed from the present speed to the appropriate speed for going through the curve, and the target speed is determined.
      <br/>
      Taking into consideration the driver's skills, the vehicle deceleration is calculated to make the present vehicle speed the target speed.
      <br/>
      The maximum of this deceleration is set so the driver may not feel the deceleration.
      <br/>
      Consequently, without making the passengers uncomfortable, the vehicle decreases its speed to the appropriate speed for going through the curve before the vehicle reaches the curve, thereby enabling the vehicle to go smoothly through the curve.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Regarding the automatically controlled transmission, in addition to the continuously variable transmission (CVT), there is so a called automatic transmission which has plural and non continuous gear stages, consisting of the gear mechanisms and frictional engagement units.
      <br/>
      The gear stages are non continuous gear ratios, the gear stages are set by engaging one frictional engagement unit and disengaging another frictional engagement unit.
      <br/>
      When the gear stage of the automatic transmission changed, the frictional engagement units will engage or disengage, which causes shift shock during a shift change.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A vehicle, that has an automatic transmission, with non continuous gear stages, to go through a curve smoothly, should be controlled by decreasing its speed before the curve.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable to avoid changing the speed ratio during the curve.
      <br/>
      Although for a vehicle that has an automatic transmission, if the gear stage is changed from a higher stage to a lower stage to decrease the vehicle speed, it is possible that more than one shift changing will continuously occur, and consequently the shift shock of the gear shift changing will occur as well.
      <br/>
      That's why if the above mentioned invention is applied the same to a vehicle that has automatic transmission, it is impossible to prevent the occurrence of the shock of the speed changing.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      One object of the present invention is to provide an automatic transmission control system that is able to decrease the number of gear stage shifts as much as possible, when the vehicle, goes through a curve.
      <br/>
      A control system built according to the present invention is described in the following.
      <br/>
      The traveling distance to zero the vehicle is determined if the vehicle decreases its speed from the present speed by the predetermined decreasing speed.
      <br/>
      The number of corners, which are regarded as the places where it is necessary to decrease speed, are detected in the determined traveling distance.
      <br/>
      The vehicle target speed Vt is calculated for each corner.
      <br/>
      Vt is set for maintaining proper behavior of the vehicle, stability of operation, and good drivability if the vehicle rounds the corner.
      <br/>
      The required vehicle speed Vi at the present position of the vehicle calculated to decrease present vehicle speed V to the vehicle target speed Vt for the specific corner.
      <br/>
      Vi is calculated on the basis of the distance between the present position of the vehicle and each corner.
      <br/>
      The target deceleration from the present speed V to the required vehicle speed Vi of the specific corner is lager than the threshold value, the specific corner is regarded as the target corner It, and it is counted as the target corner It.
      <br/>
      The target corner needs the automatic transmission 2 to shift down.
    </p>
    <p num="9">In the invention, if there is more than one corner where vehicle is not able to decreases its speed to the vehicle target speed Vt at a rate less than the target deceleration; and the distance from the present position to the immediate corner is less than the threshold value; and the present vehicle speed V is more than the vehicle target speed Vt; and the vehicle is on the straight road; it is regarded that there is little possibility to accelerate before entering the target corner, the deceleration of the vehicle or the shift down makes little influence against the behavior of the vehicle, stability of the vehicle, and the drivability, then more than one gear stage will be executed.</p>
    <p num="10">
      According to the invention, when the corner is detected on the road ahead of the present position by the navigation system, the gear stage is shifted down only if the deceleration from the present vehicle speed to the required vehicle speed Vi is more than the threshold value.
      <br/>
      The shifting down of the gear stage is aimed towards getting engine brake effect easily.
      <br/>
      So it is possible that when the criteria are satisfied, the automatic transmission is controlled in order to get engine brake effect.

    <p num="12">The entire disclosure of Japanese Patent Application HEI 8-355567 filed on Dec. 24, 1996, including specification, claims drawings, and summary is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
    <p num="13">
      The present invention will be described more specifically with reference to the accompanying drawings.
      <br/>
      First of all, here will be described the summary of a vehicle to which is directed the present embodiment.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, there is connected to the output side of an engine 1 acting as a power source, an automatic transmission 2, which is exemplified by transmission gear stages.
      <br/>
      The output power of the engine 1 is electrically controlled, and an intake manifold 3 of the engine 1 is provided with an electronic throttle valve 5, which is driven by a servo motor 4.
      <br/>
      The engine 1 is provided with a fuel injection control unit 6, including a fuel injector 6A, which controls the amount of the fuel injection in the combustion chamber 1A, and an ignition timing adjusting unit 7, including a spark plug 7A, a distributor 7B, and an ignition coil 7C.
      <br/>
      An opening amount of an acceleration pedal 8, which is used to control the output power of the engine 1, is detected by an acceleration pedal switch 9.
      <br/>
      The acceleration pedal switch 9 generates a signal indicative of the operating amount of the acceleration pedal 8, which is applied to the engine electronic control unit (E-ECU) 10. The engine electronic control unit 10 is comprised of a micro computer, which incorporates a central processing unit CPU) 11, a random-access memory (RAM) 12, an input interface circuit 13, and an output interface circuit 14.
      <br/>
      The engine electronic control unit 10 is fed with various kinds of data to control the engine 1, for example, data from an engine revolving speed sensor 15 for detecting the revolving speed of the engine (Ne), data from an air flow meter 16 for detecting the quantity of intake-air (Q), an intake-air temperature sensor 17 for detecting the temperature of intake air, and a throttle sensor 18 for detecting the opening degree  THETA  of the electronic throttle valve 5.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the engine electronic control unit 10 is fed with data from a vehicle speed sensor 19 for detecting vehicle velocity in accordance with the revolving speed of the output shaft of the automatic transmission 2 or the like, cooling water temperature sensor 20 for detecting the temperature of cooling water for the engine 1, and a brake switch 22 for detecting the amount of the operation of brake pedal 21.
      <br/>
      The engine electronic control unit (E ECU) 10 calculates the data, which are from various sensors and switches, in order to determine the driving condition of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      At least one of the following is controlled based on the driving condition: opening of the electronic throttle valve 5, the amount of the fuel injection of the fuel injection control unit 6, or the ignition timing of the ignition control unit 7.
      <br/>
      The engine electronic control unit (E-ECU) 10 and navigation systems are connected to communicate with each other to exchange data.
      <br/>
      It is possible that the engine electronic control unit (E-ECU) 10 controls at least one of the opening of the electronic throttle valve 5, the amount of the fuel injection of the fuel injection control unit 6, or the ignition timing of the ignition control unit 7 based on the route data output from the navigation system, which indicates the route that the vehicle will follow.
      <br/>
      So the engine electronic control unit (E-ECU) 10 stores the standard data, which will be corrected by correspondence of the road information to the route, to control the opening of the electronic throttle valve 5, the amount of the fuel injection of the fuel injection control unit 6, or the ignition timing of the ignition control unit 7.

      The control of the Step 1 will be explained specifically in the example described in FIG. 8 and FIG. 9.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      At Step 2, at first, the number of the corners i, a target corner It, and a vehicle target speed Vt are initialized, so these are set as i=1, It=0, and Vt=the present speed of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The target corner It indicates a corner where a shift down is needed if the vehicle decreases in speed from the present.
      <br/>
      In other words, if the vehicle is to go through the corner smoothly, it must decrease its speed by more than the target deceleration.
      <br/>
      The vehicle target speed Vt is set for maintaining proper handling of the vehicle, stability of the operation, and good drivability if the vehicle rounds the corner.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The vehicle target speed Vt is calculated for each corner (i=N).
      <br/>
      The number of the corners (i=N) is detected at Step 1.
      <br/>
      The vehicle target speed Vt is the appropriate speed for maintaining handling of the vehicle, stability of the operation, and good drivability as the vehicle rounds each corner, and it is calculated based on the radius of the corner and so on.
      <br/>
      At Step 3, a required vehicle speed Vi at the present position of the vehicle is calculated in order to make the present vehicle speed V decrease to the vehicle target speed Vt for the specific corner.
      <br/>
      Vi is calculated on the basis of the distance between the present position of the vehicle and each corner.
      <br/>
      In other words, Vt is determined to pass through the i-th corner safely, and Vi is determined as how much speed the vehicle has to decrease at present.
      <br/>
      Vi is calculated on the basis of the distance between the present position and the i-th corner.
      <br/>
      Step 3 will be described in detail FIG. 10. At Step 4, it is decided whether the present vehicle speed is more than the required vehicle speed Vi or not.
      <br/>
      In other words, Step 4 judges whether it is possible for the vehicle to decrease the present speed to less than the vehicle target speed Vt when it enters the i-th corner, and if the vehicle decreases its speed by less than the vehicle target deceleration.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      If the answer of Step 4 is NO, the control flow goes to Step 5.
      <br/>
      At Step 5, it is decided whether the required vehicle speed Vi corresponding to N corners is lower than the vehicle target speed.
      <br/>
      If the answer of the Step 4 is YES, the control flow goes to Step 6.
      <br/>
      At Step 6, the i-th corner is counted as a target corner It, and the vehicle target speed Vt is renewed to the minimum value of the required vehicle speed Vi.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      At Step 7, the number of the corner i is increased by 1, which means one of the calculations of the vehicle target speed Vt corresponding to one of the corners is finished.
      <br/>
      At Step 8, it is decided whether the number of the corner i exceeds the number of the corner N, which is detected in Step 1.
      <br/>
      If the answer of Step 8 is NO, the control flow goes back to Step 3.
      <br/>
      The loop is constructed by Step 2, 3, and 8, and the loop counter i is the number of corners, which is detected by Step 1.
    </p>
    <p num="49">If the answer of Step 4 is YES, the control flow goes to Step 7, because there is a possibility to enter the corner at less than the vehicle target speed Vt even if the vehicle keeps the present vehicle speed V, if the answer of Step 5 is NO, the control flow goes to Step 7.</p>
    <p num="50">
      As shown in FIG. 7, if the answers of Step 4 is NO and Step 5 is YES, the i-th corner is counted as the target corner It.
      <br/>
      In other words, if the target deceleration from the present speed V to the required vehicle speed Vi of the specific corner is larger than the threshold value, the specific corner is regarded as the target corner It, and it is counted as the target corner It.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      If the answer of the Step 8 is YES, it means that the all of the calculations about the vehicle target speed Vt, corresponding to the all the corners N, which are detected in Step 1, are finished.
      <br/>
      At Step 9, it is decided whether the target corner It is more than 0.
      <br/>
      If It is more than 0, it means that there is more than one corner where vehicle is not able to decrease its speed to the vehicle target speed Vt at the rate less than the target deceleration.
      <br/>
      And it is decided whether the distance from the present position to the immediate corner is less than the threshold value.
      <br/>
      And it is decided whether the present vehicle speed V is more than the vehicle target speed Vt, in other words, the present vehicle speed V is more than the minimum value of the required vehicle speed Vi.
      <br/>
      And it is decided whether the vehicle is on the straight road.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      At Step 9, if the all criteria are satisfied, the control flow goes to Step 10.
      <br/>
      In other words, if there exists more than one target corner It and the corner is located on a straight road within the threshold distance from the present position, the control flow goes to Step 10.
      <br/>
      Because there exists It, there is little possibility to accelerate before entering the target corner, and the reduction of the vehicle speed, the shift down has little influence on the vehicle, stability of the vehicle, and the drivability.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      At Step 10, if the criteria for the shift down of the automatic transmission 2 are satisfied, more than one gear stage of the shift down will be executed and the control flow returns.
      <br/>
      The criteria for the shift down include following condition, when the amount of the operation of the brake pedal 21 is detected, or when the amount of the operation of the acceleration pedal 8 is detected.
      <br/>
      The number of the shift at the same time is determined on the basis of the deceleration which is needed.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      At Step 9, if the criteria are not satisfied, the shift down is not executed and the control flow returns.
      <br/>
      Because of the reduction of the vehicle speed or the shift down influences the behavior of the vehicle, stability of the vehicle, and the drivability.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      According to the control flow shown in FIG. 7, when the corner is detected on the road ahead of the present position by the navigation system, the gear stage is only shifted down if the deceleration from the present vehicle speed to the required vehicle speed Vi is more than the threshold value.
      <br/>
      The shift down of the gear stage is used to get the engine to brake easily.
      <br/>
      So it is possible that when the criteria are satisfied, the control will be executed to get the engine brake effect.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      In other words, if the deceleration is smaller than the threshold value, the shift down is prohibited.
      <br/>
      It is possible to decrease the number of the shift down of the automatic transmission 2 as small as possible.
      <br/>
      Comfort and drivability of the vehicle will be improved because the shift down of the automatic transmission 2 is controlled.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 7, because the shift down of the automatic transmission 2 is controlled by taking account into the corners, the shift down is prohibited during the corner, and the shift shock during the corner is controlled, and the handling of the vehicle is stable and stability of the operation is improved.

      The predicted running time t indicates the time which is needed for the vehicle speed to be the required vehicle speed vi by decreasing the speed at the predetermined deceleration on a straight road.

    </p>
    <p num="88">
      Instead of the control shown in FIG. 7, it is possible to adapt the following example.
      <br/>
      The control system has a vehicle speed decreasing point detector which detects only those places where it is necessary to decrease the vehicle speed.
      <br/>
      The vehicle target speed calculator calculates a vehicle target speed only for the vehicle speed decreasing point.
      <br/>
      And it has a target deceleration calculator which calculates the decrease speed to the vehicle target speed.
      <br/>
      And it has a gear stage controller which executes shift down of the automatic transmission 2 only if the decrease speed is more than the threshold.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      It is possible for automatic transmission 2 to control other systems to decrease the vehicle speed.
      <br/>
      In such a case, the information about the corner detected by the navigation system 67, the distance between present position and the corner, and the radius of the corner are used for the control.
    </p>
    <p num="90">For example, if the vehicle speed decreasing point is detected by the navigation system 67, electronic throttle valve 5 is shut to increase the force of engine braking, the oil pressure for the wheel cylinder 69 of the brake system 65 is controlled to increase the force of the braking, and the control of the same speed control, by the vehicle auto drive control system 66, is canceled to decrease the speed.</p>
    <p num="91">The predetermined target side direction acceleration is corrected by the coefficient of friction of the road which is determined based on the revolving speed difference by wheel speed 71 and the braking force is controlled.</p>
    <p num="92">
      Furthermore, it is possible to calculate the lateral acceleration based on the vehicle speed during the corner and the radius of the corner, and the control of the deceleration will take into account the result of the calculation.
      <br/>
      It is a kind of learning control of the target lateral acceleration, for example, if the result of the calculation is larger than the predetermined lateral acceleration, the difference between the calculated value and the predetermined lateral acceleration will be added to the target lateral acceleration; if the result of the calculation is smaller than the predetermined lateral acceleration, the difference between the calculated value and predetermined lateral acceleration will be subtracted from the target lateral acceleration.
      <br/>
      If the data, which are renewed from the learning and are reflecting the tendency of the driver, are used for the control of the lateral acceleration, the control of the sown shift, and the other controls, will improve the drivability.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      It is possible to execute learning control to correct the target deceleration by the tendency of the driver.
      <br/>
      For example, it is detected if the deceleration occurs during braking before the corner.
      <br/>
      If the detected deceleration is greater than the predetermined target deceleration, the difference value between the detected decreasing speed rate and the predetermined target value is added to the target deceleration.
      <br/>
      If the deceleration is smaller than the predetermined target deceleration, the difference value is reduced from the target deceleration.
    </p>
    <p num="94">Reflecting the target decreasing speed which is controlled by the learning control, the decreasing speed is conformed to the driver's liking, and consequently, the drivability is improved.</p>
    <p num="95">
      The following example is also possible.
      <br/>
      The road slope is detected based on the data from the vehicle speed sensor 19, throttle sensor 18, engine revolving speed sensor 15, and the slope sensor 92.
      <br/>
      The vehicle speed when the vehicle enters the corner is predicted on the basis of the detected data.
      <br/>
      And if the predicted speed is higher than a permissible speed, the automatic transmission 2 shifts down.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      As a result, while the vehicle is running on the up slope, if it predicts that the vehicle speed will decrease enough before the next corner because of the slope, the down shift is prohibited.
      <br/>
      While the vehicle is running on the down slope, if it predicts that the vehicle speed will increase before the next corner because of the slope, the down shift is executed.
      <br/>
      These controls improve the drivability.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      The following example is also possible.
      <br/>
      While the vehicle is running before the corner, if the ON signal of the brake switch 22 or OFF signal of the acceleration pedal switch 9 is detected, the automatic transmission 2 shifts down.
      <br/>
      In other words, while the vehicle is running before the corner, if the driver's intention is to decrease the speed, for example, operation of the brake pedal 21 or the release of the acceleration pedal 8, is detected, so the automatic transmission 2 shifts down.
      <br/>
      The down shift is executed when the driver's intention of decreasing the speed is detected, so it does not create a bad feeling of drivability.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Furthermore, the automatic transmission 2 is controlled on the basis of the road conditions detected by the navigation system 67, if a diverging point, such as an intersection, is detected on the road ahead of the present position, it is impossible to predict which way the driver will choose.
      <br/>
      So control of the detecting the corners is stopped or control of the automatic transmission 2 is prohibited.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is possible to prevent disagreement between the road condition and the driving force of the vehicle, and improve the drivability.
      <br/>
      This invention is applicable to the automatic transmission which is capable of setting three forward gear stages or four forward gear stages.
