      Field of Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates in general to electrophotography and, in particular, to a process for preparing electrophotographic imaging members or photoreceptors.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides a process for forming such imaging members, and imaging members formed thereby, having improved adhesion between coated layers.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In electrophotography, also known as Xerography, electrophotographic imaging or electrostatographic imaging, the surface of an electrophotographic plate, drum, belt or the like (imaging member or photoreceptor) containing a photoconductive insulating layer on a conductive layer is first uniformly electrostatically charged.
      <br/>
      The imaging member is then exposed to a pattern of activating electromagnetic radiation, such as light.
      <br/>
      The radiation selectively dissipates the charge on the illuminated areas of the photoconductive insulating layer while leaving behind an electrostatic latent image.
      <br/>
      This electrostatic latent image may then be developed to form a visible image by depositing oppositely charged particles on the surface of the photoconductive insulating layer.
      <br/>
      The resulting visible image may then be transferred from the imaging member directly or indirectly (such as by a transfer or other member) to a print substrate, such as transparency or paper.
      <br/>
      The imaging process may be repeated many times with reusable imaging members.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      An electrophotographic imaging member may be provided in a number of forms.
      <br/>
      For example, the imaging member may be a homogeneous layer of a single material such as vitreous selenium or it may be a composite layer containing a photoconductor and another material.
      <br/>
      In addition, the imaging member may be layered.
      <br/>
      Current layered organic imaging members generally have at least a substrate layer and two active layers.
      <br/>
      These active layers generally include (1) a charge generating layer containing a light-absorbing material, and (2) a charge transport layer containing electron donor molecules.
      <br/>
      These layers can be in any order, and sometimes can be combined in a single or mixed layer.
      <br/>
      The substrate layer may be formed from a conductive material.
      <br/>
      In addition, a conductive layer can be formed on a nonconductive substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The charge generating layer is capable of photogenerating charge and injecting the photogenerated charge into the charge transport layer.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,855,203 to Miyaka teaches charge generating layers comprising a resin dispersed pigment.
      <br/>
      Suitable pigments include photoconductive zinc oxide or cadmium sulfide and organic pigments such as phthalocyanine type pigment, a polycyclic quinone type pigment, a perylene pigment, an azo type pigment and a quinacridone type pigment.
      <br/>
      Imaging members with perylene charge generating pigments, particularly benzimidazole perylene, show superior performance with extended life.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In the charge transport layer, the electron donor molecules may be in a polymer binder.
      <br/>
      In this case, the electron donor molecules provide hole or charge transport properties, while the electrically inactive polymer binder provides mechanical properties.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the charge transport layer can be made from a charge transporting polymer such as poly(N-vinylcarbazole), polysilylene or polyether carbonate, wherein the charge transport properties are incorporated into the mechanically strong polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Imaging members may also include a charge blocking layer and/or an adhesive layer between the charge generating and the conductive layer.
      <br/>
      In addition, imaging members may contain protective overcoatings.
      <br/>
      Further, imaging members may include layers to provide special functions such as incoherent reflection of laser light, dot patterns and/or pictorial imaging or subbing layers to provide chemical sealing and/or a smooth coating surface.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Suitable coating methods used for applying the various layers in electrophotographic imaging members include dip coating, roll coating, Meyer bar coating, bead coating, curtain flow coating and vacuum deposition.
      <br/>
      Solution coating is a preferred approach because it is more economical than vacuum coating and can be used to deposit a seamless layer.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,855,203 to Miyaka teaches applying charge generating layers from coating solutions comprising a resin dispersed pigment.
      <br/>
      Miyaka discloses suitable organic solvents for preparing a coating solution of the pigments as including alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol; ketones such as acetone, methylethyl ketone and cyclohexanone; amides such as N,N-dimethyl formamide and N,N-dimethyl acetamide; sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and ethylene glycol monomethyl ether; esters such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate; aliphatic halogen hydrocarbons such as chloroform, methylene chloride, dichloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene; or aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ligroin, monochlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene.

      <br/>
      However, vacuum coating is expensive.

      The process comprises forming a dispersion of a perylene pigment and a polyvinylbutyryl binder in an acetate solvent and applying the dispersion to an electrophotographic imaging member layer by solution coating.
      <br/>
      Yuh et al. teaches that perylenes form stable dispersions in acetate solvents for the purposes of application by solvent coating such as dip coating.

      <br/>
      The process includes the steps of dispersing a perylene-containing charge generating material in a solvent comprising n-butylacetate and a second solvent having a lower boiling point than n-butylacetate, wherein the second solvent is an acetate or tetrahydrofuran, and applying the dispersion to form the charge generating layer on a substrate or underlayer of the imaging member.

      Despite the presence of various methods for forming imaging member layers, it is desired in the art to increase the adhesion between successive layers in an imaging member package.
      <br/>
      In particular, in the case of endless (seamless) belts, which tend to undergo much mechanical stress, increased adhesion of the successive layers in the imaging member is particularly desired.

    <p num="15">
      Various treatment methods are generally known in the art to improve adhesion between successive layers in a photoreceptor.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,915,514 discloses the use of plasma or corona discharge on an insulating member (substrate) of a donor roll, to increase adhesion and to provide a uniform subsequent metal coating.
      <br/>
      The disclosed process includes the step of applying corona discharge to the surface of the donor roll, prior to coating the donor roll substrate with a photo or thermally sensitive composition comprised of a polymeric material and a conductive metal nucleating agent.

      Similarly, various methods such as plasma discharge and corona discharge are known and used for various purposes.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,635,327 discloses the use of glow discharge decomposition to apply amorphous silicon containing at least one of hydrogen and a halogen onto a conductive substrate.
      <br/>
      Likewise, U.S. Pat. No. 5,514,507 discloses using plasma discharge to form a layer having amorphous silicon germanium as a main body containing at least hydrogen, fluorine and a group III element.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      The present invention is directed to a process for preparing an organic electrophotographic imaging member having at least a charge generating layer and a charge transport layer, wherein the imaging member has increased adhesion between at least two of the layers.
      <br/>
      The process comprises applying one of corona discharge or plasma discharge to the surface of an organic layer of the imaging member, and subsequently forming a coating layer thereover.
      <br/>
      The corona or plasma treatment provides increased adhesion between the respective layers.

    <p num="19">
      applying a first organic layer to an imaging member substrate,
      <br/>
      treating said first organic layer with one of corona discharge or plasma discharge; and
      <br/>
      applying a second organic layer to said first organic layer.
    </p>
    <p num="20">In other embodiments, the present invention provides imaging members formed by such a process.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="21">
      The present invention relates to a method for increasing the adhesion between adjoining layers of an imaging member, preferably an organic imaging member, by applying a corona or plasma discharge to the underlying layer.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the described corona and/or plasma discharge may be applied to any of the various organic layers of the imaging member, which layer is subsequently coated with another layer.
      <br/>
      Such treatment provides increased adhesion between the two layers.
      <br/>
      Although the corona or plasma discharge may be applied to any or all of the various layers, it is preferred that the layer to be treated is an organic-based layer, i.e., a layer that includes, in whole or in part, organic molecules and/or an organic binder.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      According to embodiments of the present invention, an electrophotographic imaging member is provided, which generally comprises at least a substrate layer, a charge generating layer, and a charge transport layer.
      <br/>
      This imaging member can be employed in an imaging process providing the electrophotographic imaging member, depositing a uniform electrostatic charge on the imaging member with a corona charging device, exposing the imaging member to activating radiation in image configuration to form an electrostatic latent image on the imaging member, developing the electrostatic latent image with electrostatically attractable toner particles to form a toner image, transferring the toner image to a receiving member and repeating the depositing, exposing, developing and transferring steps.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In general, electrostatographic imaging members are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      An electrostatographic imaging member, including the electrostatographic imaging member of the present invention, may be prepared by any of the various suitable techniques, provided that at least one of the underlying organic layers is processed or treated by the corona discharge or plasma discharge methods of the present invention, which will be described below.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      According to the present invention, at least one of the organic layers is treated by corona discharge or plasma discharge (including glow discharge) to roughen the surface of the layer.
      <br/>
      Such treatments roughen the layer surface, at least on a micro scale, to provide increased adhesion of the layer to a subsequently applied layer.
      <br/>
      In embodiments, such treatment can avoid the use of separate adhesive layers between respective layers of the photoreceptor.
      <br/>
      Although such treatment can be used on any of the underlying layers of the imaging member, the treatment is preferably applied to at least one of the organic layers.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the treatment step is conducted inline as a step in the production process, which permits fabrication of imaging members with increased adhesion.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Preferably, in embodiments of the present invention, the corona or plasma discharge treatment only roughens the surface of the particular layer.
      <br/>
      That is, the treatment preferably physically alters the desired layer, such as by forming valleys in the layer material, and does not itself apply a separate, distinct layer of material to the layer, such as by forming peaks of a different material on the layer.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      According to the present invention, the specific parameters of the treatment step will generally depend upon, for example, the specific materials be treated and the amount of roughening that is desired.
      <br/>
      In embodiments of the present invention, the roughening is preferably not so rough as to be visible to the naked eye, although such treatment is within the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the surface roughening is visible under a magnification of 1,000 * , more preferably under a magnification of 10,000 * , using scanning electron microscopy.
      <br/>
      If the surface roughening is not visible under a magnification of about 100,000 * , then further roughening treatment may be necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      One suitable treatment method is corona discharge.
      <br/>
      Corona discharge treatment is illustrated, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,666,735 (in particular at col. 6), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Corona discharge may be applied to the surface of the layer to be treated at any effective stage during the fabrication of the imaging member.
      <br/>
      For example, corona discharge may be applied to the desired layer surface immediately after the underlying layer is applied, immediately before the successive layer is applied, or in between the two.
      <br/>
      Any suitable equipment may be used to treat surfaces with corona discharge, including, but not limited to, Enercon Model A1 corona surface treater available from Enercon Industries Corporation.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      According to the present invention, different parameters of the treatment may be necessary depending, for example, on the material being treated.
      <br/>
      Thus, the power setting, wattage, and the like of the equipment may be adjusted as desired.
      <br/>
      If necessary, scanning electron microscopy may be used to assess the degree of surface roughening.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      An alternative to corona discharge is plasma discharge.
      <br/>
      Plasma discharge, which includes glow discharge, can be conducted on the layer surface in a similar manner to corona discharge.
      <br/>
      Preferably, however, the plasma or glow discharge is conducted in vacuum.
      <br/>
      Plasma discharge treatment is described, for example, in Vossen and Keen, Thin Film Processes, Acedemic Press Inc., pages 24-31 (1978) and Brian Chapman, Glow Discharge Processes, John Wiley and Sons, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      As with corona discharge, plasma discharge may be applied to the surface of the layer to be treated at any effective stage during the fabrication of the imaging member.
      <br/>
      For example, plasma discharge may be applied to the desired layer surface immediately after the underlying layer is applied, immediately before the successive layer is applied, or in between the two.
      <br/>
      Any suitable equipment may be used to treat surfaces with plasma discharge, including, but not limited to the PX Series of equipment available from March Instruments, Concord Calif.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      As with corona discharge treatment, described above, according to the present invention, different parameters of the treatment may be necessary depending, for example, on the material being treated.
      <br/>
      Thus, the power setting, wattage, and the like of the equipment may be adjusted as desired.
      <br/>
      If necessary, scanning electron microscopy may be used to assess the degree of surface roughening.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      If necessary and/or desired, the corona or plasma discharge treatments of the present invention can be performed with the imaging member substrate held next to a chill drum, or other suitable support.
      <br/>
      This may be particularly desired in instances where the substrate and/or individual layers may be susceptible to deformation during the corona or plasma discharge treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="32">The structure of an exemplary imaging member according to the claimed invention will now be described.</p>
    <p num="33">
      Typically, a flexible or rigid substrate is provided having an electrically conductive surface.
      <br/>
      A charge generating layer is then usually applied to the electrically conductive surface.

      An optional charge blocking layer may be applied to the electrically conductive surface prior to the application of the charge generating layer.
      <br/>
      If desired, an adhesive layer may be utilized between the charge blocking layer and the charge generating layer.
      <br/>
      Usually the charge generation layer is applied onto the blocking layer and a charge transport layer is formed on the charge generation layer.
      <br/>
      However, in some embodiments, the charge transport layer may be applied prior to the charge generation layer.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The substrate may be opaque or substantially transparent and may comprise numerous suitable materials having the required mechanical properties.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the substrate may comprise a layer of an electrically non-conductive or conductive material such as an inorganic or an organic composition.
      <br/>
      As electrically non-conducting materials there may be employed various resins known for this purpose including, but not limited to, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyamides, polyurethanes, mixtures thereof, and the like.
      <br/>
      As electrically conductive materials there may be employed various resins that incorporate conductive particles, including, but not limited to, resins containing an effective amount of carbon black, or metals such as copper, aluminum, nickel, and the like.
      <br/>
      The substrate can be of either a single layer design, or a multi-layer design including, for example, an electrically insulating layer having an electrically conductive layer applied thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The electrically insulating or conductive substrate is preferably in the form of a rigid cylinder, drum or belt.
      <br/>
      In the case of the substrate being in the form of a belt, the belt can be seamed or seamless, with a seamless belt being particularly preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The thickness of the substrate layer depends on numerous factors, including strength and rigidity desired and economical considerations.
      <br/>
      Thus, this layer may be of substantial thickness, for example, about 5000 micrometers or more, or of minimum thickness of less than or equal to about 150 micrometers, or anywhere in between, provided there are no adverse effects on the final electrostatographic device.
      <br/>
      The surface of the substrate layer is preferably cleaned prior to coating to promote greater adhesion of the deposited coating.
      <br/>
      Cleaning may be effected by any known process including, for example, by exposing the surface of the substrate layer to plasma discharge, ion bombardment and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The conductive layer may vary in thickness over substantially wide ranges depending on the optical transparency and degree of flexibility desired for the electrostatographic member.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, for a photoresponsive imaging device having an electrically insulating, transparent cylinder, the thickness of the conductive layer may be between about 10 angstrom units to about 500 angstrom units, and more preferably from about 100 Angstrom units to about 200 angstrom units for an optimum combination of electrical conductivity and light transmission.
      <br/>
      The conductive layer may be an electrically conductive metal layer formed, for example, on the substrate by any suitable coating technique, such as a vacuum depositing technique.
      <br/>
      Typical metals include, but are not limited to, aluminum, zirconium, niobium, tantalum, vanadium and hafnium, titanium, nickel, stainless steel, chromium, tungsten, molybdenum, mixtures thereof, and the like.
      <br/>
      In general, a continuous metal film can be attained on a suitable substrate, e.g. a polyester web substrate such as Mylar available from E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., with magnetron sputtering.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      If desired, an alloy of suitable metals may be deposited.
      <br/>
      Typical metal alloys may contain two or more metals such as zirconium, niobium, tantalum, vanadium and hafnium, titanium, nickel, stainless steel, chromium, tungsten, molybdenum, and the like, and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Regardless of the technique employed to form the metal layer, a thin layer of metal oxide generally forms on the outer surface of most metals upon exposure to air.
      <br/>
      Thus, when other layers overlying the metal layer are characterized as "contiguous" (or adjacent or adjoining) layers, it is intended that these overlying contiguous layers may, in fact, contact a thin metal oxide layer that has formed on the outer surface of the oxidizable metal layer.
      <br/>
      Generally, for rear erase exposure, a conductive layer light transparency of at least about 15 percent is desirable.
      <br/>
      The conductive layer need not be limited to metals.
      <br/>
      Other examples of conductive layers may be combinations of materials such as conductive indium tin oxide as a transparent layer for light having a wavelength between about 4000 Angstroms and about 7000 Angstroms or a conductive carbon black dispersed in a plastic binder as an opaque conductive layer.
      <br/>
      A typical electrical conductivity for conductive layers for electrophotographic imaging members in slow speed copiers is about 102 to 103 ohms/square.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      After formation of an electrically conductive surface, a hole blocking layer may optionally be applied thereto for photoreceptors.
      <br/>
      Generally, electron blocking layers for positively charged photoreceptors allow holes from the imaging surface of the photoreceptor to migrate toward the conductive layer.
      <br/>
      For negatively charged photoreceptors, the blocking layer allows electrons to migrate toward the conducting layer.
      <br/>
      Any suitable blocking layer capable of forming an electronic barrier to holes between the adjacent photoconductive layer and the underlying conductive layer may be utilized.
      <br/>
      The blocking layer may include, but is not limited to, nitrogen containing siloxanes or nitrogen containing titanium compounds such as trimethoxysilyl propylene diamine, hydrolyzed trimethoxysilyl propyl ethylene diamine, N-beta(aminoethyl) gamma-amino-propyl trimethoxy silane, isopropyl 4-aminobenzene sulfonyl, di(dodecylbenzene sulfonyl)titanate, isopropyl di(4-aminobenzoyl)isostearoyl titanate, isopropyl tri(N-ethylaminoethylamino)titanate, isopropyl trianthranil titanate, isopropyl tri(N,N-dimethyl-ethylamino)titanate, titanium-4-amino benzene sulfonat oxyacetate, titanium 4-aminobenzoate isostearate oxyacetate, �H2 N(CH2)4 �CH3 Si(OCH3)2 (gamma-aminobutyl)methyl diethoxysilane, �H2 N(CH2)3 �CH3 Si(OCH3)2 (gamma-aminopropyl)methyl diethoxysilane, mixtures thereof, and the like, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,291,110, 4,338,387, 4,286,033 and 4,291,110, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      A preferred blocking layer comprises a reaction product between a hydrolyzed silane and the oxidized surface of a metal ground plane layer.
      <br/>
      The oxidized surface inherently forms on the outer surface of most metal ground plane layers when exposed to air after deposition.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The blocking layer may be applied by any suitable conventional technique such as spraying, dip coating, draw bar coating, gravure coating, silk screening, air knife coating, reverse roll coating, vacuum deposition, chemical treatment and the like.
      <br/>
      For convenience in obtaining thin layers, the blocking layers are preferably applied in the form of a dilute solution, with the solvent being removed after deposition of the coating by conventional techniques such as by vacuum, heating and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="41">The blocking layers should be continuous and have a thickness of less than about 0.2 micrometer because greater thicknesses may lead to undesirably high residual voltage.</p>
    <p num="42">
      An optional adhesive layer may applied to the hole blocking layer.
      <br/>
      Any suitable adhesive layer well known in the art may be utilized.
      <br/>
      Typical adhesive layer materials include, for example, but are not limited to, polyesters, dupont 49,000 (available from E. I. dupont de Nemours and Company), Vitel PE100 (available from Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber), polyurethanes, and the like.
      <br/>
      Satisfactory results may be achieved with adhesive layer thickness between about 0.05 micrometer (500 angstrom) and about 0.3 micrometer (3,000 angstroms).
      <br/>
      Conventional techniques for applying an adhesive layer coating mixture to the charge blocking layer include spraying, dip coating, roll coating, wire wound rod coating, gravure coating, Bird applicator coating, and the like.
      <br/>
      Drying of the deposited coating may be effected by any suitable conventional technique such as oven drying, infra red radiation drying, air drying and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      However, according to the present invention, such an optional adhesive layer can be omitted, particularly if the underlying blocking layer is corona discharge or plasma discharge treated, as described above.
      <br/>
      That is, where a blocking layer has been applied to a substrate, the blocking layer can be corona or plasma discharge treated so as to roughen the surface of the blocking layer.
      <br/>
      Such roughening of the surface of the blocking layer provides increased adhesion between the blocking layer and a subsequently applied layer.
    </p>
    <p num="44">Any suitable photogenerating layer may be applied to the adhesive or blocking layer, which in turn can then be overcoated with a contiguous hole (charge) transport layer as described hereinafter.</p>
    <p num="45">
      Again, as with the blocking layer described above, any of the organic layers applied subsequent to the substrate being provided can be roughened and the surface structure chemically modified near the surface only according to the processes of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, where a charge generating layer is applied followed by a charge transport layer, the charge generating layer can be corona or plasma discharge treated to roughen the surface thereof prior to application of the succeeding layer.

      <br/>
      The photogenerating layer thickness is generally related to binder content.

      Of course, thickness outside these ranges can be selected providing the objectives of the present invention are achieved.

      Generally, the thickness of the charge transport layer is between about 10 and about 50 micrometers, but thickness outside this range can also be used.

      The charge transport layer should preferably be an insulator to the extent that the electrostatic charge placed on the charge transport layer is not conducted in the absence of illumination at a rate sufficient to prevent formation and retention of an electrostatic latent image thereon.

      In general, the ratio of thickness of the charge transport layer to the charge generator layer is preferably maintained from about 2:1 to 200:1 and in some instances as great as 400:1.

      In other words, the charge transport layer is substantially non-absorbing to visible light or radiation in the region of intended use but is "active" in that it allows the injection of photogenerated holes from the photoconductive layer, i.e., charge generation layer, and allows these holes to be transported through the active charge transport layer to selectively discharge a surface charge on the surface of the active layer.

      An optional overcoat layer may be applied over the charge transport layer.

      <br/>
      The hydrogen atom is the positive end of one polar molecule and forms a linkage with the electronegative end of the polar molecule.
      <br/>
      The polyamide utilized in the overcoatings should also have sufficient molecular weight to form a film upon removal of the solvent and also be soluble in alcohol.
      <br/>
      Generally, the weight average molecular weights of polyamides vary from about 5,000 to about 1,000,000.
      <br/>
      Since some polyamides absorb water from the ambient atmosphere, its electrical property may vary to some extent with changes in humidity in the absence of a polyhydroxy arylamine charge transporting monomer, the addition of charge transporting polyhydroxy arylamine minimizes these variations.
      <br/>
      The alcohol soluble polyamide should be capable of dissolving in an alcohol solvent, which also dissolves the hole transporting small molecule having multi hydroxy functional groups.

      When the overcoat layer contains only polyamide binder material, the layer tends to absorb moisture from the ambient atmosphere and becomes soft and hazy.

      This adversely affects the electrical properties, and the sensitivity of the overcoated photoreceptor.
      <br/>
      To overcome this, the overcoating of this invention also includes a dihydroxy arylamine, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,709,974, 4,871,634 and 4,588,666, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

      If the amount of hydroxy arylamine in the overcoat exceeds about 50 percent by weight based on the total weight of the overcoating layer, crystallization may occur resulting in residual cycle-up.

      A thickness of between about 1 micrometer and about 5 micrometers in thickness is preferred.

      Drying of the deposited coating may be effected by any suitable conventional technique such as oven drying, infrared radiation drying, air drying and the like.
      <br/>
      The dried overcoating of this invention should transport holes during imaging and should not have too high a free carrier concentration.
      <br/>
