      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to generally to semiconductor memory devices and, more particularly, to a method for programming EPROMS and multi-level Flash EPROMS.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM), electronically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) and Flash memory are classes of floating gate memory devices.
      <br/>
      More particularly, these floating gate memory devices are programmable memory devices which use floating gates as charge storage layers.
      <br/>
      These devices are based on a memory transistor, consisting of a source, channel, and a drain with a floating gate over the channel and a control gate isolated from the floating gate.
      <br/>
      Programming a cell requires charging the floating gate with electrons, which increases the turn on threshold of the memory cell.
      <br/>
      Flash EPROMS typically use a "hot electron" programming technique to charge the cells.
      <br/>
      When programmed, the cell will not turn on, i.e. it remains non-conductive, if a read potential is applied to its control gate.
      <br/>
      To erase the cell, electrons are removed from the floating gate in order to lower the threshold.
      <br/>
      With a lower threshold, the cell will now turn on when a read potential is applied to the control gate.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Conventionally, hot electron programming is performed by ramping up the drain voltage or the gate voltage.
      <br/>
      In other words, the source voltage is first shorted to ground, and then the drain (or gate) voltage is increased.
      <br/>
      Finally, the gate (or drain) voltage is applied.
      <br/>
      One programming method which operates by varying the gate voltage has been disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,563,822, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      However, this programming method has low programming efficiency and a large leakage current is induced by the drain-turn-on or punch-through problems of the unselect cells.
      <br/>
      Two proposals to overcome these problems include U.S. Pat. No. 5,553,020, disclosing a programming method that applies a source bias, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,590,076, disclosing a constant current source programming method.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      More recently, memory cells have included multiple levels in order to provide more data storage.
      <br/>
      For instance, instead of having only two threshold states, a larger number of threshold states are now being used and sensed as separate data levels.
      <br/>
      This allows for increased data storage for a given amount of memory.
      <br/>
      The addition of multiple levels increases the programming problems associated with the prior art solutions, since multiple levels are already more difficult to program.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In the view of the foregoing, there is a need for faster and more efficient schemes for programming erasable programmable memory cells, especially for multi-level Flash EPROMS.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The present invention is a method for programming a semiconductor memory device, which combines the advantages of ramping down a source voltage with the advantages associated with increasing a gate voltage.
      <br/>
      A programming period is divided into a program disturbance inhibited period and a program period.
      <br/>
      During a program disturbance inhibited period, a ground line GL is first pulled high, then a data line DL is pulled up, and finally a word line WL voltage is pulled up.
      <br/>
      Under these conditions, the data line DL and the ground line GL are kept at a high voltage to inhibit programming during this period.
      <br/>
      In addition, the corresponding BWL and DWL/DWR lines are turned on to prevent any voltages from disturbing the adjacent cells during the following programming period.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      During the programming period, the ground line GL is pulled down and the corresponding BWL line is turned on to generate a high electric field between the drain and the source of the programmed cell, in order to perform hot electron programming.
      <br/>
      A programming method performed by ramping down the source bias is thereby achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In a second embodiment, the programming period is further divided into sub-program periods, with each sub-program period having a program disturbance and a program period.
      <br/>
      The wordline WL voltage may increase with each sub-program period to improve the programming speed.
      <br/>
      Also, the program disturbance period may only be performed for the first sub-program period.
    </p>
    <p num="12">In another embodiment, each sub-program period may also include a verify period, in order to implement a program and verify technique suitable for programming multi-level Flash EPROMS.</p>
    <p num="13">
      The programming method of the present invention is thus able to combine the advantages associated with ramping down a source voltage with the advantages associated with increasing a gate voltage.
      <br/>
      The programming method is also especially suited for programming virtual ground EPROM devices.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The following description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention and sets forth the best modes contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the invention.
      <br/>
      Various modifications, however, will remain readily apparent to those skilled in the art, since the basic principles of the present invention have been defined herein specifically to provide a method for fast programming of EPROMS and multi-level Flash EPROMS.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      FIG. 1 illustrates a flash EPROM memory array that includes a plurality of modes, including a read mode, a program mode, a program and verify mode and erase verify mode.
      <br/>
      This device is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,563,822, herein incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      In order to obtain the most efficient cell size, a virtual ground array structure is preferred for the memory array 11.
      <br/>
      For example, FIG. 2 illustrates a preferred virtual ground array structure, the construction of which is described in detail in the related application entitled VIRTUAL GROUND EPROM STRUCTURE referenced above.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      A virtual ground EPROM structure 30 preferred for use with the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The structure 30 includes a program disturb inhibited unit 303 comprising disturbance inhibited transistors MD0-MD4 that are controlled by dummy word lines DWR and DWL.
      <br/>
      The program disturb inhibited unit 303 is operatively connected to a memory array 301.
      <br/>
      The memory array 301 comprises a plurality of floating gate memory cells C0,0-C31,9, each cell connected to a cell word line SWL0-SWL31.
      <br/>
      The floating gate memory cells are coupled source to drain to form the rows of memory cells.
      <br/>
      The control gates of the memory cells are coupled to the same wordline.
      <br/>
      Two bit line selection transistors BLTs (i.e. MBn-1,0 and MBn1,2), also known as band select transistors, are connected to each metal line (ground or bit line), which allows the cell size to be reduced.
      <br/>
      The virtual ground lines are connected to the sources of the BLTs, whereas the bit lines are connected to the drains of the BLTs.
      <br/>
      Four block selection lines (BWL) BWLn0-BWLn3 control the bit line selection transistors MBn-1,0-MBn-1,9.
      <br/>
      Also, in the present structure 30, one metal pitch is connected to two buried diffusion lines.
      <br/>
      This structure 30 can prevent programming disturbances on adjacent cells, as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      For a read operation, DWR and DWL are low and the program disturb inhibited unit 303 is turned off.
      <br/>
      The BWL decoding method is listed below:
    </p>
    <p num="19">

      -- Cell          BWLn0   BWLn1          BWLn2   BWLn3

      -- C0.0          on      off            on      off

    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In order to perform a programming operation, the program pulses are divided into a program disturbance inhibited period and a programming period as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      During a program disturbance inhibited period, the ground line GL is first pulled high, then the data line DL (i.e. a bit line in FIG. 2) is pulled up, and finally the word line voltage is pulled up.
      <br/>
      Under these conditions, the data line DL and the ground line GL are kept at a high voltage to inhibit programming during this period.
      <br/>
      In addition, the corresponding BWL and DWL/DWR lines are turned on to prevent any voltages from disturbing the adjacent cells during the following programming period.
      <br/>
      During the programming period, the ground line GL is pulled down and the corresponding BWL line is turned on to generate a high electric field between the drain and the source of the programmed cell, in order to perform hot electron programming.
      <br/>
      A programming method performed by ramping down the source bias is thereby achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The corresponding BWL and DWL/DWR decoding scheme during the program disturbance inhibited period is listed below:</p>
    <p num="22">
      --

      -- Cell    BWLn0     BWLn1     BWLn2   BWLn3     DWL     DWR

    </p>
    <p num="23">
      For example, in order to program cell C0,0 without disturbing C0,1, the drain sides of C0,0 and C0,1 are charged to a high voltage through path A by turning on BWLn2.
      <br/>
      However, the source side of C0,1 is charged to a high voltage through path B by turning on the DWL and BLWn1 lines.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the cell C0,1 will not be disturbed during the programming period.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The programming period is performed after the program disturbance inhibited period by pulling down source side of C0,0.
      <br/>
      During the programming period, the DWR and DWL lines are low and the BWL decoding scheme is the same as the read operation and is listed below:

      The present invention proposes a fast programming method for the above-described structure by combining the advantages of ramping down the source voltage and increasing the gate voltage, while any programming disturbance for adjacent cells is inhibited.
      <br/>
      The proposed programming waveforms of the present invention are shown in FIG. 4(a).
      <br/>
      The complete program period can be divided into sub-program periods.
      <br/>
      Each sub-program period is identical to the period shown in FIG. 3, wherein each sub-program period is divided into a program disturbance inhibited period and a program period.

      In addition, the corresponding BWL and DWL/DWR lines are turned on to prevent any voltages from disturbing the adjacent cells during the following programming period.
      <br/>
      During the programming period, the ground line GL is pulled down and the corresponding BWL line is turned on to generate a high electric field between the drain and the source of the programmed cell, in order to perform hot electron programming.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Note that the source voltage is ramped down to execute programming for each sub-program period and the wordline voltage is increased for each sub-program period in order to improve programming speed.
      <br/>
      An alternate programming sequence is illustrated in FIG. 4(b).
      <br/>
      In the modified programming sequence, only the first sub-program period keeps the program disturbance inhibited period.
      <br/>
      The remaining sub-program periods only use the program period (DWL/DWR is low).
      <br/>
      The advantages associated with the ramping down of the source voltage and increasing the gate voltage are unchanged.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In order to store more that one bit in one cell, the Vt control has to be very precise.
      <br/>
      For example, FIG. 5 illustrates 4 Vt levels per cell (i.e. two bit per cell).
      <br/>
      In order to program the cells to the desired level and keep the Vt distribution tight, the program and verify approach is adopted.
      <br/>
      The multilevel programming method according to the present invention is shown in FIG. 6, wherein the complete program period can be divided into sub-program periods.
      <br/>
      Each sub-program period is divided into a program disturbance inhibited period, a program period and a verify period.
      <br/>
      The program disturbance inhibited periods and program periods are the same as described above.
      <br/>
      The wordline voltage is the incremental type and the verify period is similar to a read operation.
      <br/>
      For example, the drain voltage is biased at 1.2V and the gate voltage is biased at 5V.
      <br/>
      However the reference levels during the program period are defined to be PV1, PV2 and PV3, instead of R1, R2 and R3, in order to improve read margins.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Thus, a new fast programming method and a new multilevel programming method have been disclosed which combine the advantages of ramping down the source voltage with increasing gate voltage.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will appreciate that various adaptations and modifications of the just-described preferred embodiment can be configured without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced other than as specifically described herein.
