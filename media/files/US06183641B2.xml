    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to an apparatus used to transmit motive force between a fluid and a plurality of spaced apart rotatable members.
      <br/>
      The apparatus may be used to transmit the motive force from a fluid to the spaced apart members or, alternately, from the spaced apart members to the fluid.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Prandtl layer turbines were first described by Nikola Tesla in U.S. Pat. No. 1,061,206 (Tesla).
      <br/>
      For this reason, these turbines are sometimes referred to as "Tesla Turbines".
      <br/>
      FIGS. 1 and 2 show the design for a prandtl layer turbine as disclosed in Tesla.
      <br/>
      As disclosed by Tesla, a prandtl layer turbine 10 comprises a plurality of discs 12 which are rotatably mounted in a housing 14.
      <br/>
      Housing 14 comprises ends 16 and ring 18 which extends longitudinally between ends 16.
      <br/>
      Discs 12 are spaced apart so as to transmit motive force between a fluid in housing 14 and rotating discs 12.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The discs 12, which are flat rigid members of a suitable diameter, are non-rotatably mounted on a shaft 20 by being keyed to shaft 20 and are spaced apart by means of washers 28.
      <br/>
      The discs have openings 22 adjacent to shaft 20 and spokes 24 which may be substantially straight.
      <br/>
      Longitudinally extending ring 18 has a diameter which is slightly larger than that of discs 12.
      <br/>
      Extending between opening 22 and the outer diameter of disc 12 is the motive force transfer region 26.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The transfer of motive force between rotating discs 12 and a fluid is described in Tesla at column 2, lines 30-49.
      <br/>
      According to this disclosure, fluid, by reason of its properties of adherence and viscosity, upon entering through inlets 30, and coming into contact with rotating discs 12, is taken hold of by the rotating discs and subjected to two forces, one acting tangentially in the direction of rotation and the other acting radially outwardly.
      <br/>
      The combined effect of these tangential and centrifugal forces is to propel the fluid with continuously increasing velocity in a spiral path until it reaches a suitable peripheral outlet from which it is ejected.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Conversely, Tesla also disclosed introducing pressurized fluid via pipes 34 to inlets 32.
      <br/>
      The introduction of the pressurized fluid would cause discs 12 to rotate with the fluid travelling in a spiral path, with continuously diminishing velocity, until it reached central opening 22 which is in communication with inlet 30.
      <br/>
      Motive force is transmitted by the pressurized fluid to discs 12 to cause discs 12 to rotate and, accordingly, shaft 20 to rotate thus providing a source of motive force.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Accordingly, the design described in Tesla may be used as a pump or as a motor.
      <br/>
      Such devices take advantage of the properties of a fluid when in contact with the rotating surface of the discs.
      <br/>
      If the discs are driven by the fluid, then as the fluid passes through the housing between the spaced apart discs, the movement of the fluid causes the discs to rotate thereby generating power which may be transmitted external to the housing via a shaft to provide motive force for various applications.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, such devices function as a motor.
      <br/>
      Conversely, if the fluid in the housing is essentially static, the rotation of the discs will cause the fluid in the housing to commence rotating in the same direction as the discs and to thus draw the fluid through the housing, thereby causing the apparatus to function as a pump or a fan.
      <br/>
      In this disclosure, all such devices, whether used as a motor or as a pump or fan, are referred to as "prandtl layer turbines" or "Tesla turbines".
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Various designs for prandtl layer turbines have been developed.
      <br/>
      These include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,402,647 (Effenberger), U.S. Pat. No. 4,218,177 (Robel), U.S. Pat. No. 4,655,679 (Giacomel), U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,197 (Cafarelli) and U.S. Reissue Pat.
      <br/>
      No. 28,742 (Rafferty et al).
      <br/>
      Most of these disclosed improvements in the design of a Tesla turbine.
      <br/>
      However, despite these improvements, Tesla turbines have not been commonly used in commercial environment.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="22">
      According to the instant invention, improvements to the design of prandtl layer turbines are disclosed.
      <br/>
      These improvements may be used in conjunction with any known designs of prandtl layer turbines.
      <br/>
      Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, housing 14 may be of any particular configuration and mode of manufacture.
      <br/>
      Further, the fluid inlet and fluid outlet ports may be of any particular configuration known in the art and may be positioned at any particular location on the housing which is known in the art.
      <br/>
      In addition, while discs 12 are shown herein as being relatively thin, flat members with a small gap 56 between the outer edge of the disc and the inner surface of ring 18, it will be appreciated that they may be of any particular design known in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, they may be curved as disclosed in Effenberger and/or the distance between adjacent discs may vary radially outwardly from shaft 20.
      <br/>
      Further, the perimeter of discs 12 need not be circular but may be of any other particular shape.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, discs 12 have also been referred to herein as "spaced apart members".
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4a-d, preferred embodiments for spaced apart members 12 are shown.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, spaced apart members 12 have an inner edge 40 and an outer edge 42.
      <br/>
      If spaced apart member 12 has a central circular opening 22, then inner edge 40 defines the inner diameter of spaced apart member 12.
      <br/>
      Further, if the periphery of spaced apart member 12 is circular, then outer edge 42 defines the outer diameter of spaced apart member 12.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Spaced apart members 12 may extend at any angle form shaft 20 as is known in the art and preferably extend at a right angle from shaft 20.
      <br/>
      Further, spaced apart member 12 may have any curvature known in the art and may be curved in the upstream or downstream direction (as defined by the fluid flow through housing 14).
      <br/>
      Preferably, spaced apart member 12 is planer so as to extend transversely outwardly from shaft 20.
      <br/>
      In this specification, all such spaced apart members are referred to as extending transversely outwardly from longitudinally extending shaft 20.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Each spaced apart member 12 has two opposed sides 44 and 46 which extend transversely outwardly from inner edge 40 to outer edge 42.
      <br/>
      These surfaces define the motive force transfer region 26 of spaced apart members 12.
      <br/>
      The spacing between adjacent spaced apart members 12 may be the same or may vary as is known in the art.

      Without being limited by theory, as a fluid travels across motive force transfer region 26, the difference in rotational speed between the fluid and spaced apart member 12 causes a boundary layer of fluid to form adjacent opposed surfaces 44, 46.
      <br/>
      If the fluid is introduced through openings 22, then the fluid will rotate in a spiral fashion from inner edge 40 outwardly towards outer edge 42.
      <br/>
      At some intermediate point, the fluid will have sufficient momentum that it will separate from opposed surfaces 44, 46 (i.e. it will delaminate) and travel towards the fluid exit port.
      <br/>
      By thickening the boundary layer, for a given rotation of a spaced apart member 12, additional motive force may be transferred between the rotating spaced apart member 12 and the fluid.
      <br/>
      Thus the efficiency of the motive force transfer between spaced apart members 12 and the fluid may be increased.

      In a further preferred embodiment of the instant invention, one or more fan members 68, 70 may be provided to assist in the movement of air through the prandtl layer turbines (see for example FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      This figure also shows a further alternate embodiment in which two prandtl layer turbines units 64, 66, each of which comprises a plurality of discs 12, are provided in a single housing 14.
      <br/>
      Each prandtl layer turbine unit 64, 66 is provided with an inlet 60 having a single outlet 62.
      <br/>
      Discs 12 of each prandtl layer turbine 64, 66 are mounted on a common shaft 20.
      <br/>
      This particular embodiment may advantageously be used to reduce the pressure drop through the prandtl layer turbine.
      <br/>
      For example, instead of directing all of the fluid at a set number of spaced apart members 12, half of the fluid may be directed to one half of the spaced apart members (prandtl layer turbine unit 64) and the other half may be directed at another set of spaced apart members (prandtl layer turbine unit 66).
      <br/>
      Thus the mean path through the prandtl layer turbine is reduced by half resulting in a decrease in the pressure loss as the fluid passes through prandtl layer turbine 10.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment of FIG. 5, the fluid feed is split in two upstream of housing 14 (not shown).
      <br/>
      Alternately, as shown in FIGS. 10 and 11, all of the fluid may be fed to a single inlet 60 which is positioned between prandtl layer turbine units 64, 66.
      <br/>
      While in these embodiments a like number of similar spaced apart members 12 have been included in each prandtl layer turbine unit 64, 66, each turbine unit 64, 66 may incorporate differing number of spaced apart members 12 and/or differently configured spaced apart members 12.

    <p num="42">
      It will be appreciated that discs 12 of prandtl layer turbine unit 64 may be mounted on a first shaft 20 and discs 12 of the second prandtl layer turbine unit 66 may be mounted on a separate shaft 20 (not shown).
      <br/>
      This alternate embodiment may be used if the two shaft are to be rotated at different speeds.

      This can be advantageous if the prandtl layer turbine is to be used to as a separator as discussed below.
      <br/>
      If spaced apart members 12 are of the same design, then the different rotational speed of spaced apart members 12 will impart different flow characteristics to the fluid and this may beneficially be used to separate the fluid (or particles entrained into the fluid) into different fluid streams, each of which has a different composition.

      Fan member 68 acts to pressurize the fluid and to push it downstream to one or more of spaced apart members 12.

      Conversely, fan member 70 acts to create a low pressure area to pull the fluid downstream, either through downstream spaced apart members 12 or through outlet 62.

      Fan member 70 may optionally be positioned outside of the interior of ring 18 so as to draw the fluid from housing 14.

      Alternately, for example, fan 70 may be a squirrel cage fan or the like.

      Fan member 68 may be non-rotationally mounted on shaft 20 so as to rotate with spaced apart members 12.

      <br/>
      If the prandtl layer turbine is functioning as a pump, then if fan member 68 is nonrotationally mounted on shaft 20, the rotation of shaft 20 will cause blades 72 to pressurize the fluid as it is introduced into the rotating spaced apart members.
      <br/>
      Alternately, if the prandtl layer turbine unit is to function as a motor, the movement of the fluid through housing 14 may be used to cause spaced apart members 12 to rotate and, accordingly, fan member 68 to rotate (if fan member 68 is freely rotatably mounted in housing 14).
      <br/>
      By pressurizing the fluid as it enters the spaced apart members with no other changes to spaced apart members 12, the pressure at outlet 62 is increased.
      <br/>
      As the downstream pressure may be increased, then there is additional draw on the fluid which allows additional spaced apart members 12 to be added to the prandtl layer turbine unit 64, 66.

      Outlet fan members 70 may be mounted in the same manner as fan member 68.

      For example, outlet fan 70 may be non-rotatably mounted on shaft 20, or rotatably mounted in housing 14 independent of spaced apart member 12 such as by a bearing 76 (not shown).
      <br/>
      Blade 72 may be configured so as to direct fluid out of housing 14 through outlet 62.
      <br/>
      If fan member 70 is outside housing 14, then fan member is constructed so as to draw fluid from outlet 62 (not shown).

      By providing a source of decreased pressure at or adjacent outlet 62, additional spaced apart members may be provided in a single prandtl layer turbine unit 64, 66.

      Further, an increased amount of the fluid may travel towards downstream end 80 such that the amount of fluid which passes over each spaced apart member 12 will be more evenly distributed.

      As the size of central opening 22 increases, then the amount of fluid which may pass downstream through the cental opening 22 of a spaced apart member 12 increases.

      Accordingly, more fluid may be passed downstream to other spaced apart members where the fluid may be accelerated.
      <br/>
      The size of central opening 22 may decrease in size for at least a portion of the spaced apart members 12 between upstream end 78 and downstream end 80.

      An advantage of this embodiment is that the amount of fluid which may pass through housing 14 per unit of time is increased.

      This is graphically represented in FIG. 7 wherein the relative amount of fluid which may flow per unit time through a prandtl layer turbine may be maximized by adjusting the ratio of the inner diameter of a spaced apart member 12 to its outer diameter.
      <br/>
      This ratio will vary from one prandtl layer turbine to another depending upon, inter alia, the speed of rotation of spaced apart members 12 when the turbine is in use, the spacing between adjacent spaced apart members.

      Accordingly, this limits the velocity which the fluid may achieve as it travels between inner edge 40 and outer edge 42 of a spaced apart member 12 on its way to outlet 62.
      <br/>
      Thus, by increasing the amount of fluid which may flow through the prandtl layer turbine 10, the amount of suction which may be exerted on the fluid at inlet 60 is decreased as is also shown in FIG. 7.

      <br/>
      This may be achieved by the outer diameter of at least some of the spaced apart members 12 of a first prandtl layer turbine unit 64 having an outer diameter which is smaller than the outer diameter of at least some of the spaced apart members 12 of a second prandtl layer turbine unit 66.

      In a preferred embodiment, all of the spaced apart members 12 of prandtl layer turbine unit 64 have an outer diameter which is smaller than the outer diameter of each of the spaced apart members 12 of prandtl layer turbine unit 66.

      Examples of these embodiments are shown in FIGS. 14-17. It will be appreciated that more than two prandtl layer turbine units 64, 66 may be provided in any particular prandtl layer turbine 10.

      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that prandtl layer turbine unit 64 may be provided in the same housing 14 as prandtl layer turbine unit 66 or, alternately, it may be provided in a separate housing which is an airflow communication with the housing of prandtl layer turbine unit 66.
      <br/>
      Preferably, in such an embodiment, each prandtl layer turbine unit 64, 66 is mounted co-axially.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the spaced apart members of prandtl layer turbine units 64 and 66 may be non rotationally mounted on the same shaft 20 (see for example FIGS. 16 and 17).

      Fluid passes through spaced apart members 12' to outlet 62' from where it is fed to inlet 60 such as via passage 61.
      <br/>
      Thus the fluid introduced into prandtl layer turbine unit 66 may have an increased pressure.
      <br/>
      Passage 61 may extend in a spiral to introduce fluid tangentially to prandtl layer turbine units 66.
      <br/>
      Thus the fluid introduced into prandtl layer turbine unit 66 may already have rotational momentum in the direction of rotation of spaced apart members 12.

      In a further preferred embodiment as shown in FIGS. 16 and 17, prandtl layer turbine unit 64 may be nested within prandtl layer turbine unit 66.

      For ease of reference, in FIG. 16, the cental openings and motive force transfer regions of prandtl layer turbine unit 64 are denoted by reference numerals 22' and 26'. The central opening and motive force transfer regions of the spaced apart members of prandtl layer turbine unit 66 are denoted by reference numerals 22 and 26.
      <br/>
      The spaced apart members of prandtl layer turbine units 64 and 66 may be mounted on the same shaft 20 or the spaced apart members of each prandtl layer turbine unit 64, 66 may be mounted on its own shaft 20 (as shown in FIG. 14).

    <p num="66">
      It will be appreciated that prandtl layer turbine unit 64 may be only partially nested within prandtl layer turbine 66.

      For example, the upstream spaced apart members 12 of prandtl layer turbine unit 64 may be positioned upstream from the first spaced apart member 12 of prandtl layer turbine unit 66 (not shown).
      <br/>
      Further, prandtl layer turbine units 64, 66 need not have the same length.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown in FIG. 16, prandtl layer turbine unit 64 comprises four discs whereas prandtl layer turbine unit 66 comprises seven discs.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the prandtl layer turbine unit 64 commences at the same upstream position as prandtl layer turbine unit 66 but terminates at a position intermediate of prandtl layer turbine unit 66.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that prandtl layer turbine unit 64 may extend conterminously for the same length as prandtl layer turbine unit 66.
      <br/>
      Further, it may commence at a position downstream of the upstream end of prandtl layer turbine unit 66 and continue to an intermediate position of prandtl layer turbine unit 66 or it may terminate to or past the downstream end of prandtl layer turbine unit 66.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      In a further alternate preferred embodiment, as shown in FIG. 14, prandtl layer turbine unit 64 is rotationally mounted on shaft 20' whereas prandtl layer turbine unit 66 is mounted for rotation on shaft 20.
      <br/>
      For example, shaft 20' may be rotationally mounted around shaft 20 by means of bearings 82 or other means known in the art.
      <br/>
      In this manner, spaced apart members 12 of prandtl layer turbine unit 64 may rotate at a different speed to spaced apart members 12 of prandtl layer turbine unit 66.
      <br/>
      Preferably, prandtl layer turbine unit 64 (which has spaced apart members 12 having a smaller outer diameter) rotates at a faster speed than prandtl layer turbine unit 66.
      <br/>
      For example, if a first prandtl layer turbine unit had discs having a two inch outer diameter, the prandtl layer turbine unit could rotate at speeds up to, eg., about 100,000 rpm.
      <br/>
      A second prandtl layer turbine unit having larger sized discs (eg. discs having an outer diameter from about 3 to 6 inches) could rotate at a slower speed (eg. about 35,000 rpm).
      <br/>
      Similarly, a third prandtl layer turbine unit which had discs having an even larger outer diameter (eg. from about 8 to about 12 inches) could rotate at an even slower speed (eg. about 20,000 rpm).
      <br/>
      In this way, the smaller discs could be used to pressurize the fluid which is subsequently introduced into a prandtl layer turbine unit having larger discs.
      <br/>
      By boosting the pressure of the fluid as it is introduced to the larger, slower rotating discs, the overall efficiency of the prandtl layer turbine 10 may be substantially increased.
      <br/>
      In particular, each stage may be designed to operate at its optimal flow or pressure range.
      <br/>
      Further, if the fluid is compressible.
      <br/>
      For example, the increase in the inlet pressure will increase the outlet pressure, and therefore the pressure throughout housing 14.
      <br/>
      This increase in pressure, if sufficient, will compress the fluid (eg. a gas or a compressible fluid) in housing 14.
      <br/>
      This increases the density of the fluid and the efficiency of the transfer of motive force between the fluid and the spaced apart members.

      Referring to FIGS. 18 and 19, a further preferred embodiment of the instant invention is shown.
      <br/>
      Fluid outlet port 62 extends between a first end 84 and a second end 86.
      <br/>
      Traditionally, in prandtl layer turbine units, outlet port 62 has extended along a straight line between first and second ends 84 and 86.
      <br/>
      According to the preferred embodiment shown in FIGS. 18 and 19, second and 86 of fluid outlet port 62 is radially displaced around housing 14 from first end 84.
      <br/>
      The portion of the fluid that passes downstream through opening 22 of a spaced apart member 12 will have some rotational momentum imparted to in even though it does not pass outwardly at that location adjacent that spaced apart member.
      <br/>
      Therefore, assuming that all spaced apart members are similar, the portion of the fluid which passes outwardly along the next spaced apart member will delaminate at a different position due to the rotational momentum imparted by its passage through opening 22 in the immediate upstream spaced apart member.
      <br/>
      Outlet 62 is preferably configure to have an opening in line with the direction of travel of the fluid as it delaminates and travels to ring 18.
      <br/>
      Thus downstream portions of outlet 62 are preferably radially displaced along ring 18 in the direction of rotation of spaced apart members 12.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Preferably, fluid outlet port 62 is curved and it may extend as a spiral along ring 18.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the curvature or spiral extends in the same direction as the rotation of the spaced apart members 12.
      <br/>
      The fluid flow in prandtl layer turbine 10 is generally represented by the arrow shown in FIG. 19. As represented by this arrow, the fluid will travel in a spiral path outwardly across an opposed surface 44, 46 and then radially outwardly through fluid outlet port 62.
      <br/>
      Fluid outlet port 62 preferably curves in the same direction as the direction of the rotation of the spaced apart members.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      It will be appreciated that all of fluid outlet port 62 need not be curved as shown in FIGS. 18 and 19. For example, a portion of fluid outlet port 62 may be curved and the remainder may extend in a straight line as is known in the prior art.
      <br/>
      It will further be appreciated that while fluid outlet port 62 in FIG. 18 extends conterminously with spaced apart members 12, first and second ends 84 and 86 need not coincide with the upstream and downstream ends of the spaced apart members 12.
      <br/>
      In particular, fluid outlet port 62 may have any longitudinal length as is known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      According to further preferred embodiment of the instant invention, a single prandtl layer turbine unit 64, 66 may have a plurality of outlets 62.
      <br/>
      Each outlet 62 may be constructed in any manner known in the art or, alternately they may be constructed as disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      For example, they may extend in a spiral or curved fashion around ring 18 in the direction of rotation of spaced apart members 12 of a prandtl layer turbine unit 64, 66.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 20, the ring of a prandtl layer turbine 10 having a single prandtl layer turbine unit 64, 66 is shown.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, two outlets, 90 and 92 are provided.
      <br/>
      Each outlet extends longitudinally along ring 18 from upstream end 78 of spaced apart members 12 to downstream end 80 of spaced apart members 12.
      <br/>
      For ease of reference, spaced apart members 12 have not been shown in FIG. 20.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Each outlet 90, 92 may be of any particular construction known in the art or taught herein.
      <br/>
      For example, each outlet 90, 92 may extend in a curve or spiral around ring 18.
      <br/>
      Outlets 90, 92 may have the same degree of curvature or, alternately, the degree of curvature may vary to allow separation of a specific density and mass of particulate matter.
      <br/>
      For example, if prandtl layer turbine 10 is used for particle separation, particles having a different shape and/or mass will travel outwardly at different positions.
      <br/>
      The outlets are preferably positioned to receive such streams and thus their actual configuration will vary depending upon the particle separation characteristics of the turbine.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Each outlet 90, 92 may curve in the same direction (eg. the direction of rotation of spaced apart members 12).
      <br/>
      Alternately, they may curve in opposite directions or one or both may extend in a straight line as is known in the prior art.
      <br/>
      Further, a plurality of such outlets 90 may be provided.
    </p>
    <p num="74">It will be appreciated that in an alternate embodiment, each outlet 90, 92 may be a portion 56a wherein the separated particulate matter may settle out and be removed from housing 14 and an outlet 62 may be provided to receive the fluid from which the particulate material has been removed.</p>
    <p num="75">
      Assuming that the portion of a fluid which is introduced through a central opening 22 to a position adjacent an opposed surface 44, 46 has approximately the same momentum, and assuming that the fluid has portions of differing density, then the rotation of spaced apart member 12 will cause the portions of the fluid having differing densities to commence rotating around shaft 20 at differing rates.
      <br/>
      As the fluid travels outwardly between inner edge 40 and outer edge 42 during its travel around shaft 20, the portions of the fluid having differing densities will tend to delaminate and travel outwardly towards ring 18 at different locations around ring 18.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment of this invention, a fluid outlet port is positioned to receive each portion of the fluid as it delaminates from the opposed surface.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 20, it is assumed that the fluid would contain two distinctive portions (eg. two elements having differing densities).
      <br/>
      Fluid outlet ports 90 and 92 are angularly displaced around ring 18 so as to each receive one of these portions.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      If the fluid also contains a solid, then, due to aerodynamic effects, particles having the same density but differing sizes will tend to separate due to the centrifugal forces exerted upon the particles as they travel in the fluid from inner edge 40 to outer edge 42.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a prandtl layer turbine may also be utilized as a particle separator.
      <br/>
      For example, in the embodiment of FIG. 20, if the particles have the same density, then first outlet 90 may be positioned to receive particles having a first particle sized distribution and fluid outlet port 92 may be positioned to receive particles having a smaller particle size distribution.
    </p>
    <p num="77">The positioning of fluid outlet ports 90, 92 may be selected based upon several factors including the total mass and density of the fluid and/or particles to be separated, the amount of centrifugal force which is imparted to the fluid and any entrained particles by spaced apart members 12 (eg. the inner diameter of spaced apart members 12, the outer diameter spaced apart members 12, the longitudinal spacing between adjacent spaced apart members 12, the disc thickness and the speed of rotation of spaced apart members 12).</p>
    <p num="78">
      In the embodiment of FIG. 20, outlets 90 and 92 may be in flow communication with any downstream apparatus which may be desired.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, each portion of the fluid may be passed downstream for different processing steps.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      Referring to FIG. 21, two cyclones 94, 96 may be provided in flow communication with fluid outlet ports 90, 92.

      For example, if the fluid includes particulate matter, fluid outlet port 90 may be positioned to receive particles having a first particle sized distribution.
      <br/>
      First cyclone 94 may be provided in fluid flow communication with first outlet port 90 for separating some or all of the particles from the fluid.
      <br/>
      Similarly, fluid outlet port 92 may be positioned to receive a portion of the fluid containing particles having a different particle sized distribution and second cyclone 96 may be provided to remove some or all of these particles from the fluid.

    <p num="80">
      Generally, cyclones are effective to efficiently remove particles over a limited particle size distribution.

      By utilizing a prandtl layer turbine to provide streams having different particle size distributions, each of cyclones 94, 96 may be configured to efficiently separate the particles which will be received therein from the fluid.

      Each cyclone 94, 96 may be of any particular design known in the art.

      Further, if a central air inlet 60 is utilized as disclosed in FIGS. 10 and 11, two fluid outlet ports having the same or differing curvature may be employed or, alternately, all or a portion of each of the outlets 62 may extend in a straight line.

    <p num="84">A further particular use of such a prandtl layer turbine may be as the sole particle separation device of a vacuum cleaner or, alternately, it may be used with other filtration mechanisms (eg. filters, filter bags, electrostatic precipitators and/or cyclones) which may be used in the vacuum cleaner art.</p>

      It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that cyclone 102 may be of any particular orientation.

      The fuel may be combusted upstream of prandtl layer turbine 10' or within prandtl layer turbine 10'. The combustion of the fluid will produce substantial quantities of gas which must travel through prandtl layer turbine 10' to exit via outlet 62'. Another source of fluid for prandtl layer turbine 10' may be harnessing natural fluid flows, such as ocean currents, ocean tides, the wind or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      As a result of the passage of a fluid through prandtl layer turbine 10', motive force is obtained which may then be transmitted to prandtl layer turbine 10.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 23, spaced apart members 12 of prandtl layer turbine 10 are mounted on the same shaft 20 as spaced apart members 12' of prandtl layer turbine 10'. However, it will be appreciated that prandtl layer turbine 10', and 10 may be coupled together in any manner which would transmit the motive force produced in prandtl layer turbine 10' to the spaced apart members 12 of prandtl layer turbine 10.
      <br/>
      For example, each series of spaced apart members 12, 12' may be mounted on a separate shaft and the shafts may be coupled together by any mechanical means known in the art such that prandtl layer turbine 10' is drivingly connected to prandtl layer turbine 10.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      Prandtl layer turbine 10 has an inlet 60 which is in fluid flow connection with a second fluid.
      <br/>
      The rotation of shaft 12 will cause spaced apart members 12 to rotate and to draw fluid through inlet 60 to outlet 62.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, prandtl layer turbine 10' may be used as a pump or a fan to cause a fluid to flow from inlet 60 to outlet 62.
      <br/>
      Depending upon the power input via shaft 20 to prandtl layer turbine 10, the fluid exiting prandtl layer turbine 10 via outlet 62 may be at a substantial elevated pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      Accordingly, prandtl layer turbine 10' functions as a motor and may be powered by various means such as the combustion of fuel.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, prandtl layer turbine 10' produces power which is harnessed and used in prandtl layer turbine 10 for various purposes.

    <p num="98">
      Referring to FIGS. 24 and 25, a prandtl layer turbine which may be used to produce motive force from a naturally moving fluid (such as wind or an ocean current or a tide) is shown.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, prandtl layer turbine 10 (which may be of any particular construction) is provided with a fluid inlet 124 (for receiving wind or water).
      <br/>
      The entry of the fluid through inlet port 124 causes spaced apart members 12 to rotate.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the fluid would travel radially inwardly along spaced apart members 12 from the outer edge 42 to inner edge 40.
      <br/>
      The fluid would then travel downstream through central opening 22 to fluid outlet 126.
      <br/>
      The rotation of spaced apart members 12 by the fluid would cause shaft 20 to rotate.
      <br/>
      Shaft 20 exits from prandtl layer turbine 10 and provides a source of rotational motive force which may be used in any desired application (eg. electrical generation and pumping water).
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      Prandtl layer turbine is preferably rotatably mounted so as to align inlet 124 with the direction of fluid flow so that the fluid is directed into prandtl layer turbine 10.
      <br/>
      It will also be appreciated that inlet 124 may be configured (such as having a funnelled shape or the like) to capture fluid and direct it into spaced apart members 12.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 24, prandtl layer turbine 10 is positioned vertically on support member 120.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that prandtl layer 10 may also be horizontally mounted (or at any other desired angle).
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      Tail 122 may be provided on ring 18 and positioned so as to align inlet 124 with the fluid flow.
      <br/>
      Tail 122 may be constructed in any manner known in the art such that when the portion of the fluid which does not enter prandtl layer turbine 10 passes around ring 18, tail 122 causes opening 124 to align with the direction of the fluid flow thereby assisting in maintaining opening 124 aligned with the fluid flow as the direction of fluid flow changes.
