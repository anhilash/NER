      Consumption power is reduced in a digital matched filter for determining a correlation value between a digital signal (Io) of 6 bits, which is synchronous with a clock, and a despreading code sequence (C7 C6 C5 C4 C3 C2 C1 C0) which includes 8 despreading codes.
      <br/>
      First to eighth flip-flop sets (211-218) constituting a storage section (210) are sequentially selected clock by clock by a write selection circuit (220), and the digital signal (Io) is stored in the selected flip-flop set.
      <br/>
      The 8 despreading codes are stored in first to eighth code flip-flops (231-238), respectively, and are shifted in synchronism with the clock.
      <br/>
      Output signals of the first to eighth flip-flop sets are multiplied by output signals of the first to eighth code flip-flops in first to eighth multiplication circuits (241-248), respectively.

    <p num="2">In a spectrum spread communication based on a code division multiplex access (CDMA) system which has been studied for use in the portable telephone or the like, a matched filter is used when a spectrum spread signal is demodulated to an original narrow-band signal (for example, "LSI, 110 mw for Digital Portable Telephone CDMA and Reduction of Consumption Power", Nikkei Electronics, No. 656, pp. 14-15, February, 1996).</p>

      FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a conventional example of an eight-times spread 8-order digital matched filter constructed by using a FIR digital filter (for example, "Spectrum Spread Handbook Edition No. 4", Stanford Telecom Inc., 1996).
      <br/>
      A transfer function H(z) of this digital matched filter is expressed by the following equation.

      This digital matched filter comprises a signal input terminal 1, a clock input terminal 2, a tapped shift register 10 including first to seventh flip-flop sets 11-17, first to eighth multipliers 21-28, first to seventh adders 31-37, and an output terminal 5.

      A digital signal Io generated by sampling an analog signal (for example, a spectrum spread signal) at a sampling frequency of 4.096 MHz is inputted to the signal input terminal 1.

      The digital signal Io is applied to the first flip-flop set 11 of the tapped shift register 10, and then is sequentially shifted from the first flip-flop set 11 toward the seventh flip-flop set 17 in synchronism with the clock CLK.

      Each of the first to eighth multipliers 21-28 is a multiplier for 6 bits * 1 bit, and outputs an output signal of 6 bits.

      As a result, the correlation detector is constructed by using the conventional digital matched filters shown in FIG. 1 or 3, raising a problem that consumption power in the correlation detector is increased.

    <p num="29">
      In order to reduce the consumption power in the correlation detector, a matched filter for wide-band DS-CDMA fundamentally constructed on the basis of an analog/digital filter for performing the correlation detection through the analog signal processing has been developed (Sawahashi et al, "Low Power Consumption Matched Filter LSI for Wideband DS-CDMA", Technical Study Report of the Institute of Electronic Information Communication (Radio Communication), RCS95-120, January, 1996).
      <br/>
      The matched filter for wide-band DS-CDMA, however, uses a tapped delay unit including a plurality of sample-hold circuits inputted with an analog input signal, and a plurality of multiplication circuits for performing multiplication operations of respective output signals of the tapped delay unit by a multiplicator represented by a digital signal.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in a utilization such as the portable telephone of the spectrum spread communication system in which the digital signal processing predominantly proceeds, a digital matched filter which is totally constructed with digital circuits can be integrated more easily with peripheral circuits for digital signal processing.

    <p num="30">
      Also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,396,446 discloses a digital filter circuit comprising a plurality of hold circuits which are respectively inputted with an input signal, a recursive tapped shift register for storing multiplicators, a plurality of multipliers for multiplying output signals of the plurality of hold circuits by output signals of the recursive tapped shift register, respectively, and an adder for adding output signals of the plurality of multipliers.
      <br/>
      However, the digital filter circuit is not devised with the aim of reducing consumption power as compared to the conventional digital matched filter using the tapped shift register as the tapped delay unit, but is devised with the aim of suppressing the hold error to a minimum by constructing the hold circuit through the use of two differential amplifiers, two transistors and two capacitors and controlling conduction/non-conduction of the two transistors with clocks which are in opposite phase with each other.
      <br/>
      Further, in the digital filter circuit, input data is cumulated and held in the capacitor of each hold circuit, so that the accuracy of holding the input data is degraded as compared to a case where input data is held by a digital circuit.
      <br/>
      Further, in the digital filter circuit, the hold circuit, the multiplier and the adder are constructed by using analog elements such as capacitors.

      Therefore, in the utilization such as the portable telephone of the spectrum spread communication system in which the digital signal processing predominantly proceeds, the digital matched filter which is totally constructed with digital circuits can be integrated more easily with peripheral circuits for digital signal processing.

    <p num="41">(First Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="42">
      A digital matched filter according to a first embodiment of the present invention is an eight-times spread 8-order digital matched filter constructed by using an FIR digital filter.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, it comprises a signal input terminal 201, a clock input terminal 202, a storage section 210 including first to eighth flip-flop sets 211-218, a write selection circuit 220 constructed by using a recursive tapped shift register including first to eighth write selecting flip-flops 221-228, a despreading code sequence shift register 230 constructed by using a recursive tapped shift register including first to eighth despreading code flip-flops 231-238, first to eighth multipliers 241-248, first to seventh adders 251-257, and an output terminal 205.
      <br/>
      Here, each of the first to eighth flip-flop sets 211-218 constituting the storage section 210 is comprised of 6 flip-flops connected in parallel to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      A digital signal Io generated by sampling an analog signal (for example, a spectrum spread signal) at a sampling frequency of 4.096 MHz is inputted to the signal input terminal 201.
      <br/>
      The digital signal Io is a 6-bit digital signal in terms of two's complement which is synchronous with a clock CLK of 4.096 MHz inputted to the clock input terminal 202.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Data input terminals D of the first to eighth flip-flop sets 211-218 constituting the storage section 210 are applied with the digital signal Io.
      <br/>
      Clock input terminals C of the first to eighth flip-flop sets 211-218 are applied with output signals of the first to eighth write selecting flip-flops 221-228 constituting the write selection circuit 220, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In the initial state, desired one of the first to eighth write selecting flip-flops 221-228 constituting the write selection circuit 220 is written with "1" (high level in logical value), and the other write selecting flip-flops are written with "0", (low level in logical value).
      <br/>
      Hereinafter, for simplification of explanation, it is assumed that only the eighth write selecting flip-flop 228 is written with "1" in the initial state.
      <br/>
      Clock input terminals C of the first to eighth write selecting flip-flops 221-228 are applied with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      When the clock CLK is applied to the clock input terminal C of the eighth write selecting flip-flop 228, the "1" which has been written to the eighth write selecting flip-flop 228 in the initial condition is shifted to the first write selecting flip-flop 221.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the "1" shifted to the first write selecting flip-flop 221 is sequentially shifted from the second write selecting flip-flop 222 toward the eighth write selecting flip-flop 228 in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the "1" is sequentially applied to the clock input terminals C of the first to eighth flip-flop sets 211-218 constituting the storage section 210 in synchronism with the clock CLK, so that the digital signal Io is sequentially fetched and held in the first to eighth flip-flop sets 211-218 in synchronism with the clock CLK.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The first to eighth despreading code sequence flip-flops 231-238 constituting the despreading code sequence shift register 230 are written with despreading codes of an 8-bit despreading code sequence C7 C6 C5 C4 C3 C2 C1 C0 respectively.
      <br/>
      Hereinafter, for simplification of explanation, it is assumed that in the initial state, the despreading codes C0 -C7 are stored in the first to eighth despreading code flip-flops 231-238 in order of from the despreading code C7 to the despreading code C0, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Clock input terminals C of the first to eighth despreading code flip-flops 231-238 are applied with the clock CLK, and the despreading codes C0 -C7 stored in the first to eighth despreading code flip-flops 231-238 are sequentially shifted from the first despreading code flip-flop 231 toward the eighth despreading code flip-flop 238 in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that a despreading code which has been shifted to the eighth despreading code flip-flop 238 is shifted to the first despreading code flip-flop 231 in synchronism with the next clock CLK.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the despreading codes C0 -C7 are outputted from the first to eighth despreading code flip-flops 231-238 while being sequentially shifted in synchronism with the clock CLK.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Each of the first to eighth multipliers 241-248 is a multiplier for 6 bits * 1 bit, and outputs an output signal of 6 bits.
      <br/>
      In the first to eighth multipliers 241-248, multiplication operations of output signals (6 bits) of the first to eighth flip-flop sets 211-218 by the despreading codes (1 bit) outputted from the first to eighth despreading code flip-flops 231-238 are carried out, respectively.
      <br/>
      For example, in the multipliers 241-248, when the despreading code indicates "1", multiplication operations of the output signals of the first to eighth flip-flop sets 211-218 by "1" are carried out.
      <br/>
      When the despreading code indicates "0", multiplication operations of the output signals of the first to eighth flip-flop sets 211-218 by "-1", are carried out.
    </p>
    <p num="49">The procedure for multiplication in the respective multipliers 241-248 will be described hereunder with reference to FIG. 5.</p>
    <p num="50">
      In the first operation state, a first sampling data D0 of the digital signal Io is inputted to the signal input terminal 201 in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the "1" which has been written in the eighth write selecting flip-flop 228 of the write selection circuit 220 in the initial state is shifted to the first write selecting flip-flop 221 in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      As a result, the "138  is applied to the clock input terminal C of only the first shift register set 211 of the storage section 210, and the first sampling data D0 is fetched and held in the first shift register set 211.
      <br/>
      Also, the despreading code C0 which has been stored in the eighth despreading code flip-flop 238 of the despreading code string shift register 230 in the initial state is shifted to the first despreading code flip-flop 231 in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      As a result, multiplication of the first sampling data D0 by the despreading code C0 is carried out in the first multiplier 241.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, an output signal indicative of a value of D0 * C0 is outputted from the first multiplier 241.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In the second operation state, a second sampling data D1 of the digital signal Io is inputted to the signal input terminal 201 in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the "1" which has been shifted to first write selecting flip-flop 221 of the write selection circuit 220 in the first operation state is shifted to the second write selecting flip-flop 222 in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      As a result, the "1" is applied to the clock input terminal C of only the second shift register set 212 of the storage section 210, and the second sampling data D1 is fetched and held in the second shift register set 212.
      <br/>
      At that time, in the first flip-flop set 211, the first sampling data D0 which has been fetched thereto in the first operation state is held as it is.
      <br/>
      Also, the despreading codes stored in the despreading code string shift register 230 are shifted in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      As a result, the despreading code C0 which has been shifted to the first despreading code flip-flop 231 in the first operation state is shifted to the second despreading code flip-flop 232, and the despreading code C1 which has been shifted to the eighth despreading code flip-flop 238 in the first operation state is shifted to the first despreading code flip-flop 231.
      <br/>
      Consequently, multiplication of the second sampling data D1 by the despreading code C0 is carried out in the second multiplier 242, and multiplication of the first sampling data D0 by the despreading code C1 is carried out in the first multiplier 241.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, an output signal indicative of a value of D1 * C0 is outputted from the second multiplier 242, and an output signal indicative of a value of D0 * C1 is outputted from the first multiplier 241.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      In the third operation state, a third sampling data D2 of the digital signal Io is inputted to the signal input terminal 201 in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the "1" which has been shifted to the second write selecting flip-flop 222 of the write selection circuit 220 in the second operation state is shifted to the third write selecting flip-flop 223 in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      As a result, the "1" is applied to the clock input terminal C of only the third shift register set 213 of the storage section 210, and the third sampling data D2 is fetched and held in the third shift register set 213.
      <br/>
      At that time, in the first flip-flop set 211, the first sampling data D0 which has been fetched thereto in the first operation state is held as it is, and in the second flip-flop set 212, the second sampling data D1 which has been fetched thereto in the second operation state is held as it is.
      <br/>
      Also, the despreading codes stored in the despreading code sequence shift register 230 are shifted in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the despreading code C0 which has been shifted to the second despreading code flip-flop 232 in the second operation state is shifted to the third despreading code flip-flop 233, the despreading code C1 which has been shifted to the first despreading code flip-flop 231 in the second operation state is shifted to the second despreading code flip-flop 232, and the despreading code C2 which has been shifted to the eighth despreading code flip-flop 238 in the second operation state is shifted to the first despreading code flip-flop 231.
      <br/>
      As a result, multiplication of the third sampling data D2 by the despreading code C0 is carried out in the third multiplier 243, multiplication of the second sampling data D1 by the despreading code C1 is carried out in the second multiplier 242, and multiplication of the first sampling data D0 by the despreading code C2 is carried out in the first multiplier 241.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, an output signal indicative of a value of D2 * C0 is outputted from the third multiplier 243, an output signal indicative of a value of D1 * C1 is outputted from the second multiplier 242, and an output signal indicative of a value of D0 * C2 is outputted from the first multiplier 241.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, a similar operation is repeated until the seventh operation state.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In the eighth operation state, an eighth sampling data D7 of the digital signal Io is inputted to the signal input terminal 201 in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the "1" which has been shifted to the seventh write selecting flip-flop 227 of the write selection circuit 220 in the seventh operation state is shifted to the eighth write selecting flip-flop 228 in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      As a result, the "1" is applied to the clock input terminal C of only the eighth shift register set 218 of the storage section 210, and the eighth sampling data D7 is fetched and held in the eighth shift register set 218.
      <br/>
      At that time, in the first to seventh flip-flop sets 211-217, the first to seventh sampling data D0 -D6 which have been fetched thereto up to the seventh operation state are held as they are, respectively.
      <br/>
      Also, the despreading codes stored in the despreading code sequence shift register 230 are shifted in synchronism with the clock CLK, so that the despreading codes C7 -C0 are stored in the first to eighth despreading code flip-flops 231-238, respectively.
      <br/>
      Thereby, multiplication operations of the first to eighth sampling data D0 -D7 of digital signal Io, which are respectively held in the first to eighth flip-flops 211-218 of the storage section 210, by the despreading codes C7 -C0 which are respectively shifted to the first to eighth despreading code sequence flip-flops 231-238 of the despreading code sequence shift register 230 are carried out in the first to eighth multipliers 241-248, respectively.
      <br/>
      As a result, an output signal indicative of a value of D7 * C0 is outputted from the eighth multiplier 248, an output signal indicative of a value of D6 * C1 is outputted from the seventh multiplier 247, an output signal indicative of a value of D5 * C2 is outputted from the sixth multiplier 246, an output signal indicative of a value of D4 * C3 is outputted from the fifth multiplier 245, an output signal indicative of a value of D3 * C4 is outputted from the fourth multiplier 244, an output signal indicative of a value of D2 * C5 is outputted from the third multiplier 243, an output signal indicative of a value of D1 * C6 is outputted from the second multiplier 242, and an output signal indicative of a value of D0 * C7 is outputted from the first multiplier 241.
    </p>
    <p num="54">Through the above operation, multiplication operations necessary to determine a correlation value between the initial 8-sampling data D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 of the digital signal Io and the 8-bit despreading code sequence C7 C6 C5 C4 C3 C2 C1 C. are all carried out.</p>
    <p num="55">
      In the ninth operation state, a ninth sampling data D8 of the digital signal Io is inputted to the signal input terminal 201 in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the "1" which has been shifted to the eighth write selecting flip-flop 228 of the write selection circuit 220 in the eighth operation state is shifted to the first write selecting flip-flop 221 in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      As a result, the "1" is applied to the clock input terminal C of only the first shift register set 211 of the storage section 210, and the ninth sampling data D8 is fetched and held in the first shift register set 211.
      <br/>
      At that time, in the second to eighth flip-flop sets 211-218, the second to eighth sampling data D1 -D7 which have been fetched thereto up to the eighth operation state are held as they are, respectively.
      <br/>
      Also, the despreading codes stored in the despreading code sequence shift register 230 are shifted in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the despreading code C0 is stored in the first despreading code flip-flop 231, and the despreading codes C7 -C1 are stored in the second to eighth despreading code flip-flops 232-238, respectively.
      <br/>
      Thereby, multiplication of the ninth sampling data D8 of the digital signal Io held in the first flip-flop 211 of the storage section 210 by the despreading code C0 stored in the first despreading code flip-flop 231 of the despreading code sequence shift register 230 is carried out in the first multiplier 241, and multiplication operations of the second to eighth sampling data pieces D1 -D7 of the digital signal Io, which are respectively held in the second to ninth flip-flops 212-218, by the despreading codes C7 -C1 which are respectively stored in the second to eighth despreading code flip-flops 231-238 of the despreading code sequence shift register 230 are carried out in the second to eighth multipliers 242-248, respectively.
      <br/>
      As a result, an output signal indicative of a value of D8 * C0 is outputted from the first multiplier 241, an output signal indicative of a value of D7 * C1 is outputted from the eighth multiplier 248, an output signal indicative of a value of D6 * C2 is outputted from the seventh multiplier 247, an output signal indicative of a value of D5 * C3 is outputted from the sixth multiplier 246, an output signal indicative of a value of D4 * C4 is outputted from the fifth multiplier 245, an output signal indicative of a value of D3 * C5 is outputted from the fourth multiplier 244, an output signal indicative of a value of D2 * C6 is outputted from the third multiplier 243, and an output signal indicative of a value of D1 * C7 is outputted from the second multiplier 242.

      Next, comparison of consumption power in the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment with that in the conventional digital matched filter shown in FIG. 1 will be described.
      <br/>
      In the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment, write of the digital signal Io to the storage section 210 at each clock CLK is carried out at only one of the first to eighth flip-flop sets 211-218.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, on the assumption that consumption power in one flip-flop constituting the respective flip-flop sets 211-218 is W, consumption power in the storage section 210 is 6 W. Also, in the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment, the first to eighth write selecting flip-flops 221-228 constituting the write selection circuit 220 and the first to eighth despreading code flip-flops 231-238 constituting the despreading code sequence shift register 230 operate in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      Hence, consumption power in the write selection circuit 220 and despreading code sequence shift register 230 is 2 * 8 W=16 W. Accordingly, consumption power in the storage section 210, write selection circuit 220 and despreading code sequence shift register 230 of the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment amounts up to 6 W+16 W=22 W. Contrary to this, in the conventional digital matched filter shown in FIG. 1, all of the first to seventh flip-flop sets 11-18 are operated in synchronism with the clock CLK when the digital signal Io is written to the tapped shift register 10 at each clock CLK.
      <br/>
      Hence, consumption power in the tapped shift register 10 is 6 * 7 W=42 W. Accordingly, as consumption power in the first to eighth multipliers 241-248 and first to seventh adders 251-257 of the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment is identical to that in the first to eighth multipliers 21-28 and first to seventh adders 31-37 of the conventional digital matched filter shown in FIG. 1, the consumption power in the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment is 22 W/42 W.apprxeq.1/2  as compared to the consumption power in the conventional digital matched filter shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Generally, given that the number of bits of the digital signal Io is N in an M-times spread M-order digital matched filter, each of the flip-flop sets of the storage section 210 includes N flip-flops, and each of the write selection circuit 220 and despreading code sequence shift register 230 includes M flip-flops in the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, consumption power in the storage section 210, write selection circuit 220 and despreading code sequence shift register 230 of the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment is NW+MW+MW=(N+M+M)W. Contrary to this, in the conventional digital matched filter shown in FIG. 1, the tapped shift register 10 includes (M-1)N flip-flops, so that consumption power in the tapped shift register 10 is (M-1)NW. Accordingly, the consumption power in the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment is (N+M+M)W/(M-1)NW=(N+M+M)/(M-1)N as compared to the consumption power in the conventional digital matched filter shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      As M&gt;&gt;1 is generally satisfied, the consumption power in the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment is 1/M+1/N+1/N as compared to the consumption power in the conventional digital matched filter shown in FIG. 1.

      In the foregoing description, each despreading code constituting the despreading code sequence C7 C6 C5 C4 C3 C2 C1 C0 is of 1 bit.

      However, the number of bits of each despreading code constituting the despreading code sequence of C7 C6 CS C4 C3 C2 C1 C0 may sometimes be two or more (provided that the bit number of each despreading code is smaller than that of the digital signal Io).

    <p num="63">A digital matched filter according to a second embodiment of the present invention differs from the previously-described digital matched filter according to the first embodiment in that it comprises a write selection circuit 300 shown in FIG. 6 in place of the write selection circuit 220 shown in FIG. 4.</p>
    <p num="64">
      As shown in FIG. 6, the write selection circuit 300 provided in the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment is constructed by using a recursive tapped shift register including first to eighth write selecting flip-flops 311-318 and a selector circuit 320.
      <br/>
      Clock input terminals C of the first to eighth write selecting flip-flops 311-318 are applied with a clock CLK of 4.096 MHz through a clock input terminal 301.
      <br/>
      Reset terminals R of the first to eighth write selecting flip-flops 311-318 are applied with a reset signal RS through a reset signal input terminal 302.
      <br/>
      A first input terminal A of the selector circuit 320 is applied with an output signal Q8 of the eighth write selecting flip-flop 318.
      <br/>
      A second input terminal B of the selector circuit 320 is applied with power supply voltage Vcc (voltage corresponding to high level in logical value).
      <br/>
      A selection terminal S of the selection circuit 320 is applied with a write timing control signal WE through a timing control signal input terminal 303.
      <br/>
      An output terminal Y of the selector circuit 320 is connected to a data input terminal D of the first write selecting flip-flop 311.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that in the selector circuit 320, the second input terminal B is selected when the write timing control signal WE is "1" (high level in logical value), and the first input terminal A is selected when the write timing control signal WE is "0" (low level in logical value).
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Next, operation of the write selection circuit 300 will be described with reference to a timing chart shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      At time preceding time t0, the reset signal RS is "0", so that the first to eighth write selecting flip-flops 311-318 are all reset and output signals Q1 -Q8 of the first to eighth write selecting flip-flops 311-318 are all rendered to be "0".
      <br/>
      When the write timing control signal WE is rendered to be "1" at time t1 after the reset signal RS is rendered to be "1" at time t0, the second input terminal B is selected in the selector circuit 320, and the output signal outputted from the output terminal Y of the selector circuit 320 is rendered to be "1".
      <br/>
      As a result, with the clock CLK changed from "0" to "1" at time t2, the output signal of the selector circuit 320 is fetched and held in the first write selecting flip-flop 311, rendering output signal Q1 of the first write selecting flip-flop 311 to be "1".
      <br/>
      At that time, output signals Q1 -Q7 (all zero) of first to seventh write selecting flip-flops 311-317 at time t, are fetched and held in the second to eighth write selecting flip-flops 312-318, respectively, so that output signals Q2 -Q8 of the second to eighth write selecting flip-flops 312-318 remain to be "0".
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      When the write timing control signal WE is rendered to be "0" at time t3, the first input terminal A is selected in the selector circuit 320 and the output signal Q8 of the eighth write selecting flip-flop 318 is outputted from the output terminal Y of the selector circuit 320.
      <br/>
      As a result, with the clock CLK changed from "0" to "1" at time t4, the output signal Q. of the eighth write selecting flip-flop 318 is fetched and held in the first write selecting flip-flop 311, rendering the output signal Q1 of the first write selecting flip-flop 311 to be "0".
      <br/>
      The output signal Q1 of the first write selecting flip-flop 311 at time t3 is fetched and held in the second write selecting flip-flop 312, so that the output signal Q2 of the second write selecting flip-flop 312 is rendered to be "1".
      <br/>
      The output signals Q2 -Q7 of the second to seventh write selecting flip-flops 312-317 at time t3 are fetched and held in the third to eighth write selecting flip-flops 313-318, respectively, so that the output signals Q3 -Q8 of the third to eighth write selecting flip-flops 313-318 remain to be "0".
      <br/>
      Subsequently, a similar operation is repeated.
      <br/>
      Consequently, as shown in FIG. 6, the "1" fetched and held in the first write selecting flip-flop 311 at time t2 is shifted from the first write selecting flip-flop 311 to the eighth write selecting flip-flop 318 in synchronism with the clock CLK.
      <br/>
      Further, the "1" fetched and held in the eighth write selecting flip-flop 318 is shifted to the first write selecting flip-flop 311 in synchronism with the clock CLK.

      Next, comparison of consumption power in the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment with that in the conventional digital matched filter shown in FIG. 3 will be described.
      <br/>
      In the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment, during write of the digital signal Io, the first to sixteenth flip-flop sets 411-426 constituting the storage section 410 are operated only one by one in synchronism with the first clock CLK1.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, on the assumption that consumption power in one flip-flop is W, consumption power in the storage section 410 is identical to the total consumption power in the 6 flip-flops constituting each flip-flop set, amounting up to 6 W. The first to sixteenth write selecting flip-flops 431 to 446 constituting the write selection circuit 430 are operated each time that the first clock CLK1 is inputted, so that consumption power in the write selection circuit 430 is 16 W. The first to eighth despreading code flip-flops 461-468 constituting the despreading code sequence shift register 460 are operated in synchronism with the second clock CLK2 having a frequency which is 1/2 of that of the first clock CLK1, so that consumption power in the despreading code sequence shift register 460 is 8 W/2=4 W. Accordingly, consumption power in the storage section 410, write selection circuit 430 and despreading code sequence shift register 460 of the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment is 6 W+16 W+4 W=26 W. Contrary to this, in the conventional digital matched filter shown in FIG. 3, the first to fourteenth flip-flop sets 111-124 constituting the tapped shift register 110 are operated each time that the clock CLK is inputted, so that consumption power in the tapped shift register 110 is 6 * 14 W=84 W. Consumption power in the first to eighth multipliers 471-478 and first to seventh adders 481-487 of the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment is identical to consumption power in the first to eighth multipliers 131-138 and first to seventh adders 141-147 of the conventional digital matched filter shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when consumption power in the first to eighth selector circuit sets 451-458 of the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment is neglected because it is small, consumption power in the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment is 26 W/84 W.apprxeq.1/3 as compared to consumption power in the conventional digital matched filter shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Generally, given that the number of bits of the digital signal Io is N in an M-order digital matched filter of FIR m-times over-sampling interpolation filter structure, the storage section 410 includes MN flip-flops, the write selection circuit 430 includes M write selecting flip-flops and the despreading code sequence shift register 460 includes M/m despreading code flip-flops in the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment.
      <br/>
      However, the flip-flop sets constituting the storage section 410 are operated only one by one in synchronism with the first clock CLK1.
      <br/>
      Further, the spreading code sequence shift register 460 is operated in synchronism with the second clock CLK2 having a frequency which is 1/m of that of the first clock CLK1.
      <br/>
      Therefore, consumption power in the storage section 410, write selection circuit 430 and despreading code sequence shift register 460 of the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment is NW+MW+(M/m2)W=(N+M+M/m2)W. Contrary to this, in the digital matched filter shown in FIG. 3, the tapped shift register 110 includes (M-1)N flip-flops.
      <br/>
      Therefore, consumption power in the tapped shift register 110 is (M-1)NW. Accordingly, consumption power in the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment is (N+M+M/m2)W/(M-1)NW=(N+M+M/m2)/(M-1)N as compared to consumption power in the conventional matched filter shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      As M&gt;&gt;1 is generally satisfied, the consumption power in the digital matched filter according to the present embodiment is 1/M+1N+1/m2 N as compared to the consumption power in the conventional digital matched filter shown in FIG. 3.
