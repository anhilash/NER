      A method of correcting a temperature probe reading in a thermal processing chamber for heating a substrate, including the steps of heating the substrate to a process temperature and using a first, a second and a third probe to measure the temperature of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The first probe has a first effective reflectivity and the second probe has a second effective reflectivity.
      <br/>
      The first probe produces a first temperature indication, the second probe produces a second temperature indication and the third probe produces a third temperature indication.
      <br/>
      The first and second effective reflectivities may be different.
      <br/>
      From the first and second temperature indications, a corrected temperature reading for the first probe may be derived, wherein the corrected temperature reading is a more accurate indicator of an actual temperature of the substrate than an uncorrected readings produced by both the first and second probes.
      <br/>
      A corrected temperature reading for the third probe may be derived by adjusting the temperature correction calculated for the first probe according to the measured emissivity sensitivity associated with the environment of the third probe to provide a corrected temperature reading that is a more accurate indicator of an actual temperature of the substrate in the environment of the third probe.
      <br/>
      An apparatus for carrying out the method is also disclosed.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to techniques for making improved noncontact temperature measurements of a semiconductor substrate by correcting measurements of substrate temperature and by compensating for the emissivity sensitivity variations across the surface of the substrate.</p>
    <p num="3">
      In many semiconductor device manufacturing processes, the required high levels of device performance, yield, and process repeatability can only be achieved if the temperature of a substrate (e.g., a semiconductor wafer) is tightly controlled during processing.
      <br/>
      To achieve that level of control, it is often necessary to measure the substrate temperature in real time and in situ, so that any unexpected temperature variations can be immediately detected and corrected for.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      For example, consider rapid thermal processing (RTP), which is used for several different fabrication processes, including rapid thermal annealing (RTA), rapid thermal cleaning (RTC), rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD), rapid thermal oxidation (RTO), and rapid thermal nitridation (RTN).
      <br/>
      In the particular application of CMOS gate dielectric formation by RTO or RTN, thickness, growth temperature, and uniformity of the gate dielectrics are critical parameters that influence the overall device performance and fabrication yield.
      <br/>
      Currently, CMOS devices are being made with dielectric layers that are only 60-80  Angstrom  thick and for which thickness uniformity must be held within  +- 2  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      This level of uniformity requires that temperature variations across the substrate during high temperature processing cannot exceed a few  (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The wafer itself often cannot tolerate even small temperature differentials during high temperature processing.
      <br/>
      If the temperature difference is allowed to rise above 1-2 (degree)  C./cm at 1200 (degree)  C., the resulting stress is likely to cause slip in the silicon crystal.
      <br/>
      The resulting slip planes will destroy any devices through which they pass.
      <br/>
      To achieve that level of temperature uniformity, reliable real-time, multi-point temperature measurements for closed-loop temperature control are necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Optical pyrometry is being widely used for measuring temperatures in RTP systems.
      <br/>
      Pyrometry exploits a general property of objects, namely, that objects emit radiation with a particular spectral content and intensity that is characteristic of their temperature.
      <br/>
      Thus, by measuring the emitted radiation, the objects temperature can be determined.
      <br/>
      A pyrometer measures the emitted radiation intensity and performs the appropriate conversion to obtain temperature (T).
      <br/>
      The relationship between spectral emitted intensity and temperature depends on the spectral emissivity of the substrate and the ideal blackbody radiation-temperature relationship, given by Planck's law:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="7">where C1 and C2 are known constants,  LAMBDA  is the radiation wavelength of interest, and T is the substrate temperature measured in  (degree)  K. According to an approximation known as Wein's distribution law, this expression can be rewritten as follows:  (Equation image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="8">
      where K( LAMBDA )=2C1 / LAMBDA 5.
      <br/>
      This is a good approximation for temperatures below about 2700 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The spectral emissivity  EPSILON ( LAMBDA ,T) of an object is the ratio of its emitted spectral intensity I( LAMBDA ,T) to that of a blackbody at the same temperature Ib ( LAMBDA ,T).
      <br/>
      That is,  (Equation image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="10">Since C1 and C2 are known constants, under ideal conditions, the temperature of the wafer can be accurately determined if  EPSILON ( LAMBDA ,T) is known.</p>
    <p num="11">
      As was described previously, variations in temperature across the surface of a substrate of more than a degree or two may result in damage to the substrate and undesirable process variations.
      <br/>
      One method for monitoring the temperature at various localized regions of the substrate includes the use of a plurality of temperature probes (pyrometers or the like).
      <br/>
      In these multi-probe systems, temperature readings from the various probes can be used for real-time control of the heating element in the RTP of substrates.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      However, despite its widespread use in the semiconductor industry, optical pyrometry still suffers from limitations due to an inability to accurately measure the emissivity of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Moreover, even if the emissivity of the substrate is known at a given temperature, it may change with temperature.
      <br/>
      The changes are usually not accurately measurable and thus they introduce an unknown error into the temperature measurements.
      <br/>
      Errors on the order of 10 (degree)  C. or more are not uncommon.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The spectral emissivity of a substrate depends on many factors, including the characteristics of the wafer itself (e.g. temperature, surface roughness, doping level of various impurities, material composition and thickness of surface layers) and the process history of the wafer.
      <br/>
      Another related term is the effective emissivity of an object.
      <br/>
      The effective emissivity is the ratio of the measured spectral intensity emitted by the object to that of a blackbody at the same temperature.
      <br/>
      The effective emissivity of an object differs from the spectral emissivity for the same object in that the effective emissivity takes into account the environment in which the object resides.
      <br/>
      The effective emissivity of a substrate may be influenced by the characteristics of the process chamber in which the substrate is positioned.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a priori estimation of substrate emissivity cannot provide a general purpose pyrometric temperature measurement capability.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In addition, the environment at each probe in a multi-probe system is unique.
      <br/>
      A pyrometric probe positioned in one of these unique environments may exhibit sensitivity to substrates having particular emissivity characteristics, introducing an error component in the temperature reading.
      <br/>
      Across the surface of the substrate, one or more of the probes may exhibit differing sensitivities to the emissivity of the substrate (hereinafter referred to as emissivity sensitivity across the surface of the substrate).
      <br/>
      Substrates having a generally low emissivity level may exhibit large variations in emissivity sensitivity over the surface of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a multi-probe temperature measurement system which does not account for variations in the emissivity sensitivity across the surface of the substrate may produce less than optimal results.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Systems which only seek to compensate for emissivity errors by a singular approximation of emissivity for the entire substrate will lead to acceptable results; however, room for improvement exists.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="16">
      In one aspect, the invention provides a method for correcting temperature probe readings in a thermal processing chamber for heating a substrate and includes calibrating the thermal processing chamber to derive emissivity sensitivity factors for each probe, forming a reflecting cavity on one side of the substrate and heating the substrate to a process temperature.
      <br/>
      Using a first probe, a second probe and at least a third probe energy may be sampled from the reflecting cavity.
      <br/>
      The first probe may have associated therewith a first effective reflectivity and the second probe may have associated therewith a second effective reflectivity, wherein the first and second effective reflectivities are different.
      <br/>
      The sampled energy from the first second and third probes may produce first, second and third temperature indications, respectively.
      <br/>
      From the first and second temperature indications, an effective emissivity for the substrate may be derived along with a corrected temperature reading for the first probe.
      <br/>
      The corrected temperature reading may be derived from the sum of the first temperature indication and an adjustment temperature.
      <br/>
      The corrected temperature reading for the first probe may be a more accurate indicator of an actual temperature of the substrate in the environment of the first probe than are uncorrected readings produced by the first probe.
      <br/>
      From the emissivity sensitivity factor for the third probe and the adjustment temperature, an emissivity sensitive adjustment temperature for the third probe may be derived.
      <br/>
      From the emissivity sensitive adjustment temperature for the third probe and the third temperature indication, a corrected temperature reading for the third probe may be derived, wherein the corrected temperature reading for the third probe is a more accurate indicator of an actual temperature of the substrate in the environment of the third probe than are uncorrected readings produced by the third probe.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Aspects of the invention include numerous features.
      <br/>
      A corrected temperature reading for the third probe may be the sum of the product of the adjustment temperature multiplied by a sensitivity factor for the third probe and the third temperature indication.
      <br/>
      The sensitivity factor may be computed by determining a temperature variation from an average temperature applied to a calibration substrate for a plurality of calibration substrates having predetermined emissivity levels.
      <br/>
      The plurality of calibration substrates may include at least one substrate having a high emissivity level, at least one substrate having a low emissivity level and at least one substrate having an emissivity level between the high and low levels.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The sensitivity factor for the third probe may be determined by a straight line approximation of a sensitivity curve associated with the corrected temperature derived for the first probe and the temperature variation derived from the calibration substrates.</p>
    <p num="19">
      Each probe may include an optical fiber for transporting radiation collected at the reflector to a pyrometer and where the view angle is reduced by including an aperture at the fiber output.
      <br/>
      Each probe may collect radiation through a conduit located in a reflector positioned opposite the substrate in the thermal processing chamber and where the effective reflectivity of a probe is varied by varying a numerical aperture for the probe.
      <br/>
      The first and second probes may measure radiation through a same conduit.
      <br/>
      The first and second probes may measure radiation through the same conduit by coupling two optical fibers to the same conduit where each optical fiber is coupled to a pyrometer.
      <br/>
      Each optical fiber may be coupled to different channels of one pyrometer and where the numerical aperture for the different channels is user selectable so as to allow for setting different effective reflectivities for each of the first and second probes.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In another aspect the invention provides an apparatus for measuring the temperature of a substrate in a thermal processing heating chamber and includes a reflecting plate placed next to one surface of the substrate to form a reflecting cavity therebetween, a first, second and third probe positioned to receive energy from the reflecting cavity and produce first, second and third temperature indications respectively.
      <br/>
      The first probe may have associated therewith a different effective reflectivity for the cavity than the second probe.
      <br/>
      The apparatus includes a temperature measurement module which receives the first, second and third temperature indications and an emissivity sensitivity factor associated with the third probe and derives a corrected temperature reading for the third probe.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Aspects of the invention include numerous features.
      <br/>
      The first, second and third probes may comprise light pipes.
      <br/>
      The first and second probes may share a light pipe.

      The temperature measurement module may compute the emissivity sensitivity factor for the third probe.

      The product of the sensitivity factor for the third probe and the adjustment temperature derived for the first probe may be summed with the third temperature indication to yield the corrected temperature reading for the third probe.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="25">The Virtual Blackbody Cavity</p>
    <p num="26">
      In the following description, we will refer to measuring the temperature of a substrate.
      <br/>
      We intend the term "substrate" to broadly cover any object that is being processed in a thermal process chamber and the temperature of which is being measured during processing.
      <br/>
      The term "substrate" includes, for example, semiconductor wafers, flat panel displays, glass plates or disks, and plastic workpieces.
    </p>
    <p num="27">To understand the present invention, it will be useful to first review the emissivity enhancement technique referred to above.</p>
    <p num="28">
      As shown in FIG. 1, a thermal reflector 22 is positioned near substrate 10 to create a virtual blackbody cavity 24 between the reflector and the substrate.
      <br/>
      If the substrate backside is diffuse, the radiation is emitted from it in a random pattern and thus the emitted radiation is reflected throughout the cavity in an equally random (isotropic) pattern.
      <br/>
      The radiation arriving at any location on the surface of reflector 22 is made up of many components: one component is made up of the radiation coming directly from the substrate and has experienced no reflections; a second component has experienced only one reflection off of reflector 22 and the backside of substrate 10; a third component has experienced two reflections off of reflector 22 and the backside of substrate 10; etc.
      <br/>
      The total intensity available at a point on the reflector plate can be found by summing over an infinite series of components of impinging radiation as follows:  (Equation image '4' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="29">where the reflectivity of the cold reflector plate is given by R, the emissivity of the wafer by  EPSILON  and where  SIGMA  is the Stefan-Boltzman constant and T is the temperature of the substrate.</p>
    <p num="30">
      Assuming that the reflectivity of the reflector is equal to one (R=1), then Eq. 5B reduces to:
      <br/>
      IT = SIGMA T4,  (5C)
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      in which the radiation IT is independent of emissivity of the backside of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Stated differently, the reflector produces a virtual blackbody cavity for which the "effective emissivity" of the substrate is equal to 1.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Note that this emissivity enhancing effect does not require that the backside of the wafer be diffuse.
      <br/>
      It will work for substrates having backsides that are perfectly specular reflectors as well as for substrates having backsides that are highly diffuse.
      <br/>
      As noted above, semiconductor wafer backsides are some combination of diffuse and specular.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      A light pipe 28 is used to sample radiation in the cavity through an aperture 27 in the reflector.
      <br/>
      The sampled intensity is passed through an optical fiber 30 to a pyrometer 33 where it is converted to temperature by using Eq. 5, above.
      <br/>
      Because of the virtual blackbody cavity effect, the measured temperature will be independent of changes in emissivity of the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In reality, however, the reflectivity of the reflector, though close to 1, will not be equal to 1.
      <br/>
      For one thing, the coating on the reflector will not be perfectly reflecting.
      <br/>
      For example, gold which is one of the better reflective coating materials, has a reflectivity of only about 0.975 at a wavelength of 950 nm (nanometers).
      <br/>
      In addition, it has become apparent that the presence of the one or more apertures in the reflector for sampling the radiation, as well as the overall geometry of the cavity (i.e., dimensions and shape), also tend to lower the performance of the virtual blackbody cavity we are trying to create here.
      <br/>
      These geometric effects together with the actual reflectivity can be lumped together into an "effective reflectivity" term Reff.
      <br/>
      Though it is possible to substantially reduce the impact that changes in substrate emissivity have on the sampled intensity, the measurements will nevertheless not be completely independent of the emissivity of the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Assuming reflector 22 is opaque, cold, and highly reflective (i.e., R+character pullout}1), we can ignore the effects of radiation emitted by the reflector, and the effective emissivity,  EPSILON eff, of the substrate can be approximated by:  (Equation image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="36">
      where Reff is the effective reflectivity of the reflecting cavity.
      <br/>
      Note that if Reff does equal 1, then  EPSILON eff will also equal 1 as it should.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if Reff is less than 1,  EPSILON eff will also be less than 1 and the measured temperature will be a function of emissivity.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In FIG. 2, effective emissivity,  EPSILON eff, is plotted as a function of the actual emissivity,  EPSILON , for different values of Reff.
      <br/>
      As indicated, the effective emissivity of the substrate approaches 1 as the effective reflectivity of the reflecting cavity approaches 1.
      <br/>
      Also, as Reff --&gt; 1, the effective emissivity of the substrate becomes less sensitive to changes in the actual emissivity of the substrate, especially for high values of actual emissivity.
      <br/>
      This sensitivity can be quantified as follows:  (Equation image '6' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="38">which is obtained by taking the derivative of Eq. 6 with respect to  EPSILON .</p>
    <p num="39">The resulting error in the temperature measurement is related to variations in the effective emissivity as follows:  (Equation image '7' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="40">Using Eqs. 6 and 7, we obtain:  (Equation image '8' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="41">
      Note that as Reff approaches one, the numerator and thus, the sensitivity of the measured temperature to changes in substrate emissivity, become vanishingly small.
      <br/>
      Conversely, if the effective reflectivity of the cavity is not sufficiently high (i.e., close to one), the variations in the temperature measurement that are due to variations in substrate emissivity can remain unacceptably large.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Referring again to FIG. 1, the presence of aperture 27 introduces a localized disturbance in the virtual blackbody cavity 24 created between the reflector and the substrate.
      <br/>
      We have come to realize that such disturbances also reduce the emissivity-enhancing effect produced by the reflector.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the size of the disturbance tends to increase with increasing aperture size (D).
      <br/>
      Thus, one approach to minimizing the effect of the aperture on emissivity enhancement might be to reduce the size of the aperture.
      <br/>
      However, since the amount of light collected by the light pipe is proportional to the area of the aperture, this reduces the amount of light collected by the light pipe which, in turn, reduces the signal-to-noise ratio of the detection system.
      <br/>
      Since radiation intensity drops off rapidly as substrate temperature decreases, using a smaller aperture can significantly increase the temperature below which the detector is no longer useful.
    </p>
    <p num="43">We have discovered, however, that by modifying the base reflector in an RTP system to include a measurement-enhancing surface feature at the end of the light probe, we can further increase the virtual blackbody effect of the reflecting cavity while also obtaining an improved signal-to-noise in the sampled signal.</p>
    <p num="44">An RTP System Incorporating the Invention Overview of the RTP System</p>
    <p num="45">
      An RTP system that has been modified in accordance with the invention is shown in FIG. 3A. The RTP system includes a processing chamber 100 for processing a disk-shaped, eight inch (200 mm) diameter silicon substrate 106.
      <br/>
      The substrate 106 is mounted inside the chamber on a substrate support structure 108 and is heated by a heating element 110 located directly above the substrate.
      <br/>
      The heating element 110 generates radiation 112 which enters the processing chamber 100 through a water-cooled quartz window assembly 114 which is approximately one inch (2.5 cm) above the substrate.
      <br/>
      Beneath substrate 106 is a reflector 102 which is mounted on a water-cooled, stainless steel base 116.
      <br/>
      Reflector 102 is made of aluminum and has a highly reflective surface coating 120.
      <br/>
      The underside of substrate 106 and the top of reflector 102 form a reflecting cavity 118 for enhancing the effective emissivity of the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The separation between the substrate and reflector is approximately 0.3 inch (7.6 mm), thus forming a cavity which has a width-to-height ratio of about 27.
      <br/>
      In processing systems that are designed for eight-inch silicon wafers, the distance between the substrate 106 and reflector 102 is between 3 mm and 9 mm, and preferably between 5 mm and 8 mm and the width-to-height ratio of cavity 118 should be larger than about 20:1.
      <br/>
      If the separation is made too large, the emissivity-enhancement effect that is attributable to the virtual blackbody cavity that is formed will decrease.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the separation is too small, e.g. less than about 3 mm, then the thermal conduction from the substrate to the cooled reflector will increase, thereby imposing an unacceptably large thermal load on the heated substrate.
      <br/>
      Since the main mechanism for heat loss to the reflecting plate will be conduction through the gas, the thermal loading will, of course, depend upon the type of gas and the chamber pressure during processing.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The temperatures at localized regions 109 of substrate 106 are measured by a plurality of temperature probes 126 (only two of which are shown in FIG. 3A).
      <br/>
      The temperature probes are sapphire light pipes that pass through a conduit 124 that extends from the backside of base 116 through the top of reflector 102.
      <br/>
      Sapphire light pipes 126 are about 0.125 inch in diameter and conduits 124 are slightly larger to enable them to be easily inserted into the conduits.
    </p>
    <p num="48">The Emissivity Enhancing Surface Features</p>
    <p num="49">
      In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a small reflective cavity 42 (i.e., a microcavity) is formed in the top surface of reflector 102 where the conduit passes through to the top of the reflector (shown more clearly in FIG. 4A).
      <br/>
      The conduit enters the small cavity forming an aperture 129 at the bottom of the small cavity.
      <br/>
      Sapphire light pipe 126 is positioned within conduit 124 so that its uppermost end is flush with or slightly below the bottom of microcavity 42.
      <br/>
      The other end of light pipe 126 couples to a flexible optical fiber 125 that transmits sampled light from the cavity to a pyrometer 128.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      In the described embodiment, the surface microcavity is cylindrically shaped, has a radius (R) of about 0.100 inch and a depth (L) of about 0.300 inch.
      <br/>
      Aperture 129 at the bottom of microcavity 42 and conduit 124 are slightly larger than about 0.125 inch, which as noted above, is the diameter of the sapphire light pipe.
      <br/>
      Surface microcavity 42 functions to enhance the virtual blackbody effect of reflecting cavity 118 that is present between the backside of substrate 106 and the top of reflector 102, thereby increasing the effective emissivity of the substrate to a value that is even closer to one.
      <br/>
      The cylindrical microcavity both increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the sampled signal that is detected by the light pipe and it functions to increase the effective emissivity of the substrate (or equivalently, the effective reflectivity of the reflecting cavity).
      <br/>
      We further note that the enhancement effect does not appear to be strongly dependent on whether the probe end is flush with the bottom of surface microcavity 42 or is placed below that point, recessed within conduit 124.
      <br/>
      Thus, the operation of inserting the probe into the conduit during the assembly of the reflector is made easier by not having to satisfy close critical tolerances regarding the placement of the probe end.
      <br/>
      However, the probe end should not protrude into the surface microcavity since this seems to degrade the enhancement effect.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Assuming perfectly reflecting sidewalls in the cylindrical microcavity, the enhancement effect caused by the cylindrical microcavity increases as the L/R ratio of the microcavity increases.
      <br/>
      However, since the sidewalls are not perfectly reflecting, the more times the collected radiation reflects back and forth within the cavity, the more its signal strength will be diminished by the losses which occur upon each reflection.
      <br/>
      Therefore, as a practical matter there is a limit to how large one can make the L/R aspect ratio of the cylindrical microcavity and still obtain improvements in performance.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Surface microcavity 42, which is formed around the end of the probe, appears to work by increasing the level of self-irradiation of a localized region of the substrate backside, by increasing the collection efficiency of the probe, or by a combination of both mechanisms.
      <br/>
      In other words, the surface cavities increase, relative to a planar reflector, the amount of light that reflects from the reflector back at the localized region 109 on the substrate at which point the temperature is to be measured and thereby also increases the probe's collection of radiation.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      To achieve the high reflectivity that is desired for the reflector, a highly reflective multi-layered coating 120 is formed on top of the reflector.
      <br/>
      The bottom layer of the coating is a thin layer of gold, which is deposited onto the surface of the reflector body.
      <br/>
      Gold is preferred because it has a reflectivity of about 0.975 in the infra-red wavelength range of interest (i.e., about 950 nm).
      <br/>
      To further enhance the reflectivity of the gold layer, a quarter-wave stack is formed on top of the gold layer.
      <br/>
      The quarter-wave stack is made up of alternating dielectric layers which have different indices of refraction and have a thickness equal to 1/4 of the wavelength to which the pyrometer is most sensitive (e.g., 1/4 of 950 nm).
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the quarter-wave stack was applied by OCLI (Optical Coating Laboratory, Inc.) of Santa Rosa, Calif., although other acceptable commercial sources are also available for applying such coatings.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The top layer of the multi-layered structure is a passivation layer, which prevents the gold of the reflecting layer from possibly contaminating the RTP chamber.
      <br/>
      The passivation layer may be made of silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, silicon nitride, or any other acceptable material that will passivate the reflecting layer without degrading its reflective properties at the wavelength of interest.
    </p>
    <p num="55">The reflectivity of this multi-layered structure is about 0.995 at 950 nm, which is significantly higher than the natural reflectivity of 0.975 for a single thin gold film.</p>
    <p num="56">
      If gold is an unacceptable material for the reflecting, other reflecting materials may, of course, be used.
      <br/>
      For example, nickel is more inert than gold and has a good reflectivity, though not as high as gold.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Many other alternative geometries are possible for the surface microcavity.
      <br/>
      For example, a hemispherical microcavity 42', such as is shown in FIG. 4B, may be used.
      <br/>
      The microcavity is spherical in shape, with its center located in the plane of the reflector surface.
      <br/>
      For the RTP embodiment described above, the radius of the sphere is about 6-8 millimeters, i.e., comparable to the separation between the reflector and the back of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Sapphire probe 126 is 0.080 inch in diameter, although it may be desirable to use a smaller size (e.g. 0.050 inch) to minimize the disturbance that the probe might cause to the substrate temperature in the localized region 109.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Other microcavity geometries are shown in FIGS. 4C-4D. FIG. 4C shows a conical-shaped microcavity with the light pipe located at the vortex of the cone.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4D shows a spherical microcavity with the light pipe located opposite a circular aperture 161 in the surface of the reflector.
      <br/>
      These are just a few of the many alternative geometries that could be used.
      <br/>
      The particular microcavity geometry that is most appropriate for a given application can be empirically determined.
      <br/>
      In addition, the microcavity could also be a raised microcavity that is formed in material that protrudes from the surface of the reflecting plate.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Referring now to FIGS. 4E-4F, a virtual micro-cavity may be realized through the use of numerical apertures at the pyrometer.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4E shows a pair of light pipes 126-1 and 126-2 mounted in conduits 124 in reflector 102, each connected by a flexible optical fiber 125 to pyrometer 128.
      <br/>
      Pyrometer 128 may be a multi-channel device able to process multiple channels of temperature data.
      <br/>
      In addition, pyrometer 128 may include a user selectable numerical aperture setting which may be adjusted for each channel.
      <br/>
      The numerical aperture for a given channel may be set to normal mode (wide numerical aperture) or narrow mode (narrow numerical aperture).
      <br/>
      In normal mode a majority of the light received from the flexible optical fiber is processed, whereas in narrow mode a portion of the light energy received from the optical fiber is filtered prior to processing.
      <br/>
      In narrow mode, a virtual micro-cavity effect is realized at the light pipe without having to provide a physical micro-cavity.
      <br/>
      In this example, the two probes (temperature measurement devices including light pipes, optical fiber and pyrometer) are characterized by different effective emissivities by varying the numerical aperture used by the respective channels of pyrometer 128.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      FIG. 4F shows a single light pipe 126 mounted in a conduit 124 in reflector 102.
      <br/>
      Coupled to the light pipe 126 are a pair of flexible optical fibers 125, each connected to a different channel of pyrometer 128.
      <br/>
      Again the numerical apertures for the two channels may be adjusted to achieve a virtual micro-cavity effect.
    </p>
    <p num="61">Emissivity Corrected Temperature Measurements</p>
    <p num="62">
      Even though the use of a microcavity in the surface of the reflector around the end of the probe produces a reflecting cavity that more closely approximates a virtual blackbody, the effective emissivity will still not be identically equal to one.
      <br/>
      In other words, the measured temperatures will have an unknown error component attributable to variations in emissivity from one substrate to the next.
      <br/>
      In addition, the unknown error component will vary over the surface of the substrate as emissivity sensitivity varies or as the "effective emissivity" varies.
      <br/>
      Thus, it may be desirable to further improve the accuracy of each temperature measurement by measuring and correcting for variations in the effective emissivity associated with a localized area of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The accuracy of real time, in situ temperature measurement may be improved by measuring the temperature at a particular localized region of a substrate using two temperature probe assemblies (or a single temperature probe sampled at two different numerical apertures) that are characterized by different effective emissivities (or equivalently, different effective reflectivities).
      <br/>
      The temperatures measured by these probe(s) can then be used to obtain an initial correction for localized temperature measurements.
      <br/>
      A refined temperature correction for each localized temperature reading can then be obtained by adjusting the initial correction by an emissivity sensitivity factor derived for each localized temperature region.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      Referring to FIGS. 3A and 3C, two radiation probes 150, 152 having different effective emissivities  EPSILON 1,  EPSILON 2 are used to derive the initial temperature correction referred to above.
      <br/>
      A first probe 150 is located inside a cylindrical surface microcavity 42, as previously described and as shown more clearly in FIGS. 4A-4D. A second probe 152 is disposed in a cylindrical microcavity 43 which has its bottom covered with a non-reflecting material.
      <br/>
      The second probe 152 may be held in place by a silicon donut (not shown).
      <br/>
      The effective emissivity of the first probe  EPSILON 1 is higher than that of the second probe  EPSILON 2 In one embodiment, microcavity 42 for first probe 150 is approximately the same diameter as first probe 150, while the diameter of microcavity 43 associated with second probe 152 is oversized, much larger than the diameter of second probe 152.
      <br/>
      The oversized microcavity helps to isolate second probe 152 from reflector 102, providing a lower effective emissivity for second probe 152.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the diameter of microcavity 43 is two times the diameter of microcavity 42.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      In the configuration just described, the effective emissivity for the first probe (i.e., probe 150) will be larger than the effective emissivity for the second probe (i.e., probe 152).
      <br/>
      As an alternative to placing probe 152 in a microcavity having a non-reflective coating, it may be placed above the reflector surface to within about 3-4 millimeters of the backside of substrate 106.
      <br/>
      The second probe (i.e. probe 152), however, should not be placed too close to the backside of the substrate (and away from the cooled reflecting plate) so as to avoid it being heated up by the radiation from the hot substrate during processing.
      <br/>
      If the probe is allowed to get too hot it can damage the probe and/or material may deposit on the probe, thereby degrading its performance.
      <br/>
      In addition, having the probe too close to the backside of the substrate may impact the temperature of the substrate.
      <br/>
      As another alternative to placing probe 152 in a microcavity, a single probe configured to produce a virtual microcavity effect (including two optical fibers for passing radiation to be processed by separate channels of a pyrometer which are set at different numerical apertures) may be used as is described above.
      <br/>

      In the described embodiment, the high emissivity wafer is a nitride wafer having an emissivity of 0.94 and the low emissivity wafer is a polysilicon wafer with an oxide layer having an emissivity of 0.32 on the backside of the wafer, i.e., the side facing the temperature probes.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      As before, two neighboring temperature probes are used.
      <br/>
      One probe, referred to hereinafter as the small hole probe, yields a high effective reflectivity.
      <br/>
      The small hole probe produces a temperature reading T1 and it is used to measure the temperature of the wafer during processing.
      <br/>
      It is the temperature that is generated by this probe (i.e., T1) that will be corrected to account for the emissivity of the backside of the wafer.
      <br/>
      The other probe, referred to hereinafter as the big hole probe, yields a lower effective reflectivity.
      <br/>
      The big hole probe produces a temperature reading of T2 and it is used to generate the correction that will be applied to the temperature that is measured by the small hole probe.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      It is desirable that the two probes be close enough to each other so that they sample the same region of the wafer at about the same time.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the probes are too close, the large hole probe will impact the temperature measurement of the small hole probe for low emissivity wafers.
      <br/>
      This may lead to temperature nonuniformity on the wafers with low emissivity.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      In the described embodiment, the two probes are located at the same radius from the wafer center and are separated by about 0.85 inch.
      <br/>
      The small hole probe has a configuration that is used for all of the other measurement probes in the reflecting plate.
      <br/>
      For purposes of the following example, the small hole probe uses a light pipe which has a diameter of about 0.080 inch, which is positioned in a 0.085 inch diameter hole in the reflecting plate, and which has its uppermost end flush with the surface of the reflecting plate.
      <br/>
      The big hole probe also uses a 0.080 inch diameter light pipe with its uppermost end flush with the surface of the reflecting plate but positioned within a larger hole (i.e., 0.37 inch) in the reflecting plate.
      <br/>
      The purpose of the larger hole is to produce a lower effective probe emissivity (or equivalently, a lower effective reflectivity for the reflecting cavity) for the big hole probe as compared to the small hole probe.
      <br/>
      Thus, the two probes will yield measurably different temperatures.
      <br/>
      For example, the difference in measured temperature using these two probes will be about 40-50 (degree)  C. for a wafer having a backside emissivity of 0.34 and an actual temperature of 1000 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      As stated earlier, it is desirable to produce a large difference in effective reflecting cavity reflectivities for the two probes so as to increase the signal to noise ratio of the different temperature measurements.
      <br/>
      Thus, it should be noted that the particular manner in which this is accomplished in the described embodiment is only meant to be illustrative of one of the many different ways of achieving that objective.

    <p num="121">As noted earlier, the energy, I, emitted by a black body is related to temperature T by Planck's law:  (Equation image '20' not included in text)</p>

    <p num="123">In other words, with this equation the temperature of a black body can be computed by knowing the amount of energy being emitted from the object.</p>
    <p num="124">Calibration for Deriving Tcorr</p>
    <p num="125">
      The procedure for generating a correction factor for the temperature reading of the small hole probe is shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      The procedure will now be described in detail with reference to the steps shown in FIG. 7.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      Initially, the high emissivity wafer is heated in the chamber to Tprocess as measured using the small hole probe and the two probes are calibrated to produce the same temperature reading (step 210).
      <br/>
      Although the actual temperature readings of the two probes prior to calibration will differ, the amount by which they differ will be small when using the high emissivity wafers.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      To establish two measurements that are necessary for the calibration of the small hole probe, the low emissivity wafer is then heated to temperature, Tprocess.
      <br/>
      To determine the process temperature of the substrate, it is again assumed that the small hole probe accurately measures the wafer temperature of the low emissivity wafer.
      <br/>
      Note that this is an assumption that proves to be acceptable, as will become apparent below.
      <br/>
      While the wafer is at Tprocess, its temperature is measured using both the big hole probe and the small hole probe (step 212).
      <br/>
      The big hole probe produces a measured temperature of T2 =Tbig and the small hole probe produces a measured temperature of T1 =Tsmall.
      <br/>
      A delta temperature,  DELTA T ( EPSILON low, Tprocess), is defined as the difference between these two readings, i.e.,  DELTA T( EPSILON low, Tprocess)=T1 -T2.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      Next, the actual sensitivity of the small hole probe to differences in wafer emissivity is determined by performing an implantation anneal on each of the wafers (i.e., the low emissivity wafer and the high emissivity wafer), using the measured temperature readings produced by the small hole probe as the actual temperature.
      <br/>
      In other words, the temperature readings produced by the small hole probe are assumed to be correct temperature readings, in spite of the fact that they are slightly incorrect.
      <br/>
      However, as is well known, the film resistivity of the implanted layer will be critically dependent upon the time and the actual temperature of the implantation anneal.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, that dependency is accurately known.
      <br/>
      Thus, by measuring the resistivities of the layer on each of two wafers, each of which has been annealed at a different process temperature for the same amount of time, it will be possible to accurately determine what the actual difference between the two process temperatures was.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      When the small hole probe produces temperature readings that are the same for both the low emissivity wafer and the high emissivity wafer, the actual temperature of the low emissivity wafer will, in reality, be slightly higher than the actual temperature of the high emissivity wafer.
      <br/>
      This is because at a given actual wafer temperature, the low emissivity wafer will emit less energy than will the high emissivity wafer at the same temperature.
      <br/>
      Thus, to make the energy emitted by the low emissivity wafer equal to the energy emitted by the high emissivity wafer, its actual temperature must be slightly higher than the actual temperature of the high emissivity wafer.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      To determine the difference between the two actual wafer process temperatures, one implantation anneal is performed on the high emissivity wafer, using the small hole probe to monitor the process temperature.
      <br/>
      A second implantation anneal is performed on the low emissivity wafer, again using the small hole probe to monitor process temperature.
      <br/>
      Then, the film resistivities of each of the wafers is measured and, using well known conversion charts for the particular anneal that was performed, the difference in the actual process temperatures of the two wafers can be accurately determined.
      <br/>
      The result is designated as Terrlow (step 214).
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      Alternatively to performing an implantation anneal, an oxide layer can be grown on the two wafers and then the difference in oxide thickness can be determined.
      <br/>
      The difference in oxide thicknesses can then be converted, using well known tables, to an accurate measure of the difference in the actual process temperatures that produced the two oxide thicknesses.
    </p>
    <p num="132">By modeling the actual temperature error, Terrorlow, of the small hole probe as a linear function of  DELTA T( EPSILON ,T), a correction factor, Kcorr, is then computed as follows (step 216):  (Equation image '22' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="133">For the present example, Kcorr equals 1.246.</p>
    <p num="134">In Situ Temperature Correction</p>
    <p num="135">
      A corrected temperature, Tcorr, is generated from the small hole probe and big hole probe temperature measurements as shown in the flow chart of FIG. 11. The wafer temperature is measured using both the small hole probe (step 230) and the big hole probe (step 232) to obtain T1 and T2, respectively.
      <br/>
      The difference in measured temperatures (i.e., T1 -T2) is computed (step 234) and multiplied by Kcorr (step 236) to arrive at the correction term which is then added to T1 to arrive at the corrected temperature (step 238).
      <br/>
      In other words,
      <br/>
      Tcorr =T1 +Kcorr *  DELTA T( EPSILON , T). (22)
    </p>
    <p num="136">The principles behind this technique and the resulting improvement in the accuracy of the temperature measurement will now be described.</p>
    <p num="137">
      In essence, the measurement of the sensitivity of the small hole probe determines which effective emissivity curve (see Eq. 15) applies to the small hole probe.
      <br/>
      This can be seen as follows.
      <br/>
      In performing the implantation anneal on the low emissivity wafer while using the small hole probe as a monitor of the process temperature, it is assumed that the emissivity of the wafer is one.
      <br/>
      With that assumption, the energy emitted by the wafer is equal to the energy that is emitted by an ideal black body at Tprocess, i.e., I(Tprocess, LAMBDA ) However, the previous determination of Terrlow indicates that the actual temperature of the wafer is higher, namely, Tprocess +Terrlow.
      <br/>
      Thus, the energy being emitted by the wafer can also be expressed as being equal to the effective emissivity for the low emissivity wafer (i.e.  EPSILON eff,low) times the energy that would be emitted by a black body at this higher temperature (i.e., I(Tprocess +Terrlow,  LAMBDA )).
      <br/>
      In other words,
      <br/>
      EPSILON eff,low * I(Tprocess +Terror, LAMBDA )=I(Tprocess, LAMBDA ).  (23)
    </p>
    <p num="138">This can be rewritten to obtain an equation for computing  EPSILON eff,low as follows:  (Equation image '23' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="139">For the described embodiment,  EPSILON eff,low is computed to be 0.855. Then, by using Eq. 17, the effective reflectivity for the small hole probe, Reffsmall, is computed from the effective and actual emissivities of the low emissivity wafer as follows:  (Equation image '24' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="140">In this example, Reffsmall is equal to 0.92</p>
    <p num="141">
      By knowing Reffsmall and by using Eq. 15, we can plot the apparent emissivity for the small hole probe as a function of actual wafer emissivity.
      <br/>
      This plot is shown as the upper curve in FIG. 8.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      The two temperature measurements that were obtained for the high emissivity wafer, namely, Tbig and Tsmall enable us to determine the effective emissivity curve of the big hole probe in a similar manner.
      <br/>
      For the big hole probe, it is known that measured emitted energy, I(Tbig, LAMBDA ), is equal to the energy emitted by a black body at some higher temperature, Tactual, times the effective emissivity of the big hole probe,  EPSILON effbig.
      <br/>
      Similarly, for the small hole probe, it is known that measured emitted energy, I(Tsmall, LAMBDA ), is equal to the energy emitted by a black body at the higher temperature, Tacual, times the effective emissivity of the small hole probe,  EPSILON effsmall.
      <br/>
      Thus, the following expression may be written:  (Equation image '25' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="143">This can, in turn, be rewritten and generalized as:  (Equation image '26' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="144">Since the effective reflectivity of the small hole probe is now known (see above),  EPSILON effsmall can be computed from the following relationship:  (Equation image '27' not included in text)</p>

      Plugging the value for  EPSILON effsmall into Eq. 27 yields a value for  EPSILON effbig.

      Note that for purposes of the calibration scheme, it is desirable to have the two curves (i.e., the apparent emissivity curves for the small hole probe and the big hole probe) separated by a large amount so as to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the calibration.

      If no correction is made to the temperature measured by the small hole probe during a process run, the temperature error, Terrnocorr, will be equal to:

    <p num="151">A plot of this function is shown in FIG. 9 (see upper, solid curve), which shows the error that is introduced into the uncorrected temperature measurement using the small hole probe increasing significantly with decreasing substrate emissivity.</p>
    <p num="152">
      By using Eq. 20, the difference in temperatures measured by the big hole probe and the small hole probe, i.e.,  DELTA T( EPSILON ,T), can be computed as follows:

      The lower, dotted curve in FIG. 9 illustrates the improved accuracy of the corrected temperature measurement as a function of wafer backside emissivity.
      <br/>
      Note that over a range of emissivities from 0.3 to 1.0, the error is less than about 1 (degree)  C. In other words, the corrected temperature reading from using the above-described technique is substantially improved and the sensitivity of the corrected temperature reading to variations in emissivity from one wafer top the next is greatly reduced as compared to the uncorrected temperature reading.
    </p>
    <p num="154">
      It is apparent from FIG. 9 that the linear approximation has generated a correction factor that has slightly overcompensated for the actual measurement error.
      <br/>
      One way to further optimize the correction factor is to simply use a smaller factor, e.g. 0.9 Kcorr. If the correction factor is scaled in that way, the resulting curve more closely approaches zero error over a larger portion of the emissivity range (see dashed curve in FIG. 9).
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      The effects that account for the error in the small hole probe temperature measurement are energy-related effects, which introduce an exponential term.
      <br/>
      Thus, the actual errors are nonlinear.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, the linear approximation to the error works very well in compensating for these nonlinear effects.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      Of course, further optimization of the correction factor can be obtained by taking into account the nonlinear way in which the correction factor varies as a function of the temperature difference between the two probes.
      <br/>
      In many applications, however, the substantial level of improvement that is obtained from the simple linear approximation makes further refinement of the corrected temperature measurement unnecessary.

      To evaluate the accuracy of the equation for  DELTA T( EPSILON ,T) (i.e., Eq. 33), the computed values were compared to actual experimental data for the temperature difference between the two probes.

      This comparison is shown in FIG. 10. The top curve is for a wafer having an emissivity of 0.32, the middle curve is for a wafer having an emissivity of 0.67, and the lower curve is for a wafer having an emissivity of 0.82. The experimental data is presented as " * 's" and "+'s" in the graph.
      <br/>
      To obtain the experimental data, a wafer was placed in the chamber and the temperature was ramped up to 1000 (degree)  C. At every 100 (degree)  C. step after 500 (degree)  C., the temperature was allowed to stabilize for about 10 seconds and then a temperature reading for each of the probes was recorded.
      <br/>
      The difference between these two readings corresponds to  DELTA T( EPSILON ,T).
      <br/>
      The scatter in the data taken at each temperature is due to the noise in the measurements.

      It should be understood that other techniques may be used to reduce the effective reflectivity associated with the second probe.
      <br/>
      The techniques described above involved raising the probe above the surface of the reflecting plate, enlarging the hole around the probe, or varying the numerical aperture for the probe.
      <br/>
      Other techniques include, for example: (1) reducing the reflectivity of the reflecting plate around the probe by forming an absorbing donut around the probe (e.g. a region covered with silicon nitride); (2) reducing the view angle of the probe by including an aperture at the fiber output.
    </p>
    <p num="159">If a reduced viewing angle (angle of acceptance for radiation entering a light pipe) is used for the second probe, the size of the hole may be decreased while still achieving a difference in the measured temperatures using the two probes of about 40 (degree)  C.

During thermal processing, support structure 108 is rotated at about 90 RPM.

      Thus, each probe actually samples the temperature profile of a corresponding annular ring area on the substrate.
      <br/>
      The temperature indications associated with each probe 151a-151f are corrected according to the individual sensitivity to variations in emissivity associated with the probe location as described above in connection with the in situ measurement technique.

      Support ring 134 has a radial width of approximately one inch (2.5 cm).
      <br/>
      To minimize the thermal discontinuities that will occur at the edge of substrate 106 during processing, support ring 134 is made of the same, or similar, material as the substrate, e.g. silicon or silicon carbide.

      Internal cavity 149 is connected to a gas supply (not shown) through a passageway 147.

      However, the light pipes can be made of any appropriate heat-tolerant and corrosion-resistant material, e.g., quartz, that can transmit the sampled radiation to the pyrometer.

      Such a scheme may be less expensive than sapphire light pipes if appropriate off-the-shelf optical elements can be found.

      If the reflector is allowed to heat up, this will tend to increase surface oxidation which could seriously degrade the reflectivity of the reflecting layer.
      <br/>
      Achieving an effective emissivity enhancement depends on having and maintaining a highly reflective surface.
      <br/>
      In addition, as the reflector assembly heats up it will become a source of radiation which will contaminate the sampled signal.
    </p>
    <p num="171">
      In the described embodiment, pyrometer 128 has a narrow bandwidth (e.g. about 40 nm) located at about 950 nm.
      <br/>
      It may also be desirable to coat the backside of quartz window 114 with an inert material which is transparent to thermal radiation in all but this narrow band of wavelengths, thereby reducing the likelihood that the heat source will introduce stray radiation into the reflecting cavity.
    </p>
    <p num="172">
      In general, it is desirable in a system for processing silicon substrates to use a pyrometer that detects long radiation wavelengths (e.g. wavelengths greater than about 3.5 to 4  MU m).
      <br/>
      However, this approach is best suited for temperatures above 700 (degree)  C. At room temperature, a silicon wafer is transparent to wavelengths of light longer than 1.0  MU m. As the temperature of the substrate increases, the substrate becomes opaque to the longer wavelengths until, at about 700 (degree)  C., the substrate becomes opaque to all wavelengths of interest.
      <br/>
      Thus, at temperatures below 700 (degree)  C., a long wavelength sensitive pyrometer will be more apt to also detect light coming directly from the heat source.
      <br/>
      In short, the wavelength sampled by the pyrometer should take into account the process temperature.
      <br/>
      If the process temperature is substantially below 700 (degree)  C., then the pyrometer should sample wavelengths shorter than 1.1  MU m. If higher process temperatures are used, then longer wavelengths can be sampled.
    </p>
    <p num="173">It should also be noted that at very low process temperatures (e.g., 600 (degree)  K (327 (degree)  C.), only a small amount of black body spectral radiation is generated at wavelengths shorter than 1.1  MU m. As a result, at temperatures below 600 (degree)  K, it becomes quite difficult to obtain a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
    <p num="174">
      In one design, particularly suitable for process temperatures between 900 (degree)  and 1350 (degree)  C., a solid-state pyrometer is used that is sensitive to radiation at wavelengths between 0.9  MU m and 1.0  MU m (e.g., a 900-LP-6.35C sensor combined with a 100-S8MS-B-8CV electronics box, both of which are available from Luxtron Corporation-Accufiber Division).
      <br/>
      In this temperature range, there is substantial amount of radiation produced in the wavelength range 0.9-1.0  MU m, providing high signal strengths and high signal-to-noise ratios.
    </p>

      FIG. 12 shows a control loop for heating the substrate to the desired temperature.
      <br/>
      It uses the sampled output from a plurality of temperature sensors 290 (i.e., pyrometers and light pipes).
      <br/>
      The heating element 110 includes 187 tungsten-halogen lamps that are arranged in radial zones.
      <br/>
      Each zone of lamps is separately powered by a multi-zone lamp driver 294 that is, in turn, controlled by a multi-input, multi-output controller 292.
      <br/>
      Since the substrate rotates at about 90 rpm and temperature measurements are made at different radial locations on the backside of substrate 106, each temperature probe produces an average temperature over a different annular region of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The annular regions coincide with the radial zones of the heat lamp.
      <br/>
      Controller 292 receives the temperature measurements that are generated by temperature sensors 290, corrects the temperatures (Trefx) based upon the above-described refined temperature correction algorithm, and adjusts the power level of the heating lamps to achieve a substrate temperature as specified by a predefined temperature cycle profile 296 that is supplied to controller 292.
      <br/>
      Throughout the process cycle, the controller automatically adjusts the power levels delivered to the different lamp zones so that any temperature deviations away from the desired temperature profile are corrected for.
