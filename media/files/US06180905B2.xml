      A pushbutton switch (10) includes a printed circuit board (14) having first and second traces (18, 20) spaced circumferentially apart about an axis (22) and a housing (40) connected to the circuit board.
      <br/>
      The housing (40) includes a chamber (80) in which a movable assembly (100) is partially disposed.
      <br/>
      The movable assembly (100) has electrical contacts (198) for engaging one or the other of the first and second traces (18 and 20) on the circuit board (14).
      <br/>
      A button (12) is connected with the movable assembly (100).
      <br/>
      The button (12) is manually depressible toward the circuit board (14).
      <br/>
      A spring (220) biases the movable assembly (100) and the button (12) away from the circuit board (14).
      <br/>
      A plurality of angled surfaces (84, 92, 126, 172) on the movable assembly (100) cooperate to cause the movable assembly to rotate about the axis (22) when the button (12) is manually depressed toward the circuit board (14).
      <br/>
      The movable assembly (100), when rotated, toggles between a first condition in which the first trace (18) is engaged by the contacts (198) and a second condition in which the second trace (20) is engaged by the contacts.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a pushbutton switch, and is particularly directed to a two position pushbutton switch having an illuminated button.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Two position pushbutton switches are used in many applications.
      <br/>
      One such application is a so-called "window lockout" switch in an automobile.
      <br/>
      The window lockout switch is typically mounted in an arm rest panel near the driver of the automobile.
      <br/>
      The window lockout switch is manually depressible to toggle between two axial positions.
      <br/>
      In one axial position, the window lockout switch electrically disables the rocker switches which the passengers would normally use to operate the automobile's power windows.
      <br/>
      In the other axial position, the window lockout switch electrically enables the rocker switches adjacent each of the passenger windows so that the passengers can operate the respective power window adjacent their seat in the automobile.
      <br/>
      The window lockout switch is particularly useful to families with small children.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">

      <br/>
      The housing includes a chamber centered on the axis.
      <br/>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention relates to a pushbutton switch, and is particularly directed to a two position pushbutton switch 10 having an illuminated button 12.
      <br/>
      The switch 10 has numerous applications.
      <br/>
      As representative of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 1 illustrates the switch 10 as a power window lockout switch for an automobile.
      <br/>
      The switch 10 is mounted in an arm rest panel (not shown) near the driver's seat in the automobile, along with a respective rocker switch (not shown) for operating each of the automobile's power windows (not shown).
      <br/>
      Additional rocker switches (not shown) are located adjacent each power window in the automobile so that a passenger seated next to a given power window can operate the power window.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The switch 10 includes a printed circuit board 14 having an upper surface 16.
      <br/>
      The upper surface 16 of the printed circuit board 14 includes first and second electrical traces 18 and 20, only portions of which are visible in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The first and second traces 18 and 20 are spaced circumferentially about a switch axis 22 in an alternating pattern.
      <br/>
      The first and second traces 18 and 20 are operatively electrically coupled to circuits (not shown) which control each of the automobile's power windows.
      <br/>
      When an electrical circuit is completed through the first trace 18, each power window in the automobile may be operated using either the rocker switch adjacent a particular power window or the respective rocker switch in the driver's arm rest panel.
      <br/>
      When an electrical circuit is completed through the second trace 20, the individual rocker switches adjacent each window are electrically disabled and only the rocker switches near the driver can operate the power windows.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The printed circuit board 14 includes a clearance hole 24 centered on the switch axis 22.
      <br/>
      The clearance hole 24 is located radially inward from the first and second traces 18 and 20.

      <br/>
      The arcuate segments 68 lie on opposite sides of the switch axis 22 and are located between the mounting tabs 66.
      <br/>
      The arcuate segments 68 have end surfaces 70 (FIG. 10) which rest on the upper surface 16 of the printed circuit board 14 to stabilize the housing 40 on the circuit board.
      <br/>
      A cylindrical orientation pin 62 (FIG. 1) projects from one of the arcuate segments 68 and into the orientation hole 28 in the printed circuit board 14.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The first and second inner surfaces 50 and 52 of the main body portion 42 of the housing 40 together define a chamber 80 centered on the switch axis 22.
      <br/>
      The first inner surface 50 includes four minor grooves 82 which extend axially from the first end 44 toward the second end 46.
      <br/>
      The four minor grooves 82 are spaced 90 (degree)  apart.

      Each minor groove 82 terminates at an angled housing surface 84 (FIG. 2) which extends radially from each minor groove to the second inner surface 52.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The second inner surface 52 in the housing 40 includes two diametrically opposed major grooves 86.
      <br/>
      The major grooves 86 are spaced 90 (degree)  from the slots 56 in the main body portion 42 of the housing 40.
      <br/>
      The major grooves 86 extend axially from the second end 46 of the main body portion 42 toward the first end 44.
      <br/>
      The major grooves 86 extend radially farther into the main body portion 40 than the minor grooves 82.
      <br/>
      Each of the major grooves 86 terminates at a groove end surface 88 (FIG. 12) which extends radially between the major groove and the first inner surface 50.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Inside the chamber 80 in the housing 40, the major grooves 86, the minor grooves 82, and the slots 56 are all separated from each other by a plurality of guide bars 90 (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      The guide bars 90 extend axially from the first end 44 of the main body portion 42 of the housing 40 toward the second end 46.
      <br/>
      The guide bars 90 have the same diameter as the first inner surface 50.
      <br/>
      Each of the guide bars 90 terminates at an angled guide surface 92 which extends radially outward from each guide bar to the second inner surface 52.
      <br/>
      The angled guide surfaces 92 extend at approximately the same angle as the angled housing surfaces 84.
      <br/>
      Further, every other one of the angled guide surfaces 92 extends co-linearly from a respective one of the angled housing surfaces 84.

      The first body portion 112 is disposed in the chamber 80 and the second body portion 114 projects out of the chamber through the first end 44 of the housing 40.
      <br/>
      The second body portion 114 has a D-shaped cross-section defined by a partially cylindrical surface 116 (FIG. 4) and a planar surface 118.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The first body portion 112 of the shaft 110 has a cylindrical inner surface 120 (FIG. 5) which defines a cavity 122 inside the shaft.
      <br/>
      The first body portion 112 has a cylindrical outer surface 124 (FIG. 2) which is larger in diameter than the second body portion 114.

      The lower end surface 128 comprises a circumferential array of axially pointing teeth 130.
      <br/>
      The array includes eight teeth 130 equally spaced apart.
      <br/>
      Each of the teeth 130 is defined by first and second angled surfaces 132 and 134 which converge to form a tooth point.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Adjacent the lower end surface 128 of the shaft 110, the outer surface 124 of the first body portion 112 further includes two diametrically opposed radial projections 140, and two diametrically opposed legs 142 which are spaced 90 (degree)  from the projections.
      <br/>
      One of the four ridges 126 is located between each of the projections 140 and each of the legs 142.
      <br/>
      The two projections 140 are thicker in the radial direction than the ridges 126 and are disposed in the two major grooves 86 in the chamber 80 in the housing 40.
      <br/>
      The projections 140 terminate at the lower end surface 128 and merge into two of the eight teeth 130.

      Each wedge portion 170 has an angled wedge surface 172 facing toward the first section 152 of the driver 150 and which blends into a respective one of the first angled surfaces 164 defining each of the teeth 130 on the driver.
      <br/>
      The second section 154 of the driver 150 further includes a cylindrical inner surface 174 (FIG. 7) and a radial surface 176 which together define a pocket 178 (FIG. 10) in the second section.

      The force of the spring 220 and the cooperation of the angled surfaces 172 on the wedge portions 170 with the angled guide surfaces 92 on the guide bars 90 moves the driver 150 in the direction of arrows B in FIG. 12, causing the driver to begin to rotate relative to the shaft 110 and the housing 40.
      <br/>
      In order for this rotation to occur, the meshed teeth 162 and 130 on the driver 150 and on the shaft 110, respectively, disengage briefly.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Under the force of the spring 220, the wedge portions 170 on the driver 150 then slide across the angled guide surfaces 92 on the guide bars 90, causing the driver to rotate in a counter clockwise direction as indicated by arrow C in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The wedge portions 170 continue sliding over the angled guide surfaces 92 and onto the angled housing surfaces 84 at the ends of the minor grooves 82 in the housing 40.
      <br/>
      This sliding movement rotates the driver 150 into a second condition shown in FIG. 13. The teeth 162 on the driver 150, having indexed one tooth over in the counterclockwise direction, mesh once again with the teeth 130 on the shaft 110.
      <br/>
      The spring 220 pushes the driver 150, and thus the shaft 110 and the button 12, upward and places the button in a second axial position for the switch 10.
      <br/>
      The second axial position is lower (i.e. closer to the printed circuit board) than the first axial position for the switch 10, as may be seen by comparing FIG. 13 to FIG. 11.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The second axial position of the switch 10 and the corresponding second condition of the movable assembly 100 constitute a position hereinafter referred to as the "lockout" position.
      <br/>
      In the lockout position, the angled surfaces 172 on the wedge portions 170 on the driver 150 engage the angled housing surfaces 84 at the ends of the minor grooves 82.
      <br/>
      The wedge portions 170 are also engaged by the first angled surfaces 132 which partially define four of the eight teeth 130 on the lower end surface 128 of the shaft 110 and which are located at the ends of the ridges 126 on the shaft.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      When the driver 150 rotates into the lockout position, the rotor 180 also rotates so that the contacts 198 move from the first trace 18 on the printed circuit board 14 to the second trace 20.
      <br/>
      The electrical circuit then completed through the second trace 20 electrically disables the automobile's power window switches (not shown) which are located adjacent each of the passenger windows, while the other power window switches (not shown) in the arm rest panel near the driver remain operable to control each of the passenger windows.
      <br/>
      With the button 12 in the lockout position, passengers are thus prevented from opening or closing the power window adjacent their respective seat in the automobile.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      To return the switch 10 to the normal position of FIG. 11, the button 12 is manually depressed manually, as indicated by arrow A, to a temporary intermediate position illustrated in FIG. 14. The shaft 110, to which the button 12 is connected by the second lightpipe 260, is pushed downward in the direction of arrow A. The angled surfaces 132 on the ridges 126 on the shaft 110, which are engaged with the angled surfaces 172 on the wedge portions 170, push the driver 150 downward against the bias of the spring 220.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 14, when the driver 150 is moved far enough downward so that the angled surfaces 172 on the wedge portions 170 are below the angled guide surfaces 92 on the housing guide bars 90, the bias of the spring 220 (FIGS. 1 and 2) pushes the driver 150 upward and causes the angled surfaces 172 on the wedge portions 170 to engage the angled guide surfaces 92 on the guide bars 90.
      <br/>
      The force of the spring 220 and the cooperation of the angled surfaces 172 on the wedge portions 170 with the angled guide surfaces 92 on the guide bars 90 moves the driver 150 in the direction of arrows D in FIG. 14, causing the driver to begin to rotate relative to the shaft 110 and the housing 40.
      <br/>
      In order for this rotation to occur, the meshed teeth 162 and 130 on the driver 150 and on the shaft 110, respectively, disengage briefly.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Under the force of the spring 220, the wedge portions 170 on the driver 150 then slide across the angled guide surfaces 92 on the guide bars 90, causing the driver 150 to rotate in the counter clockwise direction indicated by arrow C in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The wedge portions 170 continue sliding over the angled guide surfaces 92 and onto the two teeth 130 on the projections 140 on the shaft 110 and onto the two teeth 130 formed under the legs 142 on the shaft.
      <br/>
      This sliding movement rotates the driver 150 and returns the driver to the first condition shown in FIG. 11. The teeth 162 on the driver 150, having indexed one tooth over in the counterclockwise direction, mesh once again with the teeth 130 on the shaft 110.
      <br/>
      The spring 220 pushes the driver 150, and thus the shaft 110 and the button 12, upward and returns the button to the first axial position for the switch.
      <br/>
      When the driver 150 rotates back to the second condition, the rotor 180 also rotates so that the contacts 198 move from the second trace 20 on the printed circuit board 10 to the first trace 18.
      <br/>
      With the contacts 198 engaging the first trace 18, all of the window switches in the automobile are again electrically energized.
      <br/>
      Thus, as described above, each manual depression of the button 12 toggles the switch 10 between the normal position and the lockout position.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Another feature of the present invention concerns the illumination of the lettering 280 in the button 12.
      <br/>
      Light from the light bulb 30 is transmitted to the lettering 280 via the first and second lightpipes 240 and 260.
      <br/>
      The light shines through the center section 242 of the first lightpipe 240 surrounding the light bulb 30 and is channeled down the first and second arcuate legs 246 and 248 to the light conducting surface 250 at the terminal end of each of the arcuate legs.
      <br/>
      The light conducting surfaces 250 on the arcuate legs 246 and 248 conduct the light across the air gaps separating the light conducting surfaces 250 on the arcuate legs and the light conducting surfaces 268 on the first and second beams 262 and 264 of the second lightpipe 260.
      <br/>
      The light is received by the light conducting surfaces 268 on the beams 262 and 264 and is channeled up to the middle beam 266 of the second lightpipe 260.
      <br/>
      The sawtooth surfaces 272 in the middle beam 266 reflect the light upward to the transparent lettering 280 in the button 12 which overlies the middle beam 266 and the lettering is illuminated.
      <br/>
      The axial length of the light conducting surfaces 250 and 268 on the first and second lightpipes 240 and 260, respectively, is selected so that the light conducting surfaces axially overlap during all axial positions of the switch 10.
      <br/>
      This ensures that the lettering 280 in the button 12 is illuminated during all axial positions of the switch 10.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      From the above description of the invention, those skilled in the art will perceive improvements, changes and modifications.
      <br/>
      For example, the second trace 20 on the printed circuit board 14 could be completely dead so that when the switch 10 is in the lockout position, all of the window rocker switches in the automobile, including those near the driver, are disabled.
      <br/>
      Such improvements, changes and modifications within the skill of the art are intended to be covered by the appended claims.
