      <br/>
      An exposure apparatus for exposing mask patterns on a sensitive substrate includes a first mark detecting system for detecting a substrate mark in a detection area positioned at a predetermined interval from the optical axis of a projection optical system, and a second mark detecting system for detecting a mask mark formed at a predetermined position on a mask in the image field of the projection optical system.
      <br/>
      First and second fiducial mark members are mounted on a substrate stage with a fiducial plate.
      <br/>
      The mark members have a predetermined positional relation so that the first fiducial mark member is positioned in the detection area of the first mark detecting system when the second fiducial mark member is positioned in a predetermined relationship with respect to the position where the mask mark is to be present in the image field of the projection optical system.
      <br/>
      A stage control system moves the substrate stage based on a coordinate system obtained by correcting a coordinate axis of a substrate stage position measuring device by an amount corresponding to an inclination of the fiducial plate with respect to the coordinate axis.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a positioning method for a projection exposure apparatus for exposing mask patterns on a sensitive member coated on a plate such as a semiconductor wafer or a glass plate for a liquid crystal display element and, more particularly, to a projection exposure apparatus having a function of controlling a so-called base line amount of an off-axis alignment system with high precision, and an exposure method.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">In a conventional projection exposure apparatus having an off-axis alignment system, as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Nos. 53-56975 and 56-134737, a fiducial mark plate is fixed on a wafer stage which two-dimensionally moves according to a step-and-repeat scheme while holding a wafer as a sensitive plate, and the distance between the off-axis alignment system and a projection optical system, i.e., a so-called base line amount, is controlled by using this fiducial mark plate.</p>
    <p num="6">
      FIG. 16 shows a main part of a conventional projection exposure apparatus having an off-axis alignment system.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 16, exposure light from a light source system (not shown) is focused by a main condenser lens 1 to illuminate a reticle R with uniform illuminance.
      <br/>
      The reticle R is held on a reticle stage 2.
      <br/>
      The reticle stage 2 holds the reticle R while a center Rc of the reticle R is aligned with an optical axis AX of a projection optical system PL.
      <br/>
      A pair of reticle marks 3A and 3B for alignment are formed outside a pattern area on the lower surface of the reticle R. Alignment systems 5A and 5B of a TTR (through the reticle) scheme are arranged above the reticle marks 3A and 3B through mirrors 4A and 4B, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      When an exposure is to be performed, a pattern of the reticle R is projected/exposed on each shot area of a wafer W on a wafer stage 6 through the projection optical system PL.
      <br/>
      A wafer mark for alignment is formed in each shot area of the wafer W. A fiducial mark plate 7 having a mark 8 for alignment formed thereon is fixed on a portion near the wafer W on the wafer stage 6.
      <br/>
      When the wafer stage 6 is positioned such that the fiducial mark plate 7 is set at a position almost conjugate to the reticle marks 3A and 3B within the projection field of the projection optical system PL, the reticle mark 3A or 3B and the mark 8 are simultaneously detected by the alignment systems 5A and 5B above the reticle R. A distance La between the reticle mark 3A (or 3B) and the center Rc of the reticle R is a design value, and the distance between the projection point of the reticle mark 3A and the optical axis AX on an image plane of the projection optical system PL (the surface of the fiducial mark plate 7) is represented by La/M, where M is the magnification of the projection optical system PL when viewed from the wafer W side to the reticle R side.
      <br/>
      If the projection optical system PL is a 1/5 reduction projection optical system, M=5.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      An off-axis wafer alignment system 9 is arranged outside the projection optical system PL.
      <br/>
      The optical axis of the wafer alignment system 9 is parallel to the optical axis AX of the projection optical system PL.
      <br/>
      An index plate 10 having an index mark formed thereon is fixed inside the wafer alignment system 9.
      <br/>
      The surface of the index plate 10 on which the index mark is formed is conjugate to the surface of the mark 8.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      For example, a base line amount BL of the wafer alignment system 9 is defined as the distance between the optical axis, of the wafer alignment system 9, located on the wafer stage 6 and a projection point, of the center Rc of the reticle R, formed by the projection optical system PL.
      <br/>
      When the base line amount BL is to be measured, the wafer stage 6 is driven to move, for example, the mark 8 of the fiducial mark plate 7 to a position A immediately below the wafer alignment system 9.
      <br/>
      The positional offset amount of an image of the mark 8 with respect to an index mark in the wafer alignment system 9 is read together with the coordinates of the wafer stage 6 at this time.
      <br/>
      The coordinates of the wafer stage 6 are measured by a laser interferometer with high resolution.
      <br/>
      With this operation, the coordinates (X1,Y1) of the wafer stage 6 when the mark 8 is on the optical axis of the wafer alignment system 9 can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Subsequently, the wafer stage 6 is driven to sequentially move the mark 8 of the fiducial mark plate 7 to positions near positions C and B which are conjugate to the reticle marks 3A and 3B.
      <br/>
      The positional offset amounts of an image of the mark 8 with respect to the reticle marks 3A and 3B are read together with the corresponding coordinates of the wafer stage 6.
      <br/>
      With this operation, the coordinates (X2,Y2) of the wafer stage 6 when the mark 8 is located at the middle point between the reticle marks 3A and 3B, i.e., a conjugate point of the center Rc of the reticle R, can be obtained.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the base line amount BL can be obtained as the distance between the coordinates (X1,Y1) and the coordinates (X2,Y2).
      <br/>
      This base line amount BL is used afterward as a fiducial amount used for positioning of each shot area of the wafer W within the exposure area of the projection optical system PL on the basis of the coordinates of the wafer mark on the wafer W which are read by the wafer alignment system 9.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Letting XP be the distance between the center of a given shot area on the wafer W and a corresponding wafer mark in the X direction, X3 be the position of the wafer stage 6 in the X direction when the wafer mark is aligned with the optical axis of the wafer alignment system 9, and BLx be the X-direction component of the base line BL, the wafer stage 6 may be moved by the amount given by the following expression in order to align the center of the shot area designated by the wafer mark with the projection point of the center Rc of the reticle R:
      <br/>
      X3-BLx-XP
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The moving amount in the Y direction can be represented by a similar expression.
      <br/>
      Note that this expression is based on the arrangement shown in FIG. 16, and different calculation methods are used depending on the positions of the reticle marks 3A and 3B or the arrangement of the wafer alignment system 9.
    </p>
    <p num="13">With any expression for calculation, after the position of each wafer mark on the wafer W is detected in advance by using the off-axis wafer alignment system 9, each shot area on the wafer W is positioned and exposed within the exposure area of the projection optical system PL in accordance with each detected position, thereby accurately superimposing and exposing a pattern of the reticle R on each shot area of the wafer W.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Since the superposition precision deteriorates even though the reticle R is mounted such that it is rotated about the optical axis of the projection optical system PL from a fiducial angle, the rotational amount (reticle rotation) of the reticle R is measured as follows.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 16, the wafer stage 6 is driven to sequentially move the mark 8 of the fiducial mark plate 7 to the positions B and C, and the relative positional relationships between a conjugate image of the mark 8 and the reticle marks 3A and 3B are measured by the alignment systems 5A and 5B, respectively.
      <br/>
      With this operation, the rotational amount of the reticle R based on the traveling direction of the wafer stage 6 is measured.
      <br/>
      In the conventional apparatus, the rotational amount of the reticle R is adjusted by a reticle fine movement mechanism (not shown) such that the rotational amount of the reticle R based on the traveling direction of the wafer stage 6 is set to be a predetermined allowable value or less.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In the conventional projection exposure apparatus, since the base line amount of the off-axis wafer alignment system 9 and the rotational amount of the reticle R are measured on the basis of the traveling direction of the wafer stage 6, these amounts cannot be measured with high precision because of a measurement error or the like in a coordinate measurement system for the wafer stage 6.
      <br/>
      More specifically, an error is included in the measurement value of the coordinates of the wafer stage 6 owing to the influences of fluctuations in the optical path of a laser interferometer for monitoring the coordinates of the wafer stage 6, an error in the reset position for the initial coordinates of the wafer stage 6, an error in the set position of a movable mirror for reflecting a laser beam above the wafer stage 6, and the like.
      <br/>
      Therefore, errors are included in the base line amount and the rotational amount of the reticle R based on the measurement value.
    </p>
    <p num="16">In the conventional apparatus, the base line amount of the wafer alignment system 9 is obtained every time the reticle R is replaced.</p>
    <p num="17">
      In the conventional projection exposure apparatus, the base line amount is measured every time the reticle R is replaced, and exposure is performed after, for example, several hundred wafers are aligned by using the wafer alignment system 9.
      <br/>
      Since exposure is continuously performed, the temperature near the wafer stage 6 changes.
      <br/>
      For this reason, a drift occurs in the relative distance between the detection center of the wafer alignment system 9 and the projection position of the center of the reticle R. As a result, the superposition precision of a pattern image of the reticle R and a pattern formed on the wafer deteriorates.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      FIG. 15A shows an example of a change in the drift amount (unit:  MU m) of the base line amount.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 15A, the abscissa represents the number of wafers to be exposed after the reticle R is replaced, and the ordinate represents the drift amount of the base line amount.
      <br/>
      As is apparent from FIG. 15A, even if measurement of a base line amount is performed and the drift amount is set to be 0 at time Q after replacement of the reticle R, the drift amount gradually increases.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In order to eliminate this inconvenience, U.S. Pat. No. 4,897,553 discloses a method of measuring a base line amount every time a wafer is replaced, and a method of measuring a base line amount every time a predetermined number of wafers (e.g., several wafers) are exposed.
      <br/>
      If, however, a base line amount is measured every time a wafer is replaced, the throughput is reduced because measurement of a base line amount takes much time.
      <br/>
      When a base line amount is to be measured every time a predetermined number of wafers are replaced, measurement of a base line amount is performed at almost equal time intervals, i.e., times R1, R2, R3, . . . , as shown in FIG. 15B. However, the drift amount of the base line amount does not change linearly with-respect to the number of wafers to be exposed (substantially proportional to time).
      <br/>
      If, therefore, a wafer alignment system in which the drift amount increases immediately after an exposure operation is started is used, the drift amount may exceed an allowable value.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="20">It is an object of the present invention to provide a positioning method of measuring the base line amount of an off-axis alignment system of a projection exposure apparatus and the rotational amount of a reticle therein with high precision.</p>
    <p num="21">It is another object of the present invention to provide an alignment method which can suppress the drift amount of the base line amount of an off-axis alignment system of a projection exposure apparatus to an allowable value or less without greatly decreasing the throughput.</p>
    <p num="22">According to the present invention, there is provided an exposure apparatus for exposing mask patterns on a sensitive plate, the apparatus comprising:</p>
    <p num="23">
      a mask stage holding the mask;
      <br/>
      a plate stage movable while holding the sensitive plate;
      <br/>
      a projection optical system imaging the mask patterns at a predetermined position on the sensitive plate;
      <br/>
      a first mark detecting system for detecting a plate mark formed on the sensitive plate in a detection area positioned at a predetermined interval from the optical axis of the projection optical system;
      <br/>
      a second mark detecting system for detecting a mask mark formed at a predetermined position on the mask in the image field of the projection optical system;
      <br/>
      a first fiducial mark member arranged on a part of the plate stage, having a configuration capable of being detected by the first mark detecting system;
      <br/>
      a second fiducial mark member arranged on a part of the plate stage, having a configuration capable of being detected by the second mark detecting system through the projection optical system;
      <br/>
      a mounting member for mounting the first fiducial mark member and the second fiducial mark member with a constant predetermined positional relationship so as to position the first fiducial mark member in the detection area of the first mark detecting system when the second fiducial mark member is positioned in a predetermined relationship with respect to the position where the mask mark is to be present in the image field of the projection optical system;
      <br/>
      plate stage position measuring means for measuring a position of the plate stage; and
      <br/>
      coordinate setting means for obtaining an inclination of a measurement coordinate axis of the plate stage position measuring means with respect to the mounting member in advance, and setting a moving coordinate axis of the plate stage with reference to the mounting member.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      According to the present invention, since the apparatus includes the fiducial mark plate on which the first fiducial mark and the second fiducial mark as a fiducial mark for a mask are arranged apart from each other such that the first and second fiducial marks are simultaneously detected by the first and second mark detecting means, respectively, the base line amount of the off-axis alignment system can be measured with high precision without moving the plate stage.
      <br/>
      In addition, the rotational amount of a reticle can be measured with high precision by using the second fiducial mark of the fiducial mark plate.
    </p>
    <p num="25">When the rotational amount of a mask is obtained with reference to a plurality of second fiducial marks on the fiducial mark plate, the rotational error of the plate stage coordinate measuring means with respect to the coordinate system can be measured with high precision at high speed on the basis of the rotational amount of the mask and the inclination of the coordinate system of the plate stage coordinate measuring means with respect to the fiducial mark plate.</p>
    <p num="26">In addition, when the second mark detecting means is arranged to be movable along a predetermined axis, and the second mark detecting means is moved along the coordinate axis of the plate stage coordinate measuring means which has undergone correction of the inclination calculated in accordance with the above-described procedure, a base line amount can be measured with high precision even if the second mark detecting means moves.</p>
    <p num="27">
      According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an exposure method for exposing mask patterns on a sensitive plate, the method comprising:
      <br/>
      the step of replacing a plurality of the sensitive plates by using an exposure apparatus including:
      <br/>
      a mask stage holding the mask;
      <br/>
      a plate stage movable while holding the sensitive plate;
      <br/>
      a projection optical system imaging the mask patterns at a predetermined position on the sensitive plate;
      <br/>
      a first mark detecting system for detecting a plate mark formed on the sensitive plate in a detection area positioned at a predetermined intervals from the optical axis of the projection optical system;
      <br/>
      a first fiducial mark member arranged on a part of the plate stage, having a configuration capable of being detected by the first mark detecting system; and
      <br/>
      plate stage position measuring means for measuring a position of the plate stage;
      <br/>
      the base line measurement step of measuring a distance between a center position of the detection area positioned and the optical axis of the projection optical system, the base line measurement step being executed every time a predetermined number of sensitive plates are replaced or at predetermined time intervals; and
      <br/>
      the step of changing the number of sensitive plates as a unit for the replacement or the predetermined time interval as a unit for the replacement.
    </p>
    <p num="28">According to the present invention, since the intervals of re-detection of the base line error amount, i.e., a certain number of sensitive plates or a certain time period as a unit is set to be variable, the base line amount can be suppressed to an allowable value or less without greatly decreasing the throughput.</p>
    <p num="29">When the first and second marks are arranged apart from each other on the fiducial mark plate on the plate stage such that the first and second marks are simultaneously detected by the first and second mark detecting means, a base line check can be performed in a very short period of time with high precision.</p>
    <p num="30">When the intervals at which a base line error amount is re-detected is set to be longer near the end of an exposure operation than at the start time of the exposure operation, the base line amount of an alignment system in which a change in the drift amount of the base line amount after the start time of the exposure operation tends to be gradually reduced can be suppressed to an allowable value or less without decreasing the throughput.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="32">An embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 1 shows the arrangement of a projection exposure apparatus of this embodiment.
      <br/>
      The same reference numerals in FIG. 1 denote the same parts as in FIG. 16. Two reticle marks 3A and 3B for alignment are set outside a pattern area 12, on a reticle R, on which a circuit pattern to be exposed is formed.
      <br/>
      The reticle marks 3A and 3B are located to oppose each other.
      <br/>
      An alignment system 5A of the TTR (through the reticle) scheme is arranged above one reticle mark 3A through a mirror 4A.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a TTR alignment system 5B is arranged above the other reticle mark 3B through a mirror 4B.
      <br/>
      The reticle R is held on a reticle stage 2.
      <br/>
      The reticle stage 2 is driven by a driving system (not shown) to translate (in the X and Y directions) and rotate the reticle R within a two-dimensional plane.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In an exposure operation, a pattern of the reticle R is projected/exposed on each shot area of a wafer (substrate) W on a wafer stage (substrate stage) 6 through a projection optical system PL.
      <br/>
      In one TTR alignment system 5A above the reticle R, images of the reticle mark 3A and a mark in the projection field of the projection optical system PL are formed on the imaging surface of an image pickup element 14A for the Y direction and on the imaging surface of an image pickup element 15A for the X direction by an objective lens 13A through the mirror 4A.
      <br/>
      Part of the light from the objective lens 13A is also incident on a light-receiving element 16A.
      <br/>

      Since the photosensitivity of a resist layer on the wafer W with respect to a red laser beam is weak, a wafer mark near each shot area of the wafer W can be detected by using the red laser beam even while an exposure is performed with respect to the wafer W. In addition, in this TTL wafer alignment system, the two alignment systems based on different mark detection principles and constituted by the LSA light-transmission system 35Y and the LIA light-transmission system 36Y are incorporated, and the two alignment systems can be selectively used.

      Such an arrangement is disclosed in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,151,750, and hence will be briefly described here.

      The red laser beam from the He--Ne laser source 56 is split by a beam splitter 57.

      <br/>
      In FIG. 5, the shutter 58 is closed, but the shutter 59 is open.
      <br/>
      The laser beam passing through an optical path opened by the shutter 59 is incident on the light-transmission system 36Y of the LIA (two light beam interference alignment) scheme.
      <br/>
      The LIA light-transmission system 36Y splits the supplied laser beam into two laser beams and outputs the two laser beams upon setting a predetermined frequency difference therebetween using an acousto-optic modulation element or the like.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 5, the two laser beams emerging from the LIA light-transmission system 36Y are aligned parallel to each other in a direction perpendicular to the surface of FIG. 5.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The two laser beams are reflected by a mirror 60 and a half mirror 61.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, each laser beam is split into two light beams by a beam splitter 62.
      <br/>
      The two laser beams reflected by the beam splitter 62 cross each other at an aperture portion of a stop 65 on a plane conjugate to the wafer W by an objective lens 64.
      <br/>
      The two laser beams transmitted through the stop 65 are reflected by the mirror 33Y to be incident on the projection optical system PL.
      <br/>
      For example, the two laser beams emerging from the projection optical system PL cross each other again at a position near the fiducial mark 40Y for interference between two beams, formed on the large fiducial mark plate 17 in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In the area where these two laser beams cross each other, one-dimensional interference fringes are formed.
      <br/>
      The interference fringes flow in the pitch direction (the Y direction in this case) of the interference fringes at a speed corresponding to the frequency difference between the two laser beams.
      <br/>
      In this case, the fiducial mark 40Y is a diffraction grating parallel to the interference fringes, and interference beat light whose intensity changes at a beat frequency corresponding to the frequency difference between the two laser beams is reflected from the fiducial mark 40Y.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      If the pitch of the diffraction grating of the fiducial mark 40Y and the pitch of the interference fringes are set to have a predetermined relationship, the resulting interference beat light beams are reflected by the large fiducial mark plate 17 vertically upward and return to the beam splitter 62 along the two laser beam paths through the projection optical system PL, the mirror 33Y, the stop 65, and the objective lens 64 in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The interference beat light beams transmitted through the beam splitter 62 are incident on the light-receiving element 37Y.
      <br/>
      The light-receiving surface of the light-receiving element 37Y is arranged on a plane almost conjugate to the pupil plane of the projection optical system PL.
      <br/>
      The light-receiving element 37Y is constituted by a plurality of photoelectric conversion elements (photodiodes and the like) separated from each other.
      <br/>
      Interference beat light is received by a photoelectric conversion element located in the center of the light-receiving element 37Y (in the center of the surface conjugate to the pupil plane of the projection optical system PL).
      <br/>
      The obtained photoelectrically converted signal becomes a sinusoidal AC signal having the same frequency as the beat frequency.
      <br/>
      This AC signal is supplied to a phase difference measuring circuit 66.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The two laser beams transmitted through the beam splitter 62 become parallel light beams and cross each other on a transmission type fiducial grating plate 70 through an inverse Fourier transform lens 68 and a mirror 69.

      Therefore, one-dimensional interference fringes are formed on the fiducial grating plate 70, and these interference fringes flow in one direction at a speed corresponding to the beat frequency.
      <br/>
      An interference light beam generated by  +- 1st-order diffracted light generated parallel from the fiducial grating plate 70 or an interference light beam generated by 0th-order light and 2nd-order diffracted light is incident on a light-receiving element 71.
      <br/>
      The intensity of such an interference light beam also changes in the form of a sine-wave at the same frequency as the beat frequency.
      <br/>
      The light-receiving element 71 photoelectrically converts the interference light beam to generate an AC signal having the same frequency as the beat frequency.
      <br/>
      This AC signal is supplied to the phase difference measuring circuit 66.

    <p num="57">
      The phase difference measuring circuit 66 obtains a phase difference  DELTA  PHI (-180 (degree) &lt; PHI  &lt;= 180 (degree) ) between the AC signal from the light-receiving element 71 and the AC signal from the photoelectric conversion element in the center of the light-receiving element 37Y, and supplies information SSB indicating the positional offset amount of the fiducial mark 40Y on the large fiducial mark plate 17 in the Y direction, which information corresponds to the phase difference  DELTA  PHI , to the main control system 50 in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      For example, the resolution of the positional offset amount is about 0.01  MU m. The main control system 50 in FIG. 3 can servo-lock the wafer stage 6 to cause the fiducial mark 40Y of the large fiducial mark plate 17 to always have a predetermined relationship with the fiducial grating plate 70 by servo-controlling the driving system 52 for the wafer stage 6 on the basis of the positional offset information SSB from the TTL alignment system of the LIA scheme.

    <p num="58">Similarly, by using the LIA light-transmission system 36x in FIG. 1, the wafer stage 6 can be servo-locked to cause the fiducial mark 40X of the large fiducial mark plate 17 in FIG. 2A to always have a predetermined relationship with the fiducial grating plate for the X direction.</p>

      Referring to FIG. 5 again, when the shutter 58 is opened, and the shutter 59 is closed, a laser beam is incident on the LSA (laser step alignment) light-transmission system 35Y.

      As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,750, the laser step alignment scheme is a scheme of scanning a mark with respect to slit-like laser spot light extending in a direction perpendicular to a mark detection direction.
      <br/>
      Signals obtained by photoelectrically converting diffracted light or scattered light generated from the mark are sampled in synchronism with up/down pulses which are generated by the laser interferometers 19X and 21Y when the wafer stage 6 is moved to scan the mark.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The laser beam incident on the LSA light-transmission system 35Y is formed into a slit-like beam having a cross-section extending in one direction at the converging point owing to the effects of a beam expander and a cylindrical lens which are incorporated in the light-transmission system 35Y.
      <br/>
      The laser beam having a slit-like cross-section and emerging from the LSA light-transmission system 35Y is incident on the projection optical system PL through the half mirror 61, the beam splitter 62, the objective lens 64, the stop 65, and the mirror 33Y.
      <br/>
      The stop 65 is conjugate to the surface (the surface of the wafer W) of the large fiducial mark plate 17 at the wavelength of a He--Ne laser beam, and the laser beam is focused on the aperture portion of the stop 65 in the form of a slit.
      <br/>
      The beam spot LSP1 of the laser beam generated by the LSA light-transmission system 35Y in FIG. 5 and emerging from the projection optical system PL is formed into a slit-like shape extending in the X direction at a position, within the exposure area of the projection optical system PL, at which the beam spot LSP1 is at rest, as shown in FIG. 2A.

    <p num="61">
      In this case, when the wafer stage 6 is scanned in, the Y direction, and the slit scanning fiducial mark 42Y on the large fiducial mark plate 17 crosses the beam spot LSP1, diffracted light or scattered light is generated from the fiducial mark 42Y.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 5, the generated reflected light such as diffracted light or scattered light is incident on the light-receiving element 37Y through the projection optical system PL, the mirror 33Y, the stop 65, the objective lens 64, and the beam splitter 62.
      <br/>
      The reflected light from the fiducial mark 42Y is photoelectrically converted by the photoelectric conversion elements around the photoelectric conversion element in the center of the light-receiving element 37Y.
      <br/>
      The photoelectrically converted signal is supplied to an LSA processing circuit 67.
      <br/>
      The LSA processing circuit 67 samples the photoelectrically converted signal in response to an up/down pulse signal UDP from the laser interferometer 21Y for the wafer stage 6, converts it into a digital signal, and writes it in a memory.
      <br/>
      The LSA processing circuit 67 calculates the Y-coordinate of the wafer stage 6, at which the central point of the beam spot LSP1 in the Y direction in FIG. 2A is accurately aligned with the central point of the fiducial mark 42Y in the Y direction, on the basis of the waveform of the signal read out from the memory.
      <br/>
      The LSA processing circuit 67 then supplies the Y-coordinate, as mark position information SSA, to the main control system 50 in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The mark position information SSA is also used to drive/control the driving system 52 for the wafer stage 6.

    <p num="62">
      Referring to FIG. 5, the LSA processing circuit 67 incorporates a memory for storing data obtained by sampling the photoelectrically converted signal SSD from the release lens 54A in FIG. 3 in synchronism with the up/down pulse UDP, and a circuit for processing a signal in the memory at high speed.
      <br/>
      The coordinates, of the wafer stage 6, at which the reticle mark 3A is aligned with the conjugate image of the emissive cross mark 41 in FIG. 2A are calculated as projection position information SSC for the reticle mark 3A.

      This projection position information SSC is supplied to the main control system 50.

      <br/>
      The light reflected by the surface of the large fiducial mark plate 17 is incident on the half mirror 72 through the prism mirror 23, the objective lens 24, the mirror 74, and the lens system 73.

      The light reflected by the half mirror 72 is incident on an index plate 75.
      <br/>
      The surface of the index plate 75 is conjugate to the surface of the large fiducial mark plate 17, and an image of the fiducial mark 39 in FIG. 2A is formed on the index plate 75 when a base line amount is measured.
      <br/>
      The illumination light EL has a wavelength of about 300 nm at which the photosensitivity of a resist layer is very low.

      As shown in FIG. 7, the index plate 75 has index marks 78A and 78B, each constituted by four light-shielding lines arranged at predetermined intervals in the X direction and formed on a transparent glass plate, and index marks 79A and 79B, each constituted by four light-shielding lines arranged at predetermined intervals in the Y direction and formed on the transparent glass plate.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 7, an image 39P of the fiducial mark 39 on the large fiducial mark plate 17 is formed in the center of the index plate 75.
      <br/>
      The X-direction positional offset amounts of the image 39P with respect to the index marks 78A and 78B and the Y-direction positional offset amounts of the image 39P with respect to the index marks 79A and 79B indicate the positional offset amount of the fiducial mark 39 with respect to the optical axis of the wafer alignment system 9.

      Referring to FIG. 6, images of the index marks on the index plate 75 and of the fiducial mark 39 on the large fiducial mark plate 17 (or a wafer mark on the wafer W) are formed on the imaging surfaces of the image pickup element 27X for the X direction and the image pickup element 27Y for the Y direction, both of which are constituted by CCDs or the like, through an imaging lens 76 and a half mirror 77.

      In this case, the imaging areas of the image pickup elements 27X and 27Y on the index plate 75 are in an area 80X in the X direction and an area 80Y in the Y direction in FIG. 7, respectively.
      <br/>
      In addition, the main scanning line (horizontal scanning line) directions of the image pickup elements 27X and 27Y are respectively set to directions conjugate to the X and Y directions in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      When imaging signals from the image pickup elements 27X and 27Y are processed by a processing circuit (not shown), the positional offset amount of the index plate 75 with respect to the fiducial mark 39 of the large fiducial mark plate 17 (or the wafer mark of the wafer W) can be obtained.

      In the embodiment, the detection center of the off-axis wafer alignment system 9 on the index plate 75 in the X direction is set at the coordinates of the centers of the index marks 78A and 78B in the X direction in FIG. 7.

      The same applies to the detection center of the wafer alignment system 9 in the Y direction.

    <p num="67">
      A method of positioning the wafer stage 6 of the projection exposure apparatus of the embodiment will be described next.
      <br/>
      According to a conventional projection exposure apparatus, the traveling direction of the wafer stage 6 is determined on the basis of the relative positions of the internal stationary mirrors of the laser interferometers 19X and 21X and the corresponding movable mirrors 18X and 18Y in FIG. 1, which positions are used as absolute coordinates.
      <br/>
      For this reason, if an error is included in the absolute coordinates due to air fluctuations, and coordinate measurement is performed at a position offset from the optical axis AX of the projection optical system PL, the yawing error of the wafer stage 6 increases.
      <br/>
      In addition, when a base line amount is to be measured, the wafer stage 6 must be moved.
      <br/>
      If measurement is repeated several times and the obtained values are averaged to improve the precision, the throughput decreases.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      In contrast to this, in the embodiment, the traveling direction of the wafer stage 6 is set with reference to the large fiducial mark plate 17 in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the reticle R is positioned with reference to the position, of the large fiducial mark plate 17, which is set when the base line amount of the off-axis wafer alignment system 9 is checked.
      <br/>
      In addition, the difference in measurement value between the laser interferometers 19X and 20X serving as yawing sensors is reset to 0.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Errors in measurement of a base line amount (base line check) will be described in detail first with reference to FIGS. 8A to 8C. Referring to 8A, assume that the position of a pattern 81 indicated by the broken line is the fiducial mirror position of each of the movable mirrors 18X and 1BY in FIG. 1, and that the position of a pattern 82 indicated by the solid line is the actual position of each of the movable mirrors 18X and 18Y in an interferometer reset operation.
      <br/>
      Let  THETA  be the inclination of the pattern 82 with respect to the pattern 81, i.e., the yawing error of the interferometer reset operation.
      <br/>
      Laser beams LB1 and LB2 from the laser interferometers 19X and 20X in FIG. 1 are incident on the movable mirror 18X, and a laser beam LB3 from the laser interferometer 21Y in FIG. 1 is incident on the movable mirror 18Y.
      <br/>
      Letting Lx0 and Lf0 be the coordinate values in the X direction measured by the laser interferometers 19X and 20 X, and Ly be the coordinate value in the Y direction measured by the laser interferometer 21Y, an initial coordinate value is set as follows:

Letting L be the distance between the laser beams LB1 and LB2 in the Y direction, and Lx and Lu be the coordinate values in the X direction measured by the laser interferometers 19X and 20X, the following equation is established:</p>

      FIG. 8C shows the relationship between the large fiducial mark plate 17 and the movable mirrors 18X and 18Y at the time of a base line check.

      As shown in FIG. 8C, the large fiducial mark plate 17 has a rotational error of an angle  THETA f with respect to the movable mirror 18X owing to a mounting error.
      <br/>
      This rotational error  THETA f can also be defined as the inclination of a straight line passing the centers of the two fiducial marks 38A and 38B of the large fiducial mark plate 17 with respect to the X axis defined by the movable mirrors 18X and 18Y.

    <p num="74">
      When alignment of the reticle R is to be performed, the two fiducial marks 38A and 38B of the large fiducial mark plate 17 are located near the design conjugate points of the reticle marks 3A and 3B, as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Since the fiducial marks 38A and 38B are illuminated with the illumination light IL from the bottom portions, as shown in FIG. 2A, peripheral portions of the reticle marks 3A and 3B on the reticle R are also illuminated with the illumination light IL.
      <br/>
      First, the position and rotation amount of the reticle R are set such that the reticle marks 3A and 3B are set in a predetermined state with respect to the internal fiducial positions of the TTR alignment systems 5A and 5B.
      <br/>
      In this state, the reticle stage 2 is fixed.
      <br/>
      In this case, two-axis photoelectric microscopes may be arranged in the TTR alignment systems 5A and 5B so that the positions of the reticle marks 3A and 3B may be measured by the photoelectric microscopes with a total of four axes.

    <p num="75">However, owing to the inclination of a straight line connecting the fiducial positions of the TTR alignment systems 5A and 5B with respect to the coordinate axis defined by the movable mirrors 18X and 18Y, the reticle R has a rotational error of an angle  THETA r with respect to the coordinate axis defined by the movable mirrors 18X and 18Y, as shown in FIG. 8C. The rotational error of and the magnification error of the projection optical system PL are obtained by using the TTR alignment systems 5A and 5B in FIG. 1.</p>

      As described above with reference to FIG. 4C, in the TTR alignment system 5A, an X-direction error RAX1 and a Y-direction error RAY between the conjugate image of the fiducial mark 38A and the reticle mark 3A are obtained.
      <br/>
      In the TTR alignment system 5B, an X-direction error RAX2 and a Y-direction error RA THETA  between the conjugate image of the fiducial mark 38B and the reticle mark 3B are obtained.

      Assume that the error RAX1 and the like are converted into values on the wafer stage 6.

      Letting M be the distance between the fiducial marks 38A and 38B, a rotational error Rr of the reticle R with respect to the fiducial marks 38A and 38B of the large fiducial mark plate 17 and a magnification error Rm of the projection optical system PL are given by

      Rr=(RA THETA -RAY)/M
      <br/>
      Rm=(RAX2-RAX1)/M  (1)

    <p num="77">
      In this case, the rotational error  THETA f of the large fiducial mark plate 17 with respect to the coordinate system defined by the movable mirrors 18X and 18Y is measured in advance and is stored as system error data.

      More specifically, in order to measure the rotational error  THETA f, a Y-direction positional offset amount Y1 of the reticle mark 3B with respect to the fiducial mark 38B is measured by the TTR alignment system 5B in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The wafer stage 6 is then moved in the X direction, and a Y-direction positional offset amount Y2 of the reticle mark 3B with respect to the fiducial mark 38A is measured by the TTR alignment system 5B.
      <br/>
      Since the distance between the fiducial marks 38A and 38B is represented by M, the rotational error of is expressed as follows:

      Referring to FIG. 8C, when the rotational error  THETA f and the rotational error Rr based on equations (1) are used, the rotational error  THETA r of the reticle R with respect to the coordinate system defined by the movable mirrors 18X and 18Y is expressed as
      <br/>
      THETA r=Rr- THETA f

    <p num="79">
      Since the traveling direction of the wafer stage 6 can be determined by the angles of the reflecting surfaces of the movable mirrors 18X and 18Y, the rotational error  THETA r can be considered as the rotational error of the reticle R with respect to the traveling direction of the wafer stage 6.
      <br/>
      Assume that orthogonality correction and angle correction are performed with respect to the movable mirrors 18X and 18Y prior to this measurement.
      <br/>
      The traveling direction of the wafer stage 6 is set in accordance with a coordinate system obtained by correcting the coordinate system of the movable mirrors 18X and 18Y by an amount corresponding to the rotational error  THETA f in a software manner.

      If there is a difference (dead path) between the length of an optical path to the internal stationary mirror of the laser interferometer 19X and that of the movable mirror 18X in the reset operation, a change in atmospheric gas temperature alone can change the measurement values, resulting in measurement errors.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the distance to a position where no dead path is present is obtained, and correction is performed such that the measurement values obtained by the laser interferometers 19X, 20X, and 21Y become zero as interferometer values with respect to temperature.

      In step 202, positioning of the wafer stage 6 is performed by the laser step alignment (LSA) scheme.

      Thereafter, the large fiducial mark plate 17 is positioned to the position for a base line check with reference to the positions of the fiducial marks 42X and 42Y.

    <p num="99">An operation of performing alignment of the wafer W by using the off-axis wafer alignment system 9 in FIG. 1 will be described next with reference to FIG. 11.</p>
    <p num="100">FIG. 11 shows wafer marks respectively formed in shot areas 86-1, 86-2, . . . on the wafer W. Referring to FIG. 12, for example, with regard to a shot area 86-5, an X-direction difference  DELTA X between a wafer mark 87X-5 arranged on a side of the shot area in the X direction and a center 88-5 of the shot area, and an y-direction difference  DELTA Y between a wafer mark 87Y-5 arranged on a side of the shot area in the Y direction and the center 88-5 of the shot area are set to predetermined design values.</p>
    <p num="101">
      Referring to FIG. 1, the wafer stage 6 is driven to move the shot area 86-5 of the wafer W to a position below the wafer alignment system 9.
      <br/>
      In this state, in the wafer alignment system 9, an image of the wafer mark 87X-5 is interposed between the index marks 78A and 78B of the index plate 75 in FIG. 7, thus measuring the X-coordinate of the wafer mark 87X-5.

      Thereafter, an image of the wafer mark 87Y-5 is interposed between the index marks 79A and 79B of the index plate 75 in FIG. 7 to measure the Y-coordinate of the wafer mark 87Y-5.
      <br/>
      When a pattern of the reticle R is to be exposed on the shot area 86-5 on the wafer W, the wafer stage 6 is driven to the coordinates determined on the basis of the coordinates of the wafer marks 87X-5 and 87Y-5, the design differences  DELTA X and  DELTA Y, and the base line amounts of the wafer alignment system 9 which are measured in accordance with the above-described procedure.
      <br/>
      As a result, the center 88-5 of the shot area 86-5 is aligned with a conjugate point of the center of the reticle R, i.e., the optical axis  DELTA X of the projection optical system PL.

In addition, assume that the tracks of movement of the TTR alignment systems 5A and 5B are represented by 85A and 85B, and for example, the alignment system 5A is fixed at two points on the track 85A.
      <br/>
      In this case, both Y- and X-direction positioning error widths d2 and d1 of the alignment system 5A with respect to the straight line 84 are set to be several  MU m or less.

      <br/>
      Thereafter, in step 212, the number of wafers to be exposed until the next base line check is set, as an initial value, in a variable N. In step 213, a wafer is loaded on the wafer stage 6.
      <br/>
      Note that if there is an exposed wafer in step 213, a new wafer is loaded after the exposed wafer is unloaded.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      In step 214, it is checked whether the variable N is 0, i.e., whether the timing of a base line check has come.
      <br/>
      If the variable N is larger than 0, 1 is subtracted from the variable N in step 215, and the flow advances to step 216.
      <br/>
      In step 216, after alignment of the wafer is performed by using the off-axis wafer alignment or the TTL wafer alignment system in FIG. 1, a pattern of the reticle R is exposed onto the respective shot areas of the wafer.
      <br/>
      If it is determined in step 223 that exposure to all the wafers (the desired number of wafers) is completed, the exposure process with respect to the reticle R is completed.
      <br/>
      If NO in step 223, the flow returns to step 213 to unload the exposed wafer and load a new wafer.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the flow advances to step 214.

    <p num="108">
      If it is determined in step 214 that N=0, i.e., the timing of a base line check has come, the rotational error and magnification error of the reticle R are measured in step 217.

      This operation is the same as in step 206 in FIG. 10. Thereafter, in step 218, the type of the sensor used for alignment is determined.

      If alignment is used by using a stationary alignment sensor, i.e., the off-axis wafer alignment system 9 or the LIA (two-beam interference alignment scheme) light-transmission systems 36X and 36Y, the flow advances to step 219.

      In this step, an X-direction base line check is performed with respect to the wafer alignment system of the laser step alignment scheme.
      <br/>
      In step 222, a Y-direction base line check is performed with respect to the wafer alignment system of the laser step alignment scheme.

    <p num="110">
      FIG. 14 shows an example of the time intervals at which base line checks are performed in the embodiment.
      <br/>
      These time intervals are suitable for a case wherein a change in the drift amount of the base line amount is gradually reduced over time, as shown in FIG. 15A. Referring to FIG. 14, the abscissa represents the number of wafers to be exposed.
      <br/>
      Since the number of wafers is almost proportional to time, the abscissa may be regarded as a time base axis.
      <br/>
      The ordinate in FIG. 14 represents the drift amount of the base line amount.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment, a base line check is performed at time points S1, S2, S3, . . . as the intervals gradually increase.
      <br/>
      That is, a base line check is performed at short time intervals in an area where a change in drift amount is large, and a base line check is performed at long time intervals in an area where a change in drift amount is small.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the drift amount of the base line amount can be suppressed to an allowable value or less without decreasing the throughput.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      As is apparent, if a change in the drift amount of the base line amount does not show the same tendency as that shown in FIG. 15A, the intervals of base line checks are adjusted accordingly.
      <br/>
      For example, the intervals of base line checks are shortened in an area where a change in drift amount is large, and the intervals of base line checks are prolonged in an area where a change in drift amount is small.
    </p>
    <p num="112">The technique of changing the intervals of base line checks may be applied not only to a projection exposure apparatus using the large fiducial mark plate 17 as shown in FIG. 1 but also to a projection exposure apparatus designed to measure base line amounts by moving a fiducial mark plate as in, for example, the prior art shown in FIG. 16. As described above, the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and various changes and modifications can be made within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
