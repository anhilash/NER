    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The invention relates to a semiconductor memory device, and more particularly, to a reduction in the power dissipation in a self-refresh operation of a dynamic random access memory (DRAM).</p>
    <p num="2">
      A DRAM used in a portable unit such as a personal computer receives power from a storage battery of the portable unit to perform a self-refresh operation to maintain data which has been written to it.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the battery dissipates power to maintain the stored data even when the portable unit is not operating.
      <br/>
      To preserve power enhance the operable time interval of the portable unit, the power dissipation for the self-refresh operation of the DRAM must be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="3">FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of a conventional DRAM 11.</p>
    <p num="4">
      The DRAM 11 includes a plurality of cell blocks, four are shown here, BLK0-BLK3.
      <br/>
      Each of the cell blocks BLK0-BLK3 comprises a memory cell array 12, a row decoder 13, an equalizer 14, a sense amplifier bank 15 and a column decoder 16.
      <br/>
      Only the cell block BLK0 is shown in detail in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The memory cell array 12 comprises a plurality of bit line pairs BL0, /BL0 to BLm, /BLm, a plurality of word lines WL0 to WLn, and a plurality of memory cells C (see FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      Each memory cell C comprises a single transistor and a single capacitor which are connected to an associated intersection of the bit line pairs BL0, /BL0 and the word lines WL0 to Wln.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The row decoder 13 receives an external address EXAdd provided via a switch 17 as an address signal Add and activates one of the word lines WL.
      <br/>
      Assume now that a word line WLi is activated by the row decoder 13 as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The column decoder 16 responds to a column address which is externally supplied to turn on a data bus switch 18 to connect the bit line pair BLi, /BLi to a data bus pair DBi, /DBi.
      <br/>
      Information stored in the memory cell C is read from the bit line BLi, amplified by the sense amp 15, and delivered externally on the data bus pair DBi, /DBi.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A refresh operation will now be described.
      <br/>
      A row control circuit 21 receives a row control signal /RAS and a column control signal /CAS, enters a CBR refresh mode when "CAS before RAS" or CBR condition is detected, which means that the falling edge of the column control signal CAS occurs earlier than that of the row control signal /RAS as shown in FIG. 3, and delivers a control signal M1 to the switch 17 for controlling the CBR refresh operation.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In this mode, the row control circuit 21 delivers a refresh clock signal RCLK to a refresh address counter 22, which counts the clock signal RCLK to generate a refresh address signal IAdd, which is then applied to the switch 17.
      <br/>
      In response to the control signal M1, the switch 17 passes the refresh address signal IAdd from the counter 22 to the row decoder 13 of the respective cell block BLK0-BLK3.
      <br/>
      The row decoder 13 of the cell block BLK0 activates the initial word line WL0 in response to the refresh address signal IAdd.
      <br/>
      The memory cell C connected to the activated word line WL0 is then refreshed.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Specifically, referring to FIG. 2, the sense amp 15 of the cell block BLK0 is activated by an H level power supply PSA and an L level power supply NSA, and when activated, amplifies a signal read from the bit line.
      <br/>
      The memory cell C connected to the activated word line WL0 is refreshed in this manner.
    </p>
    <p num="10">When the memory cell C is refreshed, a reset operation takes place automatically, thus precharging the bit line.</p>
    <p num="11">Specifically, the row control circuit 21 delivers an equalize signal EQ of an H level to the equalizer circuit 14, which is supplied with a precharge signal PR of a given potential (which may be equal to one-half Vdd, for example) from a bit line precharge circuit 23, where Vdd is a power supply used to operate various circuits.</p>
    <p num="12">
      As shown in FIG. 2, the equalizer circuit 14 comprises a pair of N-channel MOS transistors connected between the bit line pair BLi, /BLi, with the equalize signal EQ being applied to the gates of the transistors and the precharge signal PR being applied to the node between the transistors.
      <br/>
      In response to the equalize signal EQ of the H level, the equalizer circuit 14 precharges the bit line pair BLi, /BLi to the potential of the precharge signal PR (which is one-half Vdd).
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      A self-refresh mode is entered after a given time interval has passed from when the memory cell C connected to the initial word line WL0 of the cell block BLK0 is refreshed in the CBR refresh mode.
      <br/>
      In the self-refresh operation, a memory cell C connected to a word line located next to the word line having the refreshed memory cell connected to it (i.e., the second word line WL1 of the cell block BLK0) is similarly refreshed.
      <br/>
      When a memory cell C connected to the last word line Wln of the cell block BLK0 has been refreshed, the refresh operation for all the memory cells C in the cell block BLK0 is completed.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Subsequently, the word lines of the cell block BLK1 are successively activated to refresh the connected memory cells.
      <br/>
      In a similar manner, the memory cells C in the cell blocks BLK2 and BLK3 are refreshed.
      <br/>
      When the refresh operation for the memory cell C connected to the last word line of the cell block BLK3 is completed, the count value of the refresh address counter shown in FIG. 1 is reset, returning to the initial refresh address or delivering the refresh address signal IAdd for the word line WL0 of the cell block BLK0.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Salvaging of a defect in the memory cell C will now be described.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, the DRAM 11 also comprises a redundancy decision circuit 24, and the memory cell array 12 includes a redundant word line RWL, which is connected to a redundant word line drive circuit 25 in the row decoder 13.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      An address of a defective cell which was previously detected by a test, is stored within the redundancy decision circuit 24, which determines whether the address Add from the switch 17 coincides with the stored defective address and delivers a redundancy control signal ROM to the row decoder 13.
      <br/>
      By way of example, assume that the circuit 24 delivers a redundancy control signal ROM having an H level for the coincidence between the defective address and the address Add.
      <br/>
      In response to the high redundancy control signal ROM, the row decoder 13 does not activate a word line which was chosen in accordance with the address Add.
      <br/>
      The redundant word line drive circuit 25 activates the redundant word line RWL in response to the redundancy control signal ROM.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, a read/write access as well as a refresh operation take place with respect to a memory cell C connected to the redundant word line RWL rather than with respect to the memory cell C connected to the word line at the defective address.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The current consumed during the refresh operation (or refresh current) comprises a DC current component representing a steady-state consumption and an AC current component representing a consumption during the memory cell refresh operation.
      <br/>
      The DC component represents the consumption by the bit line precharge circuit 23 and the refresh address counter 22, while the AC component represents the current required for driving the word line WLi and an operating current of the sense amp 15.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      However, it should be noted that if a defective location is replaced by a redundant memory cell which allows a normal read/write operation through an address conversion, this does not physically remove the current consumed by the defective location.
      <br/>
      That is, there is a current flow through the defective location, which increases the DC component.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As shown in FIG. 5, suppose that there is an electrical short circuit across a word line WL and a bit line BL.
      <br/>
      The sense amp 15 connected to the bit line BL is supplied with the precharge signal PR from the bit line precharge circuit 23, whereby the bit line BL is precharged to one-half Vdd.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the word line WL is connected to a word line drive circuit 26 and is set to a low potential (a ground potential), when it is not activated.
      <br/>
      Thus, there occurs a steady-state leak current from the bit line BL to the word line WL, as indicated by an arrow.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Defective locations usually occur in a random manner, and the number of such locations increases with an increase in the integration level of memory cells and the sophistication of the fabrication process.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, the power dissipation during the self-refresh operation increases by an amount corresponding to the steady-state current flow through the defective location or locations, thus increasing power consumption.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Japanese Unexamined Patent Application No.5-128858 discloses a method for reducing a current flow through a defective location.
      <br/>
      In the method, the bit line is precharged at one-half Vdd level immediately before the read operation and is maintained at the ground potential except for during the read operation, to reduce a defective current.
      <br/>
      However, the method requires placing all the bit lines at the ground potential when the refresh operation takes place for all the word lines of the memory cell array inclusive of both non-defective and defective locations.
      <br/>
      This means that the precharge-ground potential (discharge) process takes place even for the refresh operation for a defect-free normal address, and this wasteful operation increases the AC current component, leading to an increase in the power dissipation.
      <br/>
      In addition, the disposition of a circuit which establishes a ground potential on the bit line pairs and a ground potential line connected to the circuit within the memory array increases the chip area.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Japanese Unexamined Patent Application No. 8-203268 discloses another method which eliminates a leak current path caused by a cross-line defect between a word line and a bit line by maintaining the bit line in a floating state when the memory cell is not accessed.
      <br/>
      By setting the bit line in a floating state, any charge which remains on the bit line is restored to the precharged level, so that an increase in the AC current component is prevented when a control is exercised uniformly for all addresses, irrespective of whether they are non-defective or defective.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      However, the second method is not practicable.
      <br/>
      In a DRAM in particular, a charge of a minimal quantity stored in a capacitor which is made as small as possible is applied to a bit line as information for a memory cell, and a minimal amplitude on the bit line is differentially amplified.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if the bit line is floating, noise generated in the substrate or opposing electrodes of a memory cell having increased capacitances may cause the bit line to have an unexpected value due to an electrostatic coupling, and in worst cases, may change the content stored in the cell storage capacitor and thus destroy the information.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      It may be contemplated, as modifications of the above method, that only a defective bit line be controlled from its precharge level to the ground level or be made floating.
      <br/>
      However, this requires the provision of a wiring for all of the bit lines which supply a control signal or of fuses to allow disconnection, and thus requiring a substantial increase in the chip area.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="29">In the drawings, like numerals are used for like elements throughout.</p>
    <p num="30">
      FIG. 6 is a schematic block diagram of a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) 31 according to one embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The DRAM 31 comprises four cell blocks BLK0-BLK3, each of which includes a memory cell array 12 and an access control circuit including a low decoder 13, an equalizer circuit 14, a sense amplifier bank 15 and a column decoder 16 (see FIG. 1).
    </p>
    <p num="31">The DRAM 31 of the present embodiment includes eight row addresses, and is externally supplied with a row address signal RA, which is provided via a row address buffer 32 to supply address signals Add (A7 to A0) to the cell blocks BLK0-BLK3.</p>
    <p num="32">
      Each of the cell blocks BLK0-BLK3 includes 64 word lines WL0-Wln (n=64) and a redundant word line RWL.
      <br/>
      One of the cell blocks BLK0-BLK3 is selected by address signals A7, A6, and one of the word lines WL0-Wln in the selected cell block is selected by address signals A5-A0.
      <br/>
      A read/write operation is normally performed to a memory cell C located at the point of intersection between the selected single word line WL and the selected bit line pair BLi, /BLi.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      A refresh address signal IAdd is supplied from a refresh address counter 22 to each of the cell blocks BLK0-BLK3.
      <br/>
      The refresh address signal IAdd functions in a manner similar to the address signal RA, which is externally supplied to the cell blocks BLK0-BLK3, and hence the same address signals A7 to A0 will be used in the following description.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      One of the cell blocks BLK0-BLK3 is selected by address signals A7, A6, and either one of the plurality of word lines WL0-Wln or the redundant word line RWL is activated by address signals A5-A0, in the same manner as done in normal operation.
      <br/>
      This selection between the word lines WL0-Wln and the redundant word line RWL is performed in accordance with the redundancy control signal ROM supplied from the redundancy decision circuit 24 to the row decoder 13 (or redundant word line drive circuit 25).
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      A defective address previously detected by a test is stored in the redundancy decision circuit 24, which determines if the address signal Add coincides with the defective address, and generates the redundancy control signal ROM based on a result of such decision to the row decoder 13.
      <br/>
      For example, when the address signal Add coincides with the defective address, the redundancy decision circuit 24 generates a high redundancy control signal ROM.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The row decoder 13 activates the redundant word line RWL in response to the redundancy control signal ROM having the H level, and activates a word line WLi corresponding to the address signal Add in response to the redundancy control signal ROM having the L level.
      <br/>
      The plurality of memory cells C connected to the activated word line WLi (or the redundant word line RWL) are thus refreshed.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The DRAM 31 includes a plurality of block control circuits 33a-33d corresponding to the respective cell blocks BLK0-BLK3.
      <br/>
      The block control circuits 33a-33d supply precharge signals PR0-PR3 each having a predetermined level (one-half the supply voltage Vdd) to the cell blocks BLK0-BLK3, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      A refresh address signal IAdd is provided to each of the block control circuits 33a-33d from a refresh address counter 22.
      <br/>
      Block selection information associated with the cell blocks BLK0-BLK3 is stored in the block control circuits 33a-33d.
      <br/>
      The block control circuits 33a-33d control the level of the precharged signal PR0-PR3 supplied to the respective cell blocks BLK0-BLK3 in accordance with the address signal IAdd and the block selection information.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      More specifically, each of the cell blocks BLK0-BLK3 which contains a defective address, as determined previously by a test, stores "controlled" block selection information.
      <br/>
      A defective address referred to herein represents an address where a cross-line defect is present to cause an electrical short circuit across a bit line and a word line, and a cell block which contains such a defective address exhibits a greater current consumption than the remaining cell blocks which do not contain a defective address.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The block control circuits 33a-33d control the level of the precharge signal PRi supplied to any cell block BLKi (i=0 to 3) containing a defective address in accordance with the block selection information.
      <br/>
      More specifically, each of the block control circuit 33a-33d sets a level for the precharge signal PRi which is equal to the reset level of the word line WLi.
      <br/>
      This reduces the current flow through the cross-line defect across the bit line pair BL, BL and the word line WLi to zero, thus reducing the current consumption.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      For any cell block BLKi which does not contain a defective address, each of the block control circuits 33a-33d stores "non-controlled" block selection information.
      <br/>
      Each of the block control circuits 33a-33d supplies the precharge control signal PRi having a given level (one-half Vdd) to any cell block BLKi for which the "non-controlled" block selection information is stored.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the current consumption or power dissipation is reduced by an amount which accrues from avoiding a charge-discharge process as compared with the prior art where the precharge signal is controlled for all of the bit lines.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      When a plurality of cell blocks contain a defective address, the "controlled" information may be set for the all or part of these cell blocks.
      <br/>
      In the partial "controlled" information setting, the information is preferably set to the cell block where many defective addresses are included.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, "controlled" information may be set to the cell block where a great amount of current is consumed based on the value of defect currents determined by a test.
      <br/>
      The value of defect currents are defined as a difference between the current consumption of a cell block which does not contain a defective address and the current consumption of a cell block containing such a defect.
    </p>
    <p num="43">Each of the block control circuits 33a-33d comprises a clamp address decision circuit 34a-34d, a precharge control circuit 35a-35d and a block selection circuit 36a-36d.</p>
    <p num="44">
      Each of the clamp address decision circuits 34a-34d receives the refresh address signal IAdd and provides an address decision signal CLMPAddi (i=0 to 3) to each of the precharge control circuits 35a-35d at a timing depending on the activation of the cell blocks BLK0-BLK3.
      <br/>
      Each of the precharge control circuits 35a-35d outputs a precharge signal PR0-PR3 having a read reference level of the sense amp 15 in response to an address decision signal CLMPAddi having an L level and outputs a precharge signal PR0-PR3 having a reset level (i.e., a ground level) of the word line Wli in response to an address decision signal CLMPAddi having an H level.
      <br/>
      While the read reference level is set to one-half the supply voltage Vdd in the present embodiment, this level may be changed as desired.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Specifically, as shown in FIG. 7, when the last word line Wln of the cell block BLK3, which is activated prior to the corresponding cell block BLK0, is activated, the clamp address decision circuit 34a outputs an address decision signal CLMPAdd0 having an L level.
      <br/>
      Similarly, when the last word line Wln of the respective cell blocks BLK0, BLK1 and BLK2, which are activated prior to the respective corresponding cell blocks BLK1, BLK2 and BLK3, is activated, the clamp address decision circuits 34b, 34c and 34d output address decision signals CLMPAdd1, CLMPAdd2 and CLMPAdd3 each having an L level, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The clamp address decision circuit 34a also outputs an address decision signal CLMPAddO having an H level when the corresponding cell block BLK0 is deactivated.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the clamp address decision circuits 34b, 34c and 34d output address decision signals CLMPAdd1, CLMPAdd2 and CLMPAdd3 each having an H level, respectively, when their corresponding cell blocks BLK1, BLK2 and BLK3 are deactivated.

      By controlling the level of the precharge signal PR0-PR3 with such timing, the current consumption is reduced without retarding the precharge operation of the memory cell C. In this manner, the memory cell C in the activated cell block BLK0-BLK3 is refreshed in accordance with the precharge signal PR0-PR3 having a level equal to one-half Vdd.

      Accordingly, a refresh operation takes place rapidly by supplying the precharge signal PR0-PR3 of the level equal to one-half Vdd before each cell block BLK0-BLK3 is activated.

      In this mode, the row control circuit 21 provides a refresh clock signal RCLK to the refresh address counter 22, which then counts the clock signal RCLK and generates a refresh address signal IAdd, which is provided to the row decoders 13 of the cell blocks BLK0-BLK3.

      <br/>
      Accordingly, by choosing one of the test signals TEST0-TEST3 to be an H level while choosing the others to have an L level and sequentially changing the test signals, the current consumption of the cell blocks BLK0-BLK3 is measured when the precharge level is controlled.
      <br/>
      The current consumption may be called a first current value Icc2SRD0-Icc2SRD3.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      Subsequently, test signals TEST0-TEST3 having the ground level are supplied from the testing equipment, and the resulting current consumption is determined, which may be referred to as a second current value Icc2SRE.
      <br/>
      By determining the difference between the first current value Icc2SRD0-Icc2SRD3 and the second current value Icc2SRE, the magnitude of any defect current which may be present within each cell block BLK0-BLK3 can be determined.

    <p num="79">Block selection information to be stored in each block selection circuit 36a-36d may be determined on the basis of the results of tests and the results of normal detection of defective memory cells, and either the first fuse F1 or the second fuse F2 in each block selection circuit 36a-36d may be broken in accordance with the determined information.</p>

      In the probing test mentioned above, where there are a plurality of cell blocks which contain cross-line defects, a fuse or fuses in the block selection circuits 36a-36d are sequentially broken beginning with the cell block which contains the maximum defect current on the basis of the test result.

      If all four of the cell blocks contain defect currents, the first fuse F1 of all of the block selection circuits 36a-36d will be broken.

      Although the number of the charge-discharge processes applied to the bit line pair BLi, /BLi on the basis of the precharge signals PR0-PR3 will increase, causing an increase in the current consumption, the power dissipation of the DRAM 31, inclusive of an increase in the current consumption, and a reduction in the defect current can be controlled within a predetermined value.

    <p num="81">
      It is to be noted that if the first fuses F1 of all of the block selection circuits 36a-36d are actually broken, the self-refresh currents of the cell blocks BLK0-BLK3 are reduced to a significant degree.

      One cycle of the refresh operation takes about 100 ns, requiring a total time of 25.6  MU s for all of 256 word lines.

      The refresh time of 2 ms includes an active interval of the refresh operation and a standby interval, the greater proportion of which essentially comprises the standby interval.
      <br/>
      The number of times that a single block is precharged from Vss level to one-half Vdd level is only once among all of the refresh times, which means that such times of precharging the blocks is equal to only four, and this does not cause any significant increase in the current consumption.

      <br/>
      As a consequence, the levels between the bit line pair BL, /BL and the word line WL are coincident and a defective current does not flow through the cross-line defect, thus reducing a current flow due to process errors and thus reducing the power dissipation during the self-refresh operation.

      <br/>
      As a consequence, when each cell block BLK0-BLK3 is activated, the bit line pair BL, /BL assumes the precharge level, allowing a rapid refresh operation without causing a timing offset.
