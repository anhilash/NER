    <p num="2">The present invention relates to packaging and in particular to a container forming apparatus and method.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Form, fill and seal packaging machines to form fluid filled containers from a tube of flexible packaging material are known in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,747,253 to Schulte discloses an apparatus for the proportion of the contents during the manufacture of packing containers.
      <br/>
      The apparatus includes a filling tube extending into a tube of laminated packaging material to deliver milk into the tube of packaging material.
      <br/>
      A sealing mechanism below the filling tube forms transverse seals across the tube of packaging material to divide the tube of packaging material into individual cushion-shaped packing containers.
      <br/>
      Cuts are then formed along the seals to separate the individual packing containers.
      <br/>
      A gas feed pipe is connected to the filling tube to introduce gas into the tube of packaging material to express air before the individual packing containers are formed so that introduced gas is trapped in each packing container as it is formed.
      <br/>
      The amount of gas introduced into the tube of packaging material is the same as the volume of the air space provided in the individual packing containers.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, gas and/or air in the packing container tends to decrease product life.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      An alternative apparatus to form fluid filled containers is disclosed in International Application No. PCT/CA96/00783 published on Jun. 5, 1997 under publication No. WO 97/19852 for an invention entitled "Container With Dispensing Spout and Method for Making Same" and assigned to the assignee of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Each fluid filled container formed by the apparatus includes a body defining an internal reservoir and a narrow, integral dispensing spout extending from the body.
      <br/>
      The apparatus includes a filling tube extending into a tube of packaging material to delivery fluid into the tuber of packaging material.
      <br/>
      A heat sealing mechanism having upstream and downstream heat sealing bars forms spaced, curvilinear heat seals across the tube of packaging material defining opposed sides of a container.
      <br/>
      A fluid displacement mechanism in the form of a cylindrical bar is associated with each heat sealing bar.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In operation, a heat seal is initially formed at the bottom of the tube of packaging material allowing fluid to be delivered into the tube of packaging material via the filling tube.
      <br/>
      The fluid level in the tube of packaging material is set above the heat sealing bars to that when the curvilinear seals are formed across the tube of packaging material, the resulting containers are filled with fluid and void of air or other gasses.
      <br/>
      Once fluid has been delivered to the tube of packaging material, the fluid displacement mechanism associated with the downstream heat sealing bar is brought into contact with the tube of packaging material to displace fluid upwardly.
      <br/>
      The downstream heat sealing bar is then brought into contact with the tube of packaging material to form a heat seal thereacross through the fluid in the tube of packaging material.
      <br/>
      The heat seal is then cut to separate the container from the tube of packaging material.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Thereafter, the fluid displacement mechanism associated with the upstream heat sealing bar is brought into contact with the tube of packaging material to displace fluid upwardly.
      <br/>
      The upstream heat sealing bar is then brought into contact with the tube of packaging material to form a heat seal thereacross and the heat seal is cut to separate the container from the tube of packaging material.
      <br/>
      Once this has been done, the tube of packaging material is indexed and the process is performed again to form successive, alternatively oriented, interlocked, fluid filled containers.
      <br/>
      The fluid displacement mechanisms displace sufficient fluid prior to forming the heat seals so that the containers can be made self-supporting and so that the volume of fluid in each container is generally less than or equal to the volume of the reservoir.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the spouts can be devoid of fluid allowing the spouts to be folded over and releasably attached to the bodies.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Although this container forming apparatus overcomes problems associated with conventional container forming apparatuses by forming fluid filled containers devoid of air or other gasses, which extends product life, improvements to container forming apparatuses are continually being sought.</p>
    <p num="8">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a novel container forming apparatus and method.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of forming fluid filled containers from a tube of flexible packaging material comprising the steps of:</p>
    <p num="10">
      delivering fluid to said tube;
      <br/>
      forming seals across said tube at spaced locations between which fluid is located, said seals being formed in a downstream to upstream succession and being non-orthogonal with respect to a longitudinal axis of said tube; and
      <br/>
      supporting said tube in a direction generally orthogonal to said longitudinal axis adjacent said seals as each seal is being formed.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a container forming apparatus to form fluid filled containers from a tube of flexible packaging material comprising:
      <br/>
      a fluid delivery conduit to delivery fluid into said tube;
      <br/>
      a heat sealing mechanism receiving said tube and forming spaced seals across said tube between which fluid is located, said seals being formed in a downstream to upstream succession and being non-orthogonal with respect to a longitudinal axis of said tube; and
      <br/>
      hydraulic equalization supports associated with said heat sealing mechanism to support said tube in directions generally orthogonal to said longitudinal axis adjacent said seals as each seal is being formed.
    </p>
    <p num="12">The present invention provides advantages in that since the tube is supported in a direction generally orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the tube as the curvilinear seals are being formed, the hydraulic forces applied to the tube are equalized allowing high integrity seals to be formed and inhibiting the shape of the containers from being distorted.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="14">
      Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, a container forming and delivery system is shown and is generally indicated to by reference numeral 30.
      <br/>
      As can be seen, system 30 includes a container forming apparatus 32 mounted on a frame assembly 34 and receiving a web of flexible packaging material unwound from a roll (not shown).
      <br/>
      The roll of packaging material is supported on a motor driven shaft (not shown) rotated to deliver packaging material to the container forming apparatus 32 to form individual containers.
      <br/>
      Container forming apparatus 32 is generally of the form, fill and seal type and is operable to form individual fluid filled containers 40 from the web of packaging material.
      <br/>
      A diverter 42 is positioned below the container forming apparatus 32 and delivers formed containers 40 to carriers 44 disposed on a conveyor system 46.
      <br/>
      The conveyor system 46 transports laden carriers 44 to a heat sealing station 48 where the containers 40 are made self-supporting.
      <br/>
      From station 48, the conveyor system 46 transports the containers 40 to an unloading station 50 where the containers are removed from the carriers 44.
      <br/>
      The conveyor system 46 then returns the empty carriers 44 to the diverter 42.
      <br/>
      Further details of the system 30 will now be described.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The conveyor system 46 includes an endless delivery belt 60 wound around head and tail pulleys 62 and 64 respectively.
      <br/>
      The delivery belt 60 is disposed below and extends from the diverter 42 to the unloading station 50.
      <br/>
      An endless return belt 66 is also wound around head and tail pulleys 68 and 70 respectively and is positioned beneath the delivery belt 60.
      <br/>
      Elevator 72 and 74 are positioned at each end of the conveyor system 46.
      <br/>
      Elevator 72 transports carriers 44 from the delivery belt 60 at the unloading station 50 to the return belt 66 while elevator 74 transports carriers on the return belt 66 to the delivery belt 60 adjacent the diverter 42.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The container forming apparatus 32 includes a tube forming station 80 receiving the web of packaging material and folding and sealing the web to form an open tube, a tube spreading and filling station 82 to delivery fluid to the tube of packaging material and to spread the tube of packaging material prior to sealing, a container forming station 84 to form spaced seals across the tube of packaging material to form individual fluid filled containers 40 and a drive mechanism 86 to synchronize operation of the tube forming station 80, tube spreading and filling station and container forming station 84.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The tube forming station 80 receives the web of packaging material unwound from the roll and includes a folding plate 90 over which the web of packaging material is drawn to fold the web of packaging material over itself.
      <br/>
      A pair of guide rollers 94 are positioned adjacent the bottom of the folding plate 90 and contact opposite sides of the folded web.
      <br/>
      The rollers 94 pull the free edges of the web of packaging material together to inhibit the web from traveling.
      <br/>
      The folded web of packaging material is then fed to a heat sealing mechanism 100 designed to heat seal the free edges of the folded web of packaging material thereby to form a tube.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The heat sealing mechanism 100 includes a vertical heat sealing bar 102 on one side of the web and a corresponding backing plate 104 on the other side of the web.
      <br/>
      The heat sealing bar 102 and backing plate 104 are aligned with the free edges of the web of packaging material.
      <br/>
      The heat sealing bar 102 is mounted on a support 106 secured to a cam driven shaft 108 forming part of drive mechanism 86.
      <br/>
      The backing plate 104 is also mounted on a support 114 secured to a cam driven shaft 116 forming part of drive mechanism 86.
      <br/>
      The drive mechanism 86 is actuable to reciprocate the heat sealing bar 102 and backing plate 104 between retracted inoperative positions where they are spaced apart and extended operative positions where they are in contact with the web of packaging material trapped therebetween.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Below the heat sealing mechanism 100 is a pair of driven, rubber pull rollers 122 and 124 respectively contacting opposite sides of the tube of packaging material.
      <br/>
      The pull roller 122 is mounted on the frame assembly 34 and is in a fixed position.
      <br/>
      The pull roller 124 is secured to a piston 126 extending from a cylinder 128 of a pneumatic drive 130 and is biased towards pull roller 122 so that the tube of packaging material is grabbed by the pull rollers allowing it to be advanced.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The tube filling and spreading station 82 (best seen in FIG. 3) includes a filling tube 140 having an inlet (not shown) receiving fluid to be packaged and an outlet 142 extending into the tube of packaging material to deliver fluid into the tube.
      <br/>
      A tube spreading device 150 is attached to the filling tube 140 and includes a single prong member 152 mounted to the filling tube 140 by way of a swivel joint 154 positioned adjacent the mid-point of the prong member.
      <br/>
      Thus, the swivel joint 154 allows the prong member 152 to swing in a plane generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tube of packaging material between inoperative retracted conditions and operative extended conditions.
      <br/>
      The prong member 152 is balanced so that its upstream and downstream ends remain generally equally spaced from the interior of the tube of packaging material in the inoperative condition.
      <br/>
      A stationary guide 155 is also mounted on the filling tube 140 diametrically opposite the prong member 152.
      <br/>
      The guide 155 has an outer guide surface 157 extending downwardly to the container forming station 84.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Positioned exterior of the tube of packaging material adjacent the upstream end of the prong member 152 is a pneumatic cylinder 156.
      <br/>
      The cylinder 156 includes a piston 158 which can be extended to contact the tube of packaging material and hence the upstream end of the prong member 152 causing the prong member to pivot about the swivel joint 154.
      <br/>
      When the prong member 152 is pivoted in this manner, its downstream end contacts the tube of packaging material.
      <br/>
      When the tube of packaging material is contacted by the prong member 152, the tube of packaging material is pulled against the guide surface 157 and is spread in a transverse direction making the tube of packaging material more elliptical when viewed in top plan.
      <br/>
      The prong member 152 and guide 155 are arranged so that the major axis of the spread tube of packaging material extends in the same direction as the longitudinal axes of the containers 40 being formed.
      <br/>
      This helps to reduce the occurrence of creases in the seals formed across the tube of packaging material by the container forming station 84.
      <br/>
      When the prong member 152 is in the inoperative position, the tube spreading device 150 allows the tube of packaging material to be indexed by the pull rollers 122 and 124 while avoiding "hang ups" from occurring.
      <br/>
      Further details of the tube spreading device are described in Applicant's co-pending application filed on even data for an invention entitled "Tube Spreading Device", the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

    <p num="22">
      The container forming station 84 forms spaced heat seals across the tube of packaging material defining opposed sides of a container.
      <br/>
      The heat seals are configured so that successive containers 40 formed from the tube of packaging material are alternately oriented and interlocked to reduce packaging material waste (see FIG. 16).
      <br/>
      Each container 40 (best seen in FIG. 2) includes a body 40a defining an internal reservoir and an integral, narrow dispensing spout 40b extending from the body.
      <br/>
      The spout 40b tapers towards its distal end.
      <br/>
      Opposed projections (not shown) are formed on the internal wall of the spout 40b adjacent the juncture between the reservoir and the spout.
      <br/>
      The projections and the dimensions of the spout 40b give an individual control over the velocity of out-flowing fluid.
      <br/>
      Further details of the container can be found in Applicant's PCT application No. PCT/CA96/00783 filed on Nov. 28, 1996, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

      Referring now to FIGS. 4 to 7, the container forming station 84 is better illustrated.
      <br/>
      As can be seen, the container forming station includes upper and lower heat sealing bars 200 positioned to one side of the tube of packaging material.
      <br/>
      The heat sealing bars 200 are curvilinear and when moved to their extended positions contact the tube of packaging material to form seals thereacross through the fluid.
      <br/>
      Each heat sealing bar 200 is mounted on a support 202 secured to cam driven shafts 204 forming part of the drive mechanism 86.

    <p num="24">
      As can be seen in FIG. 9a, each heat sealing bar 200 is generally in the shape of a "lazy S" having upper and lower arms 200a and 200b respectively joined by a bridge 200c.
      <br/>
      Bulges 200d are provided at the turns and define the opposed projections within the spouts 40b of the containers 40.

      The angled faces 222 generally have a slope of between about 0 to 5 degrees.
      <br/>
      A plurality of parallel spaced, shallow V-shaped channels 226 are formed in each angled face 222 and extend the length of the heat sealing bar 200 (see FIG. 9b).
      <br/>
      The channels 226 are approximately 0.015 inches deep.

      <br/>
      The upper opening 406 of each chute 402 flares outwardly to catch falling containers 40.

    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The operation of the container forming and delivery system 30 will now be described.
      <br/>
      As the web material is unwound from the roll by rotating the motor driven shaft, the web material is delivered to the folding plate 90.
      <br/>
      The web is then pulled over the folding plate 90 which folds the web over itself.
      <br/>
      The folded web is then pulled together by the rollers 94 before being conveyed to the heat sealing station 100.
      <br/>
      At the heat sealing station, the heating sealing bar 102 and backing plate 104 are brought together by the drive mechanism 86 to sandwich the folded web and form a seal along the free edges of the folded web thereby to form a tube.
      <br/>
      The heat sealing bar 102 and backing plate 104 are then retracted by the drive mechanism 86 allowing the tube of packaging material to be indexed by the pull rollers 122 and 124.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      After the tube of packaging material has been advanced and assuming that a seal has been formed across the bottom of the tube of packaging material, fluid is delivered into the tube via the filling tube 140 to partially fill the tube.
      <br/>
      The air cylinder 156 of the tube spreading device 150 is then actuated by the drive mechanism 86 to spread the tube so that it takes generally a more elliptical shape.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the lower sealing clamp 250 and lower backing plate 306 are extended by the drive mechanism 86 to clamp the fluid filled tube.
      <br/>
      The hydraulic equalization bar 264 on the support 252, which is generally in line with the upper arm of the curvilinear seal at the end of the tube of packaging material, supports the tube of packaging material in a direction generally orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the tube of packaging material.
      <br/>
      The hydraulic equalization bar 264 is dimensioned so that it displaces fluid in the tube of packaging material upwardly above the lower sealing clamp 250 and backing plate 306.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the amount of fluid held in the tube of packaging material between the seal at the bottom of the tube and the lower sealing clamp and backing plate is set to the desired amount so that each container has the proper fluid content.
      <br/>
      The desired amount of displaced fluid is set so that only the reservoir of each container 40 is filled with fluid creating a vacuum in the spout 40b allowing it to be deflated and so that there is sufficient room for the corners of the containers to be pinched to make the containers self-supporting.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Once the lower sealing clamp 250 and backing plate 306 have been brought together and the fluid has been displaced by the hydraulic equalization bar 264, the drive mechanism 86 extends the lower heat sealing bar 200 through the passage 260 in the lower sealing clamp 250 so that the heat sealing bar contacts the tube of packaging material and pins the tube between its outer surface 220 and the rubber strip 304 on the anvil of the backing plate 306.
      <br/>
      The configuration of the outer surface of the heat sealing bar 200 ensures that as the heat sealing bar contacts the tube of packaging material where the seal is to be formed, fluid is displaced away from the seal in opposite directions.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      After the seal has been formed across the tube of packaging material, the drive mechanism 86 retracts the heat sealing bar 200 and then extends the cutting mechanism 320.
      <br/>
      As the cutting mechanism is extended, the cutting blade 324 passes through the slit 307 and contacts the tube of packaging material generally along the center line of the seal.
      <br/>
      The leading edge of the cutting blade ensures a clean cut along the seal thereby separating the container 40 from the tube of packaging material.
      <br/>
      Once this is done, the drive mechanism 86 retracts the cutting mechanism 320 and then retracts the lower backing plate and the lower sealing clamp.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      At this state, the upper sealing clamp 250 and backing plate 306 are extended by the drive mechanism 86 to trap the tube of packaging material therebetween.
      <br/>
      The same sequence of steps is then performed so that a second container is formed and separated from the tube of packaging material.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the web of packaging material is indexed twice by the pull rollers 122 and 124 allowing the next two containers to be formed and separated from the tube in succession by the container forming apparatus.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 10 to 15 illustrate the above-described sequence of events.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      As each container is formed and separated from the tube and the upper sealing clamps and backing plates are retracted, the containers 40 fall towards the open upper ends 406 of the chutes 402.
      <br/>
      Since the reservoirs of the two containers are positioned on opposite sides of the longitudinal axis of the tube of packaging material, the weight of the fluid in the reservoirs causes the containers to fall on opposite sides of the central longitudinal axis of the tube.
      <br/>
      Each container is therefor received by a different chute 402 of the diverter 42.
      <br/>
      As each container enters a chute, its spout contacts the dividing wall 404 causing the container to turn upright.
      <br/>
      The upright containers are then delivered by the chutes 402 to different seats of the carrier 44 positioned below the diverter.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Once the containers are positioned in the seats of the carrier 44, the delivery belt 60 is driven to advance the carrier to the station 48.
      <br/>
      When the carrier arrives at the station, the pneumatic air cylinders 504 are actuated to bring the assemblies 502 into contact with opposed bottom corners of the body 40a thereby to pinch the corners of the container between the assemblies and wedge-shaped backing plates 550.
      <br/>
      The displacement units 516 displace fluid from the pinched corners into the reservoir.
      <br/>
      The heat sealing bars 520 are then extended through the openings 518 to form seals.
      <br/>
      As the seals are being formed, the cutting blades 530 are extended to cut the corners behind the seals and thereby remove the corners from the containers.
      <br/>
      The heat sealing bars and cutting blades are then retracted and the pneumatic air cylinders are actuated to retract the heat sealing and cutting mechanisms.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Following this, the delivery belt 60 is driven to deliver the self-supporting containers to the unloading station 50 where the containers are removed from the carriers 44.
      <br/>
      Once emptied, the carries 44 are carried by the elevator to the return belt allowing the return belt to deliver the carriers to the elevator so that the carries can be placed back on the delivery belt adjacent the container forming apparatus 32.
      <br/>
      The above operation can be performed at a high speed allowing fluid filled containers to be formed quickly.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      As will be appreciated, since the tube is supported in a direction generally orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the tube at positions adjacent the seals as each seal is being formed, the forces applied to the tube by the fluid column below the sealing clamp and backing plate are generally equalized across the tube allowing high integrity seals to be formed.
      <br/>
      It has been found that when the tube is not supported in this manner and curvilinear seals are formed across the tube, the unequal forces applied to the tube by the fluid column create stresses which compromise the integrity of the seals as they are formed and distort the shape of the containers.
