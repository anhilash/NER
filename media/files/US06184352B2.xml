    <p num="3">
      In many secretory cells in the resting state, secretion products such as neurotransmitters and hormones are stored in the form of granules or vesicles.
      <br/>
      When the cells receive adequate signals, these substances are released from the cells by exocytosis.
      <br/>
      In the process of exocytosis, the granules and vesicles migrate toward plasma membrane.
      <br/>
      Then they come into contact with the plasma membrane followed by fusion therewith, thus opening the membrane.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      This exocytosis is tightly controlled by the concentration of intracellular free calcium �Ca2+ �i (Knight et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 493:504-523, 1987).
      <br/>
      Namely, it is considered that in resting cells where �Ca2+ �i is low, exocytosis is blocked at several steps depending on �Ca2+ �i (Burgoyne, Biochem.
      <br/>
      Biophys. Acta 779:201-216, 1984).
      <br/>
      A number of secretory cells including chromaffin cells which are adrenal medulla secretory cells have a microfilament network composed of actin filaments under the plasma membrane which is supposed to serve as a barrier against the migration of granules and vesicles toward the plasma membrane (Cheek et al., FEBS Lett. 207:110-114, 1986; Lelkes et al., FBES Lett. 208:357-363, 1986).
      <br/>
      Prior to the release of the secretion products by exocytosis, this network is disassembled due to the increase in �Ca2+ �i by Ca2+ -dependent mechanisms (Vitale et al., J. Cell Biol. 113:1057-1067, 1991).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Actin is a globular protein with a molecular weight of 42 kD which is commonly distributed in eukaryocytes.
      <br/>
      It is a cytoskeleton protein closely relating to the contraction of muscle cells, etc.
      <br/>
      Actin membranes are polymerized to form filaments.
      <br/>
      Under the physiological ionic strength, actin undergoes polymerization in vitro at a ratio of about 100% so as to give filaments.
      <br/>
      In actual cells, however, various actin-regulating proteins contribute to the reversible conversion of filaments (gel) and monomers (sol) and changes occur depending on extracellular stimuli.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In bovine chromaffin cells, gelsolin, which seemingly relates directly to this process, was identified (Yin et al., Nature 281:583-586, 1979).
      <br/>
      Gelsolin shows a Ca2+ -dependent actin filament severing activity in vitro and exerts barbed end capping and nucleating activities on actin filaments.
      <br/>
      Recently, adseverin (a protein of 74 kDa), which is similar to gelsolin in activity but different from it, was isolated from bovine adrenal medulla by Prof.

    <p num="7">
      Gelsolin is relatively widely distributed in various tissues and blood plasma (Stossel et al., Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1:353-402, 1985), while the distribution of adseverin is restricted mainly to the tissues with secretory functions (Sakurai et al., Neuroscience 38:743-756, 1990).
      <br/>
      This difference in tissue distribution of these proteins suggests that adseverin more closely relates to the secretory process (i.e., control of the release of neurotransmitters, endocrine substances or physiologically active substances) than gelsolin does.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is highly interesting to reveal the structure and function of adseverin to thereby clarify the role and regulatory mechanisms of actin filaments in exocytosis.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In former days, it was generally regarded that this process was regulated by fused proteins, etc. �Nishizaki, "Kaiko Hoshutsu Gesho ni okeru Saiboshitsu Tanpakushitsu no Yakuwari (Roles of Cytoplasmic Proteins in Exocytosis)", Saibo Kogaku (Cell Technology), 13:353-360, 1994�. However, Nonomura et al. newly point out in their hypothesis that this process finally depends on an interaction between actin and myosin.
      <br/>
      This hypothesis further provides an epoch-making idea that the regulation by the actin-severing protein takes place in non-muscular cells on the actin side, differing from the regulation on the myosin side by myosin light chain kinase �Mochida, "Miosin Keisa Kinaze Shinkei Dentatsu Busshitsu Hoshutsu to sono Chosetsu ni okeru Miosin Keisa Kinaze no Yakuwari (Role of Myosin Light Chain Kinase in Release of Myosin Light Chain Kinase Neutrotransmitter and Regulation thereof)", Saibo Kogaku (Cell Technology), 13:381-388, 1994�.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      It is thought that actin is liberated from broken cells and induces or enhances platelet agglutination in the blood so as to trigger thrombus development (Scarborough et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 100:1314-1319, 1981).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, adseverin has a gelsolin-like activity (i.e., an actin filament-severing activity) in vivo as described above.
      <br/>
      These facts indicate that adseverin might be applicable to drugs relating to thrombus (for example, thrombosis inhibitors).
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      It is furthermore expected that the release of, for example, a physiologically active substance might be regulated at the gene level by administering the antisense DNA sequence constructed on the basis of the base sequence encoding adseverin.
      <br/>
      Since adseverin might closely relate to the multiplication of vascular smooth muscles, it is considered that the administration of the antisense DNA would regulate the function of adseverin to thereby inhibit the multiplication of the smooth muscles.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is expected that the administration of the antisense DNA of adseverin might be usable in the inhibition of angiostenosis in blood vessel transplantation in bypass operation, etc. or in the inhibition of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      To use the actin-regulating protein adseverin in the medicinal purposes as described above, it is necessary to produce adseverin in a large amount and in a uniform state.
      <br/>
      However, it is difficult to obtain uniform adseverin in a large amount by the conventional method wherein adseverin is isolated from an animal tissue per se or the culture supernatant of adseverin-producing cells.
      <br/>
      It is therefore required to clarify the base sequence of the gene encoding adseverin so as to produce adseverin in a large amount by using gene recombination techniques.

      An object of the present invention is to identify the base sequence of the gene encoding adseverin.

      Further, a hydrolyzed fragment of this protein was obtained and, based on the partial information of its amino acid sequence, oligonucleotide primers were synthesized.

    <p num="25">
      FIG. 1 is a photograph which shows the electrophoretic pattern of purified adseverin obtained from bovine adrenal medulla in comparison with purified gelsolin obtained from bovine aorta. SDS-PAGE was carried out by using 6.5-10.5% linear gradient gel. Lanes 1 and 2 show fractions from bovine aorta treated with a DNase I affinity column. Lane 1 corresponds to the EGTA eluate, while lane 2 corresponds to the 6 M urea eluate. Lanes 3 to 8 show fractions obtained from bovine adrenal medulla. Namely, lanes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 correspond respectively to: the crude extract; the EGTA eluate of the DNase I affinity column; the 6 M urea eluate of the DNase I affinity column; the Q-Sepharose fraction containing adseverin; the Q-Sepharose fraction containing plasma gelsolin, cytoplasmic gelsolin and actin; and adseverin purified by HPLC gel filtration. Lane M shows molecular weight markers of 94,000, 67,000, 43,000 and 30,000 from top to bottom.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="26">cDNA encoding adseverin can be obtained by, for example, preparing mRNA from adseverin-producing cells and then converting it into a double stranded cDNA by a known method.</p>
    <p num="27">
      In the present invention, mRNA of the bovine adseverin are obtained from MDBK cells, which is a cell line established from bovine kidney, and bovine adrenal medulla (Madin et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. 98:574-576, 1958), while mRNA of the human adseverin is obtained from human kidney mRNA purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories Inc.
      <br/>
      However the mRNA sources are not restricted thereto but use can be made of adrenal medulla chromaffin cells, kidney medulla, thyroid tissue homogenizate, etc. therefor.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The RNA may be prepared in accordance with, for example, the method of Chirgwin et al. (Biochemistry 18:5294-5299, 1979).
      <br/>
      Namely, the whole RNA can be obtained by treating the RNA source with guanidine thiocyanate followed by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, use can be also made of methods employed for cloning genes of other physiologically active proteins, for example, treatment with a surfactant or phenol in the presence of a ribonuclease inhibitor (for example, a vanadium complex).
    </p>
    <p num="29">To obtain the double stranded cDNA from the mRNA thus obtained, reverse transcription is performed by, for example, using the mRNA as a template and an oligo (dT) or random primer, which is complementary to the poly A-chain at the 3'-end, or an synthetic oligonucleotide, which corresponds to a part of the amino acid sequence of adseverin, as a primer so as to synthesize a DNA (cDNA) complementary to the mRNA.</p>
    <p num="30">
      In the present invention, the bovine adseverin cDNA is obtained in the following manner.
      <br/>
      Namely, reverse transcription is carried out by using random hexamers as primers.
      <br/>
      Next, the resulting product is amplified by PCR with the use of condensed primers to give a PCR product corresponding to a partial cDNA of adseverin of about 700 bp.
      <br/>
      Then this PCR product is subcloned into pBluescript SK(-) (Stratagene).
      <br/>
      Next, A  LAMBDA gtll cDNA library prepared from bovine adrenal medulla is screened with the use of the 32 P-labeled cloned PCR product as a probe.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, 3 plaques are thus obtained and the target cDNA encoding adseverin is assembled on the basis of the overlapping base sequence of these plaques.
      <br/>
      Thus it is found out that the open reading frame is a protein of 80527 dalton composed of 715 amino acids (see SEQ ID NO: 5 in Sequence Listing).
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The cDNA of human adseverin is obtained in the following manner.
      <br/>
      That is, a double stranded cDNA is synthesized by using TimeSaver (tm)  cDNA Synthesis Kit (Pharmacia).
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Then the double stranded cDNA thus synthesized is fractionated in size by using Spun Column included in the above-mentioned Kit or agarose electrophoresis.
      <br/>
      Thus a cDNA of about 400 bp or more (in the former case) or about 2 to 3 kbp (in the latter case) is taken up exclusively.
      <br/>
      After ligating an adaptor to one end, the cDNA is integrated into a vector.
      <br/>
      Then the cDNA thus integrated into the vector is subjected to packaging with the use of GIGAPACK.RTM. II PACKAGING EXTRACT (STRATAGENE) to give a cDNA library.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Next, the cDNA library is screened under less stringent conditions by using thermally denatured bovine adseverin cDNA as a probe.
      <br/>
      Thus one positive phage clone is obtained.
      <br/>
      Then its cDNA moiety is amplified by PCR and integrated into a plasmid vector to thereby give a clone pADa-17.
      <br/>
      When partly sequenced, the base sequence of this clone shows a very high homology (80-90%) with the base sequence of the bovine adseverin cDNA.
      <br/>
      In contrast, it shows only a low homology of 60% or below with gelsolin which is a protein belonging to the adseverin family and having a known base sequence, suggesting that this is a gene obviously different therefrom.
      <br/>
      Thus it is assumed that this clone is human counter part of adseverin.
      <br/>
      However, this clone is about 1 kbp in full length and thus seemingly fails to contain the entire coding region.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, further screening should be carried out.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Thus plaque hybridization is carried out by using the above-mentioned clone pADa-17 as a probe under usual conditions with an elevated strictness.
      <br/>
      In this step, use is made of a library newly prepared from human kidney mRNA by concentrating cDNAs of 2 to 3 kbp exclusively in order to efficiently obtain clones of the full length.
      <br/>
      Thus 5 positive phage clones are obtained therefrom and excised into a plasmid �pBluescript.RTM. SK(-) vector� with ExAssist (tm) /SOLR SYSTEM to thereby give plasmid clones phAD-2 to 6.
      <br/>
      Among these plasmid clones, the base sequences of phAD-2 and phAD-4 are identified.
      <br/>
      By combining these base sequences, a sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 6 in Sequence Listing is determined.
      <br/>
      From this base sequence, an open reading frame composed of 715 amino acids and having ATG at the 79-position as the initiation codon (Met) is found out (SEQ ID NO: 7).
      <br/>
      FIG. 9 shows the result of a comparison of this amino acid sequence with the bovine adseverin amino acid sequence.
      <br/>
      These amino acid sequences show a homology of about 92% at the amino acid level, which suggests that this protein has been very well conserved beyond difference in species.
      <br/>
      It is also clarified that these amino acid sequences are highly analogous in many amino acids, even though they are not completely the same as each other.
      <br/>
      Although a high homology of about 90% is observed at the base level, the homology shows a rapid decrease after the stop codon, which seemingly reflects the difference in species.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In FIG. 9, putative phospholipid binding sites are boxed by solid lines.
      <br/>
      The putative phospholipid binding sites in bovine adseverin, namely, (112) KGGLKYKA (119) and (138) RLLHVKGRR (146) are both completely conserved in human adseverin too.
      <br/>
      Thus it is suggested that the difference in sensitivity to phospholipids between adseverin and gelsolin might be caused by the difference in the amino acid sequences of these regions.
      <br/>
      It is reported that adseverin is located in cells in the vicinity of cell membrane.
      <br/>
      Thus, the regulation of the adseverin activity by cell membrane constituents, if any, might be highly important.
      <br/>
      Since gelsolin is also activated by Ca2+, there is a fair possibility that phospholipids would control how to utilize these proteins case by case.
    </p>
    <p num="36">By using the cloned gene of the present invention encoding adseverin thus obtained, adseverin can be produced in a large amount by gene recombination techniques and used for medicinal purposes.</p>
    <p num="37">Accordingly, prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells can be transformed by appropriate vectors into which the gene of the present invention encoding adseverin has been integrated.</p>
    <p num="38">
      Further, the gene can be expressed in each host cell by introducing an adequate promoter or a sequence relating to the expression into these vectors.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the target gene may be ligated to another gene encoding a polypeptide and expressed as a fused protein to thereby facilitate purification or elevate the expression dose.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to excise the target protein by effecting adequate treatments in the purification step.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      It is generally considered that an eukaryotic gene shows polymorphism as known in the case of human interferon gene.
      <br/>
      In some cases, one or more amino acids are replaced due to this polymorphism, while changes occur not in amino acids but exclusively in base sequence in other cases.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      It is sometimes observed that a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 or 7 in Sequence Listing having the deletion, addition or replacement of one or more amino acids shows an actin filament-severing activity.
      <br/>
      For example, it is publicly known that a polypeptide, which is obtained by replacing a base sequence corresponding to cysteine of human interleukin 2 (IL-2) by another base sequence corresponding to serine, sustains the IL-2 activity (Wang et al., Science 224:1431, 1984).
      <br/>
      Thus the techniques for constructing the variants of these genes encoding adseverin are well known by those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Moreover, bovine adseverin is highly homologous with human adseverin and highly analogous in many amino acids even though they are not completely the same, as described above.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, genes having partial replacements of bovine or human adseverin and chimeric genes thereof also fail within the scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      When adseverin is expressed in eukaryotic cells, sugar chain(s) are frequently added thereto and the addition of the sugar chains can be controlled by converting one or more amino acids.
      <br/>
      In such a case, the expression product sometimes has an actin filament-severing activity.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the present invention includes any gene which is obtained by artificially varying the gene encoding human adseverin and encodes a polypeptide, so long as the obtained polypeptide has an actin filament-severing activity.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Furthermore, the present invention includes a gene which is capable of giving a polypeptide having an actin filament-serving activity and hybridizable with a gene represented by SEQ ID NO: 4 or 6 in Sequence Listing.
      <br/>
      The hybridization may be carried out under the conditions commonly employed in probe hybridization (see, for example, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Sambrook et al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989).
    </p>
    <p num="44">An expression vector may contain a replication origin, a selective marker, a promoter, an RNA splicing site, a polyadenylation signal, etc.</p>
    <p num="45">
      Examples of the prokaryotic cells to be used as the host cells in the expression system include E. coli and Bacillus subtilis.
      <br/>
      Examples of the eukaryotic cells usable as the host cells include yeasts and Myxomycota.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, insect cells such as Sf9 may be used as the host cells.
      <br/>
      In addition, use can be made of host cells with an animal origin such as COS cell and CHO cells therefor.
    </p>
    <p num="46">The protein, which has been produced by incubating a transformant transformed by the gene encoding adseverin, can be purified either in the cells or after isolating from the cells.</p>
    <p num="47">
      Adseverin may be isolated and purified by procedures commonly employed in the isolation and purification of proteins.
      <br/>
      For example, various chromatographies, ultrafiltration, salting out, dialysis, etc. may be adequately selected and combined therefor.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      According to the present invention, an antisense DNA can be prepared on the basis of the base sequence of the gene encoding adseverin.
      <br/>
      The antisense DNA, which has a base sequence complementary to the mRNA, forms base pairs with the mRNA and blocks the transmission of genetic information, thus regulating the synthesis of the adseverin protein, i.e., the final product.
      <br/>
      The antisense DNA usable in the present invention is an oligonucleotide hybridizable specifically with a base sequence which encodes the amino acid sequence represented by the SEQ ID NO: 5 or 7 in Sequence Listing.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The term "oligonucleotide" as used herein means an oligonucleotide composed of a base occurring in nature with a sugar moiety binding thereto via a phosphodiester bond of the inherent meaning or its analogue.
      <br/>
      That is to say, the first group meant thereby includes natural oligonucleotides and synthetic oligonucleotides prepared from subunits occurring in nature or homologues thereof.
      <br/>
      The term "subunit" means a combination of a base with a sugar binding to the adjacent subunit via a phosphodiester bond or another bond.
      <br/>
      The second group of the oligonucleotide includes analogues of the above-mentioned oligonucleotides taking the same roles as oligonucleotides but having residues containing some parts which are not observed in nature.
      <br/>
      Oligonucleotides, which have been chemically modified at the phosphate group, the sugar moiety, or the 3'- or 5'-end to enhance the stability, also fall within this category.
      <br/>
      Examples thereof include oligophosphorothioate and oligomethylphosphonate wherein an oxygen atom in the phosphodiester bond between nucleotides has been replaced respectively by a sulfur atom and --CH3.
      <br/>
      The phosphodiester bond may be replaced by another structure which in nonionic and nonchiraric.
      <br/>

      By administering an oligonucleotide hybridizable specifically with the gene of the present invention encoding adseverin to an animal, the formation of adseverin in the animal can be regulated.
      <br/>
      As described above, adseverin might relate to the multiplication of blood vessel smooth muscles.
      <br/>
      The multiplication of blood vessel smooth muscles is regarded as one of the factors causing angiostenosis in blood vessel transplantation in bypass operation, etc. or restenosis which is observed at a ratio of 30 to 40% after PTCA.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the antisense DNA of the gene encoding adseverin, the administration of which can suppress the multiplication of blood vessel smooth muscles, is usable as a preventive and remedy for these stenoses.
      <br/>
      For example, it is expected that angiostenosis can be prevented by soaking the blood vessel to be transplanted in a solution containing the oligonucleotide of the present invention to thereby incorporate the oligonucleotide into the cells followed by the transplantation.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to prevent restenosis by administering the oligonucleotide of the present invention with the use of a PTCA catheter or stent.

      An antibody of the present invention capable of recognizing the adseverin protein can be constructed in accordance with a conventional method �see, for example, Shinseikagaku Jikken Koza (New Biochemistry Experiment Lecture) 1, Tanpakushitsu (Protein) I, 389-397, 1992� by immunizing an animal with adseverin serving as the antigen and collecting and purifying the antibody thus produced in the animal body.
      <br/>
      The anti-adseverin antibody thus obtained is usable in various immunological assays such as enzyme immunoassays (for example, ELISA), radioimmunoassays and immunofluorescent techniques.

      Bovine adrenal glands were obtained from a slaughterhouse.
      <br/>
      All the procedures described below were carried out at 4 (degree)  C. The adrenal medullae were carefully separated from cortices and minced with scissors. 80 g of the material thus obtained was homogenized in thrice by volume as much buffer A (pH 8.0) containing 40 mM of Tris-HCl, 4 mM of EGTA, 2 mM of EDTA, 1 mM of DTT, 1 mM of DFP, 1 mM of PMSF, 10-6 M of E-64-c, 10  MU g/ml of aprotinin (Trasylol, Bayer) and 0.02% of NaN3 in a Waring blender.
      <br/>
      The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 g at the maximum for 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      The supernatant was filtered and further centrifuged at 150,000 g at the maximum for 90 minutes.
      <br/>
      To the supernatant were added 1 mol solutions of CaCl2 and MgCl2 to give final concentrations of 0.5 and 1 mM respectively.
      <br/>
      Then the resulting solution was passed through a DNaseI-Affi-Gel 15 column which had been equilibrated with buffer B (pH 7.5) containing 50 mM of KCl, 20 mM of Tris-HCl, 0.5 mM of CaCl2, 1 mM of MgCl2, 0.1 mM of PMSF and 0.02% of NaN3.
      <br/>
      Then the column was washed successively with the buffer B and the modified buffer B containing not 50 mM but 0.6 M of KCl.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Next, Ca2+ -sensitive proteins were eluted with the modified buffer B containing 10 mM of EGTA as a substitute for 0.5 mM of CaCl2 and eluted with the modified buffer B containing 6 M of urea.
      <br/>
      Thus 3 Ca2+ -sensitive actin-binding proteins and actin (molecular weight: 42,000) were eluted with the EGTA-containing buffer.
      <br/>
      The results of SDS PAGE suggested that these 3 proteins had molecular weights of 86,000, 84,000 and 74,000 respectively (FIG. 1, lanes 1 to 4).
      <br/>
      The column was regenerated by washing with the buffer B and stored at 4 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The EGTA eluate thus collected was adjusted to pH 8.2 with 1 M Tris and then applied to a Q-Sepharose ion exchange column (1.5 * 12 cm) which had been equilibrated with a solution (pH 8.2) containing 50 mM of KCl, 20 mM of Tris-HCl, 1 mM of EGTA, 0.1 mM of PMSF, 7 mM of 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.02% of NaN3.
      <br/>
      Proteins were eluted with a linear KCl gradient from 50 to 250 mM and then with 1 M KCl.
      <br/>
      The first peak fraction corresponding to 0 to 150 mM KCl contained the protein of a molecular weight of 74,000 together with a small amount of contaminating proteins (FIG. 1, lane 6 ).
      <br/>
      The proteins of molecular weights of 86,000 and 84,000 and actin were contained in the second peak which was the eluate with 1 M KCl (FIG. 1, lane 7).

    <p num="65">
      Adseverin in digestion buffer C (1 mM of EGTA, 1 mM of DTT, 0.02% of NaN3 and 50 mM of NH4 HCO3) was digested by Staphylococcus V8 protease at room temperature at a ratio of 1:25 (wt/wt).
      <br/>
      The reaction was stopped by adding 1 mM of DFP followed by SDS-PAGE analysis.
      <br/>
      Thus it was found out that adseverin was digested into two major fragments of 42,000 and 39,000 in molecular weight.
      <br/>
      After digesting by the V8 protease over a prolonged period, the fragment of 39,000 in molecular weight was further digested into fragments of molecular weights of 28,000 and 15,000, while the fragment of 42,000 in molecular weight remained stable.
    </p>
    <p num="66">(2) Digestion by trypsin</p>
    <p num="67">
      Adseverin in buffer D (1 mM of EGTA, 1 mM of DTT, 0.02% of NaN3 and 20 mM of Tris-HCL, pH 8.0) was digested by trypsin at a ratio of 1:200.
      <br/>
      After reacting at 25 (degree)  C. for 60 minutes, a 200 mM solution of PMSF in ethanol was added to give a final PMSF concentration of 4 mM followed by SDS-PAGE analysis.
      <br/>
      Thus it was found out that adseverin was also digested into two fragments of 42,000 and 39,000 in molecular weight and no further digestion occurred thereafter.
    </p>
    <p num="68">From the results of recognition reactions of 2 antigelsolin polyclonal antibodies with the above-mentioned 2 fragments, it was confirmed that the fragment of 39,000 in molecular weight was not a digestion product of the fragment of 42,000 in molecular weight.</p>
    <p num="69">(3) Purification of V8 protease digestion product</p>
    <p num="70">
      The V8-digestion product was applied to an HPLC DEAE ion exchange column (DEAE-SPW, Tosoh) which had been equilibrated with buffer D. The fragment of 39,000 in molecular weight was adsorbed by the column, while the one of 42,000 in molecular weight was eluted with an NaCl gradient of 0 to 150 mM and obtained as a single peak at the NaCl concentration of 10 mM.
      <br/>
      Next, the buffer D containing no EGTA but 0.5 mM CaCl2 was used.
      <br/>
      Thus the fragment of 39,000 in molecular weight was eluted but the fragment of 42,000 in molecular weight was recovered only in a small amount.
      <br/>
      These 2 V8 protease-digestion fragments thus purified showed almost the same patterns in SDS-PAGE.

    <p num="71">(4) Identification of N-terminal amino acid sequence</p>
    <p num="72">
      The N-terminal amino acid sequences of 2 fragments purified in the above (3) and native adseverin were discussed.
      <br/>
      Although the N-terminal of native adseverin were discussed.
      <br/>
      Although the N-termini of native adseverin and the fragment of 42,000 in molecular weight were blocked, it was clarified by the Edman degradation method that the vicinity of the N-terminus of the fragment of 39,000 in molecular weight had the following amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 in Sequence Listing:
    </p>
    <p num="73">KVAHVKQIPFDA.</p>
    <p num="74">
      This sequence was compared with those of publicly known actin filament-serving proteins gelsolin (Kwiatkowski et al., Nature 323:455-458, 1986) and villin (Bazari et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:4986-4990, 1988).
      <br/>
      As a result, the above-mentioned sequence was similar to the hinge region located between the conserved repetition segments 3 and 4 in gelsolin and villin, i.e., the middles of these molecules, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is suggested that the fragment of 42,000 in molecular weight is a protein located in the NH2 -terminal half of adseverin (hereinafter referred to as "N42"), while the fragment of 39,000 in molecular weight is a protein located in the COOH-terminal half of adseverin (hereinafter referred to as "C39").
    </p>
    <p num="75">(5) Actin-binding properties of N42 and C39</p>
    <p num="76">
      The actin-binding properties of N42 and C39 obtained above were examined by using an actin monomer (G-actin) bound to agarose beads.
      <br/>
      As a result, it was clarified that N42 and C39 both bound to G-actin in the presence of calcium but not in the absence of calcium.
    </p>
    <p num="77">(6) Identification of functional domain of adseverin (digestion of N42 by thermolysin)</p>
    <p num="78">
      When N42 was digested by thermolysin which was a metaproteinase, 5 fragments including those of 31,000, 30,000 and 16,000 in molecular weight and 2 different ones of 15,000 in molecular weight were obtained.
      <br/>
      These fragments were purified by HPLC.
      <br/>
      The fragments of 31,000 and 30,000 in molecular weight were named respectively TL1 and TL2, while the other 3 fragments were named TL3 (molecular weight: 16,000), TL4 (molecular weight: 16,000) and TL5 (molecular weight: 15,000) in the order of elution from the HPLC column.
      <br/>
      The N-termini of TL1 and TL3 were not detected by an antibody A, since they were blocked as in the case of N42 and native adseverin.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, TL2 and TL5 reacted with the antibody A. Based on these results, it is estimated that N42 has 2 cleavage sites with the mapping of the fragment as shown in FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The amino acid sequences of TL4 and TL5, the N-termini of which were not blacked, were analyzed by the Edman degradation method.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is proved that the N-terminal amino acid sequence of TL4 is the following one represented by SEQ ID NO:2 of Sequence Listing:
      <br/>
      VLTNDLTAQ
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      which is homologous with the sequence of the hinge region between the segments 1 and 2 of gelsolin.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of TL5 is the following one represented by SEQ ID NO:3 of Sequence Listing:
      <br/>
      ITNRK
    </p>
    <p num="81">which is homologous with the sequence of the hinge region between the segments 2 and 3 of gelsolin (FIG. 3).</p>
    <p num="82">
      Accordingly, it is considered that adseverin has a structure similar to that of gelsolin.
      <br/>
      Similar to gelsolin, the N-terminal half of adseverin is composed of 3 repetition segments each corresponding to a protein digestion fragment of up to 15 kDa.

    <p num="107">
      Biochemical analyses and the predicted amino acid sequence from cDNA have revealed that human gelsolin and villin each consists of 6 homologous segments. (Bazari eta l., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:4986-4990, 1988; Matsidaora et al., Cell 54:139-140, 1988; Way et al., J. Mol. Biol. 203:1127-1133, 1988).
      <br/>
      The segments 1, 2 and 3 have higher homologies respectively with the segments 4, 5 and 6 than nay other combinations.
      <br/>
      The analysis on the predicted amino acid sequence of adseverin has revealed that adseverin has 6 homologous segments too.
      <br/>
      The segments 1 to 6 have homologies respectively with the corresponding segments of gelsolin and villin (FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      As FIG. 5 clearly shows, motifs B, A and C existing in each of the 6 segments of gelsolin and villin were also found out in the 6 segments of adseverin.
      <br/>
      These facts indicate that adseverin belongs to gelsolin family proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      Moreover, the putative polyphosphoinositide binding sequences existing in gelsolin and villin were also found in adseverin in the regions corresponding to the regions of gelsolin and villin, i.e., the first and second segments (S1, S2).
      <br/>
      This fact agrees with the data that the protein fragment-severing activity corresponding to S1-2 of adseverin was inhibited by polyphosphoinositide.
      <br/>
      These sequences are boxed in FIG. 5 and shown as a model view in Table 1.
      <br/>
      One of these 2 putative sequences completely agreed with the consensus sequence, while another one located in the first segment was different from the consensus sequence only in one amino acid.
      <br/>
      That is to say, it had alanine at the COOH-terminal while the consensus sequence had a basic amino acid at this position.
      <br/>
      Thus this domain of adseverin had a less basic nature than that of the corresponding domain of gelsolin.
      <br/>
      This difference could partly account that acidic phospholipids other than phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate, for example, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine can inhibit the serving activity of adseverin but not that of gelsolin.

    <p num="111">Expression of Adseverin cDNA in E. coli</p>
    <p num="112">
      The bovine adseverin cDNA (pSK-adseverin) obtained in Example 6 was amplified by PCR.
      <br/>
      Primers empoloyed in PCR were so designed that the initiation codon (ATG) of the product cDNA constituted a part of NdeI while the termination codon (TAA) was immediately followed by the XhoI site.
      <br/>
      The cDNA thus obtained was integrated into an expression vector pET-23a (Novagen) via the NdeI and XhoI sites.
      <br/>
      The resulting recombinant vector pET-adseverin was then introduced into competent BL21(DE3)pLysS cells by the method of Chung et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86:2172-2175, 1998).
      <br/>
      Transformants were selected, incubated and induced with IPTG (isopropyl- BETA -thiogalactopyranoside) in accordance with the method of Studier et al. �in Methods in Enzymology, Gene Expression Technology (Goeddle eds) Vo., 185, pp. 60-89, Academic Press, San Diego, 1991�. Namely, a colony resistant against ampicillin and chloramphenicol was picked up and incubated in M9ZB medium supplemented with 50  MU g/ml of ampicillin.
      <br/>
      When the expression of the cDNA was induced by IPTG, a protein of approximately 74 kDA on SDS-PAGE was produced (FIG. 6A, indicated by arrow).
      <br/>
      In contrast, the untransformed control BL21(DE3) pLysS produced no extra protein on the induction with IPTG.
      <br/>
      The size (i.e., 74 kDa) of the induced protein on SDS-PAGE was the same as that of adseverin prepared from bovine adrenal medulla.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      The culture supernatant of the transformed E. coli was purified by substantially the same methods the one employed for the isolation and purification of adseverin from bovine adrenal medulla in Example 1.
      <br/>
      The purified protein was electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane.
      <br/>
      When reacted with an antibody specific to adseverin, this protein underwent an immunological reaction with this protein, as shown in FIG. 6B. Based on the apparent size of this protein on SDS-PAGE and its immunoreactivity with the adseverin specific antibody, it was confirmed that this protein was the cDNA encoding adseverin.

      As FIG. 7 shows, the viscosity of the actin solution was affected by adseverin exclusively in the presence of Ca2+ (compare FIG. 7A with 7B).

      In the presence of Ca2+, adseverin promoted the nucleation in the process of actin polymerization so as to lower the final viscosity of the polymerized actin solution.
      <br/>
      When adseverin was added to the polymerized actin solution (indicated by arrows), the specific viscosity showed a sudden drop in the case of the solution containing Ca2+.

    <p num="132">
      At a low magnification, the color development was observed in the medulla but not in the cortex except in the area adjacent to the medulla.
      <br/>
      Next, the interface area between the medulla and the cortex was observed at higher magnifications.
      <br/>
      Toluidine Blue staining (FIG. 8a) revealed that the cells in the cortex were tightly packed, whereas the cells in the medulla were loosely distributed and classified into groups by sheath-like structures containing vessels.
      <br/>
      The cortex and the medulla were easily distinguishable from each other in both of the in situ hybridization and the immunofluorescent staining depending on the cellular characteristics as described above without effecting counter-staining.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8c and f show the results of the in situ hybridization observed at middle and high magnifications respectively.
      <br/>
      Staining was observed mainly in loosely packed cells corresponding to the medullary chromaffin cells.
      <br/>
      In addition, a small number of cells in the cortex facing the medulla were also stained as shown by arrows.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      The adseverin distribution of the same pattern was observed in the immunofluorescent staining with the anti-adseverin antibody (FIG. 8b and e).
      <br/>
      Namely, fluorescence was observed in the chromaffin cells of the medulla and in the cells in the cortex facing the medulla.
      <br/>
      In the chromaffin cells, fluorescence was mainly observed in the subplasmalemmal region.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      In summary, it was demonstrated that the adseverin mRNA and the adseverin protein were both expressed in the adrenal medulla but not in most part of the cortex.
      <br/>
      Exceptionally, the expression of both of the adseverin mRNA and the adseverin protein was observed in a part of the cortex facing the medulla.
      <br/>
      Thus it is concluded that such differential expression of adseverin in the parts of bovine adrenal glad is controlled at the transcription level.
      <br/>
      Secretion in the mode of exocytosis takes place in the adrenal medulla but not in the adrenal cortex.
      <br/>
      Therefore, this differential expression strongly suggests that adseverin relates not to the regulation of the secretory process in general but exclusively to the secretory process depending on the mode of exocytosis.
      <br/>
      Further, the localization of adseverin in the subplasmalemmal region agrees with the idea that this protein relates to the regulation of exocytosis.

      Staring from a resin having a branched structure to which 7 lysine residues were bound, a multiple antigen peptide (MAP) was synthesized (Tam, J. P., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5409-5413, 1988).
      <br/>
      Then emulsions were prepared by using this peptide with Freund's complete adjuvant in the first time and Freund's incomplete adjuvant in the second time and thereafter.
      <br/>
      These emulsions were subcutaneously injected into 2 rabbits at intervals of 1 week.
      <br/>
      After 7, 8 and 9 weeks, blood was collected from the ear vein and the antibody titer was determined by ELISA.
      <br/>
      Thus an antibody, which showed scarcely any cross reaction with gelsolin and reacted with rat, bovine and human adseverins, was obtained.
      <br/>
      Since a nonspecific reaction shown in the unimmunized serum was observed, affinity purification was carried out similar to the case of the antibody obtained by immunizing with a purified protein.
