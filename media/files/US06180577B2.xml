    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Basic skin cleansing compositions have been long addressed by the personal care industry.
      <br/>
      The consumer population is looking for additional benefit beyond basic skin cleansing which now includes germ as well as soil removal.
      <br/>
      Recently, intensified focus has been directed to the spread of germs from touching various objects in public use such as an ATM machine, public phones, public restrooms, the gym and the like.
      <br/>
      New compositions which fight germs have recently been marketed.
      <br/>
      However, many of these products use high quantities of alcohol to accomplish the degerming of the skin.
      <br/>
      These products are directed to eliminating pre-existing germs present in the skin prior to treatment.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a need exists for obtaining a longer lasting "antigerm" effect with a cleansing composition normally employed as a rinse-off product which inhibits the further attachment of germs to the skin following the rinse off process.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Such a product should not be restricted to having activity against only one or a small number of germs which can be present on the skin.
      <br/>
      It should be readily applicable to a large number of germs, regardless of their gram negative or gram positive nature or whatever type of classification system under which they may be categorized.
      <br/>
      A few compositions with active agents seem to work by stopping the attachment of specific germs to the skin.
      <br/>
      However, compositions containing these agents are disclosed to be germ specific to only one or a small number of germs.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      It has now been discovered that a relatively simple rinse off skin cleansing composition has the ability to inhibit the attachment of germs to the skin for a significant period of time after rinsing the skin.
      <br/>
      A broad spectrum of germs can be inhibited.
      <br/>
      In this manner a standard rinse off skin cleansing composition provides a desired benefit to the everyday skin washing population.
      <br/>
      Additionally, it can provide a meaningful benefit to those individuals whose skin is in particular need to have diminished levels of germs thereon, for example those people suffering from atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, immunodeficient conditions and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A further advantage of the composition is that germs which are present, can be more readily removed from the skin by rinsing with water after treatment of the skin with the composition of the invention.
      <br/>
      This occurs for a period of time after the initial rinse-off of the composition has occurred.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">In accordance with the invention, there is a method for inhibiting the attachment of germs to the skin which comprises applying to the skin a composition comprising</p>
    <p num="7">
      a. a skin cleansing effective amount of a surfactant or mixture of surfactants,
      <br/>
      b. a silicone component in amounts effective to inhibit attachment of germs to the skin, and rinsing said composition from the skin.
    </p>
    <p num="8">A further aspect of the invention is the composition having as an additional component a cationic material, preferably a cationic polymer.</p>
    <p num="9">Additionally, a composition which accomplishes the goal of inhibition of germ attachment is the composition of (a) and (b) above.</p>
    <p num="10">
      Still further, there is the use of a composition comprising:
      <br/>
      (a) a skin cleansing effective amount of a surfactant or mixture of surfactants,
      <br/>
      (b) a silicone component in amounts effective to inhibit attachment of germs to the skin, in the preparation of a skin cleansing material which inhibits the attachment of germs to the skin.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The composition can work its effects in many realistic situations.
      <br/>
      It can reduce the spread of germs from inanimate objects, for example door knobs, phones, water faucets and the like as well as through skin to skin contact, for example the shaking of hands.
      <br/>
      In summary, the transmission of germs to skin can be reduced by prior contact of skin with the composition of this invention.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The term "germ" as used in the specification and claims of this invention means bacteria and viruses, particularly bacteria.
      <br/>
      Examples of bacteria which are inhibited from attaching to the skin include staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermis, corynebacterium minutissium, escherichia coli, salmonella, choleraesuis and serratia marcescens.
      <br/>
      Examples of viruses include human rhinovirus and human rotovirus.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The surfactants which can be used in the composition include the following families: anionic, amphoteric, nonionic and cationic, alone or in combination.
      <br/>
      Soap a long chain alkyl or alkenyl, branched or normal carboxylic acid salt such as sodium, potassium, ammonium or substituted ammonium salt, can be present in the composition.
      <br/>
      Exemplary of long chain alkyl or alkenyl are from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms in length, specifically about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms in length, more specifically alkyl and most specifically normal, or normal with little branching.
      <br/>
      Small quantities of olefinic bond(s) may be present in the predominantly alkyl sections, particularly if the source of the "alkyl" group is obtained from a natural product such as tallow, coconut oil and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Examples of anionic surfactants other than soap include but are not limited to alkyl sulfates, anionic acyl sarcosinates, methyl acyl taurates, N-acyl glutamates, acyl isethionates, alkyl sulfosuccinates, alkyl phosphate esters, ethoxylated alkyl phosphate esters, trideceth sulfates, protein condensates, mixtures of ethoxylated alkyl sulfates and the like.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Other surfactants can be present in the composition as well.
      <br/>
      Examples of such surfactants are the anionic, amphoteric, nonionic and cationic surfactants.
      <br/>
      Examples of anionic surfactants include but are not limited to alkyl sulfates, anionic acyl sarcosinates, methyl acyl taurates, N-acyl glutamates, acyl isethionates, alkyl sulfosuccinates, alkyl phosphate esters, ethoxylated alkyl phosphate esters, trideceth sulfates, protein condensates, mixtures of ethoxylated alkyl sulfates and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Alkyl chains for these surfactants are C8 -C22, preferably C10 -C18, more preferably C12 -C14.
      <br/>

      With respect to liquid, preferably aqueous, compositions, the anionic surfactant is from about 2 to about 25 wt. % of the composition, specifically about 5 to about 20 wt. %. Other surfactants may be present such as an amphoteric, particularly a betaine, and a nonionic, particularly an alkylated polyglycoside.
      <br/>
      Their quantities are from about 1 to about 20 wt. % of the composition.
      <br/>
      Generally the total surfactant in a liquid composition is at least about 3 or 4 wt. %, preferably at least about 5 wt. % and is generally no more than about 30 wt. %, preferably no more than about 25 wt. % but can be as low as no more than about 10, 15 or 20 wt. %. For a solid composition, the total surfactant can be from about 60 to about 90 wt. %, preferably from about 70 to about 85 wt. %, of the composition.
      <br/>
      Soap can be present at about 15 to about 100 wt. % of the total surfactant. "Soap-bars" generally have from about 65 to about 90 wt. % soap therein with less than about 10 wt. %, preferably less than about 5 wt. % of other surfactant therein.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, there is zero or zero to about 2 wt. % of other surfactant therein Bars having a smaller quantity of soap within the disclosed range of soap usually have a mild synthetic surfactant therein such as sodium cocoyl isethionate at moderate to high levels.

    <p num="56">
      The quantity of silicone component is at least about 0.01 wt. %, preferably at least about 0.1 wt. %. of the composition.
      <br/>
      The maximum can vary but generally is not above about 7 or 8 wt. %., preferably about 5 wt. %, more preferably about 4.5 wt. % of the composition.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      When using a cationic polymer in the composition, the quantity of polymer is from about 0.01 to abut 3.0 wt. % of the composition preferably about 0.02 wt. % as a minimum and more preferably about 0.03 wt. % as a minimum.
      <br/>
      The maximum is generally no more than about 0.9 wt. %, or about 0.75 wt. %, although lower maximums such as about 0.6 wt. % can be employed.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Although not necessary but if present the quantity of hydrocarbonaceous material is at least about 0.1, preferably 0.5 wt. % of the composition.
      <br/>
      The maximum can vary but generally is not above about 7 or 8 wt. %, preferably a maximum of about 5 wt. % or about 4.5 wt. % of the composition.

      As well as the rinse off compositions, the effect of inhibition of germ attachment also occurs with leave on compositions such as creams, lotions, and the like.
