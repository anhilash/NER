    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to use of a complexing agent in a mixture of dyes in a magenta dye-donor element for thermal dye transfer imaging which is used to obtain a color proof that accurately represents the hue of a printed color image obtained from a printing press.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      In order to approximate the appearance of continuous-tone (photographic) images via ink-on-paper printing, the commercial printing industry relies on a process known as halftone printing.
      <br/>
      In halftone printing, color density gradations are produced by printing patterns of dots or areas of varying sizes, but of the same color density, instead of varying the color density continuously as is done in photographic printing.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      There is an important commercial need to obtain a color proof image before a printing press run is made.
      <br/>
      It is desired that the color proof will accurately represent at least the details and color tone scale of the prints obtained on the printing press.
      <br/>
      In many cases, it is also desirable that the color proof accurately represent the image quality and halftone pattern of the prints obtained on the printing press.
      <br/>
      In the sequence of operations necessary to produce an ink-printed, full-color picture, a proof is also required to check the accuracy of the color separation data from which the final three or more printing plates or cylinders are made.
      <br/>
      Traditionally, such color separation proofs have involved silver halide photographic, high-contrast lithographic systems or non-silver halide light-sensitive systems which require many exposure and processing steps before a final, full-color picture is assembled.

    <p num="5">
      Colorants that are used in the printing industry are insoluble pigments.
      <br/>
      By virtue of their pigment character, the spectrophotometric curves of the printing inks are often unusually sharp on either the bathochromic or hypsochromic side.
      <br/>
      This can cause problems in color proofing systems in which dyes, as opposed to pigments, are being used.
      <br/>
      It is very difficult to match the hue of a given ink using a single dye.

    <p num="6">
      In U.S. Pat. No. 5,126,760, a process is described for producing a direct digital, halftone color proof of an original image on a dye-receiving element.
      <br/>
      The proof can then be used to represent a printed color image obtained from a printing press.
      <br/>
      The process described therein comprises:
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      a) generating a set of electrical signals which is representative of the shape and color scale of an original image;
      <br/>
      b) contacting a dye-donor element comprising a support having thereon a dye layer and an infrared-absorbing material with a first dye-receiving element comprising a support having thereon a polymeric, dye image-receiving layer;
      <br/>
      c) using the signals to imagewise-heat by means of a diode laser the dye-donor element, thereby transferring a dye image to the first dye-receiving element; and
      <br/>
      d) retransferring the dye image to a second dye image-receiving element which has the same substrate as the printed color image.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In the above process, multiple dye-donors are used to obtain a complete range of colors in the proof.
      <br/>
      For example, for a full-color proof, four colors: cyan, magenta, yellow and black are normally used.
    </p>
    <p num="9">By using the above process, the image dye is transferred by heating the dye-donor containing the infrared-absorbing material with the diode laser to volatilize the dye, the diode laser beam being modulated by the set of signals which is representative of the shape and color of the original image, so that the dye is heated to cause volatilization only in those areas in which its presence is required on the dye-receiving layer to reconstruct the original image.</p>
    <p num="10">
      Similarly, a thermal transfer proof can be generated by using a thermal head in place of a diode laser as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,923,846. Commonly available thermal heads are not capable of generating halftone images of adequate resolution but can produce high quality continuous tone proof images which are satisfactory in many instances. U.S. Pat. No. 4,923,846 also discloses the choice of mixtures of dyes for use in thermal imaging proofing systems.
      <br/>
      The dyes are selected on the basis of values for hue error and turbidity.
      <br/>
      The Graphic Arts Technical Foundation Research Report No. 38, "Color Material" (58-(5) 293-301, 1985) gives an account of this method.

    <p num="11">
      An alternative and more precise method for color measurement and analysis uses the concept of uniform color space known as CIELAB in which a sample is analyzed mathematically in terms of its spectrophotometric curve, the nature of the illuminant under which it is viewed and the color vision of a standard observer.
      <br/>
      For a discussion of CIELAB and color measurement, see Principles of Color Technology, 2nd Edition, F. W. Billmeyer, p. 25-110, Wiley-Interscience and Optical Radiation Measurements, Volume 2, F. Grum, p. 33-145, Academic Press.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In using CIELAB, colors can be expressed in terms of three parameters: L*, a* and b*, where L* is a lightness function, and a* and b* define a point in color space.
      <br/>
      Thus, a plot of a* vs b* values for a color sample can be used to accurately show where that sample lies in color space, i.e., what its hue is.
      <br/>
      This allows different samples to be compared for hue if they have similar density and L* values.

      In color proofing in the printing industry, it is important to be able to match the proofing ink references provided by the International Prepress Proofing Association.
      <br/>
      These ink references are density patches made with standard 4-color process inks and are known as SWOP.RTM. (Specifications Web Offset Publications) color aims.

      The magenta SWOP color aim is actually slightly reddish since it contains a high amount of blue absorption.

      Therefore, a "good" magenta dye selected from a photographic standpoint would not be suitable for matching the magenta SWOP color aim.

      In U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,509, a magenta dye donor element comprising a mixture of magenta dyes and a yellow dye is described for color proofing.
      <br/>
      However, a problem has developed using the dye solutions when it is necessary to hold them for a period of time before coating in that the composition of the solutions changes.
      <br/>
      Thus when a comparison of coatings was made from the fresh solution and the aged solution, the donor made from the aged solution did not deliver the correct colorimetry.
      <br/>
      Analysis of the aged solution showed that the change in composition was caused by decomposition of the yellow dye which is due to the presence of copper ion in one of the magenta dyes.
      <br/>
      Cuprous cyanide is used in the synthesis of one of the magenta dyes and it is difficult to remove all traces of copper from the final dye.

      The support for the dye-receiving element may also be reflective such as baryta-coated paper, polyethylene-coated paper, an ivory paper, a condenser paper or a synthetic paper such as DuPont Tyvek.RTM.. Pigmented supports such as white polyester (transparent polyester with white pigment incorporated therein) may also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The dye image-receiving layer may comprise, for example, a polycarbonate, a polyurethane, a polyester, poly(vinyl chloride), poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile), polycaprolactone, a poly(vinyl acetal) such as poly(vinyl alcohol-co-butyral), poly(vinyl alcohol-co-benzal), poly(vinyl alcohol-co-acetal) or mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      The dye image-receiving layer may be present in any amount which is effective for the intended purpose.
      <br/>
      In general, good results have been obtained at a concentration of from about 1 to about 5 g/m2.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      As noted above, the dye-donor elements of the invention are used to form a dye transfer image.
      <br/>
      Such a process comprises imagewise-heating a dye-donor element as described above and transferring a dye image to a dye-receiving element to form the dye transfer image.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The dye-donor element of the invention may be used in sheet form or in a continuous roll or ribbon.
      <br/>
      If a continuous roll or ribbon is employed, it may have only the dyes thereon as described above or may have alternating areas of other different dyes or combinations, such as sublimable cyan and/or yellow and/or black or other dyes.
      <br/>
      Such dyes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,541,830, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      Thus, one-, two-, three- or four-color elements (or higher numbers also) are included within the scope of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Thermal printing heads which can be used to transfer dye from the dye-donor elements of the invention are available commercially.
      <br/>
      There can be employed, for example, a Fujitsu Thermal Head (FTP-040 MCSOO1), a TDK Thermal Head F415 HH7-1089 or a Rohm Thermal Head KE 2008-F3.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      A laser may also be used to transfer dye from the dye-donor elements of the invention.
      <br/>
      When a laser is used, it is preferred to use a diode laser since it offers substantial advantages in terms of its small size, low cost, stability, reliability, ruggedness, and ease of modulation.
      <br/>
      In practice, before any laser can be used to heat a dye-donor element, the element must contain an absorbing material which absorbs at the emitting wavelength of the laser.
      <br/>
      When an infrared laser is employed, then an infrared-absorbing material may be used, such as carbon black, cyanine infrared-absorbing dyes as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,973,572, or other materials as described in the following U.S. Patents: Nos. 4,948,777; 4,950,640; 4,950,639; 4,948,776; 4,948,778; 4,942,141; 4,952,552; 5,036,040; and 4,912,083, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      The laser radiation is then absorbed into the dye layer and converted to heat by a molecular process known as internal conversion.
      <br/>
      Thus, the construction of a useful dye layer will depend not only on the hue, transferability and intensity of the image dyes, but also on the ability of the dye layer to absorb the radiation and convert it to heat.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Lasers which can be used to transfer dye from dye-donors employed in the invention are available commercially.
      <br/>
      There can be employed, for example, Laser Model SDL-2420-H2 from Spectra Diode Labs, or Laser Model SLD 304 V/W from Sony Corp.

    <p num="52">
      Spacer beads may be employed in a separate layer over the dye layer of the dye-donor in the above-described laser process in order to separate the dye-donor from the dye-receiver during dye transfer, thereby increasing the uniformity and density of the transferred image.
      <br/>
      That invention is more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,772,582, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the spacer beads may be employed in the receiving layer of the dye-receiver as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,876,235, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      The spacer beads may be coated with a polymeric binder if desired.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The use of an intermediate receiver with subsequent retransfer to a second receiving element may also be employed in the invention.
      <br/>
      A multitude of different substrates can be used to prepare the color proof (the second receiver) which is preferably the same substrate as that used for the printing press run.
      <br/>
      Thus, this one intermediate receiver can be optimized for efficient dye uptake without dye-smearing or crystallization.
    </p>
    <p num="54">Examples of substrates which may be used for the second receiving element (color proof) include the following: Flo Kote Cover.RTM. (S. D. Warren Co.), Champion Textweb.RTM. (Champion Paper Co.), Quintessence Gloss.RTM. (Potlatch Inc.), Vintage Gloss.RTM. (Potlatch Inc.), Khrome Kote.RTM. (Champion Paper Co.), Consolith Gloss.RTM. (Consolidated Papers Co.), Ad-Proof Paper.RTM. (Appleton Papers, Inc.) and Mountie Matte.RTM. (Potlatch Inc.).</p>
    <p num="55">
      As noted above, after the dye image is obtained on a first dye-receiving element, it may be retransferred to a second dye image-receiving element.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished, for example, by passing the two receivers between a pair of heated rollers.
      <br/>
      Other methods of retransferring the dye image could also be used such as using a heated platen, use of pressure and heat, external heating, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Also as noted above, in making a color proof, a set of electrical signals is generated which is representative of the shape and color of an original image.
      <br/>
      This can be done, for example, by scanning an original image, filtering the image to separate it into the desired additive primary colors, i.e., red, blue and green, and then converting the light energy into electrical energy.
      <br/>
      The electrical signals are then modified by computer to form the color separation data which are used to form a halftone color proof.
      <br/>
      Instead of scanning an original object to obtain the electrical signals, the signals may also be generated by computer.
      <br/>
      This process is described more fully in Graphic Arts Manual, Janet Field ed., Arno Press, New York 1980 (p. 358ff), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

      A thermal dye transfer assemblage of the invention comprises
      <br/>
      a) a dye-donor element as described above, and
      <br/>
      b) a dye-receiving element as described above,
    </p>
    <p num="58">the dye-receiving element being in a superposed relationship with the dye-donor element so that the dye layer of the donor element is in contact with the dye image-receiving layer of the receiving element.</p>
    <p num="59">
      The above assemblage comprising these two elements may be preassembled as an integral unit when a monochrome image is to be obtained.
      <br/>
      This may be done by temporarily adhering the two elements together at their margins.
      <br/>
      After transfer, the dye-receiving element is then peeled apart to reveal the dye transfer image.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      When a three-color image is to be obtained, the above assemblage is formed three times using different dye-donor elements.
      <br/>
      After the first dye is transferred, the elements are peeled apart.
      <br/>
      A second dye-donor element (or another area of the donor element with a different dye area) is then brought in register with the dye-receiving element and the process repeated.
      <br/>
      The third color is obtained in the same manner.
