    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a heat-fusion composition for use in a multi-layer molding (referred to a heat-fusion composition hereinafter) and a multi-layer molded body obtained by a double injection molding, an insert molding, a multi-layer extrusion or multi-layer blow molding of a heat-fusion composition and a hard resin.
      <br/>
      In more detail, the present invention relates to a multi-layer molded body containing a layer comprising a heat-fusion composition composed of a block copolymer having epoxy groups and a thermoplastic elastomer.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Hard resins and thermoplastic elastomers have been molded into a multi-layers in the conventional art.
      <br/>
      This multi-layer molding makes use of the function of elastomers such as soft feeling and slip preventive property as a surface skin material, along with integrating the elastomer into a seal material and packing material to obtain a molded body with a good water-proof property.
      <br/>
      Integrated molding can also save the cost for adhering the hard resin with the thermoplastic resin.
      <br/>
      Many molded bodies and heat-fusion compositions have been recently proposed through the attempt to improve the fusion property of the hard resins and thermoplastic elastomers.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 4-2412 proposes a multi-layer injection molded body comprising (a) an elastomer of a hydrogenated block copolymer obtained by hydrogenating a block copolymer comprising a polymer block A mainly composed of at least two vinyl aromatic compounds and a polymer block B mainly composed of at least one conjugated diene compound and (b) a resin selected from a polyolefin resin, polystyrene resin and ABS resin.
      <br/>
      However, the elastomer of hydrogenated block copolymers used in the invention cited herein has no functional groups to enhance the adhesive property, imposing a limitation in the heat-fusion property.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications No. 1-139240, No. 1-139241, No. 3-100045, No. 6-65467 and No. 6-107898 propose a method for producing a composite molded body comprising a thermoplastic elastomer composition, in which a styrene-based thermoplastic elastomer having no functional groups is combined with other thermoplastic elastomers, and a hard resin selected from polycarbonate, nylon 11, nylon 12, ABS resin and PMMA resin.</p>
    <p num="5">However, the styrene-based thermoplastic elastomers used in the invention cited herein has no functional groups to enhance the adhesive property, rendering the compositions poor adhesive property.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 8-59954 proposes a composition in which (a) a hydrogenated block copolymer obtained by hydrogenating a block copolymer comprising a polymer block A mainly composed of at least. one vinyl aromatic compound and a polymer block B mainly composed of at least one conjugated diene compound, and/or a modified hydrogenated elastomer in which the hydrogenated block copolymer is bound with a molecular unit containing a carboxylic acid group or its derivative group, (b) a polystyrene based resin and/or a polyphenylene based polymer and (c) a thermoplastic elastomer comprising an ethylene--unsaturated carboxylic acid ester copolymer are laminated on a resin mainly composed of the resin (b).
      <br/>
      Although the heat-fusion property of the modified hydrogenated block copolymer as used herein has been improved by virtue of functional groups since the resin is modified with a carboxylic acid group or its derivative group, the resin is only able to fuse with so-called modified PPO resins.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, developments of a heat-fusion resin being able to fuse with an wider range of resins are desired.

The present invention also provides a heat-fusion composition containing (d) 0.01 to 25 parts by weight of a polyfunctional compound containing at least two functional groups reactive to the epoxy group in the molecule and/or (e) 0.001 to 2 parts by weight of an accelerating agent for the curing reaction of epoxy groups per 100 parts by weight of the heat-fusion composition.

    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The present invention will now be described in more detail hereinafter.
      <br/>
      The heat-fusion composition according to the present invention is characterized by containing a block copolymer (a) having epoxy groups.
      <br/>
      The heat-fusion composition according to the present invention also comprises a block copolymer (a) having epoxy groups and a thermoplastic elastomer.
      <br/>
      The heat-fusion composition according to the present invention further comprises a block copolymer (a) having epoxy groups, for example, an epoxydized block copolymer obtained by epoxydizing a block copolymer comprising a polymer block mainly composed of a vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon compound and a polymer block mainly composed of a conjugated diene compound or a hydrogenation product of the foregoing polymer block, and a thermoplastic elastomer (b), for example at least one kind of elastomer selected from styrene elastomers, polyurethane elastomers, polyester elastomers, polyamide elastomers, polyolefin elastomers and polyvinyl chloride elastomers.
    </p>
    <p num="13">The heat-fusion composition according to the present invention has a good heat-fusion property with a hard resin, forming the multi-layer molded body composed of a layer comprising the heat-fusion composition and a layer comprising the hard resin into a strongly heat-adhered molded body with each other.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Vinyl aromatic compounds as one component of the polymer block constituting the block copolymer (a) having epoxy groups can be selected, for example, from at least one of the compounds comprising styrene, a-methylstyrene, vinyltoluene, p-tert-butylstyrene, divinylbenzene, p-methylstyrene and 1,1-diphenylstyrene.
      <br/>
      Styreneis preferable among them.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Conjugated diene compounds as components of the other polymer block constituting the block copolymer (a) can be selected, for example, from at least one of the compounds comprising butadiene, isoprene, 1,3-pentadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, 3-butyl-1,3-octadiene and phenyl-1,3-butadiene.
      <br/>
      Butadiene and isoprene, and a combination thereof are preferable among them.
      <br/>
      The block copolymer as used herein refers to a block copolymer comprising a polymer block A mainly composed of a vinyl aromatic compound and a polymer block B mainly composed of a conjugated diene compound.
      <br/>
      A weight ratio of copolymerization between the vinyl aromatic compound and conjugated diene compound is in the range of 5/95 to 70/30, the range of 10/90 to 60/40 being preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The number average molecular weight of the block copolymer to be used in the present invention is in the range of 5,000 to 600,000, preferably in the range of 10,000 to 500,000, and the molecular weight distribution (the ratio (Mw/Mn) between the weight average molecular weight (Mw) and number average molecular weight (Mn)) is 10 or less.
      <br/>
      The block copolymer may have a linear, branched or radial molecular structure, or a combination thereof.
      <br/>
      For example, the block copolymer is represented by a block copolymer of a vinyl aromatic compound and conjugated diene compound having a structure such as A-B-A, B-A-B-A, (A-B-)4 Si or A-B-A-B-A.
      <br/>
      The unsaturated bonds in the conjugated diene of the block copolymer may be partially hydrogenated.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Any production methods can be adopted as the methods for producing the block copolymer to be used in the present invention, provided that the copolymer obtained has the structure as described above.
      <br/>
      For example, a block copolymer of a vinyl aromatic compound and conjugated diene compound can be synthesized in an inert solvent using a lithium catalyst or the like in accordance with the methods disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publications No. 40-23798, No. 47-3252, No. 48-2423, No. 46-32415, No. 49-36957, No. 43-17979and No 56-28925, Japanese Patent Application No. 49-105970 and No. 50-27094, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 59-166518. According to the method disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publications No. 42-8704 and No. 43-6636, or in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 59-133203, the partially hydrogenated block copolymers to be used in the present invention can be synthesized by a hydrogenation in an inert solvent in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst.
      <br/>
      The epoxydized block copolymers to be used in the present invention are obtained by epoxydizing the foregoing block copolymers in the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The epoxydized block copolymer (otherwise, referred to a epoxy-modified block copolymer) in the present invention can be obtained by allowing the foregoing block copolymer to react with an epoxydizing agent such as hydroperoxides or peroxy acids in an inert solvent.
      <br/>
      Examples of the peroxy acids include performic acid, peracetic acid or perbenzoic acid, a catalytic effect being able to obtain by using either one of these peroxy acids or a mixture thereof together with hydrogen peroxide, or by using an organic acid together with hydrogen peroxide, or by using molybdenum hexacarbonyl together with tert-butyl hydroperoxide.
      <br/>
      The optimum amount of the epoxydizing agent can be determined depending on variables such as the kind of respective epoxydizing agent to be used, the required degree of epoxydation and the kind of respective block copolymer to be used.
    </p>
    <p num="19">The epoxydized block copolymer obtained can be isolated by an appropriate method, for example by precipitating in a poor solvent, by evaporating the solvent off after introducing the polymer into hot water with stirring, or by directly removing the solvent.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The degree of epoxydation is determined, after titrating with 0.1 N hydrobromic acid, by the following equation:
      <br/>
      Epoxy equivalent=(10.000 * W)/(V * f)
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      wherein W, V and f denote the weight (g) of the epoxydized block copolymer, the titration volume with hydrobromic acid and the factor of the hydrobromic acid solution, respectively.
      <br/>
      The smaller the calculated value is, the higher the degree of epoxydation.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The epoxy equivalent of the epoxydized block copolymer according to the present invention is 140 to 10,000, the equivalent of 200 to 6,000 being especially preferable.
      <br/>
      It is not preferable that the degree of epoxydation is too high since a gelation product is formed during processing of the heat-fusion composition obtained to result in a poor appearance while, when the degree of epoxydation is too low, heat-fusion of the composition ascribed to epoxy groups can not be expected.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The thermoplastic elastomer to be used in the constituent (b) of the heat-fusion composition will be described hereinafter.
      <br/>

      An injection molding machine, extruder, blow molding machine or a combined molding machine thereof is used for molding the heat-fusion composition and hard resin according to the present invention into a multi-layers.
      <br/>
      A method for using a double (or two color) molding machine and an insert molding method are used in molding different materials into a multi-layers using an injection molding machine.
      <br/>
      In the method using the double injection molding machine, a die for the primary material (a hard resin) and a die for the secondary material (a heat-fusion composition) are disposed to alternately extrude the different resins from the two heated cylinders.
      <br/>
      A die for the double molding is classified into core-rotation method and core-back method.
      <br/>
      In the core-rotation method, only the movable part of the primary material die is rotated by 180 (degree)  C. to make the primary molded body molded at first to transfer to the cavity part of the secondary material die to be used in the subsequent injection and, after forming a space for filling the secondary material following die clamping, the secondary material is filled into the space to subject to heat-fusion, thereby obtaining a multi-layer molded body.
      <br/>
      In the core-back method, on the other hand, a slide core is assembled in the die to firstly inject the primary material by allowing the core to advance and, after allowing the core to recede, the secondary material is injected into the cavity formed to subject to heat-fusion, thereby obtaining a multi-layer molded body.
      <br/>
      A combined method of these two methods has been developed, or a method for simultaneously obtaining the multi-layer molded body from the two cylinders are being developed.
      <br/>
      The multi-layer molded body according to the present invention may be produced by the method using the double molding machine, irrespective of the methods.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      In the method by the insert molding, the primary material is previously molded, which is inserted into the die followed by injecting the secondary material to make the first and second materials to heat-fuse to obtain a multi-layer molded body.
      <br/>
      Although this method is favored in its low die cost, the degree of molecular interlock between the primary and secondary materials is low since the surface of the primary material has been already hardened, exhibiting a low heat-fusion property.
      <br/>
      While a multi-layer molded body having a high heat-fusion property is expected by using the method described above, this insert molding method is made possible to obtain a multi-layer molded body having a high heat-fusion property in the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Conventional multi-layer extrusion molding machine is used in the method for molding different materials into a multi-layers using an extrusion molding machine.
      <br/>
      The method for molding different materials into a multi-layer using a blow molding machine is classified into two methods of multi-layer extrusion blow molding in which parisons are formed by co-extrusion and multi-layer injection blow molding in which parisons are formed by co-injection.
      <br/>
      The method for using the conventional multi-layer extrusion blow molding machine can be used for the multi-layer molded body according to the present invention irrespective of the methods.

      Each heat-fusion composition and hard resin were heat-fused with each other in the blending proportions shown in TABLE 1 to 2 and TABLE 3 to 4 using the epoxydized block copolymer (a-l) with a dual-layer extrusion molding machine with a diameter of 30 mm.
      <br/>
      The results of measurements were as shown in Table 3 to 4.
      <br/>
      The heat-fusion property tends to be higher when the blending proportion of the epoxydized block copolymer is larger with a few exceptions.

      The results of measurements were as shown in TABLE 8 to 10.
      <br/>
      Although the heat-fusion property is speculated to be low in the insert molding with a low surface temperature of the primary material (a hard resin) since the degree of molecular interlock with the secondary material (a heat-fusion composition) is small, the multi-layer molded body according to the present invention exhibits a high heat-fusion property.

      The results of measurements were as shown in TABLE 14 to 16.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      The heat fusion property becomes lower in the sample with a blending ratio of the epoxydized block copolymer of less than 20% by weight.
