    <p num="7">
      FIGS. 1-4 represent fabrication stages of a diode bar mounting structure according to the aforementioned Karpinski U.S. Pat. No. 5,040,187. FIG. 1 shows a dielectric substrate layer 10, typically of beryllium oxide (BeO), with parallel grooves 12 in its face.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, a metalization layer 11 is formed on the substrate 10 and in the grooves 12.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 3, the layer 11 is cut at the bottom of each groove 12 by a disk saw or the like.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4, a laser diode bar 13 is inserted and soldered into each groove 12.
      <br/>
      The metalization layer 11 is cut at the bottom of each groove to break its electrical continuity so current will go through the inserted diode bar 13 and will not be short circuited around it.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 includes a blown-up view of a single groove 12 and diode bar 13 for a clearer showing of detail.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      FIGS. 5-8 represent fabrication stages of a diode bar mounting structure according to the aforementioned Karpinski U.S. Pat. No. 5,128,951. FIG. 5 shows a dielectric substrate layer 10, typically of beryllium oxide (BeO), with an overlying conductor layer 14.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 6, parallel grooves 12 are cut through the conductor layer 14 and into the dielectric substrate layer 10.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 7, a metalization layer 11 is deposited on the conductor 14 and in the grooves 12.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 8, a laser diode bar 13 is inserted and soldered into each groove 12.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 also includes a blown-up view of a single groove 12 and diode bar 13.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In the prior art just described, the grooves 12 are typically cut by a disk saw.
      <br/>
      Cutting the grooves 12 with a disk saw makes it inherent that their sidewalls are parallel for most or all of their depth, as shown in FIGS. 1-4 and 6-8, and that they can only converge at their bottoms.
      <br/>
      The bottoms of such grooves might be flat, or they might be somewhat curved or tapered as shown, but they cannot be wider than their upper portions.
      <br/>
      A potential problem with bar grooves of such a configuration is illustrated in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      With the inwardly tapered bar groove 12 shown there, it is possible for excess solder to migrate by capillary action and collect in a pool 31 under the bottom of a diode bar 13, forming a short circuit around the diode bar.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      FIGS. 9-12 represent fabrication stages of a diode bar mounting structure according to this invention.
      <br/>
      The structure includes a dielectric substrate 20, preferably of beryllium oxide, and an overlying conductor layer 21, preferably of copper.
      <br/>
      The conductor layer 21 is segmented by a number of parallel diode bar spaces 22 cut through it A diode bar 23 is mounted and soldered into each space, so that the segmented layer 21 and diode bars 23 together form a path for electric current.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The diode bar spaces 22 are preferably cut through the conductor layer 21 by electric discharge machining.
      <br/>
      Electric discharge machining is an electrolytic process in which a consumable cathode electrode wire 30 is moved into an anode workpiece, electrically discharging metal from the anode workpiece.
      <br/>
      The traveling electrode wire 30 is fed continually as it is partially consumed.
      <br/>
      The process is flushed with deionized water as it proceeds.
      <br/>
      Electric discharge machining is a known machining process and a thorough discussion of it is not necessary here.
      <br/>
      For the present purpose, electric discharge machining can be thought of as analogous to cutting cheese with a wire.
      <br/>
      The analogy may be simplistic, but it provides a spatial concept of the cutting action.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The diode bar spaces 22 are formed with generally parallel upper sidewalls 24 and flared out bottom portions 25.
      <br/>
      The electrode wire 30 makes this possible.
      <br/>
      The configuration of the diode bar space 22 is determined by the path of the traveling electrode wire 30, and that path is relatively unconstrained.
      <br/>
      This is a fundamental difference between this invention and prior art bar grooves cut by a disk saw.
      <br/>
      As stated earlier, it is inherent that a groove cut with a disk saw cannot be wider at the bottom than at the top.
      <br/>
      The cutting path of a disk saw is inherently limited by the structure of the disk itself.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The traveling electrode wire 30 may be of such diameter that a single pass of the wire will create a bar space 22 suitable for insertion of a laser diode bar 23.
      <br/>
      It is preferably of a smaller diameter as shown in FIG. 10, in which case the wire 30 will cut down one side of the bar space and up the other side, with the resulting cut-out piece flushed out by water.
      <br/>
      The path of the wire defines the shape of the bar space.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In FIG. 11, a metalization layer 26 is deposited on the conductive layer 21 to aid the soldering process.
      <br/>
      Metalization might consist of several layers of differing metals or metal alloys.
      <br/>
      The final layer is typically gold or a gold alloy.
      <br/>
      Gold prevents oxides from forming on the metal layers under it.
      <br/>
      Gold also enhances the flow of solder over its surface, providing a wicking effect between laser diode bars 23 and the inside surfaces of bar spaces 22.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Laser diode bars 23 are fixed in place in the bar spaces 22 by solder.
      <br/>
      The flared out bottom 25 of the bar space 22 (FIG. 12) provides an expanded and flat cavity for solder, as compared with the constricted and concave space available in prior art grooves (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      The flared out bottom 25 of the bar space 22 of this invention prevents solder from pooling as in FIG. 4, or minimizes the likelihood of such pooling.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Electric discharge machining works only on a conductive workpiece.
      <br/>
      Consequently, another advantage of the technique of this invention is that the traveling electrode wire 30 cuts into and through the conductor layer 21 but does not cut or otherwise affect the dielectric substrate 20.
      <br/>
      As a result, the bottoms 25 of bar spaces 22, in addition to being expanded or flared out, are assured to be flat and not concave.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      FIGS. 13-16 represent fabrication stages of a diode bar mounting structure in a second form of this invention.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 13, cavities are first formed in a dielectric substrate 20 as shown in three examples 27, 28, 29.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 14, a conductor layer 21 is added and bar spaces 22 with generally parallel upper sidewalls 24 are cut through it.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 15, a metalization layer 26 is deposited on the conductor layer 21 and particularly on the upper sidewalls 24 to aid the next step.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 16, a diode bar 23 is soldered into each bar space 22.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      FIGS. 17-19 represent fabrication stages of a diode bar mounting structure in a third form of this invention.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 17, bar slots 32 with generally parallel upper sidewalls 34 are cut into a dielectric substrate 20, and an expanded cavity 35 is cut along the bottom of each bar slot 32 by a microdrill, needle file, wire saw, or the like.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 18, a metalization layer 36 is deposited on the dielectric substrate 20 and bar slots 32 by a vacuum deposition process.
      <br/>
      In this form of the invention, the metalization layer 36 is not only to aid the soldering process; it is also the conductor layer.
      <br/>
      It serves the same function here as the separate conductor layers 21 in the embodiments of FIGS. 9-12 and 13-16.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 19, a diode bar 23 is soldered into each bar slot 32.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The enlarged view of FIG. 19 shows that the expanded bottom cavity 35 has side surface areas 37 where metalization and solder does not attach.
      <br/>
      This is because metalization is applied by a vacuum deposition process in which metal is sprayed in a direct line of sight.
      <br/>
      The bottom area 38 of the bottom cavity 35 is within sight of the metal spray, so metalization and excess solder will attach there.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The dielectric material 20 (including side surface areas 37 in FIG. 19) is repellant to solder in a way that is analagous to the mutual repulsion of grease and water.
      <br/>
      The metal surfaces (26 in FIG. 12 and FIG. 16, and 36 in FIG. 19) are receptive to solder.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The term "overlying conductor" in this specification includes conductive film formed by metalization on a substrate, and conductive sheet or plate placed on a substrate. "Conductor" and "conductive", unless otherwise qualified, mean electical conductor and electrically conductive, respectively.</p>
    <p num="22">
      "Upper", "lower", "top", "bottom", "over", "under", and like terms are used herein with reference to structural orientations illustrated (for example) in FIGS. 11, 15, and 18.
      <br/>
      Such terms will retain their meanings regardless of physical orientation of the described structure.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the device in FIG. 11 (for example) is turned "upside down", the bar space opening is still the "top", and its flared portion is still the "bottom".
