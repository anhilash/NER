    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to safety methods and apparatus for construction sites and the like, and more specifically, to safety nets designed to limit the fall of debris and thereby reduce the likelihood of bodily injury and/or property damage.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The use of safety nets is well known in the construction industry.
      <br/>
      Such nets are typically positioned in a generally horizontal orientation to prevent objects from falling from an elevated height onto objects and/or people positioned below the net.
      <br/>
      Such nets are typically supported by beams and/or columns on the building under construction or repair.
      <br/>
      Cables or other intermediate or supplemental supports may be interconnected between the net and the building to provide a more secure arrangement.
      <br/>
      For example, border ropes are often secured about the perimeter of the net to enhance the structural integrity of both the net and its connection points with the building.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Generally speaking, conventional safety nets are manufactured in specific sizes and designed to accommodate particular applications.
      <br/>
      The nets must be strong and mounted with sufficient tension to ensure reliable retention of falling objects.
      <br/>
      In order to accommodate various building sizes, construction companies and/or their suppliers must maintain a large inventory of nets of various shapes and sizes.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      An object of the present invention is to provide a safety net capable of spanning areas of various sizes and configurations without compromising performance.
      <br/>
      Additional objects of the present invention are to provide an adjustable safety net which is cost effective to manufacture and to provide an adjustable safety net which is easy to use.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention may be generally described as an adjustable safety net having effective dimensions which are readily adjustable to accommodate dimensional constraints for various applications.
      <br/>
      A preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a netting panel circumscribed by a flexible border rope which defines a reinforced perimeter.
      <br/>
      The net spans or extends across the area or opening defined by the border rope and thereby defines a netting panel, and the edges of the netting panel are secured to the border rope.
      <br/>
      The netting panel and the border rope cooperate to define a substantially planar member having a generally rectangular shape.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Net adjuster units are spaced along one or more sides of the rectangular perimeter to selectively reduce the operational dimensions of the adjustable safety net.
      <br/>
      Each net adjuster unit comprises a web-like strap and a buckle for adjusting the effective length of the strap.
      <br/>
      The net adjuster units are mounted to the border rope and operable to reduce the distance between opposed sides of the safety net.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      On one version of the invention, each strap has an intermediate portion which is looped about the border rope, a first end portion which is connected to a buckle, and a second, distal end portion.
      <br/>
      Each distal end portion is threaded through a desired opening in the net and then secured to a respective buckle to gather and bind the portion of net disposed between the desired opening and the border rope.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="13">
      The present invention provides an adjustable safety net adapted for use in relation to a support structure for purposes of preventing objects from falling off the support structure.
      <br/>
      The effective dimensions of the safety net are readily adjustable so that the same net may be installed and used in a wide variety of applications involving different dimensional constraints.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      A first embodiment of the present invention is designated as 11 in FIGS. 1-5. The safety net 11 may be described as a flexible netting panel 12 having elongate net cords or strands 14 which extend in generally perpendicular directions and cooperate to define an array of openings 16 therebetween.
      <br/>
      The net cords 14 are interconnected at their intersections by knots or other suitable means known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      A flexible border rope 18 extends about the perimeter of the netting panel 12 and is secured thereto.
      <br/>
      The border rope 18 is preferably a flexible woven material having a relatively larger diameter and relatively greater strength than any one net cord 14.
      <br/>
      As such, the border rope 18 provides both reinforcement for the netting panel 12 and a suitable means for connecting the net 11 to a support structure.
      <br/>
      The border rope 18 is connected to the netting panel 12 by laces 20, although other suitable means, including weaving of the rope 18 relative to the cords 14, may be used in lieu of or in combination with the laces 20.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The present invention may be applied to nets of various configurations.
      <br/>
      For ease of discussion, the present invention is described with reference to a rectangular configuration which spans an area defined by a width and a length.
      <br/>
      In this regard, the net 11 has two opposing pairs of equal length sides, and the border rope 18 extends about all four sides to define a continuous perimeter.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Net adjuster units 22 are provided on the net 11 at spaced apart locations along two adjacent sides of the perimeter.
      <br/>
      Each net adjuster unit 22 comprises a web-like strap 24 and a buckle 26.
      <br/>
      The buckle 26 is a conventional buckle having opposed end bars 28 and an intermediate bar 30.
      <br/>
      One end of the strap 24 is formed into a closed loop 31 about the intermediate bar 30 of the buckle 26.
      <br/>
      The other end 25 of the strap 24 remains free.
      <br/>
      An intermediate portion of the strap 24 is formed into a closed loop 32 by stitching 34 or other means known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Each net adjuster unit 22 may be connected to the border rope 18 by positioning the intermediate loop 32 and the buckle end of the strap 24 on opposite sides of the border rope 18 and inserting the buckle end of the strap 24 through the intermediate loop 32 to form a closed loop about the border rope 18.
      <br/>
      Other suitable connecting means, including laces, may be used in lieu of this arrangement.
      <br/>
      Mounting clips 36 are connected to the border rope 18 at spaced apart locations about the perimeter of the net 11.
      <br/>
      The mounting clips 36 may be described as self-closing carabiners but could be replaced by other suitable means which may or may not be connected in like fashion to the border rope 18.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The effective span of the net 11 is selectively reduced by capturing inward portions of the netting panel 12 and retaining same in proximity to the border ropes 18.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the loose ends 25 of the adjuster units 22 are threaded through selected openings 16 in the netting panel 12 and then connected to respective buckles 26 in such a manner that the loop defined therebetween is as small as possible.
      <br/>
      The intermediate net cords 14, disposed between the selected openings 16 and the border rope 18 may be gathered and ordered in pleated fashion to provide a relatively secure connection.
      <br/>
      The process is performed on only one side of the net 11 if only one dimension requires reduction but may be performed on two adjacent sides of the net 11 if both dimensions require reduction.
      <br/>
      In any event, the appropriately sized net is subsequently mounted to a support structure in the same manner as a conventional net would be.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 illustrates the difference between a first, fully extend net configuration 11A and a second, relatively smaller net configuration 11B.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Working models of the net 11 were tested and performed satisfactorily.
      <br/>
      In particular, three commercially available nets measuring twenty feet by thirty feet (sold as model number 120/350D by SINCO, Inc. of Middletown, Conn.) were modified like the net 11 shown in FIG. 4 to span an area measuring only seventeen feet by twenty-four feet.
      <br/>
      A three hundred and fifty pound bag of sand was dropped fifty feet onto each net (at a different location on each net), and in each case, the net prevented the load from reaching the ground.
      <br/>
      The test nets would sustain a comparable load when fully extended to span an area measuring twenty feet by thirty feet.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Once the viability of the present invention is established, other possible embodiments are likely to be derived and/or put into practice by those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, the foregoing embodiment 11 may be modified by substituting commercially available plastic "cinch" connectors for the adjuster units 22.
      <br/>
      Such connectors have teeth disposed along an elongate strip and a closed loop disposed at one end of the strip.
      <br/>
      The strip may be inserted into the loop but resists removal therefrom.
      <br/>
      Another possible modification is to substitute rigid snap hooks, carabiners, or the like for the adjuster units 22.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Still another alternative means for transforming a net between multiple configurations is described with reference to an embodiment of the present invention which is designated as 111 in FIGS. 6-9. The safety net 111 may likewise be described in terms of a flexible netting panel 112 having crisscrossing net cords or stands 114 which cooperate to define an array of openings 116 therebetween.
      <br/>
      The net cords 114 are interconnected at their intersections by knots or other suitable means known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Net adjuster units 122 are spaced along the sides of the adjustable safety net 111 and extend between opposite sides thereof.
      <br/>
      On the embodiment shown in FIG. 6, adjuster units 122 are disposed about the perimeter of the netting panel 112 and function as the border rope, as well.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Each adjuster unit 122 includes first and second end strap sections 123, and an intermediate strap section 125 adjustably connected therebetween.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 7, with reference to one of the two identical end strap sections 123 associated with the adjuster unit 122, each end strap section 123 is formed to provide a first end loop 132 which is secured about a respective border rope 122 and supports a respective clip 36.
      <br/>
      Each end strap section 123 is also formed to provide a second end loop 131 which is secured about the intermediate bar 30 of a respective buckle 26.
      <br/>
      Each intermediate strap 125 has a first end which is adjustably connected to the buckle 26 on one of the two end strap sections 123, and a second end which is adjustably connected to the buckle 26 on the other of the two end strap sections 123.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The adjuster units 122 (including those which function as border ropes and those which are disposed inward of the perimeter) are connected to the netting panel 112 by weaving in and out of the openings 116 between the cords 114.
      <br/>
      At each corner of the netting panel 112, the loop 132 on one of the adjuster units 122 is inserted through the loop 132 on an adjacent adjuster unit 122.
      <br/>
      The adjuster units 122 may be collectively described as two groups of straps which extend in perpendicular directions to form an orthogonal adjustment grid.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The effective span of the net 111 is selectively reduced by reducing the length of the adjuster units 122.
      <br/>
      More specifically, one or both of the ends 127 on each intermediate strap section 125 is pulled to a greater extent through a respective buckle 26 on a respective end strap section 123.
      <br/>
      The process is performed in only one direction relative to the net 111 if only one dimension requires reduction but may be performed in both orthogonal directions if both dimensions require reduction.
      <br/>
      In any event, the appropriately sized net is subsequently mounted to a support structure in the same manner as a conventional net would be.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The provision of buckles 26 near each end of each adjuster unit 122 is intended to place the adjustment means within reach along each side of the perimeter.
      <br/>
      In the alternative, only a single buckle 26 may be provided for each adjuster unit, in which case only one strap section has a buckle, and one other strap section extends across the netting panel 112 and engages same.
      <br/>
      In other words, the strap 125 shown in FIGS. 7-9 could extend to an opposite end strap section 123, or it could extend all the way to the opposite side border rope and be connected directly thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In either case, a mounting clip 36 is connected to each closed loop 132 to facilitate mounting of the safety net 111 to a support structure.
      <br/>
      Mounting clips 36 may be mounted to the strap sections 123 and/or 125 of the border ropes in lieu of or in addition to those on the closed loops 132.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Working models of the net 111 were tested and performed satisfactorily.
      <br/>
      In particular, three commercially available nets measuring twenty feet by thirty feet (sold as model number 120/350D by SINCO, Inc. of Middletown, Conn.) were modified like the net 111 shown in FIG. 6 and then reduced in size to span an area measuring only seventeen feet by twenty-four feet.
      <br/>
      A three hundred and fifty pound bag of sand was dropped fifty feet onto each net (at a different location on each net), and in each case, the net prevented the load from reaching the ground.
      <br/>
      As previously noted, the test nets would sustain a comparable load when fully extended to span an area measuring twenty feet by thirty feet.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The range of possible alternative embodiments is further emphasized by the depiction of yet another variation of the present invention in FIG. 10. The adjustable safety net system designated as 211 includes a netting panel 212 comprised of strands 214 which are interconnected in interlacing fashion and define a matrix of openings.
      <br/>
      A border rope 218 is secured to the strands 214 and extends about the perimeter of the panel 212.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Net adjuster units 222 are disposed along at least one side of the panel 212 to selectively adjust at least one dimension thereof.
      <br/>
      The adjuster units 222 include a hook portion 224 suitable for retaining one or more of the strands 214, and a base portion 226 suitable for mounting on the support structure which the net 211 will span (by bolts, for example).
      <br/>
      In the embodiment 211, the hook portion 224 and the base portion 226 are opposing walls on a U-shaped member.
      <br/>
      A latch 228 is pivotally connected to a distal end of the base portion 226 and is biased into engagement with a distal end of the hook portion 224.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The latch 228 cooperates with the U-shaped member to define a closed loop.
      <br/>
      The border rope 218 is disposed inside the loop together with a select number of strands 214.
      <br/>
      The remainder of the netting panel 212 is maintained in tension between the hook portions 224 and the border rope 218 on the opposite side of the net 211.
      <br/>
      An optional strap 230 is secured to the distal end of the hook portion 224 to facilitate gathering of the excess netting strands 214 in a given application.
      <br/>
      A distal end of the strap 230 is threaded about a desired strand 214 and then pulled toward the adjuster unit 222 to encourage the desired strand 214 to travel about the distal end of the hook portion 224.
