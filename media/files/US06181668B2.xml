      The optical pickup device includes a two wavelength semiconductor laser (23) selectively generating a laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm and laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm, a collimator lens (24), a hologram (25) formed on a surface of collimator lens (24), a polarizing glass (22) having an annular polarizing region (40) and an objective lens (21).
      <br/>
      Hologram (25) does not diffract the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm, and diffracts outward the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm.
      <br/>
      Therefore, virtual light source of the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm comes closer to the collimator lens (24) than the light source of the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm.
      <br/>
      Therefore, objective lens (21) focuses the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm on a recording surface of a transparent substrate (31) of a DVD, and focuses the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm on a recording surface of a transparent substrate (32) of a CD-R.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the optical pickup device is capable of reproducing both DVD and CD-R having transparent substrates of different thicknesses.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to an optical pickup device, and more specifically, to an optical pickup device for recording and/or reproducing digital video disc (DVD) and compact disc (CD).</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      An optical device for reading information recorded on an optical disc having a transparent substrate of about of 1.2 mm in thickness, such as a CD, by using a semiconductor laser has been provided.
      <br/>
      In such an optical pickup device, focus servo and tracking servo control for an objective lens of the pickup device is performed, a pit string on the recording surface is irradiated with laser beam, whereby audio, video and data signals are reproduced.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Referring to FIG. 91, in a recordable compact disc (CD-R) 150 which is one type of CDs, cyanine dye 152 is provided on a recording surface side of transparent substrate 151, and gold 153 is further provided.
      <br/>
      CD-R has the same track pitch, recording density and pit length as those of a general CD for music, and the CD-R is different from the CD for music only in that it allows one recording.
      <br/>
      Recording is done by irradiating cyanine dye 152 with laser beam through transparent substrate 151.
      <br/>
      When cyanine dye 152 is irradiated with laser beam, optical characteristic of the irradiated portion becomes uneven.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, at a portion not irradiated with laser beam at the time of recording, most laser beam is reflected by gold 153 at the time of reproduction, while at portions irradiated with laser beam at the time of recording, laser beam is hardly reflected at the time of reproduction.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Recently, density has been increased in order to record a motion picture for a long period of time on such an optical disc.
      <br/>
      For example, a DVD allowing recording of information of about 5 G byte on one side having the same diameter of 12 cm as the CD has been proposed.
      <br/>
      Thickness of the transparent substrate of the DVD is about 0.6 mm. One DVD formed by adhering two transparent substrates back to back allows recording of information of about 10 G byte.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      However, the aforementioned pickup objective lens is designed taking into consideration the thickness of the transparent substrate of the optical disc of interest and wavelength of semiconductor laser used.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when an optical disc having a thickness different from the design is to be reproduced, laser beam is not focused on the recording surface of the optical disc, and hence reproduction is not possible.
      <br/>
      For example, an objective lens designed for a CD having transparent substrate of 1.2 mm in thickness is not capable of focusing laser beam on the recording surface of a DVD having a transparent substrate 0.6 mm in thickness.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In CD-R 150 employing cyanine dye 152 mentioned above, maximum reflectance is attained when the laser beam has the wavelength of 800 nm, while reflectance is not higher than 10% when the laser beam has the wavelength of 635 nm, as shown in FIG. 92. Accordingly, reproduction of a CD-R is not possible by the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm which is used for reproduction of a DVD.
      <br/>
      In order to reproduce the CD-R with the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm, it may be possible to use dye having higher reflectance to the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm in place of cyanine dye 152.
      <br/>
      However, it is not practical to change CD-R standard to be in line with the DVD.

The laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm is refracted at the surfaces of lenses 272 and 273, and in addition, at interfaces between each of lenses 272 and 273 and cyanine dye 274.
      <br/>
      Therefore, as shown by the dotted line in FIG. 29, the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm enters objective lens 21 not collimated but slightly enlarged.
      <br/>
      Therefore, objective lens 21 focuses the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm on a position different from that of the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm.

      In place of bifocal collimator lens 271 described above, a bifocal collimator lens 300 such as shown in FIG. 30 may be used.
      <br/>
      Bifocal collimator lens 300 includes a lens 301, a lens 302 provided opposing to lens 301, a transparent electrode 303 formed on an inner surface of lens 301, a transparent electrode 304 formed on an inner surface of lens 302, and a TN liquid crystal 305 sandwiched between transparent electrodes 303 and 304.

      A liquid crystal driving circuit 306 formed of an oscillating circuit is provided for driving TN liquid crystal 305.
      <br/>
      When reproduction of a CD-R is to be performed, that is, when the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm is incident on bifocal collimator lens 300, liquid crystal driving circuit 306 applies a prescribed voltage between transparent electrodes 303 and 304.

      As shown in FIG. 31(a), when voltage is not applied between transparent electrodes 303 and 304, TN liquid crystal 305 has refractive index of 1.50, and therefore, bifocal collimator lens 300 functions in the similar manner a single collimator lens 254.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 31(b), when a prescribed voltage is applied between transparent electrodes 303 and 304, refractive index of TN liquid crystal 305 as a whole changes to 1.65, and therefore incidence light beam is refracted not only at the surfaces of lenses 301 and 302 but also at interface between each of lenses 301 and 302 and TN liquid crystal 305.

      When DVD is to be reproduced, that is, when the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm enters bifocal collimator lens 300, voltage is not applied between transparent electrodes 303 and 304.

      Therefore, bifocal collimator lens 300 collimates the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm and guides the laser beam to objective lens 21, as represented by the solid line in FIG. 32. When a CD-R is to be reproduced, that is, when the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm enters bifocal collimator lens 300, a prescribed voltage is applied between transparent electrodes 303 and 304.

      Therefore, bifocal collimator lens 300 guides the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm not collimated but slightly expanded, as represented by the dotted line in FIG. 32. Therefore, objective lens 21 focuses the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm on a position different from that of the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm.

      Relation between the applied voltage and refractive index of the TN liquid crystal is shown in FIG. 33. The voltage at which refractive index of TN liquid crystal 305 begins to increase from 1.50 and the voltage at which the refractive index is saturated at 1.65 may be set freely.

      Referring to FIG. 36(a), when a voltage is not applied between the stripe transparent electrodes 351 and 352, refractive index of TN liquid crystal 305 as a whole is 1.50. However, referring to FIG. 36(b), when a prescribed voltage is applied between the stripe transparent electrodes 351 and 352, refractive index of TN liquid crystal 305 changes partially.

      More specifically, refractive indexes of 1.50 and 1.65 appear as linear stripes.

    <p num="122">According to Embodiment 16, since transparent electrodes 351 and 352 are pattern as linear stripes, TN liquid crystal 305 has further polarization selectivity.</p>

      According to Embodiment 17, since transparent electrode 371 is patterned as a concentrical stripes, TN liquid crystal further functions as a hologram.

    <p num="128">Referring to FIG. 38, optical pickup device 13 in accordance with Embodiment 18 of the present invention is characterized in that it includes a solar cell 382, an optical filter 381 attached to a light receiving surface of solar cell 382 and liquid crystal driving circuit 306 for driving TN liquid crystal 305 of bifocal collimator lens 300 using power supplied from solar cell 382.</p>
    <p num="129">
      Optical filter 381 intercepts laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm and transmits laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm.

      In place of optical filter 381 having such wavelength selectivity, a polarizing optical filter of which direction of polarization matches the direction of polarization of the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm may be used.

    <p num="130">
      As shown in FIG. 39, solar cell 382 includes a transparent substrate 383 formed of glass, polycarbonate, plastic film or the like, and a plurality of photocells 384 formed on a main surface of transparent substrate 383.
      <br/>
      Optical filter 381 is formed on a surface opposite to the main surface of transparent substrate 383.

    <p num="131">
      Each of photocells 384 includes a transparent electrode 385 formed of ITO, SnO2, ZnO or the like formed on the main surface of transparent substrate 383, an amorphous silicon (a-Si) layer 386 having a PIN structure formed on transparent electrode 385, and a back plate 387 formed of aluminum, silver or the like.

      Each photocell 384 converts optical energy of the laser beam which has passed optical filter 381 to electric energy.

      The plurality of photocells 384 are connected in series.

      Again referring to FIG. 38, when a DVD is to be reproduced, laser element 61 generates the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm.

      Part of the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm is reflected by half mirror 255, and the remaining part is transmitted through half mirror 255.
      <br/>
      However, the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm is not transmitted through optical filter 381, and therefore photocells 382 does not generate any voltage.
      <br/>
      As a result, liquid crystal driving circuit 306 does not operate, and hence TN liquid crystal 305 in bifocal collimator lens 300 has refractive index of 1.50. Therefore, the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm reflected at half mirror 255 is collimated by bifocal collimator lens 300.

    <p num="134">
      Meanwhile, when a CD-R is to be reproduced, laser element 62 generates laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm.
      <br/>
      Part of the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm is reflected by half mirror 255, and the remaining part is transmitted through half mirror 255.
      <br/>
      The laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm which has been transmitted through half mirror 255 is also transmitted through optical filter 381, and therefore solar cell 382 supplies power to liquid crystal driving circuit 306.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, refractive index of TN liquid crystal 305 of bifocal collimator lens 300 changes to 1.65. Therefore, the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm reflected by half mirror 255 is refracted to expand slightly from parallel, by bifocal collimator lens 300.
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      According to Embodiment 18, the laser beam which has been transmitted through half mirror 255 is effectively utilized by solar cell 382 to drive TN liquid crystal 305, and therefore it is not necessary to externally supply any power to drive TN liquid crystal 305.
      <br/>
      Further, since there is provided optical filter 381 selectively transmitting laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm only, the point of focus of bifocal collimator lens 300 is switched automatically.

    <p num="156">According to Embodiment 22, since photodetector 411 for detecting first order diffraction beam provided by hologram 25 out of beams reflected from the optical disc is provided adjacent to laser elements 61, 62, it is not necessary to provide a beam splitter such as a half mirror to detect the reflected beam.</p>

    <p num="158">
      As described above, objective lens 21 is designed such that it focuses the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm on the recording surface of the DVD.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when objective lens 21 focuses parallel laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm on the recording surface of the CD as shown in FIG. 43, there is generated wave aberration.
      <br/>
      However, when diffusion beam (position of light source: finite) such as shown in FIG. 44 is incident on objective lens 21 rather than the aforementioned parallel beam (position of light source:infinite), the generated wave aberration is reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="159">When we represent distance from the light source (semiconductor laser 23) to objective lens 21 as bb, and distance from objective lens 21 to the point of focus (recording surface of the optical disc) as aa, then magnification of objective lens 21 is represented as aa/bb, as shown in FIG. 45. Relation between magnification aa/bb of objective lens 21 and the wave aberration is shown in FIG. 46. Here, simulation is performed under the condition that the laser beam having the wavelength of 785 nm ( LAMBDA ) is focused on the recording surface of a CD having transparent substrate 31 having the thickness of 1.2 mm, and the effective numerical aperture of objective lens 21 is set to 0.45.</p>
    <p num="160">Considering the relation between the magnification and the wave aberration shown in FIG. 46, it is understood that in order to minimize the wave aberration, semiconductor laser 23 should be arranged at such a position where magnification is about 0.06.</p>
    <p num="161">
      The wave aberration of not higher than 0.05 LAMBDA  (=785 nm) does not cause any practical problem.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the magnification of objective lens 21 preferably used is in the range of 0.025 to 0.095, as shown in FIG. 47.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      Assuming that the diffusion beam is incident on objective lens 21, when objective lens 21 moves in the tracking direction by tracking control, the laser beam enters objective lens 21 obliquely.
      <br/>
      As a result, reproduction characteristic is deteriorated than when parallel beam enters objective lens 21.
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      The laser beam entering objective lens 21 will be closer to parallel when distance bb is made larger, that is, when magnification aa/bb is made smaller.
      <br/>
      Deterioration of reproduction characteristic when objective lens 21 moves can be suppressed in this manner.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the preferable magnification of objective lens 21 used is in the range of 0.025 to 0.065, as shown in FIG. 48.

      However, it is very difficult to arrange laser elements 491 and 501 at highly accurate distance cc.

      Hologram plate 510 with wavelength selectivity has recesses and protrusion formed as stripes, as shown in FIG. 52(a).
      <br/>
      Hologram plate 510 with wavelength selectivity transmits the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm directly without diffraction, while it transmits the laser beam having the wavelengths of 780 nm diffracted in a prescribed direction, as shown in FIG. 52(b).

      The beam reflected from recording surface 492 of the optical disc passes through objective lens 21 and reaches hologram plate 510 with wavelength selectivity.
      <br/>
      Since the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm is not diffracted by hologram plate 510 with wavelength selectivity but is transmitted as it is, the laser beam is focused on the center of light receiving portion 531 which is divided into four, in photodetector 28.
      <br/>
      The laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm from laser element 62 passes through objective lens 21 and is focused on recording surface 492 of the optical disc.

      The beam reflected from recording surface 492 of the optical disc passes through objective lens 21 and reaches hologram plate 510 with wavelength selectivity.
      <br/>
      The laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm is diffracted inward by hologram plate 510 with wavelength selectivity.
      <br/>
      Hologram plate 510 with wavelength selectivity is arranged at a specific position in the direction of the optical axis so that the first order inward diffracted beam of the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm is focused on the center of light receiving portion 531.

      According to Embodiment 24, even when the distance aa between laser elements 61 and 62 varies, it is possible to focus not only the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm but also the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm on the center of the light receiving portion 531 by appropriately adjusting the position of hologram plate 510 in the direction of the optical axis.
      <br/>
      Therefore, only one light receiving portion 531 commonly incorporating light receiving portions 494 and 502 shown in FIG. 50 has to be provided.

      As shown in FIG. 65(a), when a DVD is reproduced, a beam spot 640 is formed on light receiving portion 591, and when a CD is reproduced, a beam spot 641 is formed on light receiving portion 592.
      <br/>
      In Embodiment 29, the position of beam spot 641 lies in the longitudinal direction in the figure in accordance with variation of distance aa between laser elements 61 and 62.
      <br/>
      However, since light receiving portion 592 consist of rectangular divided sensors 592A1 to 592A3 extending in the longitudinal direction in the figure, the reproduction signal RF, the focus error signal FE and the tracking error signal TE are generated appropriately even when beam spot 641 varies to some extent in the longitudinal direction of the figure.

    <p num="195">
      When objective lens 21 comes closer to or goes away from optical disc 10, beam spots 640 and 641 are deformed in the lateral direction or longitudinal direction as shown in FIGS. 65(b) and (c).

      Accordingly, the focus error signal FE is generated and objective lens 21 is moved in the direction of the optical axis so that the laser beam is focused on the recording surface of optical disc 12.
    </p>
    <p num="196">The tracking servo operation of the optical disc recording/reproducing apparatus will be described.</p>
    <p num="197">When a DVD is reproduced, the tracking error signal TE is generated in the similar manner as the focus error signal FE described above, and objective lens 21 is moved in a direction perpendicular to the track, so that the laser beam is always directed to the track.</p>

      Meanwhile, when a CD is reproduced, when main laser beam and two sub laser beams are directed to optical disc 10, as shown in FIG. 66. One main laser beam is reflected from the signal recording surface of optical disc 10 and enters light receiving portion 592 of photodetector 590.

      The two sub laser beams are reflected by the signal recording surface of optical disc 10 and enters side sensors 593A4 and 593A5 of photodetector 590.
      <br/>
      Consequently, beam spot 641 is formed on light receiving portion 592, and beam spots 650 and 651 are formed on side sensors 593A4 and 593A5, respectively.
      <br/>
      When the position of the main laser beam directed to optical disc 10 deviates from the track, the tracking error signal TE is generated accordingly.
      <br/>
      Therefore, objective lens 21 is moved in the direction perpendicular to the track so that the track is always irradiated with the main laser beam.

      At the central region where hologram 682 is formed, there are annular protrusions 72 formed concentrically, as shown in FIG. 71. In order that hologram 682 has lens effect, the pitch of protrusions 72 is gradually narrowed from the inside to the outside.
      <br/>
      Further, in order that hologram 682 functions as a lens only for the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm, the step of protrusions 72 is set to integer multiple of 635 nm.
      <br/>
      The recesses and protrusions of diffraction grating 683 are formed at a constant pitch, and therefore diffraction grating 683 has a prescribed grating constant.

      <br/>
      Since diameter of laser beam 720 entering hologram aperture element 681 is larger than the diameter of hologram 682, laser beam 720 also enters the diffraction grating 683.
      <br/>
      Outer peripheral portion of laser beam 720 is significantly diffracted both to the left and right sides, with the part 721 of laser beam being the center.

    </p>
    <p num="234">
      According to Embodiment 36 described above, since hologram 860 which diffracts only the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm inward is used, the distance between two wavelength semiconductor laser and hologram 860 can be made shorter than the above described embodiments.
      <br/>
      As a result, the size of the optical pickup device can be reduced in accordance with the thirty-sixth embodiment.

    <p num="236">
      In Embodiment 36 described above, hologram 860 which diffracts only the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm inward is provided immediately preceding collimator lens 254.
      <br/>
      However, as in Embodiment 1 shown in FIG. 3, a hologram 870 which diffracts only the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm inward may be formed on a surface of collimator lens 254.

    <p num="237">�Embodiment 38�</p>
    <p num="238">
      As described above, a single beam method is used for reproducing a DVD, and the three beam method is used for reproducing a CD.
      <br/>
      Generally, in order to divide one laser beam into three, a diffraction grating is used.
      <br/>
      The diffraction grating has only to function only on the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm which is used for reproducing the DVD.
    </p>
    <p num="239">
      Therefore, as shown in FIGS. 89 and 90, a diffraction grating 890 with wavelength selectivity which divides the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm into three by diffraction, and which does not diffract but transmits as it is the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm may be provided.
      <br/>
      Diffraction grating 890 with wavelength selectivity is formed in the similar manner as diffraction grating 130 with wavelength selectivity described above.
    </p>
    <p num="240">As shown in FIG. 89, when a DVD is reproduced, laser element 61 generates the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm, and the generated laser beam is not divided but transmitted as it is through diffraction grating 890 with wavelength selectivity.</p>
    <p num="241">Referring to FIG. 90, when a CD is reproduced, laser element 62 generates the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm, and the generated laser beam is divided into three by diffraction grating 890 with wavelength selectivity and transmitted.</p>
    <p num="242">According to Embodiment 38, since diffraction grating 890 with wavelength selectivity dividing only the laser beam having the wavelength of 780 nm into three is provided, noise caused by undesirable diffracted beam can be reduced when a DVD is reproduced.</p>
    <p num="243">It is understood that various improvements, modifications and variations are possible within the scope of the present invention, for example, laser beam having the wavelength of 650 (tolerance  +- 20)nm may be used in place of the laser beam having the wavelength of 635 nm, and the wavelength of the laser beam is not specifically limited.</p>
