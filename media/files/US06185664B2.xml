      A memory system and method that allow more than one cycle of memory latency for accesses to a synchronously accessed memory.
      <br/>
      The memory system includes a memory with a clocked interface and a corresponding clock input, and may include an output register for storing data outputted from the memory during a read operation.
      <br/>
      The output register and the memory are coupled together by a data path, for transferring data between the memory and the output register.
      <br/>
      The memory system may further include a clock signal coupled to the clocked interface of the memory.
      <br/>
      The clock signal feeds through a delay element into a clock input of the output register.
      <br/>
      This causes the output register to receive a delayed clock signal, thereby providing more than one clock cycle of time for data to be read from the memory and latched in the output register.
      <br/>
      The memory system may also include an input register, for inputting data during write operations.
      <br/>
      This input register similarly receives a delayed clock signal, which functions as an advanced clock signal from the preceding clock cycle to provide more than one clock cycle of latency for write accesses to memory.
      <br/>
      A delay element may be selectively configured to produce variable delay or latency to allow the memory system to flexibly operate with different memory devices and/or processor clock speeds.

    <p num="5">
      New memory system designs have been developed to keep pace with rapid increases in processor clock speeds.
      <br/>
      As processors get faster, memory systems are under increasing pressure to provide data at faster rates to keep up with the processors.
      <br/>
      This has recently led to the development of new memory system designs.
      <br/>
      Latencies for memory accesses have been dramatically decreased by using page mode and extended data out (EDO) memory designs, which achieve a high burst rate and low latencies within a single page of memory.
      <br/>
      Another recent innovation is to incorporate a synchronous clocked interface into a memory chip, thereby allowing data from within the same page of memory to be clocked out of the memory in a continuous stream using the processor clock.
      <br/>
      Such memory chips, with clocked interfaces are known as synchronous random access memories.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      RAMBUS (tm)  and SYNCLINK (tm)  have been developed to govern the transfer of data between memory and processor using such clocked interfaces. (Rambus is a trademark of Rambus, Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.
      <br/>
      Synclink is a trademark of the Microgate Corporation of Austin, Tex.
      <br/>
      SYNCLINK (tm) , which will be known as Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) Standard 1596.7, specifies an architecture that supports a 64 megabit (m-bit) memory with a data transfer rate of 1.6 gigabytes per second.
      <br/>
      SYNCLINK (tm)  packetizes and pipelines the address, commands, and timing, and adds features that significantly increase the data bus speed, thereby providing fast memory access without losing the ability to move quickly from row to row or to obtain bursts of data.
      <br/>
      In the IEEE standard, a 10-bit upper bus is used for command and address transmission, and an 18-bit lower bus is used for data signals.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      As processor clock speeds continue to increase, it is becoming increasingly harder for memories with clocked interfaces to keep pace with processor clock speeds.
      <br/>
      More than one clock cycle of time may be required to read from or write to a synchronous memory.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the amount of time required to access a memory may depend upon the latency of a particular memory chip, and this latency can vary as different memory chips are included in a memory system.
      <br/>
      This makes it hard to design a memory architecture that can flexibly accommodate different memory chips.

    <p num="8">What is needed is a memory system including a synchronous interface between processor and memory that provides more than one clock cycle of time for read and/or write accesses to the memory.</p>

      <br/>
      FIG. 1 illustrates a computer system 140, including a memory subsystem 150, which is coupled to processor 100 through a processor-to-memory bus 105.
      <br/>
      Processor 100 is additionally coupled with disk drive 142, graphics card and display 144 and peripheral device 145 through bus 141.

      <br/>
      Peripheral device 145 may be any type of peripheral device that can be coupled to a computer system.

    <p num="22">
      Processor 100 is coupled through processor-to-memory bus 105 to memory controller 10 within memory subsystem 150.
      <br/>
      Processor-to-memory bus 105 includes any type of channel that can be used to connect processor 100 with memory 120.
      <br/>
      Memory controller 110 coordinates accesses by processor 100 to memory 120.
      <br/>
      In the illustrated embodiment, memory controller 110 includes data capture registers with variable delay 112.
      <br/>
      Data capture registers 112 may be used to buffer data to be read from and written to memory 120.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Memory controller 110 is coupled through data path 115 to memory 120.
      <br/>
      Data path 115 is any channel capable of carrying data between memory controller 110 and memory 120.
      <br/>
      Memory 120 is any type of memory with a clocked interface for moving data onto and off of the memory.
      <br/>
      This includes but is not limited to: synchronous random access memory, memory with a RAMBUS (tm)  interface, and memory with a SYNCLINK (tm)  interface.
      <br/>
      Any other memory that provides for clocked data transfers onto and off of a memory chip can be used as memory 120.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, memory 120 includes a plurality of memory chips.
      <br/>
      Thus, each line in data path 115 may have to drive inputs of a plurality of memory chips.
      <br/>
      This drive requirement may increase the latency for memory transfers.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Memory controller 110 additionally produces control signals 118, for controlling memory chips within memory 120.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, control signals 118 feed through buffers 130, which act to increase the drive strength of control signals 118, before control signals 118 feed into memory 120.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, increasing the drive strength of control signals 118, allows control signals 118 to more rapidly activate chips within memory 120.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The memory subsystem 150 illustrated in FIG. 1 operates as follows.
      <br/>
      During a read operation, processor 100 makes a read request over processor-to-memory bus 105 to memory controller 110.
      <br/>
      Memory controller 110 receives the read request and activates control signals 118 to command memory 120 to read a data value from a specified address.
      <br/>
      Memory 120 returns the requested data through its clocked interface to memory controller 110 via data path 115.
      <br/>
      Memory controller 110 completes the read operation by returning the requested data to processor 100 through processor-to-memory bus 105.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      During a write operation, processor 100 feeds the write request and data to be written to memory controller 110.
      <br/>
      Memory controller 110 receives the write request and activates control signals 118 to command memory 120 to write the data to be written to a specified address.
      <br/>
      The data to be written is then fed through data path 115 into the specified location in memory 120 through the clocked interface of memory 120.

      The selected input will have a 0, 1, 2, or 3 element delay.
      <br/>
      Delayed clock signal 360 from the output of MUX 320 feeds into the clock input of memory input register 220.
      <br/>
      During a write operation, delayed clock signal 360 functions as an advanced or early clock signal for the next clock pulse.
      <br/>
      If write data 350 is available at the input of memory input register 220 early enough, write data 350 is latched into memory input register 220 earlier than the next clock cycle by delayed clock signal 360.
      <br/>
      This provides more than one clock cycle of latency for data to be written into memory 120 from memory input register 220.
      <br/>
      By shifting the clocking of memory input register 220, time is effectively stolen from the preceding transition through interconnection network 200, because the write data 350 must arrive early at memory input register 220.

      FIG. 4 is a circuit diagram illustrating a circuit that produces a configurable delay for a clock signal to memory output register 222 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the configurable delay circuitry primarily resides within controller 240.
      <br/>
      Controller 240 receives a configuration command 442 from processor 100 through processor-to-memory bus 105.
      <br/>
      Controller 240 additionally receives system clock signal 340, which it uses to generate delayed clock signal 460.
      <br/>
      Delayed clock signal 460 feeds into a clock input of memory output register 222.
      <br/>
      During a read operation, read data 450 from memory 120 is latched into memory output register 222.
      <br/>
      It then feeds through interconnection network 200 to processor 100, which completes the read operation.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In the illustrated embodiment, controller 240 includes circuitry to produce delayed clock signal 460 for memory output register 222.
      <br/>
      This circuitry includes multiplexer (MUX) 420. The data inputs of MUX 420 are coupled to system clock 340, delay element 410, delay element 412, and delay element 414.
      <br/>
      The select inputs of MUX 420 are coupled to configuration register 430.
      <br/>
      Configuration register 430 receives a configuration command 442 from processor bus 105.
      <br/>
      The output of MUX 420 is delayed clock signal 460, which feeds into the clock input of memory output register 222.
      <br/>
      Controller 240 also includes additional circuitry, which is not illustrated.

    <p num="40">
      Delay elements 410, 412 and 414 are chained together.
      <br/>
      The input of delay element 410 is coupled to system clock 340.
      <br/>
      The input of delay element 412 is coupled to the output of delay element 410.
      <br/>
      The input of delay element 414 is coupled to the output of delay element 412.
      <br/>
      This produces an increasing delay for successive data inputs to MUX 320.
      <br/>
      The illustrated embodiment includes a four-input multiplexer, which produces four different delays.
      <br/>
      Another embodiment includes an eight-input multiplexer, which produces eight different delays in one nanosecond increments.
      <br/>
      Yet another embodiment includes a 16-input multiplexer which produces 16 different delays in 0.5 nanosecond increments.

      The embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4 operates as follows.
      <br/>
      Configuration command 442 feeds into configuration register 430, through which it selects one of the data inputs of MUX 420.
      <br/>
      The selected input will have a 0, 1, 2 or 3 element delay.
      <br/>
      Delayed clock signal 460 from the output of MUX 420 feeds into the clock input of memory output register 222.
      <br/>
      During a read operation, delayed clock signal 460 provides more than one clock cycle of latency for data to be read from memory 120 into memory output register 222.
      <br/>
      By shifting the clocking of memory input register 220, time is effectively stolen from the following transition through interconnection network 200, because read data 450 must make the next transition in less than one clock cycle, since it was delayed in being latched into memory output register 222.
