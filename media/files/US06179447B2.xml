      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a light distribution lens of a strobe device which is located in front of a light emitter and a zoom strobe device using the same.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A strobe device, and particularly a strobe device incorporated in a zoom lens camera should be small and have a large guide number and a uniform emission distribution over the entire zoom range from the telephoto extremity to the wide-angle extremity (i.e., least loss of the quantity of light at the periphery of the lens), in accordance with an increase in the focal-length at the telephoto extremity.
      <br/>
      Attempts have been made to improve a light emitting tube, a reflector, and a Fresnel lens (light distribution lens).
      <br/>
      In particular, the Fresnel lens can have theoretically the same power of an equivalent convex lens, though it be made thinner in size; therefore is useful in reducing the entire thickness of the strobe system.
      <br/>
      However, a light loss occurs due to the concentric cylindrical surfaces of the annuluses of the Fresnel lens, axes of which being the optical axis, and hence it is difficult to obtain a large guide number.
      <br/>
      If a bi-convex lens which has no light loss is used, it is possible to obtain a large guide number.
      <br/>
      However, the bi-convex lens has a large thickness at the center portion thereof, thus resulting in an increase in volume.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is difficult to obtain the necessary thickness at the peripheral portion.
      <br/>
      Thus, the bi-convex lens makes it difficult to miniaturize the strobe device.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">It is an object of the present invention to provide a light distribution lens for a strobe wherein the thickness can be made thinner than an equivalent bi-convex lens; to reduce the light loss due to the annuluses (concentric grooves); and an increased guide number.</p>
    <p num="6">Another object of the present invention is to provide a zoom strobe device using the above-mentioned light distribution lens.</p>
    <p num="7">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a light distribution lens for a strobe which is located in front of a strobe light emitter, including a convex surface which is provided on one of the opposed lens surfaces of the light distribution lens; and a convex Fresnel surface which is provided on the other lens surface of the light distribution lens.</p>
    <p num="8">
      According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a zoom strobe device including a light emitter unit including a light emitter and a reflector; a light distribution lens provided in front of the light emitter unit to distribute strobe light; and a zoom mechanism for varying the distance between the light emitter unit and the light distribution lens.
      <br/>
      One of opposed lens surfaces of the light distribution lens is made of a convex surface, and the other lens surface is made of a convex Fresnel surface.
      <br/>
      The convex Fresnel surface faces the light emitter unit while the convex surface is located so that it faces outward.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Preferably, the Fresnel surface is provided with annuluses, each being defined by a cylindrical surface having an axis coincident with the optical axis and a conical surface to define a wedge shape in section.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a molding die used to mold the Fresnel lens can be easily machined or produced.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The strobe light distribution lens preferably satisfies the following relationship:
      <br/>
      THETA  &lt;= 10 H
    </p>
    <p num="11">wherein H (mm) represents the distance of each annulus of the convex Fresnel surface from the optical axis, and  THETA ( (degree)  ) represents the angle defined by the wedge surface of each annulus and a plane perpendicular to the optical axis.</p>
    <p num="12">
      The radius of curvature of the convex surface is preferably larger than that of the basic curved surface of the Fresnel surface (at the center portion thereof).
      <br/>
      This is because if the radius of curvature of the convex surface is small, the lens must be thick to obtain a necessary thickness of the lens at the peripheral portion thereof.
      <br/>
      In order to provide a thin lens without decreasing the power, it is preferable that the power be chiefly provided by a Fresnel surface.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="15">
      FIGS. 1 and 2 show an embodiment of a light distribution lens 10 for a strobe device according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The light distribution lens 10 is in the form of a rectangle in a front elevation, which is elongated in the direction parallel with the length of a light emitting tube.
      <br/>
      The light distribution lens 10 is provided with a convex surface 11 and a convex Fresnel (lens) surface 12.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The convex Fresnel surface 12 is provided with a circular portion 12 a whose center is located on the optical axis O and a group of concentric annuluses (concentric grooves) 12b which are concentrically spaced at an equi-distance.
      <br/>
      The diameter "a" of the central circular portion 12a is not larger than twice the width "b" of each annulus 12b.
      <br/>
      The circular position 12a is a semi-spherical surface or a planar surface.
      <br/>
      Each annulus 12b is provided with a cylindrical surface 12c whose axis is the optical axis O and a conical surface 12d to define a wedge surface in cross section.
      <br/>
      The angle  THETA ( (degree)  ) of the wedge surface (i.e., an angle defined by the wedge surface and a plane perpendicular to the optical axis O) is gradually increased from the center portion toward the peripheral portion.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 3, assuming that the wedge angles of the annuluses 12b are represented by  THETA 1,  THETA 2,  THETA 3, . . .  THETA i, . . .  THETA n, in this order from the center toward the peripheral portion, and the distance of the annulus 12b from the optical axis O is represented by H (mm), there is the following relationship:
      <br/>
      THETA i &lt;= 10 H
    </p>
    <p num="17">If this relationship is satisfied, an improved light distribution lens for a strobe in which little light loss occurs, a good light distribution property is obtained, and the thickness is smaller than a bi-convex lens can be provided.</p>
    <p num="18">
      In the case that the wedge angle of the Fresnel lens is increased from the center portion toward the peripheral portion, it is preferable that the increment be decreased as the distance from the center increases.
      <br/>
      If the angle  THETA ( THETA i) is above 10H, it is difficult to machine the wedge surfaces (or wedge surfaces of a molding die which is used to mold the convex Fresnel surface 12).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The light distribution lens 10 is generally designed to have different curvatures on front and back surfaces thereof.
      <br/>
      The surface that has a larger radius of curvature is formed by the convex surface 11, and the surface that has a smaller radius of curvature is formed by the convex Fresnel surface 12.
      <br/>
      The angle  THETA i is determined in accordance with the basic curved surface which is needed to optically function as the convex Fresnel surface 12.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The convex surface 11 can be made of either a spherical surface or an aspherical surface.
      <br/>
      The cylindrical surfaces 12c and the conical surfaces 12d of the convex Fresnel surface 12 are each preferably made to have a simple shape that is formed by straight lines in cross section, so that the wedge surfaces (i.e., wedge surfaces of a molding die used to mold the convex Fresnel surface 12) can be easily produced.
      <br/>
      Either the convex surface 11 or the convex Fresnel surface 12 can be an external surface of the light distribution lens 10 (strobe device) from the viewpoint of an optical function, but preferably, the convex surface 11 is located to face outward in order to provide a good outer appearance and to prevent foreign matter from collecting on the edge portions of the annuluses.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      FIGS. 4 and 5 show two embodiments of a zoom strobe device using the strobe light distribution lens 10.
      <br/>
      In each embodiment, the zoom strobe device is composed of a light emitter unit 23 comprised of a light emitting tube (xenon tube) 21, a reflector 22 and a zoom mechanism (not shown).
      <br/>
      The light emitter unit 23 is moved close to or away from the strobe light distribution lens 10 to vary the emission angle.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4, the reflector 22 is made of a conventional reflector 22A whose sectional shape is elliptical.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 5, the reflector 22 constitutes a reflector 22B whose sectional shape is defined by a curved portion 22a corresponding to the back surface shape of the light emitting tube 21, first planar portions 22b which correspond to tangential lines to the curved portion 22a, and second planar portions 22c which extend from the front ends of the first planar portions 22b and are bent inward at a predetermined angle.
      <br/>
      Angles between the first planar portions 22b and the optical axis and between the second planar portion 22c and the optical axis in cross section are defined by  ALPHA  and  BETA , respectively as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      Also, the total length of the curved portion 22a and the first planar portion 22b and the length of the second planar portion 22c in the optical axis direction are defined by L1 and L2, respectively.
      <br/>
      The reflector 22B is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 7-110513 in the name of the assignee of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A zoom mechanism (not shown) is used for varying the distance between the light emitter unit and the light distribution lens.
      <br/>
      The zoom mechanism per se known can be, for example, a cam mechanism, driven in accordance with the movement of the photographing lens.
    </p>
    <p num="23">In FIG. 4 or 5, when the light emitter unit 23 is moved close to the light distribution lens 10, the emission angle (illumination angle) is increased (wide-angle) and when the light emitter unit 23 is moved away from the light distribution lens 10, the emission angle is decreased (telephoto).</p>

      FIG. 7 is a graph showing the guide numbers of the four kinds of zoom strobe devices which are comprised of the light distribution lenses 10 according to Examples 1, 2, 3 and the comparative example, and the reflector 22B shown in FIG. 5 in combination, when the distance between the light distribution lens 10 and the light emitter unit 23 is varied.
      <br/>
      The position in which the light distribution lens 10 is closest to the light emitter unit 23 (distance=0) corresponds a 35 mm focal-length of the photographing lens, and the position in which the light distribution lens 10 is farthest from the light emitter unit 23 (distance=10 mm) corresponds to a 115 mm focal-length of the photographing lens.

      L2 =2.8 mm
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In Example 1, a basic curved surface of the convex Fresnel surface 12 is 8 mm, as in the comparative example.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, the reduction in the guide number is smaller than that in the comparative example or no significant differences between the two.
      <br/>
      Namely, it can be found that the light loss caused by the use of the Fresnel surface can be minimized in the present invention.
      <br/>
      The power of the Fresnel surface in Example 2 is slightly weaker than that in Example 1.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the guide number is slightly reduced, but the improvement of the light distribution property is confirmed in Example 2.
      <br/>
      In Example 3, the power of the Fresnel surface is further weakened.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, it is possible to weaken the power of the convex surface without weakening the power of the Fresnel surface.
      <br/>
      In this alternative, the radius of curvature of the convex surface is increased, so that if the thickness of the lens is reduced, the necessary thickness of the lens at the peripheral portion can be obtained.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the lens can be made thin, thus resulting in a realization of a compact strobe device.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      As can be understood from the above discussion, according to the present invention, an improved light distribution lens for a strobe in which the lens thickness is smaller than a bi-convex lens; little light loss caused by the cylindrical surfaces of the annuluses of the Fresnel lens occur; and the guide number can be increased can be provided.
      <br/>
      Also, a zoom strobe device using the improved light distribution lens can be provided.
