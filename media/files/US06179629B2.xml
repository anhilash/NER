      <br/>
      A high density board-to-board connector has a housing integrally defining two upper stepped faces and two lower stepped faces.
      <br/>
      Each face defines a number of contact passageways extending to a rear face of the housing.
      <br/>
      A spacer has two mounting blocks and a stair-like spacing section between the two mounting blocks.
      <br/>
      The spacing section integrally forms four steps each defining a number of vertically extending contact tail portion receiving holes.
      <br/>
      A number of contacts are each bent to have a contact portion and a tail portion perpendicular to the contact portion.
      <br/>
      The contacts are interferentially mounted in the housing at a position wherein the contact portions are received in a front end of the contact passageways, and the tail portions vertically extend behind the rear face of the housing.
      <br/>
      The housing together with the contacts is mounted to the spacer between the mounting blocks wherein the tail portions of the contacts received in the contact passageways in different faces are received in the tail portion receiving holes in corresponding steps.

    <p num="4">High density board-to-board connectors are proposed to meet the development of portable computers which require that the connectors used therein occupy the smallest amount of space possible and directly connect a daughter board to a mother board avoiding the use of cables.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Conventional high density board-to-board connectors are disclosed in U.S. Utility Pat.
      <br/>
      Nos. 5,219,294 and 5,567,168 and U.S. Design Pat.
      <br/>
      Nos. D332,599, D364,378 and D367,263.
      <br/>
      However, such conventional high density board-to-board connectors have a complicated structure and, thus, a high manufacturing cost.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Furthermore, in order to correctly solder such conventional connectors onto a printed circuit board (PCB), each connector is equipped with a spacer to precisely space tail portions of contacts thereof from each other a predetermined distance.
      <br/>
      However, as shown in FIG. 1, when the contacts 30 are bent to have tail portions 301 perpendicular to body portions 302 thereof, the tail portions 301 of the two rear rows of contacts 30 have a length which is too long resulting in excessive flexibility thereof.
      <br/>
      It becomes tedious to correctly extend tail portions having excessive flexibility into contact tail portion receiving holes defined in a spacer 40.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      To overcome this disadvantage, an improvement has been proposed to bend the contacts 30' twice whereby the tail portions 301' thereof have the same length, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the tail portions 301' can be easily assembled to the spacer 40.
      <br/>
      However, bending the contacts twice increases manufacturing costs.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Hence, an improved high density board-to-board connector is needed to eliminate the above mentioned defects of current high density board-to-board connectors.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">Accordingly, an objective of the present invention is to provide a high density board-to-board connector which has a simple structure and a low manufacturing cost.</p>
    <p num="10">Another objective of the present invention is to provide a high density board-to-board connector which has a stair-like spacer with four steps each defining a number of contact tail portion receiving holes whereby tail portions of contacts of the connector can be easily inserted into the spacer and accurately spaced thereby when the contacts are bent and their tail portions received in the two rear rows of receiving holes have an excessive flexibility.</p>
    <p num="11">
      To fulfill the above mentioned objectives, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a high density board-to-board plug connector comprises a generally T-shaped housing having a front face for engaging with a mating connector and a rear face opposite the front face.
      <br/>
      The T-shaped housing further integrally forms two stepped upper faces and two stepped lower faces each defining a number of contact passageways extending to the rear face of the housing.
      <br/>
      A number of contacts each having a contact portion and a tail portion are interferentially mounted in the housing at a position wherein the contact portions are received in the contact passageways and the tail portions vertically extend behind the rear face.
      <br/>
      A spacer has a stair-like configuration defining four steps, wherein each step has a number of vertically defined contact tail portion receiving holes.
      <br/>
      When the housing together with the contacts is mounted to the spacer, the tail portions of the contacts in different faces of the housing extend into the contact tail portion receiving holes in corresponding steps.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A board-to-board receptacle connector includes a generally U-shaped housing defining two stepped upper faces and two stepped lower faces in a recess of the housing.
      <br/>
      Each face has a number of contact passageways defined therein and extending to a rear face of the housing.
      <br/>
      The U-shaped housing further has a mating connector engaging face defined by an end wall of the recess.
      <br/>
      A number of contacts are interferentially mounted in the housing at a position wherein contact portions thereof are received in a front part of the contact passageways, and tail portions thereof vertically extend behind the rear face.
      <br/>
      A spacer has a configuration the same as the spacer used with the plug connector.
      <br/>
      When the U-shaped housing together with the contacts is mounted to the spacer, the tail portions of the contacts in different faces of the housing extend into the contact tail portion receiving holes in corresponding steps.
      <br/>
      When the plug connector mates with the receptacle connector, the T-shaped housing extends into the recess of the U-shaped housing to cause the engaging faces of the two connectors to engage with each other and the contacts to electrically connect with each other.

    <p num="16">
      The contact portion 110 of each contact 11 electrically engages with a corresponding contact in a mating connector, and the tail portion 111 thereof is soldered to a PCB.
      <br/>
      Each contact 11 is bent whereby the tail portion 111 is perpendicular to the contact portion 110.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The shielding 12 is formed to have a body 120 defining a mating connector receiving space 121 therein.
      <br/>
      Two tenons 123 extend from two lateral sides of the body 120 into the space 121.
      <br/>
      Two mounting ears 122 outwardly extend from lateral ends of the body 120.

      Each ear 122 defines a hole 1221 therein, and an engaging flange 1222 projecting rearward from a lateral edge thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The housing 10 is formed to have a rear wall 102 and a T-shaped body portion 103 projecting from the rear wall 102.
      <br/>
      The housing 10 has a front face 101 for engaging with a mating connector and a rear face 1022 opposite the front face 101.
      <br/>
      The body portion 103 has upper front and rear faces 1031, 1032 constituting a stair-like configuration, and lower front and rear faces 1033, 1034 also constituting a stair-like configuration, wherein the upper front face 1031 aligns with the lower front face 1033, and the upper rear face 1032 aligns with the lower rear face 1034.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the upper front face 1031 and the lower front face 1033 define a thickness which is smaller than that defined by the upper and lower rear faces 1032, 1034.
      <br/>
      A number of contact passageways 104 are defined in each of the faces 1031, 1032, 1033 and 1034 and extend to the rear face 1022.
      <br/>
      The rear wall 102 further defines a stop face 1024 near the body portion 103.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The spacer 14 has two lateral mounting blocks 132 each defining a horizontally extending mounting hole 1321 and a fitting recess 1322 at a front, outer corner thereof.
      <br/>
      A mounting face 141 is defined at a lower portion of a front face of the spacer 14.
      <br/>
      A stair-like spacing section 140 is formed between the mounting blocks 132 and defines four steps 1401, 1402, 1403 and 1404 each defining a number of contact tail portion receiving holes 1405 extending vertically therethrough.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Each board lock 130 is formed by stamping a metal sheet to have a body portion 1301 defining a central hole 1302 and two retention legs 1303 extending downward from the body portion 1301.
      <br/>
      The retention legs 1303 are used to retentively engage with a PCB.

    <p num="21">Each mounting post 131 is formed to have a square mounting plate 1312 and a mounting sleeve 1311 projecting from the mounting plate 1312.</p>
    <p num="22">
      To assemble the plug connector 1, also referring to FIGS. 4(A) and 4 (B), the board locks 130 are firstly mounted to the spacer 14 by fitting the body portions 1301 of the board locks 130 from a bottom of the spacer 14 into the respective mounting blocks 132 to reach a position wherein the holes 1302 of the board locks 130 are aligned with the corresponding holes 1321 of the mounting blocks 132.
      <br/>
      The contacts 11 are then interferentially fitted into the housing 10 to reach a position wherein the tail portions 111 thereof extend vertically behind the rear face 1022 of the housing 10 and the contact portions 110 thereof are received in a front end of the contact passageways 104.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the housing 10 together with the contacts 11 is mounted to the spacer 14 by extending the tail portions 111 of the contacts 11 into the contact tail portion receiving holes 1405 to reach a position wherein the rear face 1022 of the housing 10 engages with an upper part of the mounting face 141 of the spacer 14.
      <br/>
      Although it is not wholly shown in the drawings, it is understood that after the contacts 11, the housing 10 and the spacer 14 are assembled, the tail portions 111 of the contacts 11 received in the contact passageways 104 in the face 1032 are received in the holes 1045 in the step 1404; the tail portions 111 of the contacts 11 received in the contact passageways 104 in the face 1031 are received in the holes 1045 in the step 1403; the tail portions 111 of the contacts 11 received in the contact passageways 104 in the face 1033 are received in the holes 1045 in the step 1402; and the tail portions 111 of the contacts 11 received in the contact passageways 104 in the face 1034 are received in the holes 1045 in the step 1401.
      <br/>
      Afterwards, the shielding 12 is assembled to the housing 10 and the spacer 14 to reach a position wherein the flanges 1222 are fittingly received in the recesses 1322.
      <br/>
      A rear face 124 of the shielding 12 engages with a lower part of the mounting face 141 of the spacer 14 and a front face 1323 of each of the mounting blocks 132.
      <br/>
      An inner stepped portion 1224 of the shielding 12 engages with the stop face 1024 of the housing 10.
      <br/>
      The body portion 103 of the housing 10 extends into the mating connector receiving space 121 defined by the shielding 12 between the tenons 123.
      <br/>
      The holes 1221 defined in the ears 122 of the shielding 12 are aligned with the corresponding holes 1321 defined in the mounting blocks 132 of the spacer 14.
