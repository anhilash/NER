      Concentration of metal element which promotes crystallization of silicon and which exists within a crystalline silicon film obtained by utilizing the metal element is reduced.
      <br/>
      A first heat treatment for crystallization is performed after introducing nickel to an amorphous silicon film 103.
      <br/>
      Then, laser light is irradiated to diffuse nickel element which is concentrated locally.
      <br/>
      After that, another heat treatment is performed within an oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature higher than that of the previous heat treatment.
      <br/>
      At this time, HCl or the like is added to the atmosphere.
      <br/>
      A thermal oxide film 106 is formed in this step.
      <br/>
      At this time, gettering of the nickel element into the thermal oxide film 106 takes place.
      <br/>
      Then, the thermal oxide film 106 is removed.
      <br/>
      Thereby, a crystalline silicon film 107 having low concentration of the metal element and a high crystallinity can be obtained.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a semiconductor device typified by a thin film transistor and to a fabrication method thereof.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the present invention relates to a semiconductor device using a crystalline silicon thin film formed on a glass substrate or a quartz substrate and to a fabrication method thereof.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="2">Hitherto, there has been known a thin film transistor using a silicon film, i.e. a technology for forming the thin film transistor by using the silicon film formed on a glass substrate or quartz substrate.</p>
    <p num="3">
      The glass substrate or quartz substrate is used because the thin film transistor is used for an active matrix type liquid crystal display.
      <br/>
      While a thin film transistor has been formed by using an amorphous silicon film in the past, it is being tried to fabricate the thin film transistor by utilizing a silicon film having a crystallinity (referred to as "crystalline silicon film" hereinbelow) in order to enhance its performance.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The thin film transistor using the crystalline silicon film can operate at high speed by more than two digits as compared to one using an amorphous silicon film.
      <br/>
      Therefore, while peripheral driver circuits of an active matrix liquid crystal display have been composed of external IC circuits, they may be built on the glass substrate or quartz substrate similarly to the active matrix circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Such structure is very advantageous in miniaturizing the whole apparatus and in simplifying the fabrication process, thus leading to reduction of the fabrication cost.</p>
    <p num="6">In general, a crystalline silicon film has been obtained by forming an amorphous silicon film by means of plasma CVD or low pressure thermal CVD and then by crystallizing it by performing a heat treatment or by irradiating laser light.</p>
    <p num="7">However, it has been difficult to obtain a required crystallinity across the wide area through the heat treatment because it may cause nonuniformity in the crystallization.</p>
    <p num="8">
      Further, although it is possible to obtain the high crystallinity partly by irradiating laser light, it is difficult to obtain a good annealing effect across the wide area.
      <br/>
      In particular, the irradiation of the laser light is apt to become unstable under the conditions needed for obtaining the good crystallinity.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Meanwhile, a technology described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei. 6-232059 has been known.
      <br/>
      This technology obtains a crystalline silicon film through a heat treatment at a lower temperature than that of the prior art by introducing a metal element (e.g. nickel) which promotes the crystallization of silicon to the amorphous silicon film.
    </p>
    <p num="10">This technology allows high crystallinity to be obtained uniformly across a wide area as compared to the prior art crystallization method by way of only heating or crystallization of an amorphous silicon film only by means of irradiation of laser light.</p>
    <p num="11">However, it is difficult to obtain a crystalline silicon film having high crystallinity and homogeneity across a wide area which is required for an active matrix type liquid crystal display.</p>
    <p num="12">Further, because the metal element is contained within the film and an amount thereof to be introduced has to be controlled very carefully, there is a problem in its reproducibility and stability (electrical stability of a device obtained).</p>
    <p num="13">Still more, there is a problem that an elapsed change of the characteristics of a semiconductor device to be obtained is large or an OFF value, in case of a thin film transistor, is large, due to the influence of the remaining metal element.</p>
    <p num="14">That is, although the metal element which promotes the crystallization of silicon plays the useful role in obtaining the crystalline silicon film, its existence becomes a negative factor which causes various problems after obtaining the crystalline silicon film once.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">It is an object of the invention disclosed in the present specification to provide a semiconductor device having excellent characteristics by using a crystalline silicon film having a high crystallinity.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <heading>FIRST EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="37">An arrangement for obtaining a crystalline silicon film on a glass substrate by utilizing nickel element will be explained in the present embodiment.</p>
    <p num="38">At first, the crystalline silicon film having a high crystallinity is obtained by an action of nickel element in the present embodiment.</p>
    <p num="39">
      Then, laser light is irradiated to enhance the crystallinity of the film and to diffuse nickel element existing locally concentrated within the film.
      <br/>
      That is, the block of nickel is extinguished.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Next, a thermal oxide film containing a halogen element is formed on the crystalline silicon film by thermal oxidation.
      <br/>
      At this time, the nickel element remaining in the crystalline silicon film thus obtained is gettered to the thermal oxide film by an action of the halogen element.
      <br/>
      Because the nickel element is distributed by the irradiation of the laser light, the gettering proceeds effectively.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Then, the thermal oxide film containing the nickel element in high concentration as a result of the gettering is removed.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the crystalline silicon film having nickel element in low concentration while having the high crystallinity is obtained on the glass substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      A fabrication process of the present embodiment will be explained by using FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      At first, a silicon oxide nitride film 102 is formed as an underlying film in a thickness of 3000 angstrom on the glass substrate 101 of Corning 1737 (distortion point: 667 (degree)  C.).
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The silicon oxide nitride film is formed by using plasma CVD using sillane, N2 O gas and oxygen as original gases.
      <br/>
      Or, it may be formed by using plasma CVD using TEOS gas and N2 O gas.
    </p>
    <p num="44">The silicon oxide nitride film has a function of suppressing the diffusion of impurities from the glass substrate in the later steps (seeing from the level of fabrication of a semiconductor, a glass substrate contains a large amount of impurities).</p>
    <p num="45">
      It is noted that the silicon nitride film is most suitable to maximize the function of suppressing the diffusion of the impurities.
      <br/>
      However, the silicon nitride film is not practical because it may be peeled off from the glass substrate due to the influence of stress.
      <br/>
      A silicon oxide film may be also used as the underlying film instead of the silicon oxide nitride film.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      It is also important to increase the hardness of the underlying film 102 as much as possible.
      <br/>
      It is concluded from the fact that the harder the hardness of the underlying film (i.e. the smaller the etching rate thereof), the higher the reliability is in an endurance test of the thin film transistor obtained finally.
      <br/>
      It is assumed to be caused by the effect of blocking the impurities from the glass substrate in the fabrication process of the thin film transistor.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      It is also effective to include a small amount of halogen element typified by chlorine in the underlying film 102.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the metal element which promotes crystallization of silicon and which exists within the semiconductor layer may be gettered by the halogen element in the later step.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      It is also effective to perform a hydrogen plasma treatment after forming the underlying film.
      <br/>
      It is also effective to perform a plasma treatment in an atmosphere in which oxygen and hydrogen are mixed.
      <br/>
      These treatments are effective in removing carbon component which is adsorbed on the surface of the underlying film and in enhancing the interfacial characteristic with a semiconductor film formed later.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Next, an amorphous silicon film 103, which turns out to be a crystalline silicon film later, is formed in a thickness of 500 angstrom by low pressure thermal CVD.
      <br/>
      The reason why low pressure thermal CVD is used is because the quality of the crystalline silicon film obtained later is better, i.e. the film quality is denser.
      <br/>
      Besides the low pressure thermal CVD, the plasma CVD may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The amorphous silicon film fabricated here is desirable to have 5 * 1017 cm-3 to 2 * 1019 cm-3 of concentration of oxygen within the film.
      <br/>
      It is because oxygen plays an important role in the later step of gettering the metal element (which promotes crystallization of silicon).
    </p>
    <p num="51">However, it must be careful here because the crystallization of the amorphous silicon film is hampered if the oxygen concentration is higher than the above-mentioned range of concentration.</p>
    <p num="52">
      The concentration of other impurities such as those of nitrogen and carbon is preferred to be as low as possible.
      <br/>
      In specifically, the concentration must be below 2 * 1019 cm-3.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The upper limit of the thickness of the amorphous silicon film is about 2000 angstrom.
      <br/>
      It is because it is disadvantageous to have a thick film to obtain the effect of laser irradiated later.
      <br/>
      Thick film is disadvantageous because the laser light irradiated to the silicon film is absorbed almost completely at the surface of the film.
    </p>
    <p num="54">The lower limit of the amorphous silicon film 103 is practically about 200 angstrom, though it depends on how it is formed.</p>
    <p num="55">
      Next, nickel element is introduced to the amorphous silicon film 103 to crystallize it.
      <br/>
      Here, the nickel element is introduced by applying nickel acetate solution containing 10 ppm (to weight) of nickel on the surface of the amorphous silicon film 103.
    </p>
    <p num="56">Besides the method of using the above-mentioned solution, sputtering, CVD, plasma treatment or adsorption may be used as the method for introducing the nickel element.</p>
    <p num="57">The method of using the solution is useful in that it is simple and that the concentration of the metal element may be readily adjusted.</p>
    <p num="58">
      The nickel acetate solution is applied as described above to form a liquid film 104 as shown in FIG. 1A. After obtaining this state, extra solution is blown out by using a spin coater not shown.
      <br/>
      Thus, the nickel element is held in contact on the surface of the amorphous silicon film 103.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      It is noted that it is preferable to use nickel sulfate solution, instead of using the nickel acetate, if the remained impurities in the later heating process is taken into consideration.
      <br/>
      It is because the nickel acetate contains carbon and it might be carbonized in the later heating process, thus remaining within the film.
    </p>
    <p num="60">An amount of the nickel element to be introduced may be controlled by adjusting the concentration of nickel element within the solution.</p>
    <p num="61">
      Next, a heat treatment is performed in the temperature range from 550 (degree)  C. to 650 (degree)  C. in the state shown in FIG. 1B to crystallize the amorphous silicon film 103 and to obtain a crystalline silicon film 105.
      <br/>
      This heat treatment is performed in a reducing atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      It is preferable to perform the heat treatment below the temperature of the distortion point of the glass substrate.
      <br/>
      Because the distortion point of the Corning 1737 glass substrate is 667 (degree)  C., the upper limit of the heating temperature here is preferable to be about 650 (degree)  C., leaving some margin.
    </p>
    <p num="63">Here, the heat treatment is performed for four hours at 620 (degree)  C. within a nitrogen atmosphere containing 3% of hydrogen.</p>
    <p num="64">The reason why the reducing atmosphere is adopted in the crystallization step by way of the heat treatment is to prevent oxides from being created in the step of the heat treatment and more concretely, to suppress nickel from reacting with oxygen and NiOx from being created on the surface of the film or within the film.</p>
    <p num="65">
      Oxygen couples with nickel and contributes a lot in gettering nickel in the later gettering step.
      <br/>
      However, it has been found that if oxygen couples with nickel in the above-mentioned stage of the crystallization, it hampers the crystallization.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is important to suppress the oxides from being created to the utmost in the crystallization step carried out by way of heating.
    </p>
    <p num="66">The concentration of oxygen within the atmosphere for performing the heat treatment for the crystallization has to be in an order of ppm, or preferably, less than 1 ppm.</p>
    <p num="67">Inert gases such as argon, besides nitrogen, may be used as the gas which occupies the most of the atmosphere for performing the heat treatment for the crystallization.</p>
    <p num="68">
      After the crystallization step by way of the heat treatment, nickel element remains as blocks.
      <br/>
      This fact has been confirmed from the observation by means of TEM (transmission electron microscope).
    </p>
    <p num="69">Although the cause of the fact that the nickel exists as blocks is not clear yet, it is considered to be related with some crystallization mechanism.</p>
    <p num="70">
      Next, laser light is irradiated as shown in FIG. 1C. Here, KrF excimer laser (wavelength: 248 nm) is used.
      <br/>
      Here, a method of irradiating the laser light by scanning its linear beam is adopted.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      The nickel element which has been locally concentrated as a result of the crystallization carried out by way of the aforementioned heat treatment is distributed by a certain degree within the film 105 by irradiating the laser light.
      <br/>
      That is, the nickel element may be distributed by disappearing the blocks of the nickel element.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Another heat treatment is performed in the step shown in FIG. 1D to form a thermal oxide film for gettering the nickel element.
      <br/>
      Here, this heat treatment is performed within an atmosphere containing halogen element.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the heat treatment is carried out in an oxygen atmosphere containing 5% of HCl (FIG. 1D).
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      This step is carried out to remove the nickel element (or another element which promotes crystallization of silicon) which has been introduced intentionally for the crystallization in the initial stage from the crystalline silicon film 105.
      <br/>
      This heat treatment is performed at a temperature higher than that of the heat treatment performed for the crystallization described above.
      <br/>
      It is an important condition for effectively performing the gettering of nickel element.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      This heat treatment is performed in the temperature range from 600 (degree)  C. to 750 (degree)  C. upon meeting the above-mentioned condition.
      <br/>
      The effect of gettering the nickel element in this step may be obtained remarkably when the temperature is higher than 600 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="75">In this step, the nickel element which has been distributed by the above-mentioned irradiation of laser is effectively gettered to the oxide film.</p>
    <p num="76">
      Further, the upper limit of the heating temperature is limited by the distortion point of the glass substrate to be used.
      <br/>
      It must be careful not to perform the heat treatment in a temperature above the distortion point of the glass substrate to be used because it is deformed.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      It is preferable to mix HCl with a ratio of 0.5% to 10% (volume %) of oxygen.
      <br/>
      It must be careful not to mix it above this concentration because, otherwise, the surface of the film is roughened with the same degree of irregularity with the thickness of the film.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      By performing the heat treatment under such conditions, the thermal oxide film 106 containing chlorine as shown in FIG. 1D is formed.
      <br/>
      Here, the heat treatment is performed for 12 hours and the thickness of the thermal oxide film 106 is 100 angstrom.
    </p>
    <p num="79">Because the thermal oxide film 106 is formed, the thickness of the crystalline silicon film 103 becomes about 450 angstrom.</p>
    <p num="80">When the heating temperature is 600 (degree)  C. to 750 (degree)  C. in this heat treatment, the treatment time (heating time) is set at 10 hours to 48 hours, typically at 24 hours.</p>
    <p num="81">This treatment time may be set adequately depending on the thickness of the oxide film to be obtained as a matter of course.</p>
    <p num="82">
      In this step, nickel element is gettered out of the silicon film by the action of the halogen element.
      <br/>
      Here, the nickel element is gettered to the thermal oxide film 106 formed by the action of chlorine.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      In the gettering, oxygen existing within the crystalline silicon film plays an important role.
      <br/>
      That is, the gettering of the nickel element proceeds effectively by chlorine acting on nickel oxide formed when oxygen couples with nickel.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      If the concentration of oxygen is too much, it becomes the factor of hampering the crystallization of the amorphous silicon film 103 in the crystallization step shown in FIG. 1B as described above.
      <br/>
      However, the existence thereof plays an important role in the process of gettering nickel as described above.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is important to control the concentration of oxygen existing within the amorphous silicon film as a starting film.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      Here, Cl has been selected as the halogen element and the case of using HCl has been shown as a method for introducing it.
      <br/>
      Besides HCl, one type or a plurality of types of mixed gas selected from HF, HBr, Cl2, F2, Br2 may be used.
      <br/>
      Besides them, halogen hydroxide may be used in general.
    </p>
    <p num="86">It is preferable to set the content (volume content) of those gases within the atmosphere to 0.25 to 5% if it is HF, 1 to 15% if it is HBr, 0.25 to 5% if it is Cl2, 0.125 to 2.5% if it is F2 and 0.5 to 10% if it is Br2.</p>
    <p num="87">
      If the concentration is below the above-mentioned range, no significant effect is obtained.
      <br/>
      Further, if the concentration exceeds the upper limit of the above-mentioned range, the surface of the crystalline silicon film is roughened.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      Through this step, the concentration of nickel element may be reduced to less than 1/10 of the maximum from the initial stage.
      <br/>
      It means that the nickel element may be reduced to 1/10 as compared to the case when no gettering by the halogen element is conducted.
      <br/>
      This effect may be obtained in the same manner even when another metal element is used.
    </p>
    <p num="89">Because the nickel element is gettered to the oxide film formed in the above-mentioned step, naturally the nickel concentration within the oxide film becomes high as compared to other regions.</p>
    <p num="90">
      Further, it has been observed that the concentration of nickel element is apt to be high near the interface of the crystalline silicon film 105 with the oxide film 106.
      <br/>
      It is considered to happen because the region where the gettering mainly takes place is on the side of the oxide film near the interface between the silicon film and the oxide film.
      <br/>
      The gettering proceeding near the interface is considered to be caused by the existence of stress and defects.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      Then, the thermal oxide film 106 containing nickel in high concentration is removed.
      <br/>
      The thermal oxide film 106 may be removed by means of wet etching or dry etching using buffered hydrofluoric acid (or other hydrofluorite etchant).
    </p>
    <p num="92">Thus, a crystalline silicon film 107 in which the concentration of nickel has been reduced is obtained as shown in FIG. 1E.</p>
    <p num="93">Because nickel element is contained near the surface of the obtained crystalline silicon film 107 in relatively high concentration, it is effective to advance the above-mentioned etching to over-etch, more or less, the surface of the crystalline silicon film 107.</p>
    <p num="94">
      It is also effective to irradiate laser light again after removing the thermal oxide film 106 to promote the crystallinity of the crystalline silicon film 107 thus obtained further.
      <br/>
      That is, it is effective to irradiate laser light again after gettering the nickel element.
    </p>
    <p num="95">Although the case when the KrF excimer laser (wavelength: 248 nm) is used as the laser to be used has been shown in the present specification, it is possible to use a XeCl excimer laser (wavelength: 308 nm) and other types of excimer lasers.</p>
    <p num="96">It is also possible to arrange so as to irradiate ultraviolet rays or infrared rays for example instead of laser light.</p>

      The present embodiment relates to a case when Cu is used as the metal element which promotes the crystallization of silicon in the arrangement shown in the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      In this case, cupric acetate �Cu(CH3 COO)2 � or cupricchloride (CuCl2 2H2 O) may be used as the solution for introducing Cu.
    </p>
    <heading>THIRD EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="98">
      The present embodiment relates to a case of growing crystal in the form different from that in the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      That is, the present embodiment relates to a method of growing the crystal in a direction parallel to the substrate, i.e. a method called lateral growth, by utilizing the metal element which promotes crystallization of silicon.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      FIG. 2 shows the fabrication process according to the present embodiment.
      <br/>
      At first, a silicon oxide nitride film is formed as an underlying film 202 in a thickness of 3000 angstrom on the Corning 1737 glass substrate (or a quartz substrate) 201.

      Next, a silicon oxide film not shown is formed in a thickness of 1500 angstrom and is patterned to form a mask 204.

      An opening is created on the mask in a region 205.

      The amorphous silicon film 203 is exposed at the region where the opening 205 is created.

      Next, a heat treatment is performed at 640 (degree)  C. for four hours in a nitrogen atmosphere containing 3% of hydrogen and in which oxygen is minimized.

      Then, crystal grows in the direction parallel to the substrate as indicated by the reference numeral 207 in FIG. 2B. This crystal growth advances from the region of the opening 205 to which nickel element has been introduced to the surrounding part.

      This crystal growth in the direction parallel to the substrate will be referred to as lateral growth.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      It is possible to advance this lateral growth across more than 100  MU m under the conditions shown in the present embodiment.

      Then, a silicon film 208 having a region in which the crystal has thus grown laterally is obtained.
      <br/>
      It is noted that crystal growth in the vertical direction called vertical growth advances from the surface of the silicon film to the underlying interface in the region where the opening 205 is formed.

      In this state, the vertical growth region, the lateral growth region and a region in which no crystal has grown (having amorphous state) exist within the silicon film 208.

      In this state, the nickel element is unevenly distributed in the film.

      After obtaining the state shown in FIG. 2C, laser light is irradiated.

      The thermal oxide film contains the nickel element thus gettered by the action of chlorine in high concentration.
      <br/>
      Further, because the thermal oxide film 209 is formed, the thickness of the crystalline silicon film 208 is reduced to about 500 angstrom.

      In the crystalline silicon film of this state, the nickel element has a distribution of concentration such that it exists in high concentration toward the surface of the crystalline silicon film.

      Accordingly, it is useful to etch the surface of the crystalline silicon film to remove the region in which the nickel element exists in high concentration after removing the thermal oxide film 209.

      This is caused by the fact that the concentration of the metal element contained within the lateral growth region is low originally.

    <heading>FOURTH EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="125">The present embodiment relates to a case of fabricating a thin film transistor disposed in a pixel region of an active matrix type liquid crystal display or an active matrix type EL display by utilizing the invention disclosed in the present specification.</p>
    <p num="126">
      FIG. 3 shows the fabrication process according to the present embodiment.
      <br/>
      At first, the crystalline silicon film is formed on the glass substrate through the process shown in the first or the third embodiment.
      <br/>
      When the crystalline silicon film is obtained by the arrangement shown in the first embodiment, it is patterned to obtain the state shown in FIG. 3A.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      In the state shown in FIG. 3A, the reference numeral 301 denotes a glass substrate, 302 an underlying film, and 303 an active layer formed of the crystalline silicon film.
      <br/>
      After obtaining the state shown in FIG. 3A, a plasma treatment is performed within a reduced pressure atmosphere in which oxygen and hydrogen are mixed.
      <br/>
      The plasma is generated by high-frequency discharge.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      Organic substances existing on the surface of the exposed active layer 303 may be removed by the above-mentioned plasma treatment.
      <br/>
      To be exact, the organic substances adsorbing on the surface of the active layer are oxidized by oxygen plasma and the oxidized organic substances are reduced and vaporized further by hydrogen plasma.
      <br/>
      Thus the organic substances existing on the surface of the exposed active layer 303 are removed.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      The removal of the organic substances is very effective in suppressing fixed charge from existing on the surface of the active layer 303.
      <br/>
      Because the fixed charge caused by the existence of organic substances hampers the operation of the device and renders the characteristics thereof instable, it is very useful to reduce it.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      After removing the organic substances, thermal oxidation is performed within an oxygen atmosphere at 640 (degree)  C. to form a thermal oxide film 300 of 100 angstrom thick.
      <br/>
      This thermal oxide film has a high interfacial characteristic with a semiconductor layer and composes a part of a gate insulating film later.
      <br/>
      Thus, the state shown in FIG. 3A is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      After obtaining the state shown in FIG. 3A, a silicon oxide nitride film 304 which composes the gate insulating film is formed in a thickness of 1000 angstrom.
      <br/>
      The film may be formed by using plasma CVD using mixed gas of oxygen, sillane and N2 O or plasma CVD using mixed gas of TEOS and N2 O.
    </p>
    <p num="132">The silicon oxide nitride film 304 functions as the gate insulating film together with the thermal oxide film 300.</p>
    <p num="133">
      It is also effective to contain halogen element within the silicon oxide nitride film.
      <br/>
      That is, by fixing the nickel element by the action of the halogen element, it is possible to prevent the function of the gate insulating film as an insulating film from being reduced by the influence of the nickel element (or another metal element which promotes crystallization of silicon) existing within the active layer.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      It is significant to use the silicon oxide nitride film in that the metal element hardly infiltrates to the gate insulating film because of its dense film quality.
      <br/>
      If the metal element infiltrates into the gate insulating film, its function as an insulating film is reduced, thus causing instability and dispersion of characteristics of the thin film transistor.
    </p>
    <p num="135">It is noted that a silicon oxide film which is normally used may be also used for the gate insulating film.</p>
    <p num="136">
      After forming the silicon oxide nitride film 304 which functions as the gate insulating film, an aluminum film not shown which functions as a gate electrode later is formed by sputtering.

      Scandium is included 0.2 weight % of aluminum within the aluminum film.
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      Scandium is included in the aluminum film to suppress hillock and whisker from being generated in the later process.
      <br/>
      The hillock and whisker mean that abnormal growth of aluminum occurs by heating, thus forming needle or prickle-like projections.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      After forming the aluminum film, a dense anodic oxide film not shown is formed.
      <br/>
      The anodic oxide film is formed by using ethylene glycol solution containing 3% of tartaric acid as electrolyte.
      <br/>
      That is, the anodic oxide film having the dense film quality is formed on the surface of the aluminum film by setting the aluminum film as the anode and platinum as the cathode and by anodizing within this electrolyte.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      The thickness of the anodic oxide film not shown having the dense film quality is around 100 angstrom.

    </p>
    <p num="143">In this step, the anodic oxide film 308 is formed selectively on the sides of the aluminum pattern because the resist mask 306 having the high adhesiveness exists thereabove.</p>

    <p num="145">
      Next, the resist mask 306 is removed.

      That is, the anodization is performed again by using the ethylene glycol solution containing 3% of tartaric acid as electrolyte.
      <br/>
      Then, an anodic oxide film 309 having a dense film quality is formed because the electrolyte infiltrates into the porous anodic oxide film 308.

      This dense anodic oxide film 309 is 1000 angstrom thick.

      Here, the exposed silicon oxide nitride film 304 and the thermal oxide film 300 are etched by utilizing dry etching.

    </p>
    <p num="191">It is noted that a heat treatment of ten hours at 650 (degree)  C. is performed within a nitrogen atmosphere containing 3% of HCl in the state shown in FIG. 5A in order to suppress the influence of carriers moving the side of the active layer.</p>
    <p num="192">Because an OFF current characteristic is degraded if a trap level exists on the side of the active layer due to the existence of the metal element, it is useful, by performing the process shown here, to reduce the density of the level on the side of the active layer.</p>
    <p num="193">
      Further, the thermal oxide film 500 and the silicon oxide nitride film 505 which compose a gate insulating film are formed.
      <br/>
      If quartz is used as the substrate here, it is desirable to compose the gate insulating film only by the thermal oxide film formed by using the above-mentioned thermal oxidation.
    </p>
    <p num="194">
      Next, an aluminum film not shown which composes a gate electrode later is formed in a thickness of 4000 angstrom.
      <br/>
      Besides the aluminum film, a metal which can be anodized (e.g. tantalum) may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="195">After forming the aluminum film, a very thin and dense anodic oxide film is formed on the surface thereof by the method described before.</p>
    <p num="196">
      Next, a resist mask not shown is provided on the aluminum film to pattern the aluminum film.
      <br/>
      Then, anodization is performed by setting the obtained aluminum pattern as the anode to form porous anodic oxide films 508 and 509.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the porous anodic oxide films is 5000 angstrom for example.
    </p>
    <p num="197">
      Then, another anodization is performed under the condition of forming dense anodic oxide films to form dense anodic films 510 and 511.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the dense anodic oxide films 510 and 511 is 800 angstrom.
      <br/>
      Thus, the state shown in FIG. 5B is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="198">Then, the exposed silicon oxide film 505 and the thermal oxide film 500 are removed by dry etching, thus obtaining the state shown in FIG. 5C.</p>
    <p num="199">
      After obtaining the state shown in FIG. 5C, the porous anodic oxide films 508 and 509 are removed by using mixed acid in which acetic acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid are mixed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the state shown in FIG. 5D is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="200">Here, resist masks are disposed alternately to implant P ions to the thin film transistor on the left side and B ions to the thin film transistor on the right side.</p>
    <p num="201">By implanting those impurity ions, a source region 514 and a drain region 517 having N-type in high concentration are formed in a manner of self-alignment.</p>
    <p num="202">Further, a region 515 to which P ions are doped in low concentration, thus having weak N-type, as well as a channel forming region 516 are formed in the same time.</p>
    <p num="203">
      The reason why the region 515 having the weak N-type is formed is because the remaining gate insulating film 512 exists.
      <br/>
      That is, part of P ions transmitting through the gate insulating film 512 is blocked by the gate insulating film 512.
    </p>
    <p num="204">
      By the same principle, a source region 521 and a drain region 518 having strong P-type are formed in a manner of self-alignment and a low concentrate impurity region 520 is formed in the same time.
      <br/>
      Further, a channel forming region 519 is formed in the same time.
    </p>
    <p num="205">In the case that when the thickness of the dense anodic oxide films 510 and 511 is as thick as 2000 angstrom, an offset gate region may be formed in contact with the channel forming region by that thickness.</p>
    <p num="206">Its existence may be ignored in the case of the present embodiment because the dense anodic oxide films 510 and 511 are so thin as less than 1000 angstrom.</p>
    <p num="207">Then, laser light or intense light is irradiated to anneal the region into which the impurity ions have been implanted.</p>
    <p num="208">
      Then, a silicon nitride film 522 and a silicon oxide film 523 are formed as interlayer insulating films as shown in FIG.
      <br/>
      SE. The thickness is 1000 angstrom, respectively.
      <br/>
      It is noted that the silicon oxide film 523 need not be formed.
    </p>
    <p num="209">
      Here, the thin film transistor is covered by the silicon nitride film.
      <br/>
      The reliability of the thin film transistor may be enhanced by arranging as described above because the silicon nitride film is dense and has a favorable interfacial characteristic.
    </p>
    <p num="210">
      Further, an interlayer insulating film 524 made of a resin material is formed by means of spin coating.
      <br/>
      Here, the thickness of the interlayer insulating film 524 is 1  MU m (FIG. 5E).
    </p>
    <p num="211">
      Then, contact holes are created to form a source electrode 525 and a drain electrode 526 of the N-channel type thin film transistor on the left side.
      <br/>
      In the same time, a source electrode 527 and the drain electrode 526 of the thin film transistor on the right side are formed.
      <br/>
      Here, the electrode 526 is disposed in common.
    </p>
    <p num="212">Thus, the thin film transistor circuit having a CMOS structure constructed in a complementary manner may be formed.</p>
    <p num="213">
      According to the arrangement shown in the present embodiment, the thin film transistor is covered by the nitride film and further the resin material.
      <br/>
      This arrangement allows to enhance the durability of the thin film transistor to which movable ions nor moisture hardly infiltrate.
    </p>
    <p num="214">Further, it allows to prevent capacitance from being generated between the thin film transistor and wires when a multi-layered wire is formed.</p>

    <p num="218">A predetermined annealing effect can be obtained with relatively low irradiation energy density by irradiating the laser light in the state shown in FIGS. 2E, 3A and 4A.</p>
    <p num="219">It is considered to have been effected because the laser energy is irradiated to a spot of small area, thus enhancing the efficiency of energy utilized in the annealing.</p>
    <heading>TENTH EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="220">The present embodiment relates to a case in which patterning of an active layer of a thin film transistor is devised in order to enhance the effect of annealing by the irradiation of laser light.</p>
    <p num="221">
      FIG. 6 shows a process for fabricating the thin film transistor according to the present embodiment.
      <br/>
      At first, a silicon oxide film or silicon oxide nitride film is formed as an underlying layer on a Corning 1737 glass substrate 601.
    </p>
    <p num="222">
      Next, an amorphous silicon film not shown is formed in a thickness of 500 angstrom by using low pressure thermal CVD.
      <br/>
      It is noted that this amorphous silicon film turns out to be a crystalline silicon film 603 through the crystallization process later.
    </p>
    <p num="223">
      Next, the amorphous silicon film not shown is crystallized by the method shown in the first embodiment (see FIG. 1) or third embodiment (see FIG. 2) to obtain the crystalline silicon film.
      <br/>
      Thus, the state shown in FIG. 6A is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="224">
      After obtaining the state shown in FIG. 6A, the crystalline silicon film 603 is formed on the glass substrate in accordance to the process shown in the first embodiment whose fabrication process is shown in FIG. 1 or the third embodiment whose fabrication process is shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      That is, the amorphous silicon film is crystallized by the heat treatment using nickel element to obtain the crystalline silicon film 604.
      <br/>
      The heat treatment is performed at 620 (degree)  C. for four hours.
    </p>
    <p num="225">
      After obtaining the crystalline silicon film, a pattern for constructing an active layer of a thin film transistor is formed.
      <br/>
      At this time, the pattern is formed so as to have a sectional profile 604 shown in FIG. 6B.
    </p>
    <p num="226">The pattern 604 as shown in FIG. 6B is formed in order to suppress the shape of the pattern from being deformed in the later treatment step of irradiating laser light.</p>
    <p num="227">In general, when laser light is irradiated to a pattern 702 made of a normal island-shape silicon film formed on a base 701 as shown in FIG. 7A, a convex portion 704 is formed at the edge of a pattern 703 after the irradiation of the laser light as shown in FIG. 7B.</p>
    <p num="228">It is considered to happen because energy of the irradiated laser light is concentrated at the edge of the pattern where heat cannot be released.</p>
    <p num="229">This phenomenon may become a factor of defective wires composing a thin film transistor or of defective operation thereof later.</p>
    <p num="230">Thus, the pattern 604 of the active layer is formed so as to have the profile as shown in FIG. 6B in the arrangement of the present embodiment.</p>
    <p num="231">Such arrangement allows to suppress the pattern of the silicon film from being deformed like the one shown in FIG. 7B when laser light is irradiated.</p>
    <p num="232">
      It is preferable to set an angle of the part designated by the reference numeral 605 from 20 (degree)  to 50 (degree) . It is not preferable to set the angle of 605 below 20 (degree)  because an area occupied by the active layer increases and it becomes difficult to form it.
      <br/>
      Further, it is not also preferable to set the angle of 600 above 50 (degree)  because the effect for suppressing the shape as shown in FIG. 7B from being formed is reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="233">The pattern 604 may be realized by utilizing isotropic dry etching in patterning it and by controlling the conditions of this dry etching.</p>
    <p num="234">After obtaining the pattern (which turns out to be the active layer later) having the shape 603 in FIG. 6B, laser light is irradiated as shown in FIG. 6C. This step allows to diffuse the nickel element which is locally blocked within the pattern 604 and to promote the crystallization of the pattern.</p>
    <p num="235">
      After finishing to irradiate laser light, a heat treatment is performed within an oxygen atmosphere containing 3% of HCl to form a thermal oxide film 606.
      <br/>
      Here, the thermal oxide film is formed in 100 angstrom thick by performing the heat treatment for 12 hours in the oxygen atmosphere containing 3% of HCl at 650 (degree)  C. (FIG. 6D).
    </p>
    <p num="236">
      The nickel element contained in the pattern 604 is gettered to the thermal oxide film by the action of chlorine.
      <br/>
      At this time, because the block of the nickel element has been destroyed through the irradiation of laser light in the previous step, the gettering of the nickel element is effectively performed.
    </p>
    <p num="237">
      Further, the gettering is performed also from the side surfaces of the pattern 604 when the arrangement shown in the present embodiment is adopted.
      <br/>
      This is useful in enhancing the OFF current characteristics and the reliability of the thin film transistor finally completed.
      <br/>
      It is because the existence of nickel element which promotes crystallization of silicon and which exists in the side of the active layer relates a wide influence over the increase of OFF current and the instability of the characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="238">
      After forming the thermal oxide film 606 for gettering as shown in FIG. 6D, the thermal oxide film 606 is removed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the state shown in FIG. 6E is obtained.
      <br/>
      It is concerned that the silicon oxide film 602 might be etched in the step of removing the thermal oxide film 606 when the silicon oxide film is adopted as the underlying layer 602.
      <br/>
      However, it does not matter so much when the thickness of the thermal oxide film 606 is as thin as 100 angstrom as shown in the present embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="239">After obtaining the state shown in FIG. 6E, a new thermal oxide film 607 is formed by a heat treatment in an atmosphere of 100% oxygen.</p>
    <p num="240">Here, the thermal oxide film 607 is formed in a thickness of 100 angstrom by the heat treatment in the oxygen atmosphere at 650 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="241">
      The thermal oxide film 607 is effective in suppressing the surface of the pattern 603 from being roughened when the laser light is irradiated later.
      <br/>
      The thermal oxide film also forms a part of a gate insulating film later.
      <br/>
      Because the thermal oxide film has a very favorable interfacial characteristic with the crystalline silicon film, it is useful to utilize it as part of the gate insulating film.
    </p>
    <p num="242">
      The laser light may be irradiated again after forming the thermal oxide film 607.
      <br/>
      Thus, the crystalline silicon film 604 in which the concentration of nickel element has been reduced and which has a high crystallinity may be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="243">Thereafter, the thin film transistor is fabricated by performing through the process shown in FIG. 3 or 4.</p>
    <heading>ELEVENTH EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="244">
      The present embodiment relates to a case devised in applying a heat treatment at a temperature more than a distortion point of a glass substrate.
      <br/>
      It is preferable to perform the process for gettering the metal element which promotes crystallization of silicon in the present invention disclosed in the present specification at a high temperature as much as possible.
    </p>
    <p num="245">When the Corning 1737 glass substrate (distortion point: 667 (degree)  C.) is used for instance, the higher gettering effect can be obtained when the temperature in gettering nickel element by forming the thermal oxide film is 700 (degree)  C. rather than when it is 650 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="246">However, if the heating temperature for forming the thermal oxide film is set at 700 (degree)  C. using the Corning 1737 glass substrate, the glass substrate deforms as a result.</p>
    <p num="247">
      The present embodiment provides means for solving this problem.
      <br/>
      That is, according to the arrangement shown in the present embodiment, the glass substrate is placed on a lapping plate which is formed of quartz whose flatness is guaranteed and the heat treatment is performed in this state.
    </p>
    <p num="248">
      Thereby, the flatness of the softened glass substrate is maintained by the flatness of the lapping plate.
      <br/>
      It is noted that it is also important to perform cooling in the state in which the glass substrate is placed on the lapping plate.
    </p>
    <p num="249">The adoption of such arrangement allows the heat treatment to be performed even if it is at the temperature above the distortion point of the glass substrate.</p>
