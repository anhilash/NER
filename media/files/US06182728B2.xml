      A run flat tire has a plurality of reinforcing wedges located in the tire sidewall with the hardness of each wedge generally diminishing in the radially inward direction of the sidewall.
      <br/>
      Since the bead filler is harder than the radial innermost wedge, the hardness at generally the top of the bead filler increases in the radial inward direction.
      <br/>
      The reinforcing wedges partially overlap each other and can generally have any configuration.
      <br/>
      The changing of hardness of the radial wedges results in a wedge sequence and thus a more even strain distribution throughout the tire sidewall.
      <br/>
      This strain distribution extends the run flat life of the tire and also provides a good balance with other tire performance parameters.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The invention relates to a run flat pneumatic tire utilizing reinforcing wedges of different hardness in the tire sidewall.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The basic concept of run flat tires has been around for many years.
      <br/>
      Many of the early inventions, such as U.S. Pat. No. 4,130,154 (1978) used separate support members that were applied to the wheel rim.
      <br/>
      These support members provided a secondary device to support the tire in an uninflated condition.
      <br/>
      Advancements in rubber compounding technology, as well as tire building techniques, have made it possible to incorporate the uninflated support capabilities into the tire sidewall itself.
      <br/>
      This provides for a more practical solution to the run flat engineering problem due to a reduction in complexity.
      <br/>
      One of the early patents that utilized this approach was U.S. Pat. No. 4,193,437 (1980).
      <br/>
      This concept used an insert of rubber material in the tire sidewall that provided the necessary extra support to allow the tire to run without inflation.
      <br/>
      Many patents have since been issued to various companies that are all modifications of this same basic approach.
      <br/>
      Some examples include U.S. Patents:
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,405,007 (1983) U.S. Pat. No. 5,368,082 (1994), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,320 (1997) to Goodyear,
      <br/>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,166 (1995), U.S. Pat. No. 5,511,599 (1996), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,868,190 (1999) to Michelin,
      <br/>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,779,658 (1988), U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,164 (1990), U.S. Pat. No. 5,217,549 (1993), U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,176 (1995), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,529,105 (1996) to Firestone.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      These patents generally use different construction and compound techniques to reach the goal of good run flat performance.
      <br/>
      However, one feature they all have in common is that they use sidewall inserts that essentially extend substantially the full radial sidewall length.
      <br/>
      This approach places a very difficult set of engineering requirements on one piece of material.
      <br/>
      Such material must provide adequate support and heat resistance performance for the entire sidewall height.
      <br/>
      Different zones in the sidewall have different performance characteristics.
      <br/>
      The upper sidewall region for instance is subjected to high flex and heat resistance requirements in the uninflated state.
      <br/>
      The lower sidewall zone, however, is subjected to much less stress.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the use of inserts that extend the full width of the sidewall makes it very difficult to balance tire performance characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A different concept is used in U.S. Pat. No. 5,309,970 (1994) which utilizes 3 specific sidewall zones.
      <br/>
      A relatively wide first reinforcing rubber insert transitions to a narrower second reinforcing insert which then transitions to the bead filler.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The characteristics of the above concepts are different from the proposed invention.
      <br/>
      Such concepts use the softest rubber compound in the upper sidewall region.
      <br/>
      The next hardest compound is the second reinforcing insert with the bead filler being the hardest compound.
      <br/>
      This approach has concentrated the stress on the upper first reinforcing insert instead of distributing it throughout the sidewall.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Another concept is set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,439,041 (1995) wherein the sidewall contains 3 basic zones.
      <br/>
      The upper zone in this case does not have any reinforcing insert.
      <br/>
      The middle section of the sidewall is reinforced with a "elastomeric sponge" type insert with the lower third consisting of a sandwich of this sponge and the bead filler.
      <br/>
      This concept also concentrates stresses in the upper sidewall region of the tire.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      A final concept is set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,526,862 (1996) wherein reinforcement does not extend the full length of the sidewall.
      <br/>
      The inserts are graduated in hardness laterally across the sidewall cross section.
      <br/>
      The hardest insert is placed in the inner portion of the tire sidewall and makes up a small percentage of the total sidewall height.
      <br/>
      It is designed for the tire to collapse around this insert in the uninflated state.
      <br/>
      This concentrates stress in the mid sidewall region of the tire.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The present invention relates to a pneumatic run flat tire, which has a sidewall hardness profile or gradient, which generally, gradually decreases in a radial inward direction from the crown of the tire to the lower sidewall region.
      <br/>
      The gradient is obtained by utilizing a plurality of reinforcing wedges of different hardness, with the hardest wedge located in the radially outermost position.
      <br/>
      The hardness of the various wedges can be controlled by utilizing different compounding formulations.
      <br/>
      The shape, geometry, etc. of the wedges is such that generally a gradual change in hardness is obtained in going in either a radial inward or outward direction from a point defined by the thickest section width of the lower sidewall wedge.
      <br/>
      The result is a a more even stress distribution which allows for increased run flat performance while at the same time providing better tuning capabilities for other tire performance characteristics such as vehicle ride.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="22">
      The run flat tire of the present invention can typically be any pneumatic tire and is generally indicated by the numeral 10.
      <br/>
      The tire has a tread or cap tread 12, which can be made from one or more conventional rubbers known to the art and the literature.
      <br/>
      A further description of the compounding required for the reinforcing inserts is, however, set forth herein below for clarity.
      <br/>
      Run flat tire 10 can have one or more reinforcing belts such as first steel belt 14 and second steel belt 15.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the tire tread area can also contain an edge cover layer, or cap strip 18 made of nylon as well as full cap layer 17 made of nylon.
      <br/>
      These reinforcement layers provide extra stiffness to the tread region of the tire to help reduce bending in the uninflated state and improve durability in the inflated state.
      <br/>
      The tire has a sidewall area generally indicated by the number 20 that extends radially inward from the outer edge of the tread.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Referring to FIG. 1, the geometric coordinates of the tire are set forth with the lateral direction extending in a horizontal direction of the drawing and the radial direction extending in a vertical direction of the drawing.</p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring to FIG. 2, the radial innermost portion of the tire contains tire bead 24 having a chafer strip 26 extending from the tire bead into the sidewall area, and filler portion 28 extending radially outward into the sidewall area.
      <br/>
      The general purpose of the bead filler is to provide a smooth transition from the bead to the sidewall above the bead.
      <br/>
      The more specific purpose of the bead filler for the run flat tire of the present invention is to provide a zone of materials whose properties are similar to the properties of the MSW, item 40.
      <br/>
      This causes the primary flex point to be located in the LSW material, item 50.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      According to the concepts of the present invention, a plurality of sidewall reinforcing wedges are utilized, each having a different hardness or stiffness, as well as different compressive characteristics, and generally located in a different radial location in the sidewall with respect to one another.
      <br/>
      While the total number of reinforcing wedges utilized in the preferred embodiment is three, the number thereof can vary as from about 2 to about 5.
      <br/>
      Application of a different number of wedges is dependent on the size tire, and therefore the total sidewall length.
      <br/>
      The radial length of each wedge is less than the radial length of the tire sidewall, which is generally defined by the distance from the top of the bead, point 1, to the edge of the tread, point 2, in FIGS. 2-5. Typically, each wedge can have a total length of from about 15% to about 85% and desirably from about 35% to about 65%, of the tire sidewall radial length as defined above.
      <br/>
      While each wedge can be located radially above or below an adjacent wedge, desirably, they partially overlap one another.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Point 4 noted on FIG. 2 designates a transition point in sidewall stiffness.
      <br/>
      This point can be located in a range of from about 10% to about 60% and desirably from about 25% to about 45% of the total sidewall length in a radial outward position from the top of the bead.
      <br/>
      This point also generally corresponds to the maximum thickness point for the LSW.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The reinforcing wedges desirably have a configuration such that the hardness or stiffness of the sidewall going from the radial outermost portion (Point 2) of the sidewall to Point 4, see FIG. 2, generally, gradually decreases in hardness or has a decreasing hardness or stiffness gradient.
      <br/>
      This gradient then increases from Point 4 as the direction continues radially inward (as defined by FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      In other words, a smooth, gradual change occurs which results in a gradual transition of the material properties, such as hardness or stiffness.
      <br/>
      Various shapes can be utilized such as a parallelogram, a rhomboid, a trapezoid, a shape in which one side is undulating and the other side is essentially a straight line, etc., with a preferred shape being a sinusoidal shape such as shown in the drawings.
      <br/>
      Other shapes can, of course, be used to generate the same sidewall properties.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, three different wedges of different hardness are utilized as shown in FIGS. 2 through 5 in conjunction with the bead filler.
      <br/>
      The USW 30 has the highest stiffness or Shore A hardness of from about 75 to about 86 and desirably from about 77 to about 84, the MSW has a Shore A hardness of from about 73 to about 82 and desirably from about 75 to about 80, and the Shore A hardness of the LSW is from about 63 to about 77 and desirably from about 65 to about 75.
      <br/>
      Depending upon the size of the tire, the lateral thickness of the tire and the like, other values can utilized with a general proviso, as noted above, that the hardness or stiffness generally, gradually decreases from the radial outward direction towards the radial inward direction.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the hardness or stiffness of the LSW is desirably less than the hardness or stiffness of the bead filler 28, which desirably has approximately the same hardness or stiffness as MSW 40.
      <br/>
      When a run flat tire having a sidewall reinforcing wedge embodiment as shown in FIGS. 2 through 5 is utilized, LSW 50 is positioned so that it's thickest lateral cross section is located at a point of from about 10% to about 60%, desirably from about 25% to about 45%, preferably from about 30 to about 40% of the total tire sidewall length above the tire bead.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the radially inward length within the LSW are the lengths of bead filler 28.
      <br/>
      Considering the MSW, the maximum lateral cross section thereof occurs approximately at the maximum lateral width of the tire.
      <br/>
      That is, at a point which is generally from about 30 to about 85%, desirably from about 45 to about 70%, and preferably from about 53 to about 63% of the total tire sidewall length above the tire bead.
      <br/>
      The USW maximum lateral cross section thickness occurs at approximately at the edge of the tread, point 2 on FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      That is, at a point which is generally from about 75 to about 125%, desirably from about 85 to about 115% and preferably from about 95 to about 105% of the tire sidewall length above the tire bead.
      <br/>
      Percentages above 100% are utilized to denote the radially outward location (Point 7) which is above point 2 in FIGS. 2-5 and wherein the USW is located partially beneath steel belts 14 and 15.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The total sidewall thickness, i.e., from the most laterally inward surface of the innerliner to the most lateral outward surfaces of sidewall 90, is a tuning parameter used to adjust the tire performance characteristics.
      <br/>
      The total thickness used is dependent on the loading demands coupled with the material properties of the inserts.
      <br/>
      This combination provides extensive latitude in design capabilities of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the teachings of the present invention can be applied to tires not intended for run flat usage.
      <br/>
      For example, thinner sidewall thickness can be used to provide ways to tune tires for handling, ride or road noise characteristics.
      <br/>
      The actual lateral thickness of the wedges will vary, as noted above, with regard to the tire size, the tire sidewall radial length, and the like, but generally is from about 10 to about 30 mm and desirably from about 16 to about 24 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      FIGS. 2 through 5 show various body ply configurations.
      <br/>
      Each configuration provides a different set of performance tradeoffs, which can be used, dependent on the individual tire's application.
      <br/>
      All of these configurations use the same reinforcement insert configuration.
      <br/>
      However, other configurations as well as other numbers of wedges can be utilized.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the composition of the inserts can be changed to provide for specific performance characteristics.
      <br/>
      The total sidewall thickness used in each ply configuration can also be different.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      FIG. 2 shows a tire having a total of 3 body plies.
      <br/>
      The following is a general description with respect to a tire building process to clarify the relative positions of the individual components of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The first tire component applied to a building drum is the innerliner of the tire with the body ply 60 applied above the innerliner.
      <br/>
      The inserts (30, 40 &amp; 50) are next applied to the top of the first body ply with LSW located in the most laterally outward positions.
      <br/>
      The second body ply 70 is then applied over the reinforcing inserts.
      <br/>
      The bead 24 and bead filler 28, which are pre-assembled, are next applied to the construction.
      <br/>
      Turnup 100 is then applied.
      <br/>
      Third body ply 80 is then applied on top of the existing components.
      <br/>
      Chafer 26 is applied next with sidewall runner 90 applied on the top of the above-noted sidewall construction.
      <br/>
      The final step is to apply the tread package, comprising belts 14 and 15, full cap 12 and cap strips 17 and 18, and tread 12.
      <br/>
      This construction package provides a good performance compromise with respect to good vertical stiffness in the uninflated condition because of the two outside plies.
      <br/>
      The combination of plies on both sides of the reinforcing inserts also provides good lateral stiffness to the construction when uninflated.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 3 shows a second tire construction having a total of 3 body plies.
      <br/>
      The basic order of building is the same for this tire as FIG. 2 but with one exception.
      <br/>
      The second body ply 70 is applied on top of reinforcing inserts 30 (LSW) &amp; 50 (USW).
      <br/>
      Reinforcing insert 40 (MSW) is then applied on top of the second body ply.
      <br/>
      The rest of the construction order is generally the same.
      <br/>
      This sidewall ply configuration provides improvements in lateral stiffness but sacrifices vertical stiffness when compared to the construction of FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 4 shows a two-ply construction.
      <br/>
      This construction is built the same as the construction shown in FIG. 2 with the exception of body ply 70 is eliminated.
      <br/>
      This sidewall ply configuration provides a tire with lower vertical stiffness while still maintaining a good lateral stiffness.
      <br/>
      It also provides a lightweight construction.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      FIG. 5 shows another two-ply construction.
      <br/>
      This construction is again built as described in the construction depicted in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The exception in this embodiment is that body ply 60 is eliminated.
      <br/>
      The reinforcing wedges in this construction are applied directly to the innerliner.
      <br/>
      This construction provides good vertical stiffness but sacrifices lateral stiffness.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      FIGS. 6 and 7 show finite element representations of the current invention compared to the prior art.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 shows the current invention modeled with material values assigned as described in this specification at a load of 900 lbs. and 0 psi inflation.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 shows a tire from U.S. Pat. No. 5,795,416 (1998) that is subjected to the same conditions.
      <br/>
      Material properties for the modeling results shown in FIG. 7 were based on the description in the patent.
      <br/>
      This representation is therefore only as accurate of the actual product as estimates from the referenced patent can provide.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The rubber compositions of the sidewall inserts must exhibit the necessary requirements of stiffness and must also have low heat build-up.
      <br/>
      The stiffness of the rubber compositions can be characterized in laboratory testing by any of a number of tests that are known to those skilled in the art of rubber testing.
      <br/>
      Two acceptable procedures are the initial deflection when measured by a Goodrich flexometer according to ASTM D623 and the dynamic modulus when measured by a RPA2000.RTM. Rubber Processability Analyzer (RPA) available from Alpha Technologies.
      <br/>
      The RPA test relates to inserting a sample of the uncured rubber composition into the cavity of the RPA2000 analyzer and allowing the sample to cure in a static state for 12 minutes at an isothermal temperature of 168 (degree)  C. The sample is then cooled to 55 (degree)  C. where it tested in a strain sweep mode from 0.5% strain to 15% strain using 20 Hz testing frequency.
      <br/>
      The G' value at 5% can be used to compare the relative stiffness of the different rubber compositions used in this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Excessive heat build-up of the rubber compositions is detrimental to the useful life of a tire.
      <br/>
      Heat build-up is a result of the internal hysteresis of the rubber compositions.
      <br/>
      The hysteresis or the heat build-up can be measured in the laboratory by any number of procedures known to those skilled in the art of rubber testing.
      <br/>
      One satisfactory procedure is to use a Goodrich flexometer while following the ASTM test number D623 for heat buildup.
      <br/>
      The machine measures the temperature build up with a thermocouple in contact with the surface of the test specimen.
      <br/>
      In addition to this measurement, a thermocouple probe can be inserted into the center of the rubber specimen immediately subsequent to the test conclusion and the sample's internal temperature can be recorded.
      <br/>
      A second satisfactory method is to measure the tangent delta while using the RPA2000 for heat buildup under the procedure mentioned previously.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      One of the requirements of the present invention is that the stiffness of the sidewall inserts progressively increases from USW 50 to the MSW 40 and next to the LSW 30.
