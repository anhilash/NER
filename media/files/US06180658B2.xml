    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) . have been used for many years in therapy.
      <br/>
      It is also well known that NSAIDs produce lesions to gastrointestinal apparatus depending on the length of the treatment and on the type of drug.
      <br/>
      This problem has a dramatic importance in cases where the therapy must be protracted for a long time.
      <br/>
      An example is rheumatoid arthritis in old people, where a chronic treatment is needed to keep under control the inflammatory state and the pain and make acceptable the quality of life.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      At present there is a pharmacological dogma establishing a mandatory connection between anti-inflammatory effect and gastric lesions.
      <br/>
      This dogma has been recently shaken by the availability of newly synthesised anti-inflammatory drugs showing gastrolesive effects lower than those of old ones.
      <br/>
      Notwithstanding that equiactive doses of drug could produce lesions of different seriousness, it was settled that an anti-inflammatory drug showed, in any case, a gastrolesive effect.
      <br/>
      From this fact it followed that it could not be expected that these drugs known in the art could show a gastroprotective effect.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It is also well known, and this has a pharmacological relevance too, that the administration of NSAIDs reflects negatively on renal function, in particular by provoking a remarkable decrease in diuresis.
      <br/>
      This effect is due to prostaglandin blockade; in fact, prostaglandin physiologically dilate the renal vascular system.
      <br/>
      The blocking effects of traditional NSAIDs lead to vasoconstriction and to the consequent inhibition of diuresis.
      <br/>
      From this fact it followed that it could not be expected that these drugs known in the art could be administered without negatively affecting the renal function.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Even more so in view of the above, it could not be expected that a NSAID could simultaneously show a gastroprotective effect without negatively affecting the renal function while at the same time maintaining a high anti-inflammatory activity.</p>
    <p num="7">
      It is also well known that in view of their side-effects on gastric mucosa, NSAIDs are invariably administered after meals or, in general, when the stomach is not empty.
      <br/>
      The generality of this pharmacological principle finds a practical confirmation in the recommendations found in the packagings of the drugs in commerce.
      <br/>
      Basically the idea is that the effects of the hypersecretion of hydrochloric acid provoked by the administration of NSAIDs may be, at least partially, counteracted by the presence of food.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      It has been now surprisingly found that the compound 2-methoxyphenyl-1-methyl-5p-methylbenzoyl-pyrrol-2-acetamido acetate, which is an effective anti-inflammatory non-steroidal drug as already known in the art, shows a remarkable atisecretory activity on gastric secretion in mammals without affecting the renal function, but, on the contrary, increasing the diuresis.
      <br/>
      This increase in diuresis is linked to its mechanism of action; in fact, the overflow of neuropeptides (in particular CGRP) produced in the stomach by MED 15 and flowing from the stomach into the bloodstream, produces renal capillary vasodilatation, with reversal of its effect on prostaglandin.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Additionally, and more than unexpectedly for a NSAID, it has been found that amtolmetin guacyl, in order to show its efficacy (gastroprotection and renal tolerability together with an anti-inflammatory effect unchanged), has to be administered on empty stomach in view of the peculiarity of its action mechanism.</p>

    <heading>CHEMISTRY</heading>
    <p num="14">
      The molecule of amtolmetin guacyl was synthesised using modern chemical technology now known as "Combinatorial Chemistry".
      <br/>
      This neologism was coined in the United States as recently as 1993, but the technique was known years before.
      <br/>
      This new synthetic chemistry technique consists in combining molecular species bioactive in themselves, to obtain molecules which possess pharmacological properties totally different from those of the single starting components.
      <br/>
      Traditionally, a staring molecule was manipulated through the substitution of a number of radicals, now the procedure is less random and starts from molecular moieties which are pharmacologically active per se (Combinatorial Chemistry, Editorial Feb. 12, 1996, C&amp;EN) .
      <br/>
      The amtolmetin guacyl molecule was born this way, producing a drug with completely new characteristics, totally different from the bioactivity of the various moieties.
    </p>
    <p num="15">While the production and characterisation of the compound amtolmetin guacyl are disclosed in the above mentioned US and Italian documents which are hereby incorporated for reference, in the following 1) the results of pharmacological tests showing the antisecretive activity and 2) the pharmacotoxicological profile and 3) the mechanism of action of the above compound and 4) clinics are reported.</p>
    <p num="16">1) Pharmacological tests showing the antisecretive activity on animals.</p>
    <p num="17">Chemicals and Animals used</p>
    <p num="18">
      The following substances have been used: carboxymethylcellulose sodium, histamine dichloride, piroxicam, carrageenin and acetylcholine chloride produced by Sigma Chimica (Milano, Italy); cimetidine produced by Farchemia (Milano, Italy); 2-methoxyphenyl-1-methyl-5p-methylbenzoyl-pyrrol-2-acetamido acetate and naproxen produced by Alfa Chemicals Italiana (Bergamo, Italia); diclofenac sodium, nimesulide and tolmetin produced by LCM Trading (Milano, Italy); gastrin produced by Fluka Chimica (Milano, Italy).
      <br/>
      Male Wistar rats, 250 +- 10 g b.w. (Charles River, Calco, Como, Italy), quarantined for five days prior to the beginning of the trial and divided into groups of 3 animals per cage, were used for determination of gastric lesions and of ID50 determination.
      <br/>
      Immature male Wistar rats, 30-45 g b.w. (Harlan Nossan, Milano) were used for the determination of the antisecretory effect on isolated rat stomach.
      <br/>
      The guinea-pigs used were the Dunkin Hartley guinea-pigs (Harlan Nossan, Milano, Italy).
    </p>
    <p num="19">The animals were fed standard laboratory chow with free access to water under animal house conditions of 22 +- 2 (degree)  C. temperature, relative humidity 55 +- 10% and 12-h light-dark cycle..</p>
    <p num="20">Determination of Gastric Lesions</p>
    <p num="21">In this first test the effect of the compound 2-methoxyphenyl-1-methyl-5p-methylbenzoyl-pyrrol-2-acetamido acetate and of some reference NSAIDs (diclofenac sodium, naproxene, nimesulide, piroxicam and tolmetin) on the gastric mucosa of rat after repeated oral administration in order to test the existence and extent of the gastric lesions, has been verified.</p>
    <p num="22">
      The animals entered in the trial, randomized and divide into groups of 6 rats each, were fasted for 16 h prior to treatment, with access to water ad libitum.
      <br/>
      They were re-fed 1 h after drug administration.
      <br/>
      The compound 2-methoxyphenyl-1-methyl-5p-methylbenzoyl-pyrrol-2-acetamido acetate and the other reference NSAIDs, suspended in 1% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solution, were orally administered by gastric gavage in a volume of 6 ml/kg for four consecutive days.
      <br/>
      Controls received the vehicle in the same way as the treated animals. 4 h after the last administration the animals were killed by ether overdose; the stomachs were removed, rinsed with 10 ml of saline and immersed in 1% formalin.
      <br/>
      They were later opened along the greater curvature and the mucosa examined for lesions.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The seriousness of the lesion was quantified according to a scale graduated from 1 to 3 according to the size of the lesions: 1=ulcer&lt;1 mm; 2=ulcer 1-2mm; 3=ulcer&gt;2mm.
      <br/>
      The total sum was divided by 10 to obtain the "erosion index".
      <br/>
      The gastric lesions were evaluated by two independent investigators under blind conditions according to Main &amp; Whittle method (BJ Pharmac 1975:53; p. 217-224).
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Since pharmacological studies in carrageenin-induced paw oedema in rat show that a daily 50mg/kg dose in oral administration of 2-methoxyphenyl-1-methyl-5p-methylbenzoyl-pyrrol-2-acetamido acetate is higly-efficacious as anti-inflammatory agent, this daily dose has been selected for the evaluation of the gastric lesions of same compound.
      <br/>
      Since the average daily dose in man (for the anti-inflammatory activity) is 600 mg, the comparative efficacious dose in the rat is in the ratio of 12:1.
      <br/>
      More precisely, comparative evaluation with the other NSAID compounds was calculated as follows:
      <br/>
      600 mg/die: 50 mg/kg=daily dose of reference NSAID in man: X
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      where X represents the daily dose of the reference NSAID in rat.
      <br/>
      This criterion keeps into account the "real" activity ratio in man.
      <br/>
      In this work the "ratio to rat dosage" has also been included which keeps into account ratios homogeneous to the same animal species.
      <br/>
      To evaluate the "ratio to rat dosage" the ID50 has been determined using the carrageenin-induced oedema as inflammatory test.
      <br/>
      This made possible to determine in rat an equiactive dose which is, consequently, comparable among the various compared NSAIDs.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Determination of ID50</p>
    <p num="27">
      ID50. relative to the products under examination (considered in table 1), has been evaluated using the anti-inflammatory response to carrageenin-induced paw oedema (according to Wong et al, J Pharmacol Exp, 1973-1855; pages 127-138).
      <br/>
      The products, suspended in 1% CMC, were administered orally in a total volume of 5 ml/rat. 1 h later, 0.1 ml of 1% carrageenin sterile solution was injected into the hind subplantar aponeurosis.
      <br/>
      Volume of the paw was measured immediately prior to injection of the phlogogen and 2 h thereafter, by means of a plethysmograph.
      <br/>
      The percentage of inhibition of oedema was calculated as follows:
      <br/>
      1- DELTA V treated/ DELTA V control * 100
    </p>
    <p num="28">where  DELTA V=final V-initial V.</p>
    <p num="29">Three doses have been used for each NSAID and the ID50, which indicates the quantity in mg/kg inhibiting oedema by 50%, has been determined.</p>
    <p num="30">
      The results are listed in the following table 1, where each expressed value is the average of 6 determinations.
      <br/>
      In this table the results either of the so-called "ratio to human dosage" and of the "ratio to rat dosage" are listed.

      Rats were treated with amtolmetin guacyl by oral gavage (100 mg/kg), diclofenac (15.8 mg/kg) and tolmetin (61.2 mg/kg) in CMC 1% for 4 consecutive days.
      <br/>
      Controls received the vehicle only, also by oral gavage. 4 h after the final administration the animals were killed by ether overdose and the stomachs removed, rinsed in saline and immersed in formalin 4%.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The histological results confirmed what we had previously seen wits the dissection microscope; the difference between amtolmetin guacyl and the other NSAIDs appeared enormous.
      <br/>
      In particular, it was emphasized the better aspect of the gastric mucosa of some of the stomachs (which were revealed to be those of amtolmetin guacyl and had also been observed in our laboratories) (b.r. No.17).
      <br/>
      This difference between amtolmetin guacyl and the controls piloted us towards research of possible gastro-protective effects of the molecule.
      <br/>
      The question posed was whether the product in some way influenced the gastric acid secretion which is well known to be at the basis of NSAID-induced gastric damage.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Antisecretive activity in vitro in the rat At the beginning, the isolated, perfused, immature rat stomach, treated externally with the study product, was used.
      <br/>
      We preferred to use the isolated stomach in toto rather than strips (B.R. No. 18, 19 and 20) in order not to exclude a section of the stomach (the antrum), unimportant for acid secretion but very important for the secretion of bicarbonates and bioactive peptides (b.r. No. 21, 22).
      <br/>
      The results were encouraging, since amtolmetin guacyl inhibited acid production stimulated by the three classic agonists (histamine, acetilcholine and gastrin) both using varying doses of agonist or varying doses of amtolmetin guacyl (Table 5).

    <p num="107">
      Carcinogenesis studies in the rat administered by gavage with amtolmetin guacyl for a period covering the animal's life-span (b.r. No. 16) demonstrated the innocuity of the product.
      <br/>
      3) Mechanism of action
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      Interest in the amtolmetin guacyl molecule arose following a thorough analysis of the results of 31 comparative and 6 non-comparative clinical trials involving 1596 patients.
      <br/>
      All of the studies revealed an extremely low incidence of adverse events involving the stomach (5% circa) which compared the product very favourably with the other NSAIDs, in which the incidence was in the region of 30% or more (as in the case of indomethacin) with frequent interruptions of treatment.
      <br/>
      This 5% was considered by us to be practically hull in consideration of the fact that all of the patients reporting side effects frequently had a past history of concomitant disease and previous medical treatment; also, it cannot be excluded that antihistamine drugs were taken during the course of the experimentation which are known to interfere with the mechanisms of gastric protection of amtolmetin guacyl.
      <br/>
      Furthermore the physician, being aware of administering an NSAID, was expecting adverse events and could not be expected to be an impartial observer.
      <br/>
      The few cases of gastro-intestinal phenomena reported with amtolmetin guacyl were transitory and in no event accompanied by the presence of occult blood in the stools.
      <br/>
      Moreover, even in the presence of a reported side-effect it was almost never necessary to suspend treatment (0.4% of suspensions).
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      On the basis of the above series of observations, we decided to study the pharmacological behaviour of a number of widely used NSAIDs (including amtolmetin guacyl) towards the gastric mucosa in the rat, as previously described.
      <br/>
      Having univocally established the effect of amtolmetin guacyl on the reduction of gastric acid, the question of the mechanism of action of this effect arose.
      <br/>
      The first hypothesis was that we were deling with an anti-H2 drug, given the fact that its potency could be compared with that of cimetidine.
      <br/>
      However, when using an organ in which only H2 receptors were present (guinea-pig atrium) the drug did not interfere with the H2 receptors (FIG. 5).
    </p>
    <p num="110">On the other hand, we had previously noted differences between potentiometric determination of H+ and NaOH titration of the gastric effluate, in agreement with the substantial literature available on the subject, This fact was clearly in favour of a strong presence of bicarbonates (b.r. No. 27, 28).</p>
    <p num="111">Experiments on bicarbonate secretion (under the same conditions as these of the acid secretion studies) following stimulation with histamine and treatment with amtolmeting guacyl, demonstrated an increase in bicarbonate production of 67% (FIG. 6).</p>
    <p num="112">In parallel we also studied the possible effect on intestinal motility in the guinea-pig isolated ileum (b.r. No. 29) using various agonists (FIG. 7, 8 and 9)</p>
    <p num="113">
      Having established the amtolmeting guacyl-related decrease in motility using all of the traditional agonists, we proceeded to verify whether this same effect was present at gastric level.
      <br/>
      Using acetilcholine and serotonin as agonists in the rat isolated stomach strips model (b.r. No. 30), we obtained clear evidence of down-regulation of motility also in this organ (FIG. 10, 11 and 12).
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      In the course of various studies conducted on animals to show the lack of renal impairment, a test was carried out to compare the diuresis in normally hydrated rats treated orally for 8 consecutive days with amtolmeting guacyl and diclofenac, which is also a NSAID.
      <br/>
      From the results, which are shown in FIG. 13, it is possible to observe a definite increase in diuresis in the animals which were treated with amtolmeting guacyl and a likewise clear decrease in the animals treated with diclofenac.
      <br/>
      It is to be stressed that the behaviour of diclofenac is completely in line with the behaviour of a NSAID as known in the art, that is to say to markedly reduce the diuresis, while that of amtolmeting guacyl is completely unforeseeable.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      The results obtained led to the identification of a mechanism of action which would simultaneously account for:
      <br/>
      1)--decrease of acidity
      <br/>
      2)--increase of bicarbonates
      <br/>
      3)--increase of gastric blood flow
      <br/>
      4)--increase of diuresis
      <br/>
      5)--decrease of motility.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      At this stage CGRP (calcitonin gene related peptide) was considered a good candidate to match with all of the parameters to be considered.
      <br/>
      CGRP is a 37 aminoacid polipeptide which depresses gastric acidity (b.r. No.31, 32).
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      Experiments carried out using a specific antagonist of CGRP (CGRP8-37) demonstrated that inhibition of this polipeptide leads to blockage of the amtolmetin guacyl related activity on gastric secretion.
      <br/>
      This demonstrates thet CGRP actually is implicated in the mechanism of action of amtolmetin guacyl (FIG. 14).
    </p>
    <p num="118">These results were confirmed by Huntingdon Life Sciences U.K.</p>
    <p num="119">
      CGRP production itself is known to be stimulated by the vanilloid (or capsaicin) sensitive receptors which simultaneously produce an increase in bicarbonate production (b.r. No. 33).
      <br/>
      A comparison between the capsaicin structures and amtolmetin guacyl shows that all of these structures contain a vanilloid radical in their molecules (FIG. 15).
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      The hypothesis of the impact of amtolmetin guacyl on the vanilloid receptors was therefore strengthened and the experimental demonstration was obtained using capsazepine, a specific receptor antagonist of capsaicin (FIG. 16).
      <br/>
      The introduction of a guaiacol moiety into the amtolmetin guacyl molecule led to the insertion of a vanilloid radical which confers gastroprotective properties to the molecule.
      <br/>
      Moreover, although capsaicin possesses revulsive and inhibitory properties, both nonivamide and amtolmetin guacyl are inhibited by the capsazepine antagonist, and do not determine any irritative phenomena (b.r. No. 34, 35, 36).
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      In the in vivo experimentation, evaluated as effect of the product both on gastric mucosal secretion and on the healthy condition of the mucosa itself, it was noted that in the presence of an inhibitor of H1 receptors (therefore a typical antihistamine agent), the gastroprotective effect of amtolmetin guacyl drops out.
      <br/>
      This is a further demonstration of the impact of amtolmetin guacyl on the vanilloid receptors, due to the well known interference existing between these receptors and drugs such as diphenidramine (b.r. No. 37) and pyrilamine (b.r. No.38).
      <br/>
      All of this constitutes a precise forewarning of the association of amtolmetin guacyl with H1 receptor inhibiting substances on pain of loss of the gastroprotective properties of the former (FIG. 17 and 18).
    </p>
    <p num="122">The presence of the vanilloid radical, essential to the expression of the gastroprotective mechanism, is guaranteed by the prolonged persistence of high amounts of intact amtolmetin guacyl molecule in the gastric and intestinal walls (at least 2 hours after oral administration in the rat).</p>
    <p num="123">
      CGRP down-regulates acid secretion and also produces intense vasodilation of gastric mucosa and of the kidney, where it produces an increase in glomerular infiltration rate (which justifies the diuretic effect of amtolmetin guacyl) (b.r. No. 39).
      <br/>
      Also, the decrease in amtolmetin guacyl-determined motility which we observed may be attributed to increased CGRP, a notorious inhibitor of gastrointestinal motility (b.r. No. 40).
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      Recent studies indicate that the vasodilatatory and cytoprotective effects of CGRP at the gastric level implicate, at least in part, NO-dependent mechanisms (b.r. No. 41).
      <br/>
      Implication of nitric oxide in the smooth muscle relaxation exercised by CGRP has also been demonstrated (b.r. No. 42).
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      Glycine is released during the metabolic processes of amtolmetin guacyl.
      <br/>
      Since glycine determines an increase in glomerular filtrate and this effect is inhibited by an antagonist of NO synthesis, it is legitimate to consider NO as the mediator of the action exercised on this mechanism by glycine.
      <br/>
      Hence, since NO is implicated in the mechanism of action of CGRP and of glycine, and the latter aminoacid is one of the amtolmetin guacyl metabolites, we may deduce that glycine also contributes to the positive renal effects exercised by the product.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      From the results summarized above amtolmetin guacyl emerges as an NSAID with a completely new profile necessitating specific indications in user in particular, being an anti-secretory drug and inhibitor of gastric motility, it has to be administered on an empty stomach so as not to interfere with normal digestive processes.
      <br/>
      It has to be stressed that this is the first case in which a NSAID is administered on empty stomach, while all other NSAIDs administered invariably after meals.
      <br/>
      Moreover, for what explained above, amtolmetin guacyl in order to have its gastro- and renal-protective effect has to be administered without concomitant assumption of H1 -receptor inhibiting drugs.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      In conclusion, the data presented indicate that amtolmetin guacyl is an anti-inflammatory drug with outstanding characteristics, which make its use possible in patients in whom the administration of NSAIDs is usually contraindicated.

    <heading>CONCLUSIONS</heading>
    <p num="150">
      Clinical studies demonstrate that amtolmetin guacyl has very marked anti-inflammatory activity, primary in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and post-operative pain.
      <br/>
      There were no differences compared to the other NSAIDs in the treatment of extra-articular rheumatism.
      <br/>
      The results are summarised in Table 15.
    </p>
    <p num="151">The singularity of the compound lies in the long duration of the peak effect (6 hours), unlike all of the other NSAIDs.</p>

    <p num="153">II Parameter: Tolerability</p>
    <p num="154">
      Drug tolerability is important for the correct calculation of the risk/benefit ratio.
      <br/>
      Of relevance for NSAIDs is the recognition of gastric (A) and renal (B) side-effects.
    </p>
    <p num="155">A) NSAIDs and gastric damage</p>
    <p num="156">
      The incidence of the undesirable side effects of NSAIDs on the gastric mucosa varies depending on the drug structure and its pharmaceutical form.
      <br/>
      The buffered effervescent formulations, for example, avoid the gastric mucosa/compound primary damage but not damage the mucosa after re-cycling.
    </p>
    <p num="157">With the NSAIDs known to date the incidence of side effects involving the gastric mucosa is about 20-30%, the elderly, in whom the adaptive processes are often slowed down or compromised, being the most affected.</p>
    <p num="158">NSAID-related gastric damage is due to the inhibition of gastric prostaglandins which results in a NSAID-related hydrochloric acid hypersecretion; in fact NSAIDs by inhibiting all prostaglandin synthesis (and this is inherent to their anti-inflammatory activity), also protective prostaglandins of the gastric mucosa.</p>
    <p num="159">Amtolmetin guacyl and gastric protection Amtolmetin guacyl shows good anti-inflammatory activity in man and the pharmacological studies conducted in rats showed that this effect is due to inhibition of both COXI (cyclooxygenase 1) and COX2 (cyclooxygenase 2).</p>
    <p num="160">
      Amtolmetin guacyl therefore also inhibits the COXl known to induce the synthesis of those prostaglandins which protect the gastric mucosa and the renal flow as well as the synthesis of TXA2 (thromboxane A2), a potent platelet aggregating agent.
      <br/>
      For all of these reasons the drug was expected to induce gastric damage and inhibit platelet aggregation.
    </p>
    <p num="161">Amtolmetin guacyl does indeed demonstrate significant platelet antiaggregating properties, but it has also demonstrated in clinics (with before/after endoscopies) not to induce gastric lesions, especially when administered on an empty stomach.</p>
    <p num="162">
      The mechanism of action of amtolmetin guacyl is linked to stimulation of both vanilloid receptors and CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) receptors, as demonstrated using specific inhibitors.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the structure of MED 15 contains a vanilloid moiety; this appears to be the reason for its specific stimulating effect.
      <br/>
      The various chemical structures are reported in FIG. 15 for comparison.
    </p>
    <p num="163">Amtolmetin guacyl per se fails to modify basal acid secretion; its gastroprotective effect arises only when H+ production exceeds a certain limit.</p>
    <p num="164">B) Renal tolerability.</p>
    <p num="165">Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis is known to reflect negatively on renal function since prostaglandins are delegated to the modulation of renal blood flow and they are physiologically released to counteract the renovasoconstriction produced by angiotensin II.</p>
    <p num="166">CGRP overflow from the stomach into the bloodstream produces visible effects in patients (red flushed appearance) and effects on the kidney (increase in diuresis), counteracting the effects of prostaglandin inhibition.</p>
    <p num="167">To shed some light on the possible exploitation of this unexpected effect on the kidney we listed the classes of patients which show the highest risk of developing renal failures when treated with NSAIDs.</p>

    <p num="169">Amtolmetin guacyl and renal function</p>
    <p num="170">Despite the fact that amtolmetin guacyl is a NSAID, it has been surprisingly found that it antagonizes the renal vasoconstriction provoked by the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.</p>
    <p num="171">As proof of the above, studies carried out in rats demonstrated that a single dose of Amtolmetin guacyl increased diuresis in these animals by an average of 10%, whilst diclofenac decreased it by an average of 10%.</p>
    <p num="172">Repeated doses (one per day) for 8 days increased diuresis in the treated rats by 35% (see FIG. 13).</p>
    <p num="173">Tolerability: conclusions The tolerability of amtolmetin guacyl is very good and no significant variations of the routine biological parameters were observed during or after treatment.</p>
    <p num="174">The organs most open to damage by the NSAIDs, the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys, benefit from the protective activity of Amtolmetin guacyl, without detriment to the therapeutic activity of the drug.</p>
    <p num="175">
      At present in clinics NSAID-related side-effects are minimized by the simultaneous delivery of H2 -receptor antagonists or protonic pump inhibitors or gastroprotective prostaglandins.
      <br/>
      All these treatments have their own side-effects.
      <br/>
      In our case this protective effect is obtained with a single drug, improving therapy acceptability on the part of the patient, especially in the long-term treatments.
    </p>
    <p num="176">Confirmation of the above described advantages is the very low incidence of treatment suspension for adverse events found in clinics (Table 17), which is not the case for most of NSAIDs known in the art (Table 18).</p>

    <p num="181">
      In any case all reports of gastric discomfort (4%) were of a minor nature resolved spontaneously during the course of the treatment.
      <br/>
      These minor events may be explained by the possibility that the drug was taken meals or in concomitance with antihistamine (anti-H1) agents, which inhibit the gastroprotective effect of amtolmetin guacyl whilst maintaining its antiinflammatory effect.
      <br/>
      Consequently amtolmetin guacyl, to show its activity, has to be administered on empty stomach and without a concomitant administration of H1 -receptor inhibiting drug.
    </p>
    <p num="182">In summary, due to its antiinflammatory properties and protective effect on the stomach and kidney, the following patient categories are specifically good responders to MED 15 treatment:</p>
    <p num="183">subjects with a need for a long term treatment with a NSAID, subjects with specific gastric and/or renal intolerance to NSAID's, subjects with preexisting gastritis and/or gastric and/or gastroduodenal lesions, subjects with NSAID-related renal impairment due to vasoconstriction, subjects with reduced renal function or in damage thereof.</p>
    <p num="184">Inhibitory effect of MED 15 on platelet aggregation.</p>
    <p num="185">
      At the present state of the art, patients in need of an antiaggregating treatment in order to avoid platelet sticking are normally treated with acetyl salicylic acid or, as an alternative, with a NSAID.
      <br/>
      The administration takes normally place over a long term; in some cases (for instance patients who suffered from an infarct) the administration of the drug has to be prolonged for all the life.
      <br/>
      One of the main problems in the administration of acetyl salycilic acid and, of NSAIDs in general, is That patients have or may develop an intolerance to this kind of drugs, one of the reasons is that this drugs are known to be gastrolesive which fact renders it difficult, if at all possible, a long-term treatment.

      This effect is prolonged, covering a span of 24 hours.

      The above show that MED 15 does possess inhibitory effects on blood platelet aggregation.
    </p>
    <p num="200">
      In view of the above properties and of the additional lack of gastrolesive effects, MED 15 may be used to counteract the platelet aggregation in patients in need of such a treatment and who are intolerant to acetyl salycylic acid and, in general, to NSAIDs, advantageously when such treatment has to be carried out for a long time.
      <br/>
      As clarified in connection with the action mechanism, in order to exert its gastroprotective effects MED 15 has to be administered on empty stomach and without a simultaneous assumption of anti-H1 substances.
    </p>
    <p num="201">It is therefore an object of the present invention a method for counteracting blood platelet aggregation in patients in need thereof and intolerant to acetyl salicylic acid and to NSAIDs, comprising administering on empty stomach and without a simultaneous assumption of anti-H1 -substances an amount of 2-metoxyphenyl-1-metyl-5p-methylbenzoyl-pyrrol-2 acetamido acetate effective to counteract blood platelet aggregation.</p>
    <p num="202">The dosage of administration of MED 15 to show its anti-aggregating property ranges from 300 to 600 mg/day; the drug may be administered alone or together with usual pharmaceutically tolerable vehicles as pharmaceutical compositions.</p>
    <p num="203">Effect of MED 15 on thrombophlebitis.</p>
    <p num="204">MED 15 may be also used in the treatment of thrombophlebitis, in particular in case of thrombophlebitis of women who have just given birth.</p>
    <p num="205">
      In general a thrombophlebitis may be defined as an inflammation of a vein associated with the formation of a thrombus or clot.
      <br/>
      In that case around the clot in a vascular bed there is a peculiar situation, which provokes simultaneously pain and inflammation.
      <br/>
      In order to treat the patient suffering from thrombophlebitis both pain and inflammation have to be treated simultaneously.
      <br/>
      Among the drugs most frequently used are NSAIDs, for their specific capability of treating pain and inflammation, that is to say their anti-inflammatory and antalgic properties(see bibliographic references No.44-46).
      <br/>
      However the simple use of a NSAID, at least of one of the NSAIDs known from the state of art, may not be regarded as sufficient in order to treat completely a thrombophlebitis.
      <br/>
      As a matter of fact and at the same time, there is also the need of a thrombolytic effect, which is normally carried out by administering a streptokinase or urokinaase or a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).
      <br/>
      Moreover, to enhance the possibility of liberating the vessel from the clot it would extremely useful to exert locally a vasodilating effect.
      <br/>
      This vasodilating effect by enlarging the section of the vessel facilitates the liberation of the clot from the vessel.
      <br/>
      Finally, once the vessel is freed from the clot, there is the further need of avoiding the occurrence of similar pathological conditions, which can be realised by using antiaggregating substances in order to avoid platelet sticking into the vessels.
      <br/>
      The substances commonly used to this purpose are aspirin, heparin and low molecular weight heparinoids.
    </p>
    <p num="206">
      In view of what above stated and to sum up, it appears clear that in order to treat a thrombophlebitis five goals have to be reached: treatment of pain and inflammation, vasodilation, thrombolisis of the clot and avoidance of platelet sticking.
      <br/>
      From the state of the art the above can be accomplished by using at least four kinds of drugs: a NSAID (for pain and inflammation), an aspirin or a heparin-like substance (antiaggregation), a urokinase-like substance (thrombolitic effect) and a vasodilating substance.
      <br/>
      Additionally, since the most frequently used drugs for the treatment of pain and inflammation are NSAIDs, which are known to be gastrolesive and to which many patients are intolerant (or easily develop an intolerance after a prolonged treatment), it will be also necessary to administer a gastroprotective drug, such as a protonic pump inhibitor like omprazole or an anti-H2 substance like famotidine.
      <br/>
      Therefore a substance simultaneously showing antalgic and antinflammatory properties as well as platelet antiaggregating and vasodilating effect would be extremely useful.
    </p>
    <p num="207">The platelet anti-aggregating properties of MED 15 have been shown before.</p>
    <p num="208">
      The effect of vasodilation of MED 15 has been shown before with reference to the mechanism of action.
      <br/>
      To sum up it may be stated that the administration of MED15 provokes in the stomach the production of CGRP with subsequent outflow of the peptide into the bloodstream and the possibility of reaching various organs.
      <br/>
      The vasodilating action of CGRP also depends on NO formation, which functions as second messenger of the CGRP-induced vasodilation.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the effect of vasodilation provoked by CGRP, and consequently by NO, takes place in each organ reached.
      <br/>
      This effect of CGRP is evident in human coronary artery dilation (see bibliographic references No.47-51).
      <br/>
      In this respect what has to be stressed is that while the vasodilating effect of CGRP and NO per se may be regarded as known from the literature, it is not known at all the fact that CGRP is produced by the action mechanism of MED 15.
    </p>
    <p num="209">
      A final consideration in using MED 15, as NSAID for its anti-inflammatory and antalgic properties is that MED 15 shows a gastroprotective effect not shown by any other NSAID.
      <br/>
      These facts, which again may be explained by the action mechanism, has the further advantage that; gastroprotective drugs such as a protonic pump inhibitor, like omeprazole or an anti-H2 substance like famotidine, have not to be simultaneously administered.
      <br/>
      The gastroprotective effect of MED 15 gives the possibility of administering it safely and for a long term in puerperium or in pathological conditions when a cronic risk of thrombophlebitis is in act.
      <br/>
      The administration of MED 15 has to take place on an empty stomach and without a simultaneous assumption of anti-H1 substances.
    </p>
    <p num="210">
      Consequently, the use of only one drug, MED15, allows the treatment of the following factors which have to be dealt with in case of a thrombophlebitis, namely pain and inflammation, vasodilation and avoidance of the sticking of platelets.
      <br/>
      In addition, in view of the gastroprotective properties of MED 15, it is possible to avoid the assumption of a further gastroprotective drug.
    </p>
    <p num="211">It is therefore an object of the present invention a method for treating thrombophlebitis, particularly in case of puerperium, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof on an empty stomach and without a simultaneous assumption of anti-H1 substances an amount of 2-methoxyphenyl-1-methyl-5p-methylbenzoyl-pyrrol-2-acetamido acetate effective to treat pain and inflammation, to exert local vasodilation, to avoid platelet sticking and to protect the stomach from NSAID-related gastric damages.</p>
    <p num="212">The dosage of administration of MED 15 ranges from 600 to 1200 mg/day; the drug has to be administered on an empty stomach and without a simultaneous assumption of anti-H1 substances alone or together with usual pharmaceutically tolerable vehicles as pharmaceutical composition.</p>
    <p num="213">Vasodilating properties of MED15.</p>
    <p num="214">
      MED 15 may also be used in the treatment of other patients thanks to its vasodilating properties connected with the liberation in the blood stream of CGRP.
      <br/>
      The main use of MED 15, as for any NSAID, is for the treatment of pain and inflammation; however, the unexpected properties due to its action mechanism, make it possible to administer MED15 with advantageous effects to patients which benefit of a vasodilating effect in addition to the antinflammatory and antalgic properties.
      <br/>
      The treatment with MED15 may be useful for patients, who need a treatment with a NSAID, namely an antinflammatory and an antalgic treatment, and at the same time are infarct patients.
      <br/>
      This may be explained taking into account that it is well known that MED 15 produces CGRP, which in turn is known to produce vasodilation also through release of NO; in case of infarct patients the vasodilation would act on the coronary arteries with a beneficial effect on the patient.
    </p>
    <p num="215">It is therefore a further object of the present invention a method for treating pain and inflammation in an infarct patient comprising administering on an empty stomach and without a simultaneous assumption of anit-H1 substances an amount of 2-methoxyphenyl-1-methyl-5p-methylbenzoyl-pyrrol-2-acetamido acetate effective to treat pain and inflammation and to exert a vasodilatative effect on coronary arteries.</p>
    <p num="216">
      A further class of patients who may be treated with MED15 thanks to its vasodilating properties is the class of patients who suffered or are under the risk of a stroke of the cerebral vessels.
      <br/>
      To clarify the possibility of treatment with MED-15 of this new class of patients a distinction has to be drawn between the two basic kinds of cerebral stroke.
      <br/>
      A cerebral stroke may be generally defined as a discontinuity of a cerebral vessel.
      <br/>
      This discontinuity may have two origins: a thrombotic origin (that is to say the vessel becomes obstructed by a thrombus) and an haemorragic origin (that is to say the vessel breaks).
      <br/>
      The strokes having thrombotic origin are treated with antiaggregating substances, while those having an haemorragic origin are treated with antihaemorragic substances.
      <br/>
      The two treatments are therefore opposite.
      <br/>
      MED 15 may be used in the treatment of patients suffering from a cerebral stroke of thrombotic origin who need an antinflammatory and an antalgic treatment and are intolerant to NSAIDs.
      <br/>
      The vasodilating effect on the cerebral vessels is beneficial the patients.
      <br/>
      The administration has to take place on an empty stomach and without a simultaneous assumption of anti-H1 substances.
    </p>
    <p num="217">It is therefore a further object of the present invention a method for treating pain and inflammation in patient affected by or under the risk of cerebral stroke of thrombotic origin comprising administering on empty stomach and without a simultaneous assumption of anti-H1 substances an amount of 2-methoxyphenyl-1-methyl-5p-methylbenzoyl-pyrrol-2-acetamido acetate effective to treat pain and inflammation and to exert a vasodilating effect on the cerebral vessels.</p>

    </claim>
    <claim num="2">
      <claim-text>2. The method according to claim 1, wherein 2-methoxyphenyl-1-methyl-5 p-methylbenzoyl-pyrrol-2-acetamido acetate is administered in a dosage ranging from 300 to 600 mg/day.</claim-text>
    </claim>
    <claim num="3">
      <claim-text>3. The method according to claim 2, wherein 2-methoxyphenyl-1-methyl-5 p-methylbenzoyl-pyrrol-2-acetamido acetate is administered together with usual pharmaceutically tolerable vehicles.</claim-text>
    </claim>
    <claim num="4">
      <claim-text>4. A method for treating thrombophlebitis, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof on an empty stomach and without a simultaneous administration of antihistamine substances an amount of 2-methoxyphenyl-1-methyl-5 p-methylbenzoyl-pyrrol-2-acetamido acetate effective to exert local vasodilation, to avoid platelet sticking and to protect the stomach from NSAID-related gastric damages.</claim-text>
    </claim>
    <claim num="5">
      <claim-text>5. The method according to claim 4, wherein said patient is suffering from thrombophlebitis derived from puerperium.</claim-text>
