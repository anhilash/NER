    <p num="1">The present invention relates to light protection formulations, in particular to cosmetic and dermatological light protection compositions.</p>
    <p num="2">
      The damaging effect of the ultraviolet part of solar radiation on the skin is generally known.
      <br/>
      While rays having a wavelength of below 290 nm (the UVC region) are absorbed by the ozone layer in the Earth's atmosphere, rays in the region between 290 nm and 320 nm, the UVB region, cause erythema, simple sunburn or even burns of varying severity.
    </p>
    <p num="3">The maximum erythema activity of sunlight is in the narrower region around 308 nm.</p>
    <p num="4">Numerous compounds for protecting against UVB radiation are known; these are usually derivatives of 3-benzylidenecamphor, 4-aminobenzoic acid, cinnamic acid, salicylic acid, benzophenone and also 2-phenylbenzimidazole.</p>
    <p num="5">
      It is also important to have available filter substances, for the region between about 320 nm and about 400 nm, the UVA region, since the rays of that region can also cause damage.
      <br/>
      For example, it has been found that UVA radiation leads to damage of the elastic and collagenic fibres of connective tissue, causing premature ageing of the skin, and it is regarded as a cause of numerous phototoxic and photoallergic reactions.
      <br/>
      The damaging effect of UVB radiation can be intensified by UVA radiation.
    </p>
    <p num="6">For protecting against the rays of the UVA region, use is therefore made of certain derivatives of dibenzoylmethane, whose photostability (Int. J. Cosm. Science 10, 53 (1988)) is inadequate.</p>
    <p num="7">
      However, UV radiation can also lead to photochemical reactions, in which case the photochemical reaction products intervene in the skin's metabolism.
      <br/>
      Such photochemical reaction products are predominantly free-radical compounds, for example hydroxyl free radicals.
      <br/>
      Undefined free-radical photoproducts which are formed in the skin itself can also display uncontrolled secondary reactions because of their high reactivity.
      <br/>
      However, singlet oxygen, a non-radical excited state of the oxygen molecule, can also be formed during UV irradiation, as can short-lived epoxides and many others.
      <br/>
      Singlet oxygen, for example, differs from normal triplet oxygen (free-radical ground state) by its increased reactivity.
      <br/>
      However, excited, reactive (free-radical) triplet states of the oxygen molecule also exist.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In order to prevent these reactions, it is possible additionally to incorporate antioxidants and/or free-radical scavengers into the cosmetic or dermatological formulations.</p>
    <p num="9">Known and advantageous light protection substances are dibenzoylmethane derivatives, for example 5-isopropyidibenzoylmethane (CAS No. 63250-25-9), which is characterized by the structure  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="10">and is marketed by Merck under the name Eusolex.RTM. 8020, and also 4-(tert-butyl)-4'-methoxydibenzoylmethane (CAS No. 70356-09-1), which is characterized by the structure  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="11">
      and marketed by Givaudan under the name Parsol.RTM. 1789. However, in combination with other substances present as solids, their use concentration is limited.
      <br/>
      There are therefore certain formulation difficulties in achieving higher light protection factors.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Another advantageous light protection filter substance is 4-methylbenzylidenecamphor, which is characterized by the structure  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="13">
      and is marketed by Merck under the name Eusolex.RTM. 6300. 4-Methylbenzylidenecamphor is an extremely advantageous light protection filter substance, which is a solid under normal conditions and is notable per se for good UV filter properties.
      <br/>
      In combination with other solid substances, however, its use concentration too is limited.
      <br/>
      There are thus certain formulation difficulties in achieving higher light protection factors here as well.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Other benzylidenecamphor derivatives are also advantageous light protection filter substances, e.g. benzylidenecamphor, which is characterized by the structure  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="15">
      and is marketed by Induchem under the name Unisol.RTM. S22. In combination with other substances in the form of solids, however, its use concentration too is limited.
      <br/>
      There are thus certain formulation difficulties in achieving higher light protection factors here as well.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Another advantageous UV filter is tris(2-ethylhexyl) 4,4', 4"-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyltriimino)trisbenzoate, synonym: 2,4,6-tris�anilino(p-carbo-2'-ethyl-1'-hexyloxy)�-1,3,5-triazine.  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="17">
      This UVB filter substance is marketed by BASF Aktiengesellschaft under the trade name UVINUL.RTM. T 150 and is notable for good UV absorption properties.
      <br/>
      In the meantime, various authors have described other UV filter substances which have the structure  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The main disadvantage of tris(2-ethylhexyl) 4,4', 4"-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyltriimino)trisbenzoate is its poor solubility in lipids.
      <br/>
      Known solvents for this UVB filter can dissolve a maximum of about 15% by weight of this filter, corresponding to about 1-1.5% by weight of dissolved, and thus active, UV filter substance.
      <br/>
      There are thus certain formulation difficulties in achieving high light protection factors here as well.

      Even if it is in principle possible to achieve a certain UV protection for a given limited solubility (and thus, according to traditional standards, poor incorporability into a cosmetic or dermatological preparation), another problem may arise, that of recrystallization.
      <br/>
      In the case of sparingly soluble substances, this happens comparatively quickly, be it as a result of fluctuations in temperature or other influences.
      <br/>
      Uncontrolled recrystallization of an essential constituent of the preparation, such as a UV filter, does, however, have extremely disadvantageous effects on the properties of the given preparation and, not least, on the desired light protection.

    <p num="38">
      In the case of this substance too, there are, however, certain formulation disadvantages when large amounts are used since this substance is sparingly soluble.
      <br/>
      Using this substance, it is therefore difficult to achieve high light protection factors.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The compounds which are used as light protection agents for cosmetic and dermatological light protection formulations, some of which are given above, are notable per se, as already stated, for good light protection effects.
      <br/>
      However, they have the disadvantage that it is at times difficult to incorporate them into such formulations in a satisfactory manner.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Generally speaking, the light absorption behaviour of light protection filter substances is very well known and documented, not least because most industrialized countries have a positive list for the use of such substances, which imposes relatively strict standards on the documentation.
      <br/>
      For the concentration of the substances in the finished formulations, the absorbance values can at best be a guide, since interactions with substances within the skin or within the surface of the skin itself may result in imponderabilities.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is usually difficult to estimate in advance how uniformly and in what layer thickness the filter substance is distributed in and on the horny layer of the skin.
    </p>
    <p num="41">The light protection factor (LPF, often also known as SPF for sun protection factor) indicates how much longer the skin protected with the light protection agent can be exposed until the same erythemal reaction takes place as would occur in the case of unprotected skin (i.e. ten times longer compared with unprotected skin for LPF=10).</p>
    <p num="42">In any case, the consumer expects, on the one hand, reliable information from the manufacturer regarding the light protection factor--not least because of the discussion about the "hole in the ozone layer" which has become a topic of public interest, and on the other hand there is a tendency by the consumer towards higher and high light protection factors.</p>
    <p num="43">Since light protection filter substances are usually costly, and since most light protection filter substances are also difficult to incorporate into cosmetic or dermatological preparations in relatively high concentrations, the object of the invention was to obtain, in a simple and low-cost manner, preparations which, in unusually low concentrations of conventional light protection filter substances, nevertheless achieve acceptable or even high LPF values.</p>
    <p num="44">It was therefore surprising and could not have been foreseen by the person skilled in the art that the use of polysaccharides for improving the light protection effect, in particular for increasing the light protection factor, of cosmetic or dermatological preparations which comprise at least one customary UV filter substance, would remedy the disadvantages of the prior art.</p>
    <p num="45">
      It is advantageous to use polysaccharides which are soluble in water and/or swellable in water and/or gellable with the help of water.
      <br/>
      It is particularly advantageous to use hyaluronic acid, chitosan and also other polysaccharides which are soluble in water and/or swellable in water and/or gellable with the help of water, for example a fucose-rich product, a polysaccharide listed in the Chemical Abstracts under the registry number 178463-23-5, which is obtainable under the name Fucogel.RTM. 1000 from SOLABIA S.A. The latter is characterized by structural elements as follows:  (Chemical Structure image '22' not included in text)

    <p num="48">Chitosan is characterized by the following structural formula:  (Chemical Structure image '24' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="49">
      where n is a value up to about 2,000, and X is either the acetyl radical or hydrogen.
      <br/>
      Chitosan is formed by deacetylation and partial depolymerization (hydrolysis) of chitin, which is characterized by the structural formula  (Chemical Structure image '25' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="50">Chitin is an essential constituent of the exoskeleton �'o citwn=Greek for integument� of arthropods (e.g. insects, crabs, spiders) and is also found in supporting tissue of other organisms (e.g. molluscs, algae, fungi).</p>
    <p num="51">
      Chitosan is a raw material known in hair care.
      <br/>
      It is suitable, to a higher degree than the chitin on which it is based, as a thickener or stabilizer and improves the adhesion and water resistance of polymeric films.

      A representative of a large number of literature references for the prior art is: H. P. Fiedler, "Lexikon der Hilfsstoffe fur Pharmazie, Kosmetik und angrenzende Gebiete" �Lexicon of auxiliaries for pharmacy, cosmetics and related fields�, third edition 1989, Editio Cantor, Aulendorf, p. 293, key word "chitosan".

    <p num="52">
      According to the invention, preference is given to chitosans having a degree of deacetylation of &gt;60%, in particular &gt;80%.
      <br/>
      Of these, particular preference is given to those whose 1% strength aqueous solution has a viscosity of 4,500-5,500 mPas (Brookfield, spindle 5, 10 rpm), in particular 5,000 mPas.

    <p num="53">If chitosan is the or one of the polysaccharides used, it is advantageous to choose one with molecular weights between 3,000 and 2,000,000, in particular one with molecular weights between 10,000 and 500,000.</p>

      Cosmetic and dermatological preparations according to the invention advantageously comprise, although it is not obligatory, inorganic pigments, which may be X-ray amorphous and/or not, based on metal oxides and/or other metal compounds which are insoluble or sparingly soluble in water, in particular the oxides of titanium (TiO2), zinc (ZnO), iron (for example Fe2 O3), zirconium (ZrO2), silicon (SiO2), manganese (for example MnO), aluminium (Al2 O3) or cerium (for example Ce2 O3), mixed oxides of the corresponding metals and mixtures of such oxides.

      According to the invention, it is advantageous if the inorganic pigments are present in hydrophobic form, i.e. if they have been surface-treated to repel water.
