      A superscalar microprocessor employing a data cache configured to perform store accesses in a single clock cycle is provided.
      <br/>
      The superscalar microprocessor speculatively stores data within a predicted way of the data cache after capturing the data currently being stored in that predicted way.
      <br/>
      During a subsequent clock cycle, the cache hit information for the store access validates the way prediction.
      <br/>
      If the way prediction is correct, then the store is complete, utilizing a single clock cycle of data cache bandwidth.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the way prediction structure implemented within the data cache bypasses the tag comparisons of the data cache to select data bytes for the output.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the access time of the associative data cache may be substantially similar to a direct-mapped cache access time.
      <br/>
      The superscalar microprocessor may therefore be capable of high frequency operation.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention is related to the field of superscalar microprocessors and, more particularly, to data caches capable of performing store accesses in a single clock cycle within high frequency superscalar microprocessors.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Relevant Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Superscalar microprocessors achieve high performance by simultaneously executing multiple instructions in a clock cycle and by specifying the shortest possible clock cycle consistent with the design.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term "clock cycle" refers to an interval of time during which the pipeline stages of a microprocessor preform their intended functions.
      <br/>
      At the end of a clock cycle, the resulting values are moved to the next pipeline stage.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Since superscalar microprocessors execute multiple instructions per clock cycle and the clock cycle is short, a high bandwidth memory system is required to provide instructions and data to the superscalar microprocessor (i.e. a memory system that can provide a large number of bytes in a short period of time).
      <br/>
      Without a high bandwidth memory system, the microprocessor would spend a large number of clock cycles waiting for instructions or data to be provided, then would execute the received instructions and/or the instructions dependent upon the received data in a relatively small number of clock cycles.
      <br/>
      Overall performance would be degraded by the large number of idle clock cycles.
      <br/>
      However, superscalar microprocessors are ordinarily configured into computer systems with a large main memory composed of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) cells.
      <br/>
      DRAM cells are characterized by access times which are significantly longer than the clock cycle of modern superscalar microprocessors.
      <br/>
      Also, DRAM cells typically provide a relatively narrow output bus to convey the stored bytes to the superscalar microprocessor.
      <br/>
      Therefore, DRAM cells provide a memory system that provides a relatively small number of bytes in a relatively long period of time, and do not form a high bandwidth memory system.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Because superscalar microprocessors are typically not configured into a computer system with a memory system having sufficient bandwidth to continuously provide instructions and data, superscalar microprocessors are often configured with caches.
      <br/>
      Caches are storage devices containing multiple blocks of storage locations, configured on the same silicon substrate as the microprocessor or coupled nearby.
      <br/>
      The blocks of storage locations are used to hold previously fetched instruction or data bytes.
      <br/>
      The bytes can be transferred from the cache to the destination (a register or an instruction processing pipeline) quickly; commonly one or two clock cycles are required as opposed to a large number of clock cycles to transfer bytes from a DRAM main memory.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Caches may be organized into an "associative" structure (also referred to as "set associative").
      <br/>
      In an associative structure, the blocks of storage locations are accessed as a two-dimensional array having rows and columns.
      <br/>
      When a cache is searched for bytes residing at an address, a number of bits from the address are used as an "index" into the cache.
      <br/>
      The index selects a particular row within the two-dimensional array, and therefore the number of address bits required for the index is determined by the number of rows configured into the cache.
      <br/>
      The act of selecting a row via an index is referred to as "indexing".
      <br/>
      The addresses associated with bytes stored in the multiple blocks of a row are examined to determine if any of the addresses stored in the row match the requested address.
      <br/>
      If a match is found, the access is said to be a "hit", and the cache provides the associated bytes.
      <br/>
      If a match is not found, the access is said to be a "miss".
      <br/>
      When a miss is detected, the bytes are transferred from the memory system into the cache.
      <br/>
      The addresses associated with bytes stored in the cache are also stored.
      <br/>
      These stored addresses are referred to as "tags" or "tag addresses".
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The blocks of memory configured into a row form the columns of the row.
      <br/>
      Each block of memory is referred to as a "way"; multiple ways comprise a row.
      <br/>
      The way is selected by providing a way value to the cache.
      <br/>
      The way value is determined by examining the tags for a row and finding a match between one of the tags and the requested address.
      <br/>
      A cache designed with one way per row is referred to as a "direct-mapped" cache.
      <br/>
      In a direct-mapped cache, the tag must be examined to determine if an access is a hit, but the tag examination is not required to select which bytes are transferred to the outputs of the cache.
      <br/>
      Since only an index is required to select bytes from a direct-mapped cache, the direct-mapped cache is a "linear array" requiring only a single value to select a storage location within it.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Both direct-mapped and associative caches are employed in high frequency (i.e. short clock cycle) superscalar microprocessors.
      <br/>
      In high frequency applications, set associative caches either become a clock cycle limiter or require multiple clock cycles to complete a cache access because the comparison of tags to the request address and the subsequent selection of data bytes to convey to the output requires more time than the desired clock cycle time allows.
      <br/>
      The term cache bandwidth is used to describe the number of cache requests which may be made per clock cycle.
      <br/>
      Cache bandwidth decrease due to multiple clock cycle accesses is particularly detrimental to superscalar microprocessors attempting to execute multiple instructions (which may require cache access) per clock cycle.
      <br/>
      Longer clock cycles are also detrimental to the performance of a microprocessor, since fewer instructions may be executed per second.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Direct-mapped caches, which compare the selected tag to the request address in parallel with conveying data bytes to the output, operate in less time than the associative cache.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, direct-mapped caches are associated with lower hit rates (i.e. the percentage of accesses that are hits) than associative caches with a similar storage capacity.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, direct-mapped caches are more susceptible to "thrashing".
      <br/>
      Thrashing is a phenomenon that occurs when the pattern of address requests presented to the cache contains several dissimilar addresses with the same index.
      <br/>
      Dissimilar addresses are addresses that are stored in the cache with different tags.
      <br/>
      As an illustrative example, addresses A and B may access the cache alternately and repeatedly.
      <br/>
      Address A and address B have the same index, and access a direct-mapped cache.
      <br/>
      First, address A accesses the cache and misses.
      <br/>
      The indexed cache storage location is filled with bytes associated with address A. Next, address B accesses the cache and misses.
      <br/>
      The indexed cache storage location discards the bytes associated with address A and is filled with bytes associated with address B. Address A accesses the cache again, and misses.
      <br/>
      The cache storage location discards the bytes associated with address B and is filled with bytes associated with address A. An associative cache would be able to store bytes associated with both address A and address B simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      An additional problem associated with both direct-mapped and associative data caches in high frequency applications is the execution of store instructions.
      <br/>
      A store instruction causes bytes to be stored at a memory location.
      <br/>
      Unlike load instructions, in which data might be speculatively forwarded to the target (a register, for example) and validated as the correct data in a later clock cycle, store instructions typically cannot speculatively store their operand data into the cache and validate that the access was a cache hit in a later clock cycle.
      <br/>
      If the speculation is incorrect, data within the cache will have been destroyed.
      <br/>
      Instead, when a store access to a cache is made, the cache is searched to determine if data associated with the store address is contained within the cache.
      <br/>
      If the store address is a hit, then the data bytes may be stored into the cache in the storage location currently associated with the store address.
      <br/>
      If the store address is a miss, data bytes associated with the store address must first be transferred into the cache from main memory.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, searching for a hit first and then storing the data bytes has often required two clock cycles of cache access for each store instruction executed in high frequency microprocessors.
      <br/>
      During the first clock cycle of a store access, the address of the store instruction is determined to hit or miss in the cache.
      <br/>
      During the second clock cycle, the data associated with the store instruction is stored into the cache.
      <br/>
      It would be advantageous to perform store accesses to the cache in one clock cycle.
      <br/>
      Additionally, such a storage device having the access time of a direct-mapped cache with the hit rate and insensitivity to thrashing of an associative cache is desired.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      The problems outlined above are in large part solved by a superscalar microprocessor employing a data cache according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The present superscalar microprocessor speculatively stores data within a predicted way of the data cache after capturing the data currently being stored in that predicted way.
      <br/>
      During a subsequent clock cycle, the cache hit information for the store access validates the way prediction.
      <br/>
      If the way prediction is correct, then the store is complete.
      <br/>
      If the way prediction is incorrect, then the captured data is restored to the predicted way.
      <br/>
      If the store access hits in an unpredicted way, the store data is transferred into the correct storage location within the data cache concurrently with the restoration of data in the predicted storage location.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Each store for which the way prediction is correct utilizes a single clock cycle of data cache bandwidth.
      <br/>
      Therefore, available data cache bandwidth is increased over conventional data caches which typically require two clock cycles to perform stores.
      <br/>
      The present superscalar microprocessor may therefore achieve higher performance due to the increased available data cache bandwidth.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Since way mispredicted stores which hit in the data cache are completed in two clock cycles, way mispredicted stores utilize the same amount of cache bandwidth as stores in conventional caches.
      <br/>
      No penalty exists with respect to conventional caches for employing way prediction for stores.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Additionally, the way prediction structure implemented within the data cache advantageously bypasses the tag comparisons of the data cache to select data bytes for the output for embodiments of the superscalar microprocessor which employ an associative data cache.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the access time of the associative data cache may be substantially similar to a direct-mapped cache access time (i.e. the access time of the way prediction array within the way prediction structure).
      <br/>
      The superscalar microprocessor may therefore be capable of high frequency operation.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Broadly speaking, the present invention contemplates a superscalar microprocessor comprising a data cache.
      <br/>
      The data cache includes a data array, a data cache control unit, a data storage device, and a data selection device.
      <br/>
      The data array includes a plurality of storage locations configured to store data bytes, and is configured to receive at least one input address and associated input data.. The data array is configured to convey output data.
      <br/>
      Coupled to the data array is the data cache control unit which is configured to cause the data array to store the associated input data into one of the plurality of storage locations if the input address is associated with a store instruction.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">
      Referring next to FIG. 1, a block diagram of a superscalar microprocessor 200 including a data cache 224 in accordance with the present invention is shown.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in the embodiment of FIG. 1, superscalar microprocessor 200 includes a prefetch/predecode unit 202 and a branch prediction unit 220 coupled to an instruction cache 204.
      <br/>
      Instruction alignment unit 206 is coupled between instruction cache 204 and a plurality of decode units 208A-208D (referred to collectively as decode units 208).
      <br/>
      Each decode unit 208A-208D is coupled to respective reservation station units 210A-210D (referred to collectively as reservation stations 210), and each reservation station 210A-210D is coupled to a respective functional unit 212A-212D (referred to collectively as functional units 212).
      <br/>
      Decode units 208, reservation stations 210, and functional units 212 are further coupled to a reorder buffer 216, a register file 218 and a load/store unit 222.
      <br/>
      A data cache 224 is finally shown coupled to load/store unit 222, and an MROM unit 209 is shown coupled to instruction alignment unit 206.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Generally speaking, instruction cache 204 is a hich speed cache memory provided to temporarily store instructions prior to their dispatch to decode units 2C8.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, instruction cache 204 is configured to cache up to 32 kilobytes of instruction code organized in lines of 16 bytes each (where each byte consists of 8 bits) During operation, instruction code is provided to instruction cache 204 by prefetching code from a main memory (not shown) through prefetch/predecode unit 202.
      <br/>
      It is noted that instruction cache 204 could be implemented in a set-associative, a fully-associative, or a direct-mapped configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Prefetch/predecode unit 202 is provided to prefetch instruction code from the main memory for storage within instruction cache 204.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, prefetch/predecode unit 202 is configured to burst 64-bit wide code from the main memory into instruction cache 204.
      <br/>
      It is understood that a variety of specific code prefetching techniques and algorithms may be employed by prefetch/predecode unit 202.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As prefetch/predecode unit 202 fetches instructions from the main memory, it generates three predecode bits associated with each byte of instruction code: a start bit, an end bit, and a "functional" bit.
      <br/>
      The predecode bits form tags indicative of the boundaries of each instruction.
      <br/>
      The predecode tags may also convey additional information such as whether a given instruction can be decoded directly by decode units 208 or whether the instruction must be executed by invoking a microcode procedure controlled by MROM unit 209, as will be described in greater detail below.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Table 1 indicates one encoding of the predecode tags.
      <br/>
      As indicated within the table, if a given byte is the first byte of an instruction, the start bit for that byte is set.
      <br/>
      If the byte is the last byte of an instruction, the end bit for that byte is set.
      <br/>
      If a particular instruction cannot be directly decoded by the decode units 208, the functional bit associated with the first byte of the instruction is set.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the instruction can be directly decoded by the decode units 208, the functional bit associated with the first byte of the instruction is cleared.
      <br/>
      The functional bit for the second byte of a particular instruction is cleared if the opcode is the first byte, and is set if the opcode is the second byte.
      <br/>
      It is noted that in situations where the opcode is the second byte, the first byte is a prefix byte.
      <br/>
      The functional bit values for instruction byte numbers 3-8 indicate whether the byte is a MODRM or an SIB byte, or whether the byte contains displacement or immediate data.

      As stated previously, in one embodiment certain instructions within the x86 instruction set may be directly decoded by decode unit 208.
      <br/>
      These instructions are referred to as "fast path" instructions.
      <br/>
      The remaining instructions of the x86 instruction set are referred to as "MROM instructions".
      <br/>
      MROM instructions are executed by invoking MROM unit 209.
      <br/>
      More specifically, when an MROM instruction is encountered, MROM unit 209 parses and serializes the instruction into a subset of defined fast path instructions to effectuate a desired operation.
      <br/>
      A listing of exemplary x86 instructions categorized as fast path instructions as well as a description of the manner of handling both fast path and MROM instructions will be provided further below.

    <p num="26">
      Instruction alignment unit 206 is provided to channel variable byte length instructions from instruction cache 204 to fixed issue positions formed by decode units 208A-208D.
      <br/>
      Instruction alignment unit 206 independently and in parallel selects instructions from three groups of instruction bytes provided by instruction cache 204 and arranges these bytes into three groups of preliminary issue positions.
      <br/>
      Each group of issue positions is associated with one of the three groups of instruction bytes.
      <br/>
      The preliminary issue positions are then merged together to form the final issue positions, each of which is coupled to one of decode units 208.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Before proceeding with a detailed description of the data cache 224, general aspects regarding other subsystems employed within the exemplary superscalar microprocessor 200 of FIG. 1 will be described.
      <br/>
      For the embodiment of FIG. 1, each of the decode units 208 includes decoding circuitry for decoding the predetermined fast path instructions referred to above.
      <br/>
      In addition, each decode unit 208A-208D routes displacement and immediate data to a corresponding reservation station unit 210A-210D.
      <br/>
      Output signals from the decode units 208 include bit-encoded execution instructions for the functional units 212 as well as operand address information, immediate data and/or displacement data.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The superscalar microprocessor of FIG. 1 supports out of order execution, and thus employs reorder buffer 216 to keep track of the original program sequence for register read and write operations, to implement register renaming, to allow for speculative instruction execution and branch misprediction recovery, and to facilitate precise exceptions.
      <br/>
      As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, a temporary storage location within reorder buffer 216 is reserved upon decode of an instruction that involves the update of a register to thereby store speculative register states.
      <br/>
      Reorder buffer 216 may be implemented in a first-in-first-out configuration wherein speculative results move to the "bottom" of the buffer as they are validated and written to the register file, thus making room for new entries at the "top" of the buffer.
      <br/>
      Other specific configurations of reorder buffer 216 are also possible, as will be described further below.
      <br/>
      If a branch prediction is incorrect, the results of speculatively-executed instructions along the mispredicted path can be invalidated in the buffer before they are written to register file 218.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The bit-encoded execution instructions and immediate data provided at the outputs of decode units 208A-208D are routed directly to respective reservation station units 210A-210D.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, each reservation station unit 210A-210D is capable of holding instruction information (i.e., bit encoded execution bits as well as operand values, operand tags and/or immediate data) for up to three pending instructions awaiting issue to the corresponding functional unit.
      <br/>
      It is noted that for the embodiment of FIG. 1, each decode unit 208A-208D is associated with a dedicated reservation station unit 210A-210D, and that each reservation station unit 210A-210D is similarly associated with a dedicated functional unit 212A-212D.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, four dedicated "issue positions" are formed by decode-units 208, reservation station units 210 and functional units 212.
      <br/>
      Instructions aligned and dispatched to issue position 0 through decode unit 208A are passed to reservation station unit 210A and subsequently to functional unit 212A for execution.
      <br/>
      Similarly, instructions aligned and dispatched to decode unit 208B are passed to reservation station unit 210B and into functional unit 212B, and so on.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Upon decode of a particular instruction, if a required operand is a register location, register address information is routed to reorder buffer 216 and register file 218 simultaneously.
      <br/>
      Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the x86 register file includes eight 32 bit real registers (i.e., typically referred to as EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, EBP, ESI, EDI and ESP).
      <br/>
      Reorder buffer 216 contains temporary storage locations for results which change the contents of these registers to thereby allow out of order execution.
      <br/>
      A temporary storage location of reorder buffer 216 is reserved for each instruction which, upon decode, is determined to modify the contents of one of the real registers.
      <br/>
      Therefore, at various points during execution of a particular program, reorder buffer 216 may have one or more locations which contain the speculatively executed contents of a given register.
      <br/>
      If following decode of a given instruction it is determined that reorder buffer 216 has a previous location or locations assigned to a register used as an operand in the given instruction, the reorder buffer 216 forwards to the corresponding reservation station either: 1) the value in the most recently assigned location, or 2) a tag for the most recently assigned location if the value has not yet been produced by the functional unit that will eventually execute the previous instruction.
      <br/>
      If the reorder buffer has a location reserved for a given register, the operand value (or tag) is provided from reorder buffer 216 rather than from register file 218.
      <br/>
      If there is no location reserved for a required register in reorder buffer 216, the value is taken directly from register file 218.
      <br/>
      If the operand corresponds to a memory location, the operand value is provided to the reservation station unit through load/store unit 222.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Details regarding suitable reorder buffer implementations may be found within the publication "Superscalar Microprocessor Design" by Mike Johnson, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1991, and within the co-pending, commonly assigned patent application entitled "High Performance Superscalar Microprocessor", Ser.

      No. 08/146,382, filed Oct. 29, 1993 by Witt, et al.

      These documents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Reservation station units 210A-210D are provided to temporarily store instruction information to be speculatively executed by the corresponding functional units 212A-212D.
      <br/>
      As stated previously, each reservation station unit 210A-210D may store instruction information for up to three pending instructions.
      <br/>
      Each of the four reservation stations 210A-210D contain locations to store bit-encoded execution instructions to be speculatively executed by the corresponding functional unit and the values of operands.
      <br/>
      If a particular operand is not available, a tag for that operand is provided from reorder buffer 216 and is stored within the corresponding reservation station until the result has been generated (i.e., by completion of the execution of a previous instruction).
      <br/>
      It is noted that when an instruction is executed by one of the functional units 212A-212D, the result of that instruction is passed directly to any reservation station units 210A-210D that are waiting for that result at the same time the result is passed to update reorder buffer 216 (this technique is commonly referred to as "result forwarding").
      <br/>
      Instructions are issued to functional units for execution after the values of any required operand(s) are made available.
      <br/>
      That is, if an operand associated with a pending instruction within one of the reservation station units 210A-210D has been tagged with a location of a previous result value within reorder buffer 216 which corresponds to an instruction which modifies the required operand, the instruction is not issued to the corresponding functional unit 212 until the operand result for the previous instruction has been obtained.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the order in which instructions are executed may not be the same as the order of the original program instruction sequence.
      <br/>
      Reorder buffer 216 ensures that data coherency is maintained in situations where read-after-write dependencies occur.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In one embodiment, each of the functional units 212 is configured to perform integer arithmetic operations of addition and subtraction, as well as shifts, rotates, logical operations, and branch operations.
      <br/>
      It is noted that a floating point unit (not shown) may also be employed to accommodate floating point operations.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Each of the functional units 212 also provides information regarding the execution of conditional branch instructions to the branch prediction unit 220.
      <br/>
      If a-branch prediction was incorrect, branch prediction unit 220 flushes instructions subsequent to the mispredicted branch that have entered the instruction processing pipeline, and causes prefetch/predecode unit 202 to fetch the required instructions from instruction cache 204 or main memory.
      <br/>
      It is noted that in such situations, results of instructions in the original program sequence which occur after the mispredicted branch instruction are discarded, including those which were speculatively executed and temporarily stored in load/store unit 222 and reorder buffer 216.
      <br/>
      Exemplary configurations of suitable branch prediction mechanisms are well known.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Results produced by functional units 212 are sent to the reorder buffer 216 if a register value is being updated, and to the load/store unit 222 if the contents of a memory location is changed.
      <br/>
      If the result is to be stored in a register, the reorder buffer 216 stores the result in the location reserved for the value of the register when the If instruction was decoded.
      <br/>
      As stated previously, results are also broadcast to reservation station units 210A-210D where pending instructions may be waiting for the results of previous instruction executions to obtain the required operand values.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Generally speaking, load/store unit 222 provides an interface between functional units 212A-212D and data cache 224.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, load/store unit 222 is configured with a load/store buffer with eight storage locations for data and address information for pending loads or stores.
      <br/>
      Decode units 208 arbitrate for access to the load/store unit 222.
      <br/>
      When the buffer is full, a decode unit must wait until the load/store unit 222 has room for the pending load or store request information.
      <br/>
      The load/store unit 222 also performs dependency checking for load instructions against pending store instructions to ensure that data coherency is maintained.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Data cache 224 is a high speed cache memory provided to temporarily store data being transferred between load/store unit 222 and the main memory subsystem.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, data cache 224 has a capacity of storing up to sixteen kilobytes of data.
      <br/>
      It is understood that data cache 224 may be implemented in a variety of specific memory configurations, including a set associative configuration and a direct-mapped configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Turning now to FIG. 2, a block diagram of an embodiment of data cache 224 according to the present invention is shown.
      <br/>
      Generally speaking, data cache 224 is configured to perform store accesses in one clock cycle in a high frequency superscalar microprocessor such as microprocessor 200.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a way prediction structure is accessed in parallel with the cache arrays.
      <br/>
      The way prediction structure predicts which way within the indexed row of data cache 224 is storing data bytes associated with the store address.
      <br/>
      Data cache 224 transfers the data stored in the predicted way to an output port and then speculatively stores the data associated with the store instruction into the predicted way.
      <br/>
      The data transferred from the predicted way is stored in a data register.
      <br/>
      During a subsequent clock cycle, cache hit information regarding the store access is determined.
      <br/>
      If the way prediction is correct and the store access is a cache hit, then the store access is successfully performed in a single clock cycle.
      <br/>
      If the way prediction is incorrect but the store address hits in another way, a second clock cycle is used to restore the previous data to the speculatively stored way and to store the data into the correct way.
      <br/>
      If the store address misses data cache 224, then the previous data is restored to the predicted way and the store address is serviced as a cache miss.
      <br/>
      As used herein with respect to data cache store accesses, the term "speculative" refers to storing data associated with the store access into a storage location within data cache 224 without first ensuring that the storage location is storing data associated with the store address.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      For simplicity, FIG. 2 shows only those elements of data cache 224 which are used in conjunction with performing store accesses in one clock cycle.
      <br/>
      Other portions of data cache 224 (not shown) are used to perform other functions, such as cache refills in response to cache misses.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, data cache 224 is an N-way associative cache, and so is configured with an N-way associative tag array 250 and an N-way associative data array 251.
      <br/>
      Coupled to input ports of tag array 250 and data array 251 is an address request bus 252 and an input data bus 253 from load/store unit 222.
      <br/>
      Address request bus 252 is configured to convey the addresses of requests along with request identification information from load/store unit 222.
      <br/>
      A request may be a load access or a store access.
      <br/>
      Request identification information includes an indication as to the load or store nature of the request.
      <br/>
      Input data bus 253 is configured to convey data associated with each store access request conveyed on address request bus 252.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, load/store unit 222 may convey up to two requests per clock cycle on address request bus 252 and input data bus 253.
      <br/>
      Both data array 251 and tag array 250 are configured with output ports associated with each request and each way of data cache 224.

      Address request bus 252 is additionally coupled to way prediction array 255, which is configured with an input port and an output port for each request which may be conveyed on address request bus 252.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, way prediction array 255 is a linear array of 512 way predictions.
      <br/>
      Way predictions may be a decoded value in which a particular bit within the value being set is indicative of a particular way of data cache 224.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, way predictions are an encoded value between 0 and N-1 wherein each value is indicative of a particular way of data cache 224.
      <br/>
      Way prediction array 255 conveys a way prediction for each request on a way prediction bus 256, which is coupled to an N to one way selection device 257 and to data array 251.
      <br/>
      The way prediction for each request is used by N to one way selection device 257 to select one of the associated N-ways conveyed on a set of way data buses 258A-258N.
      <br/>
      Each way data bus 258 transfers data bytes from an indexed way of data cache 224 for each request on address request bus 252.
      <br/>
      The selected data bytes are conveyed on a data bus 269 to load/store unit 222 and reservation stations 210.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the selected data bytes are stored in a data register 259.
      <br/>
      Data register 259 stores the data bytes until the following clock cycle, during which the data bytes are conveyed to a multiplexor 260.
      <br/>
      Data register 259 and multiplexor 260 are used for the restoration of data to a storage location within data cache 224 when data is speculatively stored incorrectly to the storage location (as will be described below).
      <br/>
      The output of multiplexor 260 is coupled to the data input ports of data array 251.

      A set of way tag buses 261A-261N deliver the tags produced on the output ports of tag array 250 to a tag comparison block 262.

      Tag comparison block 262 is additionally coupled to address request bus 252 and way prediction bus 256.
      <br/>
      Tag comparison block 262 is configured to determine if a request address hits in data cache 224, as well as whether or not the hit occurs in the predicted way.
      <br/>
      If a request hits in the predicted way of data cache 224, an associated signal is asserted on hit predicted way bus 263.
      <br/>
      Hit predicted way bus 263 is coupled to load/store unit 222 and reservation stations 210.
      <br/>
      If a request hits data cache 224, but in a way other than the predicted way, an associated signal is asserted on a hit unpredicted way bus 264.
      <br/>
      Hit unpredicted way bus 264 is coupled to load/store unit 222 and reservation stations 210, and is additionally coupled to a way prediction control unit 268.
      <br/>
      If a request is a miss, then the associated signals on hit predicted way bus 263 and hit unpredicted way bus 264 are not asserted.
      <br/>
      Tag comparison block 262 additionally provides the way of data cache 224 in which each request hits on a hit way bus 267 coupled to a way prediction control unit 268 and to data array 251.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Way prediction control unit 268 is configured to update way prediction array 255, and is a part of the way prediction structure of data cache 224.
      <br/>
      When a hit in an unpredicted way is detected by tag comparison block 262, the associated hit way from hit way bus 267 is stored into the storage location within way prediction array 255 which is indexed by the associated request address.
      <br/>
      Way prediction control unit 268 is coupled to a set of data input ports in order to provide the update way or ways, and controls the writing of update ways into way prediction array 255.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      As mentioned above, data cache 224 speculatively stores data associated with a store access into the predicted way.
      <br/>
      When a store access is conveyed on address request bus 252 (and the associated data on input data bus 253), a cache control unit 254 causes multiplexor 260 to select the data bytes on input data bus 253 to be conveyed on an input port to data array 251.
      <br/>
      The address of the access is used to index into data array 251 and tag array 250, causing the associated data and tags to be transferred on way data buses 258 and way tag buses 259, respectively.
      <br/>
      In parallel, the request address indexes into way prediction array 255 and causes the way prediction stored in the indexed storage location to be conveyed on way prediction bus 256.
      <br/>
      The way prediction is received by data array 251, and the storage location indicated by the way prediction is written with the data bytes associated with the store access.
      <br/>
      The indicated storage location is written after the previous data is transferred on way data buses 258 (as will be explained in more detail below with respect to FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, byte enables indicate which bytes of the storage location should be written with the input data bytes.
      <br/>
      Other bytes within the storage location remain unchanged.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The way prediction is additionally conveyed to way selection device 257, which selects the predicted way to transfer data bytes on data bus 269.
      <br/>
      These data bytes are stored in data register 259, and therefore the data that is being overwritten within data array 251 is saved.
      <br/>
      Finally, the way prediction is conveyed to tag comparison block 262.
      <br/>
      During a subsequent clock cycle, tag comparison block 262 completes its compares of tags to the request addresses.
      <br/>
      The hit/miss information so generated is combined with the way prediction to produce the signals on hit unpredicted way bus 264, hit predicted way bus 263, and miss bus 266.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      If the store access is a hit in the predicted way, then no action need be taken by data cache 224.
      <br/>
      The speculative storage of data in the previous clock cycle is correct.
      <br/>
      Load/store unit 222 may discard the associated store instruction.
      <br/>
      Therefore, stores which hit in the predicted way are advantageously performed in a single clock cycle.
      <br/>
      A superscalar microprocessor incorporating a data cache according to the present invention realizes increased cache bandwidth over prior data caches due to the single clock cycle stores.
      <br/>
      Additionally, since way prediction bypasses the tag comparisons of tag comparison block 262 to provide data, the access time of the associative cache is advantageously shortened.
      <br/>
      Such a data cache may be suitable for high frequency applications.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      However, if a hit in an unpredicted way is detected for a store access, then the store data has been stored into an incorrect storage location in data cache 224.
      <br/>
      The correct data for that storage location is stored within data register 259, and the clock cycle in which the hit/miss information is generated is used to restore the correct data to the predicted way.
      <br/>
      Load/store unit 222 is configured to cancel a request in a clock cycle subsequent to the first access of the store request if the first access hits in an unpredicted way.
      <br/>
      Cache control unit 254 uses the idle port associated with the cancelled access to access the row indexed by the store access in data array 251, tag array 250, and way prediction array 255.
      <br/>
      The correct way for the store access is conveyed on hit way bus 267, and way prediction control unit 268 stores the correct way in the indexed storage location of way prediction array 255.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the correct way is conveyed on hit way bus 267 to data array 251.
      <br/>
      Cache control unit 254 receives the hit predicted way and hit unpredicted way signals, and is configured to cause multiplexor 260 to select the data stored in data register 259 during clock cycles in which a hit in an unpredicted way is detected.
      <br/>
      Multiplexor 260 transfers the bytes to a data input port of data array 251, and the bytes are written into the originally predicted way.
      <br/>
      The originally predicted way is conveyed to data array 251 from tag comparison block 262.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the data associated with the store access is transferred to another data input port of data array 251, and this data is written into the correct way by data array 251 according to the aforementioned byte enables.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a store access which hits in an unpredicted way is performed in two clock cycles, and the data that was incorrectly overwritten in the predicted way is restored to the value contained prior to the store access.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      If a miss is detected for a store access, then the data associated with the store access is not written into data cache 224 until the data associated with the store address is transferred from main memory (if microprocessor 200 is configured to allocate a storage location in data cache 224 for store miss accesses).
      <br/>
      If microprocessor 200 is configured not to allocate a storage location on a store miss access, the store data is written to memory.
      <br/>
      In either the allocate or no allocate case, the data in the predicted way is restored as described above for the hit in the unpredicted way case.
      <br/>
      Way prediction array 255 is not updated for the miss case, since there is not a correct way prediction for a cache miss.

    <p num="49">
      Turning now to FIG. 3, portions of data array 251 (shown in FIG. 2) are shown to further illustrate elements of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 depicts a column 300 of data array 251 corresponding to a bit of storage in each row of data array 251.
      <br/>
      When an address is conveyed to data array 251, one of the storage locations in column 300 is indexed, and the value within the location is conveyed on bit conductor 301 and xbit (or bit bar) conductor 302.
      <br/>
      Bit conductor 301 is configured to convey the value stored in the indexed bit location, and xbit conductor 302 is configured to convey an inversion of the value stored in the indexed bit location.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Bit conductor 301 and xbit conductor 302 are charged to a high voltage prior to the address selecting a bit location for reading.
      <br/>
      The address is then conveyed to data array 251 and the selected bit location begins to discharge either bit conductor 301 (if the selected location stores a logical zero) or xbit conductor 302 (if the selected location stores a logical one).
      <br/>
      A read pulse is then transferred on read conductor 303 to a senseamp 304.
      <br/>
      A senseamp is a device which senses a voltage difference between the voltage on bit conductor 301 and the voltage on xbit conductor 302 and converts the voltage difference to a logical one or a logical zero.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, a logical one is the output of senseamp 304 if bit conductor 301 has a higher voltage than xbit conductor 302 when the read pulse is conveyed on read conductor 303.
      <br/>
      A logical zero is the output of senseamp 304 if bit conductor 301 has a lower voltage than xbit conductor 302.
      <br/>
      When the read pulse is conveyed to senseamp 304, senseamp 304 is isolated from bit conductor 301 and bit conductor 302, so that the action of senseamp 304 does not influence the voltages on these conductors.
      <br/>
      Therefore, senseamp 304 essentially latches the value at the time the read pulse arrives.
      <br/>
      The value generated by senseamp 304 is conveyed to way selection device 257 as part of way data buses 258.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      After the read pulse occurs, a write pulse is conveyed on a write conductor 305 which is coupled to a pair of tristating buffers.
      <br/>
      Tristating buffer 306 and inverting tristating buffer 307 are used to store a bit of data into the indexed bit location of column 300.
      <br/>
      The bit of data is provided by multiplexor 260, which also provides other bits of data for other columns within data array 251.
      <br/>
      Multiplexor 260 is operated as described above.
      <br/>
      The write pulse is produced during clock cycles when a store access is conveyed by load/store unit 222 to data cache 224 or when a restoration of data from an incorrectly predicted store access is being performed.
      <br/>
      When the write pulse is activated, buffers 306 and 307 charge bit conductor 301 and xbit conductor 302 to values indicative of the bit from multiplexor 260.
      <br/>
      A value indicative of the bit from multiplexor 260 is thereby stored into the indexed bit location in column 300.
      <br/>
      As can be understood from the foregoing description, the original data is read from data array 251 prior to the speculative write of store access data.
      <br/>
      The restoration of data may be performed for cases where the speculation is found to be incorrect by storing the original data into the storage location in a subsequent clock cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      A read from cache data array column 300 is an inherently slow process.
      <br/>
      Bit and xbit conductors 301 and 302 typically have a large capacitance.
      <br/>
      A storage location within cache data array column 300 is configured with transistors capable of a relatively low current which may only slowly discharge the appropriate conductor 301 or 302.
      <br/>
      The storage locations within cache data array column 300 are numerous, making larger transistors (capable of higher currents) expensive in terms of silicon area.
      <br/>
      Conversely, tristating buffers 306 and 307 are fewer in number and may therefore by significantly larger and may charge or discharge conductors 301 and 302 quickly.
      <br/>
      Therefore, writes to storage locations within cache data array 251 may be performed in significantly less time than reads.
      <br/>
      Performing a write during the same clock cycle as a read has minimal effect on the clock cycle time, especially considering that the row within cache data array column 300 is selected during the read.
      <br/>
      A relatively small amount of added time for tristating buffers 306 and 307 to charge or discharge conductors 301 and 302 is used.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, adding the read and write to data array 251 within the same clock cycle enables the present invention with negligible deleterious affect on clock cycle time.
      <br/>
      In many cases, cycle time may not be affected as the added time to perform the write after the read is less than the desired clock cycle time.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Turning next to FIG. 4A, a timing diagram of an exemplary pair of store accesses to data cache 224 is shown.
      <br/>
      In this example, both store accesses receive correct way predictions.
      <br/>
      The clock cycles are consecutive, and are labeled CLK1, CLK2 and CLK3.
      <br/>
      During CLK1, a store request to an address "A" is conveyed to data cache 224 by load/store unit 222, as indicated by block 401.
      <br/>
      The address is conveyed to way prediction array 255, which selects the indexed way prediction and transfers the prediction on way prediction bus 256.
      <br/>
      Data array 251 receives the way prediction and address A, and selects the storage location corresponding to the indexed row and the predicted way.
      <br/>
      The data bytes stored within the selected storage location are transferred to an output port of data array 251 and selected by way selection device 257.
      <br/>
      The data bytes are thereby stored into data register 259.
      <br/>
      These actions are represented on FIG. 4A as arrow 402, where the data previously stored in the selected storage location is captured.
      <br/>
      Subsequently during CLK1 (as indicated by arrow 403), the data bytes associated with the store access are stored into the selected storage location.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Early in CLK2 (as indicated by arrow 404), a hit in the predicted way is detected by data cache 224.
      <br/>
      Therefore, address A was correctly stored within data cache 224 during CLK1.
      <br/>
      Additionally, load/store unit 222 conveys a store request for an address "B" (as shown in block 405).
      <br/>
      Similar to CLK1 above, the data bytes in the predicted way are read and stored within data register 259, as indicated by arrow 406.
      <br/>
      Again similar to CLK1, the data bytes associated with the store access are stored in the selected storage location (shown as arrow 407 in FIG. 4A).
      <br/>
      During CLK3, address B is determined to hit in the predicted way and therefore the store access completed successfully in CLK2 (as indicated by arrow 408).
      <br/>
      As can be seen from FIG. 4A, store accesses are advantageously completed in one clock cycle as long as the way prediction is correct.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Turning now to FIG. 4B, a timing diagram of another exemplary pair of store access to data cache 224 are shown.
      <br/>
      In this example, the first store access will be found to hit in an unpredicted way.
      <br/>
      During CLK1, load/store unit 222 conveys a store access for an address "A" to data cache 224, as indicated by block 410.
      <br/>
      As with CLK1 in FIG. 4A and as indicated by arrow 411, the data stored in the predicted way and indexed row of data cache 224 is captured in data register 259.
      <br/>
      The data associated with the store access to address A is stored into data cache 224 in the predicted way of the indexed row, as indicated by arrow 412.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      During CLK2, load/store unit 222 begins to transfer a store access to an address "B" (as indicated by block 414).
      <br/>
      However, a hit in an unpredicted way is detected with respect to address A (shown by arrow 413).
      <br/>
      Load/store unit 222 cancels its request for address B and data cache 224 indexes the row indicated by address A once again, as indicated by block 415.
      <br/>
      The data in the predicted way is restored and the correct way is written with data associated with the store access, as indicated by arrow 416.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      During CLK3, the request for store access to address B is conveyed by load/store unit 222 (as indicated by block 417).
      <br/>
      The data from the selected storage location is stored in data register 259 and the data associated with address B is stored into the selected storage location, shown as arrows 418 and 419, respectively.
      <br/>
      Early in CLK4, address B is determined to hit in the predicted way (arrow 420), and so address B successfully stored into data cache 224 in one clock cycle.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a hit in an unpredicted way for a store access incurs a one clock cycle penalty.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      It is noted that although the foregoing discussion disclosed a way prediction structure associated with an associative cache for performing store accesses in one clock cycle, a direct-mapped data cache may also benefit from the above described mechanism for reducing store accesses to a single cycle.
      <br/>
      A way prediction structure is not utilized in the direct-mapped embodiment of the present invention (since there is not a "way" to predict).
      <br/>
      Such an embodiment is specifically contemplated.

      Processor 500 limits the addressing mechanism used in the x86 to achieve both regular simple form of addressing as well as high clock frequency execution.
      <br/>
      It also targets 32-bit O/S and applications.
      <br/>
      Specifically, 32-bit flat addressing is employed where all the segment registers are mapped to all 4GB of physical memory. the starting address being 0000--0000 hex and their limit address being FFFF hex.
      <br/>
      The setting of this condition will be detected within processor 500 as one of the conditions to allow the collection of accelerated data paths and instructions to be enabled.
      <br/>
      The absence of this condition of 32-bit flat addressing will cause a serialization condition on instruction issue and a trapping to MROM space.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      Another method to ensure that a relatively high clock frequency may be accommodated is to limit the number of memory address calculation schemes to those that are simple to decode and can be decoded within a few bytes.
      <br/>
      We are also interested in supporting addressing that fits into our other goals, i.e., regular instruction decoding.

      The block diagram of FIG. 6 shows the pipeline for calculating addressing within processor 500.
      <br/>
      It is noted that base +8/32 bit displacement takes 1 cycle, where using an index register takes 1 more cycle of delay in calculating the address.
      <br/>
      More complicated addressing than these requires invoking an MROM routine to execute.

      An exemplary listing of the instruction sub-set supported by processor 500 as fast path instructions is provided below.

      The standard x86 instruction set is very limited in the number of registers it provides.
      <br/>
      Most RISC processors have 32 or greater general purpose registers, and many important variables can be held during and across procedures or processes during normal execution of routines.
      <br/>
      Because there are so few registers in the x86 architecture and most are not general purpose, a large percentage of operations are moves to and from memory.
      <br/>
      RISC architectures also incorporate 3 operand addressing to prevent moves from occurring of register values that are desired to be saved instead of overwritten.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The x86 instruction set uses a set of registers that can trace its history back to the 8080.
      <br/>
      Consequently there are few registers, many side effects, and sub-registers within registers.
      <br/>
      This is because when moving to 16-bit, or 32-bit operands, mode bits were added and the lengths of the registers were extended instead of expanding the size of the register file.
      <br/>
      Modern compiler technology can make use of large register sets and have a much smaller percentage of loads and stores.
      <br/>
      The effect of these same compilers is to have a much larger percentage of loads and stores when compiling to the x86.

      The actual x86 registers are often relegated to temporary registers for a few clock cycles while the real operation destinations are in memory.

      One notes from this organization that there are only 8 registers. and few are general purpose.
      <br/>
      The first four registers, EAX, EDX, ECX, and EBX, have operand sizes of 8, 16, or 32-bits depending on the mode of the processor or instruction.
      <br/>
      The final 4 registers were added with the 8086 and extended with the 386.
      <br/>
      Because there are so few real registers, they tend to act as holding positions for the passing of variables to and from memory.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The important thing to note is that when executing x86 instructions, one must be able to efficiently handle 8, 16, and 32-bit operands.
      <br/>
      If one is trying to execute multiple x86 instructions in parallel, it is not enough to simply multi-port the register file.
      <br/>
      This is because there are too few registers and all important program variables must be held in memory on the stack or in a fixed location.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      RISC designs employ regular instruction decoding along natural boundaries to achieve very high clock frequencies and also with a small number of pipeline stages even for very wide issue processors.
      <br/>
      This is possible because finding a large number of instructions and their opcodes is relatively straightforward, since they are always at fixed boundaries.
    </p>
    <p num="71">As stated previously, this is much more difficult in an x86 processor where there are variable byte instruction formats, as well as prefix bytes and SIB bytes that can effect the length and addressing/data types of the original opcode.</p>
    <p num="72">
      Processor 500 employs hardware to detect and send simple instructions to fixed issue positions, where the range of bytes that a particular issue position can use is limited.
      <br/>
      This may be compensated for by adding many issue positions that each instruction cache line can assume in parallel.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Once the instructions are aligned to a particular issue position, the net amount of hardware required to decode common instructions is not significantly greater than that of a RISC processor, allowing equivalent clock frequencies to be achieved.
      <br/>
      Processor 500 achieves high frequency, wide issue, and limited pipeline depth by limiting the instructions executed at high frequency to a sub-set of the x86 instructions under the conditions of 32-bit flat addressing.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The results of executing instructions are returned to the corresponding entry in the reorder buffer.
      <br/>
      If a store, the store is held in speculative state in front of the data cache in a store buffer, from which point it can be speculatively forwarded from.
      <br/>
      The reorder buffer then can either cancel this store or allow it to writeback to the data cache when the line is retired.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The following set of instructions probably comprise 90% of the dynamically executed code for 32-bit applications:
      <br/>
      8/32-bit operations
      <br/>
      move reg/reg reg/mem
      <br/>
      arithmetic operations reg/mem reg/reg logical operations reg/reg reg/mem push
      <br/>
      logical operations reg/reg reg/mem
      <br/>
      push
      <br/>
      call/return
      <br/>
      load effective address
      <br/>
      jump cc
      <br/>
      jump unconditional
      <br/>
      16-bit operations
      <br/>
      prefix/move reg/reg
      <br/>
      prefix/move reg/mem
      <br/>
      prefix/arithmetic operations reg/reg, reg/mem
      <br/>
      prefix/logical operations reg/reg reg/mem
      <br/>
      prefix/push
      <br/>
      prefix/pop
    </p>
    <p num="76">When executing 32-bit code under flat addressing, these instructions almost always fall within 1-8 bytes in length, which is in the same rough range of the aligned, accelerated fast path instructions.</p>
    <p num="77">
      Accelerated instructions are defined as fast-path instructions between 1 and 8 bytes in length.
      <br/>
      It noted that it is possible that the start/end positions predecoded reflect multiple x86 instructions, for instance 2 or 3 pushes that are predecoded in a row may be treated as one accelerated instruction that consumes 3 bytes.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      When a cache line is fetched from the instruction cache, it moves into an instruction alignment unit which looks for start bytes within narrow ranges.
      <br/>
      The instruction alignment unit uses the positions of the start bytes of the instructions to dispatch the instructions to four issue positions.
      <br/>
      Instructions are dispatched such that each issue position accepts the first valid start byte within its range along with subsequent bytes.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      A multiplexer in each decoder looks for the end byte associated with each start byte, where an end byte can be no more than seven bytes away from a start byte.
      <br/>
      The mechanism to scan for a constant value in an instruction over four bytes in length may be given an extra pipeline stage due to the amount of time potentially required.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      Note that instructions included in the subset of accelerated instructions, and which are over four bytes in length, always have a constant as the last 1/2/4 bytes.
      <br/>
      This constant is usually not needed until the instruction is issued to a functional unit, and therefore the determination of the constant value can be delayed in the pipeline.
      <br/>
      The exception is an instruction requiring an eight-bit displacement for an address calculation.
      <br/>
      The eight-bit displacement for stack-relative operations is always the third byte after the start byte, so this field will always be located within the same decoder as the rest of the instruction.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      It is possible that a given cache line can have more instructions to issue than can be accommodated by the four entry positions contained in each line of the four issue reorder buffer.
      <br/>
      If this occurs, the four issue reorder buffer allocates a second line in the buffer as the remaining instructions are dispatched.
      <br/>
      Typically, in 32-bit application and O/S code, the average instruction length is about three bytes.
      <br/>
      The opcode is almost always the first two bytes, with the third byte being a sib byte specifying a memory address (if included), and the fourth byte being a 16-bit data prefix.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      The assumption in the processor 500 alignment hardware is that if the average instruction length is three, then four dedicated issue positions and decoders assigned limited byte ranges should accommodate most instructions found within 16-byte instruction cache lines.
      <br/>
      If very dense decoding occurs (i.e., lots of one and two byte instructions), several lines are allocated in the four issue reorder buffer for the results of instructions contained in a few lines of the instruction cache.
      <br/>
      The fact that these more compact instructions are still issued in parallel and at a high clock frequency more than compensates for having some decoder positions potentially idle.
    </p>
    <p num="83">Overview of the Processor 500 Instruction Cache (Icache)</p>
    <p num="84">
      This section describes the instruction cache organization, fetching mechanism, and pre-decode information.
      <br/>
      The Processor 500 instruction cache has basic features including the ICSTORE, ICTAGV, ICNXTBLK, ICCNTL, ICALIGN, ICFPC, and ICPRED.
      <br/>
      Highlights are: the pre-decode bits per byte of instructions are 3 bits, the branch prediction increases to 2 targets, 2 different types of branch prediction techniques (bimodal and global) are implemented, the X86 instructions align to 4 fixed length RISC-type instructions, and the pre-decode logic eliminates many serializtion conditions.
      <br/>
      Processor 500 executes the X86 instructions directly with a few instructions requiring two Rops, the BYTEQ is configured for fast scanning of instructions, and instructions are aligned to 4 decode units.
      <br/>
      The pre-decode data is separate in a block called ICPDAT, instead of inside the ICSTORE.
      <br/>
      The pre-fetch buffers are added to the ICSTORE to write instructions directly into the array, and the prefixes are not modified.
      <br/>
      All branches are detected during pre-decoding.
      <br/>
      Unconditional branches are taken during pre-decoding and aligning of instructions to the decode units.
      <br/>
      A return stack is implemented for CALL/RETURN instructions.
      <br/>
      Way prediction is implemented to read the current block and fetch the next block because the tag comparison and branch prediction do not resolve until the second cycle.
      <br/>
      The scanning for 4 instructions is done from ICPDAT before selected by tag comparison.
      <br/>
      Since the pre-decode data does not include the information for the 2-Rop instructions, the instructions must be partially decoded for the 2-rop during prioritizing and aligning of instructions to decode units.
      <br/>
      The early decoding includes decoding for unconditional branches, operand addresses, flags, displacement and immediate fields of the instruction.
      <br/>
      The CMASTER takes care of the replacement algorithm for the Icache and sends the way associative along with the data to the pre-fetch buffer.
      <br/>
      This section includes signal lists, timings and implementation issues for the Icache and all sub-blocks.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The Icache size is 32K bytes with 8-way set associative.
      <br/>
      The Icache is linearly addressed.
      <br/>
      The number of pipeline stages is 9.
      <br/>
      Icache will have more than one clock cycle to read and align the instructions to the decode units.
      <br/>
      The row decoding of index address is calculated in first half of ICLK, the data, tag, pre-decode, and predicting information are read in by the end of ICLK.
      <br/>
      In the next cycle, the data are selected by the TAGHITs and latched.
      <br/>
      The pre-decode data are scanned to generate the controls to the multiplexers for aligning and sending the instructions to the decode units and MROM units.
      <br/>
      A part of the scanning logic is done in parallel with the tag comparison.
      <br/>
      The scanning and alignment of instructions takes two clock cycles.
      <br/>
      The decode units can start decoding in the second half of the third clock.
      <br/>
      The Icache includes a way-prediction which can be done in a single clock using the ICNXTBLK target.
      <br/>
      The branch prediction includes bimodal and global branch prediction which takes two clock cycles.
      <br/>
      The timing from fetching, scanning, aligning, decoding, and muxing of instructions to decode units are shown in FIG. 8.

      Processor 500 executes fast X86 instructions directly, no ROPs are needed.
      <br/>
      The pre-decode bits with each byte of instruction are 3 bits; start bit, end bit, and functional bit.
      <br/>
      All the externally fetched instructions will be latched into the Icache.
      <br/>
      This should not be a problem since the Icache is idle and waits for external instructions.
      <br/>
      Only single byte prefix of 0 * 66 and 0 * 0F is allowed for Processor 500's fast path, multiple prefixes including 0 * 67 is allowed for multi-prefix, all other prefixes will take an extra cycle in decoding or go to MROM.
      <br/>
      With these simple prefixes, the instruction bytes need not be modified.
      <br/>
      The linear valid bit is used for the whole cache-line of instructions, 16-byte.
      <br/>
      The replacement procedure is done by the CMASTER.
      <br/>
      Along with each line of instruction, the CMASTER tells the Icache which way to put in the data and tag.
      <br/>
      The start and end bits are sufficient to validate the instruction.
      <br/>
      If branching to the middle of the line or instructions wrapping to the next line, the start and end bits must be detected for each instruction or else the instruction must be pre-decoded again.
      <br/>
      The possible cases are branching to the opcode and skipping the prefix (punning of instruction) and part of the wrapping instruction is replaced in the Icache.
      <br/>
      The instructions must first pass through the pre-fetch buffers before sending to the ICPRED.
      <br/>
      The ICPRED has only one input from the IB(127:0) for both the pre-fetched or cached instructions.
      <br/>
      The pre-decode information is written into the ICPDAT as the whole line is decoded.
      <br/>
      The output IB(127:0) is merged with the previous 8-byte to form a 24-byte line for the alignment unit to select and send to 4 decode units.
    </p>
    <p num="233">
      Since the instruction fetching from external memory will be written directly into the Icache, the pre-fetch buffer should be built into the ICSTORE; the input/output path of the array.
      <br/>
      In this way, the data will be written into the Icache regardless of the pre-decode information or the taken branch instruction and the instructions is available to the Icache as soon as they are valid on the bus.
      <br/>
      The number of pre-fetch buffers is two, and request will be made to BIU as soon as there is space in the pre-fetch buffer for another line of instructions.
      <br/>
      The pre-fetch buffer consists of a counter and a valid bit for instructions written into the cache and a valid bit for instructions sent to the decode unit.
      <br/>
      As long as the address pointer is still in the same block, the data will be written to the array.
      <br/>
      With the pre-fetch buffer in the Icache, a dedicated bus should be used to transfer instructions directly from the pads to the Icache; this is a step to keep Processor 500 from using dynamic pre-charged buses.
    </p>
    <heading>ICSTORE ORGANIZATION</heading>
    <p num="234">
      The ICSTORE on Processor 500 does not store the pre-decode data, as shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      The ICSTORE consists of 32K bytes of instructions organized as 8 sets of 128 rows by 256 columns.
      <br/>
      The array set in this documentation has its own decoder.
      <br/>
      The decoder is in the center of the set.
      <br/>
      Each of the sets consist of 2-byte of instructions.
      <br/>
      The 8-way associative muxing from the 8 TAG-HITs is performed before the data is routed to the ICALIGN block.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, the input/output to each set is 16-bit buses.
      <br/>
      The muxing information relating to which byte is going to which decode unit should also be decoded; this topic will be discussed in detail below in the ICALIGN block section.
      <br/>
      For optimal performance the layout of the column should be 64 RAM cells, pre-charge, 64 RAM cells, write buffer and senamp.
      <br/>
      The row decoder should be in the middle of the array to drive 128 column each way.
      <br/>
      Basically, the pre-charge and the row decoder should be crossed in the middle of the array.
      <br/>
      The self-time column is used to generate internal clock for each set of the array.
      <br/>
      Pre-charge is gated by ICLK.
      <br/>
      The instruction is valid by the end of ICLK, the data muxes by the TAG-HIT should be gated by ICLK to be valid for the second ICLK.
      <br/>
      The two-entry pre-fetch buffers are implemented inside the array with data can be written from either entry.
      <br/>
      The output IB bus is taken from either the array or the pre-fetch buffer.

    <p num="264">
      In Processor 500, the pre-decode data is in a separate block than the ICSTORE, and is updated with a different timing than that of instructions.
      <br/>
      The ICPDAT is updated as the whole instruction line is completed decoding in the ICPRED.
      <br/>
      To prevent erroneous setting of the pre-decode bits, the valid bit in the ICTAGV is not set until the pre-decode data is written into the array.
      <br/>
      The pointer to ICSTORE can advance before the whole line of instruction is completed in pre-decode for split-line instruction.
      <br/>
      The pre-decode data includes three bits: start-byte, end-byte, and functional-byte.
      <br/>
      During pre-decoding, the ICPDAT uses 2 sets of latches to keep the pre-decode information for each line of instructions.
      <br/>
      The first set is for the current line and the second set is used for split-line instructions.
      <br/>
      As each instruction is completed in pre-decoding, the start and end pointers set the latches.
      <br/>
      The functional bits are kept in the ICPRED and write into the array at the completion of pre-decoding for the line.
      <br/>
      If a taken branch instruction is detected in ICPRED, the control should allow one clock cycle to write the current pre-decode data into the ICPDAT array.

      A valid instruction should start with a start byte and end with an end byte before another start byte can be detected.
      <br/>
      Any invalid instruction should be detected in the scanning logic before sending the instruction to early decoding.
      <br/>
      The invalid instruction must be pre-decoded again by the ICPRED block.
      <br/>
      ICPDAT should keep all pre-decode data for the line of the confused instruction from the array which will be ORed with the functional bits from pre-decoding for writing back into the array.
      <br/>
      The pre-decoding stops on two conditions: a taken branch is detected or valid start byte (or valid instruction) is detected after the end byte from pre-decoding; this condition should be detected in the ICPDAT.
    </p>
    <p num="266">
      The start bits are decoded into byte-shifting information for up to 4 instructions per 8-byte block which will be used by the ICALIGN block.
      <br/>
      The start-byte pointer for the current fetching instruction is used to reset all the start and end bits before the current pointer, and the taken branch pointer from the way prediction is used to reset all the start and end bits after the branch pointer.
      <br/>
      All 8-way data should be latched in case of way mis-prediction, the corrected way should be read again from the latches for scanning.
      <br/>
      An 8-byte or 16-byte block can be read from the array to merge with the previous data to form a 16-byte line for scanning and sending to early decoding.
      <br/>
      The scanning of the start bits is sectioned into two 8-byte blocks, the maximum scanned path is 8-byte long.
      <br/>
      The. scanning outputs control the muxing of up to 7 bytes for each instruction to early decoding unit.
      <br/>
      In addition, the scanning of the 8-start-byte generates the look-ahead controls of next 8-byte blocks.
    </p>
    <heading>ICPDAT ORGANIZATION</heading>
    <p num="267">
      For each 8-byte, the ICPDAT (as shown in FIG. 10) generates 4 sets of valid bits based on the start and end bits.
      <br/>
      The valid bits are muxed to the ICALIGN the same way as the instruction bytes.
      <br/>
      The valid bits are used to qualify the functional bits.
      <br/>
      Example of the valid bits for 8-byte instruction:
    </p>
    <p num="268">
      --
      <br/>
      --             Start bits     10100100    01110101
      <br/>
      --             End bits       01001000    11101010
      <br/>
      --             Valid bits 1   11000000    01000000
      <br/>
      --             Valid bits 2   00111000    00100000
      <br/>
      --             Valid bits 3   00000111    10011000
      <br/>
      --             Valid bits 4   00000000    00000110
    </p>
    <p num="269">
      In setting up the valid bits for the instructions, ICPDAT needs to validate the instruction with proper the start and end bits.
      <br/>
      Only instructions with valid start and end bits can be in ICALIGN.
      <br/>
      If the line is hit in the cache, the pre-decode data should be latched into the buffer for future reference.
      <br/>
      ICPDAT notifies ICCNTL to pre-decode the invalid instruction.
      <br/>
      The functional bits from ICPRED are ORed with the local buffer of functional bits for writing back into the array.
      <br/>
      During pre-decoding if a valid start byte is detected after an end byte, ICPDAT should notify ICCNTL to stop pre-decoding, writing the current pre-decode data into the array, and re-fetching the line for scanning.
      <br/>
      The scanning logic should use only the pre-decode data from the array.
      <br/>
      The MROM instruction should also be detected in ICPDAT with a pointer to the ICALIGN and the MROM.
      <br/>
      The MROM instruction is read directly from the IB(127:0).
      <br/>
      MROM is responsible to detect and decode the prefixes and opcode as with ICALIGN.
      <br/>
      Exemplary hardware is shown in FIG. 11.
    </p>
    <p num="270">
      The Icache line sets up as two 8-byte sections, the scanned logic and fetching of next line should be independent of each other.
      <br/>
      While scanning, the end-byte should also be detected to indicate that all 8-byte can be dispatched in one clock cycle and to fetch a new line.
      <br/>
      Conditions to fetch the next 8-byte are:
      <br/>
      Three start bits or less.
    </p>
    <p num="271">Four start bits with no more than 3 end bits.</p>
    <p num="272">Four start bits with 4 end bits, the last end bit is on the last byte.</p>
    <p num="273">Hold indication from early decoding.</p>
    <p num="274">Hold for more than one MROM instruction in the current 16 bytes.</p>
    <p num="275">
      Since the instruction can have up to 15 bytes which can span more than two 8-byte blocks, the ICPDAT can send the instruction to the next stage with assumed valid bits.
      <br/>
      The split-line instruction has indication to read the rest of the instruction in the next clock cycle.
      <br/>
      In the next cycle if the end bit is not detected within 15 bytes, the instruction must be sent to ICPRED for pre-decoding.
      <br/>
      The output from the ICSTORE is IB(127:0), ICPDAT provides the controls for muxing of this bus to the IB1(191:0) which is in the ICALIGN block.
      <br/>
      The muxing is for any of the 8-byte block on IB(127:0) to any of the 8-byte block on IB1(191:0).
      <br/>
      ICPRED also provides similar controls for the muxes.
    </p>
    <p num="276">
      If there are more than 4 instructions in the 8-byte block, the ICPDAT muxes the 8-byte block from IB(127:0) to IB1(191:0) and stalls the next 8-byte block.
      <br/>
      In the next clock cycle, the first 4 instructions clear the pre-decode data and the 8-byte block starts scanning with the fifth instruction.
      <br/>
      The same 8-byte block should be muxed from IB(127:0) to IB1(191:0) again.
      <br/>
      This mechanism keeps the ICALIGN from feeding back information on dispatching of the first 4 instructions.
      <br/>
      With this method the scanning of instructions in ICPDAT is independent of the next stage and is more flexible; either 3 or 4 instructions can be scanned.
    </p>
    <p num="277">
      The scanning logic for each 8-byte segment of instructions is done in parallel with the TAGHITs in the ICTAGV block.
      <br/>
      More details regarding the scanning logic may be found in the commonly assigned, co-pending patent application entitled "TA Parallel and Scalable Instruction Scanning Unit", Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/475,400 filed Jun. 7, 1995 by Narayan.
      <br/>
      The disclosure of this patent application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
      <br/>
      It is possible to implement the fetching, scanning, early decoding, and shifting of instructions to the decode units in 4 clock cycles.
    </p>
    <heading>MROM INTERFACING</heading>
    <p num="278">
      The ICPDAT sends the MROM instruction directly to the MENG.
      <br/>
      Only one MROM instruction can be sent to the MENG per clock cycle.
      <br/>
      The MENG pipelines the MROM instructions and provides latches to keep up to 3 MROM instructions including the last MROM on IB(127:0).
      <br/>
      MROMFULL indicates that the next MROM instruction should be stalled in ICPDAT until the previous MROM instruction is dispatched to a decode unit.
      <br/>
      ICPDAT provides the byte pointer for the MENG to read the instruction from the IB(127:0) along with the functional and valid bits for decoding the instruction.
      <br/>
      ICPDAT should indicate MROM instruction to MENG only if the associated 8-bytes can be shifted to the next stage.
      <br/>
      If the instruction continues to the next line, MENG can expect to read the rest of the instruction on IB(127:0) in the next cycle (similar to sending split-line instruction to ICALIGN).
      <br/>
      The signal MROMFULL is used to stop ICPDAT to keep the data on IB(127:0) for MENG to process prefixes of the instruction.
      <br/>
      The micro-instructions rejoin the instruction pipeline in the muxing stage to the decode units.
      <br/>
      With early detection of MROM instruction to MENG, the penalty for MROM instruction is one clock cycle.
      <br/>
      MENG is responsible to decode prefixes and all fields of instructions.
      <br/>
      The same decoding logic is used in the ICPRED and ICALIGN.
    </p>
    <p num="279">
      In ICALIGN, as the MROM instruction is detected, it moves to dispatched position 0 and waits for micro-instructions from MENG.
      <br/>
      The following instructions fill the pipeline and dispatch as soon as the last micro-instruction is sent to decode unit.
      <br/>
      In dispatch position 0, the MROM instruction should start in the first 8-byte block of the IB2(191:0) bus. The MENG can provide pointers to read the displacement and immediate fields of the MROM instruction directly from the IB2(191:0)

    <heading>ICPDAT ORGANIZATION</heading>
    <p num="280">
      The ICPDAT includes of 32K of 3-bit pre-decode data organized as 8 sets of 64 rows by 192 columns.
      <br/>
      Each of the sets consists of two 3-bit pre-decode data.
      <br/>
      The pre-decode data is decoded into byte-shifting information which ise used by the ICALIGN block.
      <br/>
      The 8-way associative muxing from the 8 TAGHITs is performed before the byte-shifting data is routed to the ICALIGN block.
      <br/>
      In order for the instructions to get to the Idecode in middle of the second ICLK, the decode logic for the byte-shifting should be less than 7 gates.
      <br/>
      The byte-shifting logic has been done.
      <br/>
      Because of this byte-shifting logic, the array for ICPDAT is 64 rows instead of 128 rows for the ICSTORE array.
      <br/>
      For optimal performance the layout of the column should be 32 RAM cells, pre-charge, 32 RAM cells, write buffer and senseamp.
      <br/>
      The row decoder should be in the middle of the array to drive 96 column each way.
      <br/>
      Basically, the pre-charge and the row decoder should be crossed in the middle of the array.
      <br/>
      The self-time column is used to generate internal clock for each set of the array.
      <br/>
      Pre-charge is gated by ICLK.
      <br/>
      The byte-shifting data muxed by the TAGHIT should be gated by ICLK to be valid for the second ICLK.
      <br/>
      The output of the array should include logic to feedback the previous pre-decode data for breaking up of the line for second cycle access.

      <br/>
      The CMASTER indicates which way to put in the pre-fetch data and tag.
      <br/>
      Writing of the tag is done at the same time as writing the data into the ICSTORE, and writing of the linear valid bit is done at the same time as writing the pre-decode bits into the ICPDAT.
      <br/>
      The start and end bits are sufficient to validate the instruction.
      <br/>
      If branching to the middle of the line or instructions wrapping to the next line, the start and end bytes must be detected for each instruction or else the instruction must be pre-decoded again.
      <br/>
      The possible cases for invalid instructions are (1) branching to the opcode and skipping the prefix, (2) part of the wrapping instruction are replaced in the Icache, (3) part of the line was not pre-decoded because of branch instruction and branch target.

      Whenever the MMU is re-mapped or the CMASTER execute a certain instruction, all the LV bits can be cleared.

      20-bit Tag address.
      <br/>
      2 Status bits (SU, LV).
    </p>
    <p num="339">
      The status bits need to be dual-port to read and write in the same clock cycle.
      <br/>
      The ICTAGV is organized as two sets of 64 rows by 224 columns and two sets of 64 rows by 128 columns.
      <br/>
      Each of the first two sets consists of 7-bit tag address, and each of the last two sets consists of 3-bit tag address and the SU or LV bit.
      <br/>
      The two status bits are dual port RAM cells.
      <br/>
      The SU uses the delayed PC to write, and the LV bit has the snooping index from CMASTER.
      <br/>
      The ICTAGV uses 64 rows for dual-port RAM and quick reading of tag address.
      <br/>
      For optimal performance the layout of the column should be 32 RAM cells, pre-charge, 32 RAM cells, write buffer and senamp.
      <br/>
      The row decoder should be in the middle of the array to drive 112 or 96 columns each way.
      <br/>
      Basically, the pre-charge and the row decoder should be crossed in the middle of the array.
      <br/>
      The row decoder for the dual port RAM should be build at one end of the array.

      The self-time column is used to generate internal clock for each set of the array.

      Pre-charge is gated by ICLK.

      The status bits muxed by the TAGHIT should be gated by ICLK to be valid for the second ICLK.

      This block contains the branch prediction information for the Icache.
      <br/>
      An important feature for performance of superscalar/superpipelined microprocessors is branch prediction.
      <br/>
      As the number of pipeline stages and the number of functional units increase the cost of mis-prediction is high.
      <br/>
      The tag comparison and selection of the 8-way associative in ICTAGV takes more than one clock cycle to resolve.
      <br/>
      Processor 500 implements another prediction technique to pick one out of the 8 ways and to use the predicted way for fetching of next line to remove the bubble in the pipeline.
      <br/>
      Three bits are needed for this way prediction.
      <br/>
      Another two bits are needed to select one of the two branch targets for fetching the next predicted line.
      <br/>
      Without the two bits to select the branch targets, comparison of the start-byte position with the positions of the branch targets will cause the way-prediction to be more than one clock cycle.
      <br/>
      This speculatively selected line of instructions can be corrected in the next cycle from the proper TAGHIT and the branch prediction.
      <br/>
      The following rules are used to set up the ICNXTBLK:
      <br/>
      During pre-decode, if there is an unconditional branch instruction, the fetching is stalled until the new target PC can be calculated.
      <br/>
      If the branch is direct, the target PC can be calculated in the next cycle in the ICFPC.
    </p>
    <p num="368">The backward taken conditional branch which the new target PC can be calculated in the ICPFC should also predict taken.</p>
    <p num="369">
      If the branch is indirect, the target PC is from the functional unit.
      <br/>
      The speculative way-prediction is updated with the successor index in the cycle following the target address access.
      <br/>
      If there is no pre-decoded taken branch, the speculative way-prediction is updated after fetching of the next sequential block.
      <br/>
      The index after accessing the array should be kept for 3 clock cycles before the way-prediction is known for updating.
    </p>
    <p num="370">From mis-prediction, the new target PC will be fetched and the selected set and successor index will be kept in a branch holding registers which will be discussed in next section.</p>
    <p num="371">
      For better branch prediction hit ratio, the ICNXTBLK will increase to 2 branch targets for both taken and non-taken branches, and pre-decode for the unconditional branches and taken branches.
      <br/>
      The pre-decoding also calculate the branch target address for the branch instructions if available.
      <br/>
      If there is a hit in the ICNXTBLK, the new target will be used for the new fetch PC.
      <br/>
      The taken branch will have higher priority to occupy the two targets in ICNXTBLK.

    </p>
    <p num="373">Bimodal Branch Prediction</p>
    <p num="374">
      This branch prediction uses a saturated counter for prediction.
      <br/>
      A 2-bit counter is used for taken/non-taken prediction.
      <br/>
      The most significant bit is used for taken/non-taken prediction.
      <br/>
      Since branch instructions are more likely to be taken than non-taken, the counter should initialize to 10 if the branch target address can be calculated.
      <br/>
      As the branch is taken, the counter increases by 1 and is saturated at 11.
      <br/>
      As the branch is not taken, the counter decreases by 1 and is saturated at 00.
      <br/>
      The bimodal branch prediction is better than a single bit prediction as the branch correct prediction is 88.09% instead of 82.29% for two targets prediction.
      <br/>
      The bimodal branch prediction behaves well for mostly taken or non-taken branch instruction and is worst as the conditional branches flip-flop between taken and non-taken.
      <br/>
      The cost is one extra bit per branch target in the ICNXTBLK, and extra logic for the counter.
    </p>
    <p num="375">Global Branch Prediction</p>
    <p num="376">
      This branch prediction is an independent branch predictor, not a part of the Icache.
      <br/>
      There are many different types of global branch prediction; Processor 500 uses the global branch prediction which has the highest branch correct prediction ratio.
      <br/>
      The prediction entries are indexed by an exclusive OR of the PC and the branch shift register, which is referred to as global sharing branch prediction.
      <br/>
      This global branch prediction has the branch correct prediction at 89.24%; the prediction improves as more branch history bits are used in the prediction.
      <br/>
      A single shift register records the direction taken/non-taken by the most recent n conditional branches.
      <br/>
      Since the branch history is global to all branches, global branch prediction takes advantage of two types of patterns, the direction taken by the current branch may depend strongly on the other recent branches, and the duplicating the behavior of local branch prediction (patterns of branches in loops).
      <br/>
      For Processor 500, since the highest priority of the two branch targets is taken branch, the global shift register includes both the conditional and unconditional branches.
      <br/>
      In a few cases, the non-taken conditional branches may not include in the global shift register.
      <br/>
      To match the number of entries in the Icache, the global branch prediction needs to have 2048 entries with 2 targets per entry.
      <br/>
      It is organized with 256 rows of 8-way associative.
      <br/>
      Eight bits are used to index the branch prediction table.
      <br/>
      The PC uses bit 11:4 for indexing the branch prediction table.

    <p num="378">
      Combining the Bimodal and Global branch predictions should give a better correct prediction ratio.
      <br/>
      A predictor counter is used to select which branch predictor is better for each individual branch instruction.
      <br/>
      This technique should give a higher correct prediction ratio than the above two prediction techniques; the prediction ratio can be shown to be 89.93%. The same saturated counter is used for the predictor counter: if the bimodal predictor is correct and the global predictor is incorrect then increase the counter until saturated; if the global predictor is correct and the bimodal predictor is incorrect then decrease the counter until saturated; else no change in the predictor counter.
      <br/>
      The most significant bit of the predictor counter is used for selecting the branch predictor.
      <br/>
      ICNXTBLK is implemented with the bimodal counter and the predictor counter.
      <br/>
      ICNXTBLK has 2 targets per instruction line, where each target consists of the following:
      <br/>
      12 bits--successor index, need 11:4 for global table index, 11:0 for icache.
      <br/>
      3 bits--for 8-way associative.
      <br/>
      4 bits--byte position of the branch instruction within the current line.
      <br/>
      2 bits--bimodal counter
      <br/>
      2 bits--predictor counter
      <br/>
      1 bit--valid target
    </p>
    <p num="379">
      The table for global branch predictor also has 2 targets per entry, where each entry consists of a 2-bit global counter.
      <br/>
      The bimodal and predictor counters must be able to update the count on every cycle.
      <br/>
      The least significant bit of the counters is dual ported.
      <br/>
      If the count is 10, predicted taken, the new count is 11.
      <br/>
      If the count is 01, predicted non-taken, the new count is 00.
      <br/>
      Only on branch mis-prediction does the most significant bit of the counters change state.
    </p>
    <p num="380">
      The successor index, way, and byte position are shared between the bimodal and global counters.
      <br/>
      The predictor counter selects between the bimodal and global counters.
      <br/>
      The combination of the counters is to predict branch instructions as taken/non-taken.
      <br/>
      In most cases, the shared target is sufficient for the two branch predictors.
      <br/>
      The branch may have two different targets depended on two different patterns of branch instructions.
      <br/>
      In this case, the global predictor may desire to have its own target.
      <br/>
      It would be very expensive in layout area to have 4 targets per 16 bytes of instruction.
      <br/>
      A diagram of ICNXTBLK is shown as FIG. 13.
    </p>
    <p num="381">Implementation of Global Branch Tag for Recovery</p>
    <p num="382">
      As discussed above, the global branch predictor needs a table with 256 rows, 8-way associative, and 2 targets per line.
      <br/>
      A shift register of 8 bits is needed for indexing.
      <br/>
      The global branch predictor shift register must be able to back track to the previous conditional branch which is mis-predicted.
      <br/>
      As each conditional branch is predicted, the direction of the branch is shifted into the shift register from right to left, 1 for taken and 0 for non-taken.
      <br/>
      The shift register needs a total of 24 bits and each of the bit beyond the 8 indexing bits needs to have a tag.
      <br/>
      The tag has 4 bits to indicate the conditional branch position in the shift register.
      <br/>
      FIROB has 6 lines of 4 instructions and the pipeline from fetch to dispatch can hold another 3 lines of 4 instructions for a total of 36 instructions.
      <br/>
      The average length of X86 instruction is 3 bytes, thus (36 instruction X 3 bytes) 108 bytes are equivalent to 6.75 lines from the Icache.
      <br/>
      Each Icache line of instructions can have up to 2 branch targets, which is 14 branch instructions in the pipeline.
      <br/>
      The extra 16 bits in the shift register is sufficient to handle all branches in the pipeline.
      <br/>
      The shift register needs to keep track of all branch instructions.
      <br/>
      All the branch tags and the taken/non-taken bits are shifted in the shift register.
      <br/>
      The shift register tag (branch tag) is routed with the branch instruction to the functional units and FIROB.
      <br/>
      As the branch instruction is mis-predicted the branch tag is used to retreat the old 8 bits in the shift register to restore the shift register with new direction for the mis-predicted branch instruction.
    </p>
    <p num="383">
      Even though it is unlikely that the number of branch instructions in the pipeline exceeds 16, a mechanism is needed to detect the overflow of the global shift register.
      <br/>
      An extra valid bit is set for each branch in the global shift register.
      <br/>
      As the branch instruction is retired, the branch tag is returned to the global shift register to clear all the tail valid bits from the branch tag.
      <br/>
      As the global shift register is shifted, if the valid bit at the tail of the shift register is set, then the pipeline must stall for the branch instruction to retire from the FIROB.
    </p>
    <p num="384">
      In the global shift register, beside the taken/non-taken bits, the branch predictor count, the bimodal count, the global count, the valid bit, and the branch target number should be kept in the same global shift register which will be restored for updating of the counters and the branch target number in case of branch mis-prediction.
      <br/>
      The counters are 6 bits, the valid is 1 bit, the branch target number is 1 bit, the taken/non-taken is 1 bit, and the branch tag is 4 bits; the total bits in the shift register is 13.
      <br/>
      The branch target number is to update one of the two branch targets in the ICNXTBLK.
      <br/>
      Since the ICNXTBLK can keep only two branch targets, some of the branch instructions may not be detected and may not get a branch tag from the global shift register.
      <br/>
      If the mis-prediction was not in the branch prediction, a new entry should be setup.
      <br/>
      The counters will be restored and incremented/decremented before sending to the holding register for updating the mis-predicted block.
      <br/>
      The return stack in the ICFPC should also restore from mis-prediction.
    </p>
    <p num="385">
      The global shift register is set and shifted in the second ICLK as the branch prediction is determined.
      <br/>
      In later pipeline stages, the unconditional jump, call, and return instructions can be detected and change the direction of the fetched instruction.
      <br/>
      In this case, the global shift register must be restored.
      <br/>
      A new branch tag is setup for the unconditional jump, call, and return instructions.
      <br/>
      The only branch instructions without branch tags are the conditional branch instruction which are not recorded in the ICNXTBLK.
      <br/>
      The ICFPC must keep track of the branch instructions in the first 4 pipeline stages for recovery of the global shift register.
    </p>
    <p num="386">
      All the branches must be detected in pre-decoding and kept in the ICNXTBLK unless there are more than two branches.

      If the branch is mis-predicted and not detected in the prediction then there are more than two branches in the same line with the mis-predicted branch.
      <br/>
      On Processor 500, there are two branch targets, if the branch mis-prediction matches one of the target, then the mis-prediction will update the same target.
      <br/>
      If the branch mis-prediction was not in the ICNXTBLK, then one of the two branch targets must be selected to be replaced.
      <br/>
      Information is needed with each of the line PC, the associated branch information from dispatching is:

      The FIROB returns the two branch target bits upon mis-prediction for replacement algorithm of the branch targets in the ICNXTBLK.
      <br/>
      The first priority for replacing the branch targets is non-taken.
      <br/>
      If both bits are set for the line of the mis-predicted branch, then random replacement based on the least significant bit of the address is used.

    <p num="399">
      Some processors use the successor index instead of the full address to limit the size of the array, the selected way for the successor index is known after the branch target is fetched from the Icache.
      <br/>
      Updating. the ICNXTBLK with successor index and selected way required dual-port RAM.
      <br/>
      With two targets per line of instructions, the current dual-port RAM cells implementation of the ICNXTBLK would make the ICNXTBLK array larger than the ICSTORE array.
      <br/>
      There are two cases of updating the branch targets: during pre-decoding of taken branch instruction and branch mis-prediction.
      <br/>
      On Processor 500, an extra branch holding register for branch mis-prediction and pre-decoding branch instruction will be implemented.
      <br/>
      The branch holding register should always be compared to the PC address and forward the data instead of reading from the ICNXTBLK.
      <br/>
      When the next branch mis-prediction occurs, the FIROB sends the logical address PC.
      <br/>
      The successor index, the way select, and branch predictor counts are latched inside the ICNXTBLK to write into the array at a later convenient time.
      <br/>
      Since the way prediction array is dual-ported, it should be updated immediately instead of keeping in the branch holding register.
      <br/>
      The branch holding register will update the last mis-predicted branch target to the ICNXTBLK as the ICFPC takes one cycle to calculate the new linear address from the logical address.
      <br/>
      Another condition to write the branch holding register into the ICNXTBLK array is when external fetch is started.
      <br/>
      With the branch holding register, the ICNXTBLK array can be single-ported which is less than half the size of the dual-ported array.
      <br/>
      The branch holding register includes the branch address which is used for comparison and forwarding of data, the successor index, the update branch predictor count after reading of the new target line.
      <br/>
      The branch address register resides in the ICFPC for comparison to the current fetch PC.
      <br/>
      If the mis-prediction is a RETURN instruction, only the target selection of the way prediction should be updated.
    </p>
    <p num="400">
      The branch predictor counters are kept in the global shift register.
      <br/>
      If the mis-prediction returns a valid branch tag, then the counters increase or decrease before latching in the branch holding register.
      <br/>
      If the mis-prediction does not have a valid branch tag, then the bimodal counter is used with 10.
      <br/>
      The global shift register should restore the proper branch pattern and the return stack should remove the cancelled CALL/RETURN instructions.
    </p>
    <heading>WAY PREDICTION</heading>
    <p num="401">
      Since the evaluation of the branch prediction takes two cycles which would create a bubble in the pipeline, the way-prediction is implemented for faster prediction.
      <br/>
      The way prediction predicts one of the 8-way associative will be hit, and uses the ICNXTBLK for the next fetch PC.
      <br/>
      The way-prediction is validated in the next cycle with the TAGHIT and the actual branch prediction.
      <br/>
      If the way is mis-predicted, a correct way will be selected for the 8-way latches in the ICPDAT and a new line will be fetched creating a bubble in the pipeline.
      <br/>
      Since the tag compare is not completed until the next clock cycle, the scanning logic should be done in parallel with the tag compare for optimal timing of fetching instruction.
      <br/>
      The scanning logic is implemented on all 8 ways pre-decode data and the outputs are selected by TAGHIT.
      <br/>
      With the way prediction, a single pre-decode data can be selected for scanning logic thus reducing the logic to one-eighth.
      <br/>
      The ICPDAT must implement a set of latches to keep the output data; in case of way mis-prediction, the correct data will be used for scanning logic in the next cycle.
      <br/>
      The branch prediction in the ICNXTBLK should be resolved in parallel with TAGHIT for the correct next line fetch in the third cycle.
      <br/>
      The instructions from the ICSTORE are not needed for aligning until the next clock cycle which will be selected by TAGHIT.
      <br/>
      The way select from branch prediction should be used to select the way instead of the way prediction.
      <br/>
      From branch prediction, there is no tag comparator for the upper address bits.
    </p>
    <p num="402">
      The way-predicting has 3 bits to mux the successor index and branch prediction from ICNXTBLK for accessing the Icache in the next cycle.
      <br/>
      Depending the current fetch PC's position, the way prediction can use one of the two branch targets or none for sequential.
      <br/>
      In order to access the next PC within a cycle, a target selection of 2 bits is needed.
      <br/>
      The target selection can also include the return stack option.
      <br/>
      The program for the target selection is:
      <br/>
      00--sequential,
      <br/>
      01--first branch target,
      <br/>
      10--second branch target,
      <br/>
      11--return stack.
    </p>
    <p num="403">
      The way prediction should provide the byte position of the return instruction so that the ICPDAT can invalidate all followed instructions.
      <br/>
      For speed, another 4 bits are needed to indicate the byte position pointer for the instruction after the taken branch instruction for ICPDAT.
      <br/>
      The ICPDAT can decode and invalidate the pre-decode data directly from this 4-bit branch pointer.
      <br/>
      If the 4-bit branch pointer is all zeros, no invalidation of the pre-decode data is needed.
    </p>
    <p num="404">
      The way prediction includes dual ported RPM cells because the information must be updated while reading data, the initial value for the way prediction should be the same mas the current PC's set.
      <br/>
      The way prediction is not known for updating until the next clock cycles or until the early decoding of the return instruction.
      <br/>
      For convenience, a holding way register is used for updating of the way prediction in the fifth ICLK.

      The way mis-prediction can be at two levels, the first level is the wrong predicted way and the second level is the wrong selected target.
      <br/>
      Way mis-prediction is from comparing the predicted way to the tag compares, a mis-prediction would have re-fetched the correct instruction line and a new fetch address as shown in case 1 of FIG. 15. If the way prediction is correct, the next level is the target selection mis-prediction, the recovery mechanism is shown in case 2 of FIG. 15. The return stack prediction is not known until ICLK4 to correct the fetch done in ICLK2, other target predictions are compared to the branch prediction in ICLK2 and re-fetch the next address in ICLK3 as shown in case 3 of FIG. 15.

      <br/>
      3 bits--for 8-way associative.

      4 bits--byte position.

      <br/>
      1 bit--valid target.
    </p>
    <p num="408">
      The least significant bits of the bimodal and predictor counters are dual ported for writing back the increment count after reading.
      <br/>
      For speculative prediction, the most significant bit of the counter should not change.
      <br/>
      The new value of the bimodal and predictor counters are speculative; if there is a branch mis-prediction, the corrected counters will be written from the branch holding register.
    </p>
    <p num="409">
      The ICNXTBLK also includes 2048 lines for way prediction which are dual ported:
      <br/>
      3 Way-prediction bits.
      <br/>
      2 Target-selection bits.
      <br/>
      4 Taken branch byte-position bits.
    </p>
    <p num="410">
      The global branch prediction includes 2048 lines of 2 global counters which is organized as 256 rows for 8-way associative.
      <br/>
      The least significant bit of the global counter is dual ported for reading and writing the speculative prediction in the next cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="411">
      The ICNXTBLK is organized as 4 sets of 64 rows by 256 columns, 2 sets of 64 rows by 196 columns including some dual-ported columns, 1 set of 64 rows by 128 dual-ported column, 1 set of 64 rows by 96 dual-ported columns, 1 set of 64 rows by 64 dual-ported columns, and 1 set of global counter array.
      <br/>
      Each of the first two sets consist of 2 * 4 bits of successor index.
      <br/>
      The next two sets consists of 2 * 4 bits of successor index and 2 * 4 bits of the byte position.
      <br/>
      The next two sets consists of 2 * 2 bits bimodal counter, 2 * 2 bits predictor counter, and 2 * 3 bits 8-way associative, the least significant bits of the counters are dual-port.
      <br/>
      The next set consists of 4 bits of way branch byte pointer.
      <br/>
      The last two sets consist of the 3 bits way-prediction and 2 bits target selection which are dual-ported RAM cells.
      <br/>
      The least significant bits of the counters are dual ported to be updated on every cycle.
      <br/>
      To minimize routing and implementation of the branch holding register, the same associated bits of the two branch targets should be laid out in two sets opposite each other.
      <br/>
      The branch successor index is selected by the way and target prediction to access the ICACHE in next clock cycle.
      <br/>
      Because of this speed-path in way prediction for reading the Icache in the next cycle, the array for ICNXTBLK is 64 rows instead of 128 rows as for the ICSTORE array.
      <br/>
      For optimal performance the layout of the column should be 32 RAM cells, pre-charge, 32 RAM cells, write buffer and senamp.
      <br/>
      The row decoder should be in the middle of the array to drive 96 or 112 column each way.
      <br/>
      Basically, the pre-charge and the row decoder should be crossed in the middle of the array.
      <br/>
      The self-time column is used to generate internal clock for each set of the array.
      <br/>
      Pre-charge is gated by ICLK.
      <br/>
      The ICNXTBLK has two different outputs; the first output in the first cycle is based on the way-prediction, and the second output in the second cycle is based on TAGHIT.
      <br/>
      If the two outputs do not select the same set or are not both non-taken, the reading of instruction in the second cycle will be invalidated, creating a bubble in the pipeline.
      <br/>
      The second output should be gated with TAGHIT and ICLK to be valid in the second cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="412">
      The branch holding register may be built into the ICNXTBLK array.
      <br/>
      This means that the bits of the two targets must be alternated in the array to access the branch holding register.
      <br/>
      The array may be skewed to accommodate the bits into a single array.
      <br/>
      The global branch counter is also implemented as the array in ICNXTBLK.
      <br/>
      The shift register and the branch tag for mis-prediction recovery are also implemented next to the array.

      For continuous instruction addresses, the Icache would be required to request for that IAD bus send the address to the MMU for re-translation before going external.
      <br/>
      Moving the instruction address latch and incrementor to the ABI block, the instruction address by default can be on the external address bus which can increase the performance of the DRAM access in burst mode.
      <br/>
      With this change, continuous instruction address request would be relatively simple since the Icache can make a request directly to the BIU without any handshaking for address.
      <br/>
      With a taken branch, the instruction address latch in ABI will be invalidated, and a new address must be sent to the MMU.
      <br/>
      The instruction address latch must have a detection for the page-boundary overflow (NAND gates for the lower bits of the address).

      The ICACHE uses linear address while the decode units use logical addresses.
      <br/>
      The code segment register is included in the ICFPC.
      <br/>
      The translation is either for 16-bit addressing or 32-bit addressing, and either real or protected mode.
      <br/>
      The code segment register includes:

      The Icache is accessed by using linear address while execution of branch instruction uses logical address.
      <br/>
      On Processor 500, these functions should be done in the ICFPC: calculating the linear address for a new fetch PC, checking for code segment limits, and calculating the logical PC address for dispatching new instructions to IDECODE.
    </p>
    <p num="478">
      For a mis-predicted branch, the Icache needs to write the branch holding register into the ICNXTBLK before accessing the cache with a new fetch PC.
      <br/>
      The linear address can be calculated in the Icache without any penalty in performance.
      <br/>
      The functional unit should send new logical address PC to the Icache directly.
    </p>
    <p num="479">
      Since Processor 500 does not have a BYTEQ, 4 * 86 instructions are scanned and dispatched directly to decode units; the PC of dispatched instructions is known for each clock cycle.
      <br/>
      The code segment limits checking should be done in the ICFPC and a violation status can be sent with the instruction to the decode unit.
      <br/>
      The ICFPC should keep both the logical and linear PC addresses for the 4 pipeline stages from fetching to muxing of instructions to decode units, the logical address is sent to the decode unit without any calculation.
    </p>
    <p num="480">Return Stack</p>
    <p num="481">
      The RETURN instruction should be detected in early decoding and fetch the next PC from return stack (the RETURN instruction will not be in the ICNXTBLK).
      <br/>
      It should be individually decoded in the early decode units.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the CALL instruction should also be detected in the early decode units to update the return stack.
      <br/>
      The CALL instruction pushes PC of the next instruction onto the stack which is the concatenation of the line PC and the ICPOSx(3:0).
      <br/>
      The return stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack.
      <br/>
      The return stack is implemented with a pointer to the top of the stack, and the pointer increases as a new entry is allocated for the CALL instruction.
      <br/>
      When the return stack is full, the stack is shifted down by one for the new CALL instruction, and the pointer should be at top of the stack.
      <br/>
      In another case, when both the call and return instructions of the same entry in the return stack are retired, the entry can be removed by shifting all entries down by one and the pointer decreases by one.
      <br/>
      The return stack must be recovered from branch mis-prediction.
      <br/>
      The mis-predicted RETURN instruction is difficult to handle, there are three possible cases.
      <br/>
      In the application program, the RETURN instruction can be fake which causes the return stack to be forever mis-predicted, the subroutine changes the return target in the stack pointer before executing the RETURN instruction, and the subroutine uses JMP instruction instead of RETURN instruction.
      <br/>
      For simplicity, the mis-predicted RETURN instruction will cause the return stack to be invalidated.
      <br/>
      Another condition for invalidating the return stack is from the CMASTER invalidating the Icache.
      <br/>
      For RETURN instruction after the mis-predicted branch instruction, the return stack should be able to recover.
      <br/>
      The current return stack is eight buffers, each buffer contains the call branch tag from the global shift register when the CALL instruction is dispatched, the return PC, the return branch tag, the call valid bit, the return valid bit, and the retired call valid bit.
      <br/>
      The best way to understand the recovery procedure is by the example of this sequence of instructions:

      The INT and IRET are similar to the CALL and RETURN instructions.

      The return stack needs to keep the PC and statuses for the INT and IRET.

      It is more often that the interrupt routine is from asynchronous interrupt and trap.
      <br/>
      The IRET executes without the previous INT.
      <br/>
      To avoid invalidating the entire return stack on mis-predicted IRET, two more status bits are needed.
      <br/>
      The IXC bit indicates that the entry is from INT or CALL instruction.
      <br/>
      The IRET pops only the top entry with IXC bit set, and the RETURN pops only the top entry with IXC bit reset.
      <br/>
      The ISTART bit indicates the starting point for INT routine.
      <br/>
      In the case of a mis-prediction on the IRET instruction, entries with ISTART bit set will be purged.
      <br/>
      The entries before the INT should not be affected by the mis-prediction from the interrupt routine.

      This block pre-decodes the instructions as they come in from the external memory or from the Icache if the start/end bits are confused.
      <br/>
      On Processor 500, the ICPRED is connected to the IB(127:0) to read the instructions from either pre-fetch buffer or Icache.
      <br/>
      For externally fetched instruction, the ICPRED starts from the fetched byte position.
      <br/>
      The ICPRED latches the instructions in the second ICLK as they are sent to the decode units.
      <br/>
      If the start/end bits are confused, then the ICPDAT sends the byte position of the invalid instruction to the ICPRED for pre-decoding.
      <br/>
      All pre-decode data before the confused instruction should remain in the ICPDAT array.
      <br/>
      The pre-decoding stops on two conditions: a taken branch is detected or valid start byte is detected after the end byte from pre-decoding; this condition should be detected in the ICPDAT.
      <br/>
      The ICPRED pre-decodes one instruction per two clock cycles plus an extra clock cycle for prefix.
      <br/>
      The pre-decode information includes the start-byte, end-byte, function-byte, and the branch prediction information.

      The ICPRED calculates the target address for the Unconditional Jump if possible.

      Otherwise, fetching is stalled until the target address is calculated in decoding or executing.

      If the split-line instruction (instruction started at the end of the first line and end in the next line) is also a predicted taken branch, then ICCNTL and ICPRED should provide control to write predecode data into the ICPDAT array in an extra cycle.
      <br/>
      ICPRED provides the start and end pointers as completion of pre-decoding of each instruction along with ENDINST.
      <br/>
      The functional bits are kept in ICPRED until completion of the line.
      <br/>
      ICPRED must continuously latch the new line from IB(127:0) in case of confused instruction, all functional bits should be cleared before pre-decoding.

      The pre-decode instruction should be sent directly to decode unit 0.
      <br/>
      The instruction has to go through early decoding before dispatching to the decode unit.
      <br/>
      During pre-decoding all the controls of sending the correct instruction from IB(127:0) to IB1(191:0) should be directly from ICPRED.
      <br/>
      The ICPRED controls the muxing between the 2 buses and the ICALIGN uses PDSHF(4:0) to read the instruction from the 8-byte of IB1 for the valid opcode, MODRM, and SIB bytes.

      The ICPRED must continue to decode instructions and fill up the bus IB1(191:0) of up to 4 instructions per 8-byte block.
      <br/>
      The ICALIGN keeps PDSHF(4:0) in ICnVAL(7:0) of each 8-byte block.
      <br/>
      Similar to ICPDAT, the information from the next stage in ICALIGN and MROM pipeline should be conveyed to this block.

    <p num="623">
      The ICPRED includes three blocks: one block (ICPREFIX) decodes the prefix, one block (ICDECINS) decodes the instruction, and one block (ICPREINS) sets up the pre-decode data.
      <br/>
      The ICPREFIX decodes up to 4 prefix bytes per clock cycle.
      <br/>
      The ICPREFIX is similar to the prefix decoding in the ICALIGN, and the same logic should be used.
      <br/>
      The ICPREFIX should combined the prefixes for dispatching to decode unit; this is to avoid an extra cycle if there are more than 4 prefixes.
      <br/>
      The ICDECINS accepts prefix status and 3 instruction bytes, the opcode, the MODRM, and the SIB.
      <br/>
      In the first cycle, no prefix is assumed.
      <br/>
      If prefix is detected in the ICPREFIX, the ICDECINS will restart the decoding of instruction with new prefix status and 3 new instruction bytes.
      <br/>
      If more prefixes are detected in subsequent cycle, the ICDECINS will restart with new information.
      <br/>
      After the decoding, the pre-decode information will be sent to the decode unit 0 and the latch in the ICPDAT, the ICALIGN will dispatch the instruction and pre-decode data to the first decode unit.
      <br/>
      The byte pointer moves to the next instruction and the procedure continues until the whole line is completed.
      <br/>
      The writing of the ICPDAT will be done when the whole line is decoded.
      <br/>
      The ICDECINS also decodes for branch instructions and sets up the two targets in the ICNXTBLK.
      <br/>
      The ICDECINS sends control to ICFPC for calculating the simple taken branch addresses: PC+displacement.
      <br/>
      The ICPRED includes local latches of 8 bytes for instruction which can wrap around to the next line.
      <br/>
      For instructions which are longer than 15 bytes, an exception is asserted to ICCNTL and decode units.
      <br/>
      The list of Processor 500 fast path instructions can be found below.
      <br/>
      The outputs of the ICPREFIX and ICDECINS are fed to ICPREINS for analyzing and setting up the pre-decode data.

      An extra pipeline stage is added on Processor 500 for early decoding of prefixes and generating two dispatched positions for a few instructions.
      <br/>
      To gain another half clock cycle for early decoding and dispatching of instructions to the decode units, the operand, flag, and un-conditional jump instruction (including CALL and RETURN) decoding can be done in early decoding.
      <br/>
      The unconditional branch instruction should be the last instruction in the line which should be compared to the branch information in the ICFPC.
      <br/>
      If the unconditional branch instruction was not recorded in the branch global shift register, then the ICFPC re-fetches from the target of the unconditional branch and corrects the branch tags in the branch global shift register.
      <br/>
      The CALL and RETURN instructions are necessary for setting the return stack.
      <br/>
      The operands and flags are sent directly to the register file and FIROB for accessing the data.

    <p num="649">
      Cycle 1--Fetch from the array, the ICPDAT starts the scanning, and the ICTAGV starts the tag comparison.

    <p num="650">Cycle 2--Complete the scanning of each individual 8-byte and align 7 bytes for each instruction to the early decoding.</p>
    <p num="651">Cycle 3--Multiplex the instructions to 4 early-decoding units (the scanning logic can send up to 8 instructions) and decode up to 5 prefixes and opcode for 2-dispatch positions instruction, and decode for the register operands, flags, CALL/RETURN instructions.</p>

      The dispatched instructions from the ICPDAT are in two 8-byte blocks and arrange into three 8-byte blocks for aligning.
      <br/>
      The ICALIGN must select the first 4 instructions to mux the instruction bytes to early decoding units.
      <br/>
      Each early decoding unit receives 7 bytes of instructions for the possibility of 4 prefix bytes, 1 opcode byte, 1 MODRM byte, and 1 SIB byte.
      <br/>
      Two conditions that can be detected early and fed back to the ICPDAT for accepting the next blocks of instructions are: the SIB-byte instruction, and the instruction with more than 4 prefixes.
      <br/>
      The other conditions for instructions with 2 dispatched positions take longer to detect.
      <br/>
      The pre-decoded functional bits provide useful information.
      <br/>
      In early decoding, the valid bits for the instruction should be used to qualify the valid bytes of the instructions.
      <br/>
      Refer to a previous section for encoding of the functional bit.
      <br/>
      For the first byte, indicated by the start bit, if the functional bit is 0, the instruction is MROM, if the functional bit is 1, the instruction is fast path.
      <br/>
      The encoding for the functional bits of MROM instruction is inverted that of the fast path instruction.
      <br/>
      If the first functional bit is 0, all functional bits are inverted before qualifying with the valid bits for prefix and opcode decoding.
      <br/>
      MROM instructions are handled in the MROM block.
      <br/>
      Detection of MROM is passed through the early decode unit and hold for micro-instructions from MROM.
      <br/>
      In addition, the functional bits should also be set for SIB-byte.
      <br/>
      The SIB-byte instruction takes two dispatched positions.
      <br/>
      ICALIGN needs to look at 2 bytes after the opcode byte for SIB-byte setting of the functional bit.
      <br/>
      The opcode byte can be detected the setting of the functional bits from the start bit.
      <br/>
      The logic can be as shown in FIG. 23.
    </p>
    <p num="678">Prefix Decoding</p>
    <p num="679">
      In early decode, 4 prefix decoding units are used for each prefix byte.
      <br/>
      All the prefixes are combined into a single encoded prefix for decode units.
      <br/>
      For each start bit, the ICALIGN logic looks at up to 7 functional bits at a time.
      <br/>
      The start and end bits are used to validate and qualify the functional bits for shifting and decoding of the instruction bytes.

      For more than 4 prefix bytes, an extra clock cycle is needed, after decoding the first 4 prefixes the instruction is shifted by 4 bytes and to decode the prefixes and opcode again.

      The extra prefixes will override the previous encoding of the same prefix.

      <br/>
      The list of 2-dispatch position instructions are: PUSH, POP, RETURN, CALL, MUL, IMUL, LOOP, JCXZ, JECXZ, and LEAVE.
      <br/>
      The above instructions have either two destination registers, or two load/store operations, or more than two input operands (not counting the immediate and displacement).
      <br/>
      The above instructions with SIB should go to MROM.
      <br/>
      PUSH from memory and POP to memory instructions can become register if the MOD field is 11.
      <br/>
      In this case, the PUSH from memory should take only one dispatch position, and the POP to memory should take 2 dispatch positions instead of going to MROM.

    <p num="691">Handling of Branch Instructions</p>
    <p num="692">
      For unconditional branch instructions, the branch is always taken, and the fetching should stall until the target address is known.
      <br/>
      There are three types of unconditional branch instructions, CALL/INT, RETURN/IRET, and unconditional jump.
      <br/>
      These branch instructions should be predicted taken.
      <br/>
      Processor 500 should implement a return stack, and as the CALL and INT instructions are in decode, the next instruction PC will be written into the return stack for future reference.
      <br/>
      The RETURN and IRET instructions will get the target address from the return stack, it is not necessary to keep the RETURN and IRET instructions in the ICNXTBLK.
      <br/>
      The target address calculation for non-conditional jump requires an adder to speculatively add the PC to displacement which is done in the ICFPC.
      <br/>
      The important features of the return stack are discussed in detail in ICFPC.

      <br/>
      The CALL instruction has the offset matched with the branch taken offset in the ICFPC.
      <br/>
      The RETURN and IRET are predicted by the way prediction.

      Only one taken branch is possible per instruction line.
      <br/>
      The ICALIGN notifies the ICFPC to send the PC's for each line dispatched to the decode units.
      <br/>
      Only one taken branch is allowed per 4 instructions sent to the decode units.
      <br/>
      The branch target address and the branch tag from the global shift register should be routed along with any branch instruction (include unconditional jump) to the FIROB in case of mis-prediction.

      The ICFPC always sends the current PC to FIROB and decode units.
      <br/>
      If there is an indication of the dispatching of instruction from a new 8-byte block, the next PC is sent.
      <br/>
      If the instruction of a new 8-byte block is to decode unit 0, then the next PC is sent as first PC, else the next PC is sent as second PC.
      <br/>
      The PC is 32-bits which indicates the full address of the instruction.

    <p num="698">
      With up to four instructions dispatched per clock cycle, eight possible read operands must be checked for data dependency.
      <br/>
      The FIROB checks for dependency against all previously dispatched instructions (up to 5 lines or 20 instructions) and within the current line.
      <br/>
      In the FIROB, the number of comparators are 20 by 8 for the 6-bit register operands.
      <br/>
      It is important to decode the register operands as soon as possible.
      <br/>
      Flags are in the same category with the operands which need early indication.
      <br/>
      Some of the X86 opcodes have implied references to registers and flags.
      <br/>
      The register operands are from MODRM byte.
      <br/>
      In early decoding, the registers are speculatively decoded and sent to dependency checking.
      <br/>
      In decode units, the direction and validation of the registers are decoded to set the statuses in the FIROB and control the issuing of operands to functional units.

      The decoding of the flags should be done in early decoding.
      <br/>
      The status flag information is from the appendix on FLAG CROSS-REFERENCE in the X86 manual.
      <br/>
      The instructions must provide the reading and writing of the status flags in the same manner as the operands.
      <br/>
      The flags are set up in three groups:
    </p>
    <p num="715">CF-carry flag.</p>
    <p num="716">OF-overflow, SF-sig, ZF-zero, PF-parity, AF-auxiliary carry, and DF-direction flags.</p>
    <p num="717">The rest of the control flags in the EFLAG register.</p>
    <p num="718">
      The-first two flag groups have dependency checking in the FIROB and forwarding in the reservation station.
      <br/>
      The second group is implemented with three sub-groups, OF, DF, and +SF, ZF, AF, and PF} (4F).
      <br/>
      The dependency checking of the second group is similar to that of the operand, if the dependency is wide-to-narrow then it is okay for forward, if the dependency is narrow-to-wide then the instruction stalls in decode units until the dependency is removed.
      <br/>
      The last flag group will stall the instruction in decode units if there is any dependency.
      <br/>
      The decoding of the status flags is as followed:

      To not effect the MODRM decoding for Processor 500 fast path, the microcode uses the prefix for extending the register field.

      The extended register field for microcode will be concatenated with the MODRM register field to address the full 64 register file.
      <br/>
      For Processor 500 fast path instruction, the extended register field is forced to zero.
      <br/>
      The MODRM, the displacement, and the immediate field can be read from the global decoding registers.

      <br/>
      During early decode, the displacement size and field is determined and read directly from the IB2(191:0) to the decode units.
      <br/>
      The immediate field is speculative of 4 bytes after the displacement field.
      <br/>
      Two-dispatch position instructions cause shifting of the next instructions to the next issue positions.

      If the instruction at 0 takes 2 dispatch positions, then only instruction at 1 is allowed to take 2 dispatch positions.
      <br/>
      The controls for reading of the displacement and immediate fields are shifted according to the 2-dispatch position instruction.

      The detection of the unconditional branch instruction are treated as mis-prediction to fetching a new instruction stream without updating the ICNXTBLK.

      It latches the inputs at the beginning of ICLK and generates control signals to the arrays for the next cycle by the end of ICLK.

      There are a few signals from the arrays, such as TAGHIT, to ICCNTL in early ICLK instead of previous phase.

      The state machine can be jammed into a certain state with late arriving signals from branch mis-prediction and branch prediction.

      If there is an instruction which wraps to the new line, writing of the last line into the ICPDAT and ICNXTBLK must wait for completion of pre-decoding of this wrapped instruction.

      Since the clock cycle is short, reading of the cache would take the whole clock to get data.
      <br/>
      The clock is single phase, and the array generates its own self time clock.

      The self-time clock uses the same cache column self-time line.

      As the line pre-charges to a high level, the pre-charge is disabled and the array access is enabled.

      As the line discharges, the row driver and senamp are disabled.

      In one embodiment, the pre-charge takes 1.7 ns and the current timing for TAGHIT from the self-time clock with 64 rows is 2.8 ns or a total time of 4.5 ns from rising edge of ICLK.

      The reading data is 2.0 ns from the self-time clock with 64 rows or 0.8 ns before the rising edge of ICLK.

    <p num="926">Overview of the Processor 500 Idecode</p>
    <p num="927">
      This section describes the instruction decode organization.
      <br/>
      The instruction decoding is directly for X86 instructions; there will be no ROPs except for a few instructions.
      <br/>
      The X86 variable-length instructions from the Icache are sent to the fixed-length decode units.
      <br/>
      Up to 4 instructions can be decoded and dispatched in one clock cycle.
      <br/>
      The decode units are identical.
      <br/>
      The operand and flag are decoded in the Icache for the critical speed path.
      <br/>
      The instruction decoding takes 2 clock cycles, in the first cycle the operand and flag dependency checking is done and multiplexed to the functional units in the second cycle.
      <br/>
      The operand addresses access the register file and the FIROB.
      <br/>
      The operand address includes the X86 registers and temporary registers generated by the MROM.
      <br/>
      The FIROB will have to check for dependencies.
      <br/>
      The instruction decoding generates direct controls to the operation of the functional unit, thus eliminating decoding in the functional units.
      <br/>
      The global controls of the decode units include a mechanism to stall the line due to serialization and limitations of the load/store buffers, the FIROB, and the reservation stations.
      <br/>
      The MROM interfacing is sent directly from the Icache and the MROM instructions go through the muxes in the Icache to decode units.
      <br/>
      A few exceptions for MROM instructions are special registers, floating point instructions, temporary registers, and serialization.
    </p>
    <p num="928">Top Level of Idecode</p>
    <p num="929">
      The Idecode has 4 identical decode units.
      <br/>
      The instructions from Icache and MROM have the same format.
      <br/>
      Operands and flags are decoded in the Icache or MROM before the instructions are dispatched to the decode units.
      <br/>
      The MROM may send the micro-instructions with simpler opcodes to the decode units.
      <br/>
      Decode units decode the micro-instructions separately and multiplex with fast-path instructions to functional units.
      <br/>
      Prefixes are pre-decoded and sent on separate buses.
      <br/>
      The format of instructions dispatched to the decode unit includes one encoded prefix byte, which may not be valid, speculative register operands and flags, 2-dispatch position control bits, 11-bit opcode, 3-bit constant, up to 4 bytes of displacement, and 4 bytes of immediate field.
      <br/>
      Since the Icache validates and partially decodes the instructions before sending to the decode units, a valid bit is issued by the Icache for valid instructions.
      <br/>
      If the valid is not set, the instruction is dispatched as NOOP.
      <br/>
      For 2-dispatch position instructions, the indication from Icache causes the decoding of the same instruction to two issue positions.
      <br/>
      Idecode has 2 clock cycles, the first cycle is for register file accessing and FIROB dependency checking, and the second cycle is for operand steering of the operands and dependency tags to the functional units.
      <br/>
      The opcode decoding takes 2 clock cycles to generate detail control signals for the functional units.
      <br/>
      Since the register operands and the immediate field are speculative, the opcode decoding is needed for validation and indication of the direction for the operands and the size of the immediate field if any.
      <br/>
      The immediate field should be sign-extended as it is sent to the functional unit.
    </p>
    <p num="930">
      To handle the PC properly, the Icache provides 2 PC's for each set of dispatched instructions per clock cycle.
      <br/>
      The first case is when the instructions cross the page boundary, and the second case is when the branch target instruction is dispatched along with the branch instruction.
      <br/>
      The limitations for branch in each 4 instructions are one taken branch instruction and two branches per line.
    </p>
    <p num="931">The Idecode can be divided into 4 blocks:</p>
    <p num="932">Opcode decoding for functional unit which can be done in 2 clock cycles.</p>
    <p num="933">Opcode decoding for registers and immediate field, generating controls for the operands and flags, and selecting the target address for branch instruction to reservation stations which should be done in 1 clock cycles.</p>

      The instruction decoding has 1.5 clock cycles for decoding, thereby allowing time to route the output to functional units.
      <br/>
      The output is a wide bus with direct commands for the functional units to execute the instruction.
      <br/>
      The current listing for functional unit includes 3-bit protocol, 6-bit opcode, 7-bit p/g for alu, 3-bit size, 4-bit segment register select, and 3-bit flag.
      <br/>
      Except for the p/g for alu, all other control bits for the functional unit must be further decoded into single-bit control.
      <br/>
      The size and segment register select are decoded in a later section.
      <br/>
      The listing of the actual binary is done by going through the X86 instruction one-by-one.

      In general, writing to special registers and cache array causes serialization after dispatching of the instruction.
      <br/>
      Reading of special register and cache array does not cause serialization.
      <br/>
      Cache array access is from MROM instructions for testing and debugging purposes.
      <br/>
      Most special register access is also from MROM instructions; few MOVE instructions specify the special register directly.
      <br/>
      Serialization is a major degradation in performance.
      <br/>
      Implementation of a special register buffer in the load/store section reduces the serialization as will be discussed in a later section.
      <br/>
      For special register access, the destination register of the instruction is the indication of special register (not a real register in the register file), the special register address and control information are encoded in the immediate field of the MROM instruction.
      <br/>
      The functional unit will pass the immediate field directly to the special register buffer.
      <br/>
      The immediate field is decoded in the special register to generate read/write to the appropriate special register or cache array.
      <br/>
      Fast-path instruction which read/write to the special register must provide the same format in the immediate field as the MROM to the functional unit.
    </p>
    <p num="1037">
      The prefix of the instruction is decoded during fetching.
      <br/>
      The segment register override is encoded as a prefix byte.
      <br/>
      The MROM instruction provides the ES reference for the string operation.
      <br/>
      All accesses to segment registers must be detected in decoding to generate controls to the load/store section.
      <br/>
      The percentage of writing to some segment register is significant to the performance of Processor 500.
      <br/>
      To further reduce the penalty of serialization due to the writing of segment registers, control signals and dependency status bits are generated.
      <br/>
      In the next section, a detailed implementation of this technique is discussed.
    </p>
    <p num="1038">
      The floating point unit is implemented as a co-processor.
      <br/>
      The MROM provides the same format for the floating point instructions in 4 issue positions.
      <br/>
      The first three issue positions are for the possible 80-bit load/store access of the floating point instructions.
      <br/>
      For 32-bit or 64-bit floating point operations, the issue position is filled with NOOP.
      <br/>
      The last issue position is the actual opcode of the floating point instruction.
      <br/>
      The floating point opcode is in the immediate field of the MROM instruction.
      <br/>
      Idecode treats the floating point instruction as a special register instruction; the immediate field is passed from special register block to the floating point unit.
      <br/>
      The floating point unit latches and loads data from the LSSEC and send the store data through the functional unit to the LSSEC.
    </p>
    <p num="1039">Special-Register Instructions</p>
    <p num="1040">
      There are two types of special-register (SR) instructions.
      <br/>
      One is for testing/debugging purpose, and the other is for normal execution.
      <br/>
      The testing/debugging SR instructions are for the cache arrays, it is not important to speed up these instructions.
      <br/>
      Implementation of the serialized instruction is as followed:
    </p>
    <p num="1041">SR instructions can be issued from any dispatch position.</p>
    <p num="1042">The SR address is sent to the functional unit in the Immediate field.</p>
    <p num="1043">Read from SR instructions are not serialized.</p>
    <p num="1044">
      Up to 4 SR instructions can be in execute.
      <br/>
      The load/store special register (LSR) buffer has 4 entries.
      <br/>
      The LSR buffer is global to both the SRB and LSR.
      <br/>
      Idecode will communicates with the LSR to allocate an entry when a SR instruction is dispatched.
      <br/>
      This is the same implementation as with the load/store buffer.
    </p>
    <p num="1045">
      Write to SRs except to DS, GS, ES, and FS are serialized.
      <br/>
      The serialization is to dispatch the write to SR instruction, stall all other instructions, and wait for LSR to notify the completion of the instruction.
      <br/>
      The write to LSR instruction must execute in program order (same as STORE instructions)
    </p>
    <p num="1046">
      Write to DS, GS, ES, and FS instruction sets a dependency bit for each of the four segment register when dispatching.
      <br/>
      Four global WRxS signals to all functional units indicate the write to the segment register is outstanding.
      <br/>
      The LSR will reset the dependency bit and clear WRxS from execution of the write to SR instruction.
      <br/>
      Any read to DS/GS/ES/FS instruction after the write will have a status read dependency bit (RD_DEP_xS).
      <br/>
      Instructions with RD_DEP_xS set, must wait in reservation station until WRxS is cleared.
      <br/>
      The read to GS/ES/FS instruction includes (1) Prefix segment override, (2) Move from segment register, and (3) String operation (ES only).
      <br/>
      The string operation will have indication from MROM.

      <br/>
      There are a few exceptions where global control is needed.
      <br/>
      With the extra pipeline stage before the alignment, some decoding of the instructions is done before sending to the decode units.
      <br/>
      Early decoding includes MROM instruction, SIB-byte instruction, 2-dispatch position instructions, multi-prefix instruction, and branch taken instructions.
      <br/>
      During decoding, partial dispatching of a line can happen for serialization, dependency, and move-to-special-register.
      <br/>
      Conditions to halt the line of instructions before dispatching to the functional units in the next ICLK are the reservation stations full, the FIROB full, and the Load/Store buffer full.
      <br/>
      These halt conditions will stop the pipeline in the decoder from advancing.
      <br/>
      For serialization, the instructions can occupy the entries in the FIROB and wait for ROBEMPTY to dispatch the instructions to functional units.
      <br/>
      Most of the serialization conditions is provided by the MENG, few serialized instructions must be decoded from fast-path instructions.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      Instructions may be partially dispatched, the FIROB invalidates instructions from the narrow-to-wide dependency.
      <br/>
      The Idecode invalidates instructions before the narrow-to-wide dependency and re-issues the instructions to FIROB.

    <p num="1070">Handling of Load/Store Instructions</p>
    <p num="1071">
      The load/store section implements a finite size load/store buffer.
      <br/>
      There would be cases that the buffer is full and creates a stall in functional units.
      <br/>
      To avoid stalling in the functional units, the decode will not dispatch the current line of instructions if there is not enough space in the load/store buffer to handle the load/store instructions of the current line.
      <br/>
      The decode units have more time to make this decision than the functional units.
    </p>
    <p num="1072">
      At dispatch, the decode units send the load/store information to the load/store section.
      <br/>
      The information includes the current FIROB line, data dependency tags, and load/store type LSTYPE(1:0):
      <br/>
      00: No load/store
      <br/>
      01: Load operation

      10: Store operation

      11: Both Load and Store operations
    </p>
    <p num="1073">
      If the instruction has a memory reference, then the load/store type should be set.
      <br/>
      The linear address and/or data will be sent to the load/store buffer from the functional units or reservation station at a later time.
      <br/>
      The load/store buffer allocates entries for the dispatched instructions.
      <br/>
      The store operation should get a slot in the load/store buffer and the load instruction increases a counter to keep track of the number of load in the executing stage.
      <br/>
      A 3-bit count is sent to the decode units to indicate the number of empty entries in the load/store buffer.
      <br/>
      The decode units will dispatch a line of instructions only if the number of load/store instructions in the line is less than or equal to the empty entries in the load/store buffer.

    <p num="1086">Dispatch and Issue Logic</p>
    <p num="1087">
      For this section, dispatch means sending a new set of up to four pseudo-opcodes with their tags and operands to the operand steering unit and then to the reservation station.
      <br/>
      Issue means sending the source operands to the FNCU for execution.
      <br/>
      The term pseudo-opcode is used since fast path x86 instructions are sent as either one or two side by side pseudo-opcodes.
      <br/>
      Each pseudo-opcode is further sub-divided into two vectors (a type of mini-opcode).
      <br/>
      Both vectors have access to the same four data busses +Aop(31:0), Bop(31:0), Disp(31:0), and Const(3:0)} but use the data differently depending on which reservation station protocol that the reservation station entry has.
      <br/>
      There are a total of three reservation station entries.
      <br/>
      Every pseudo-opcode is one dispatch position that carries an identification or DTAG denoted by the FIROB line number and entry number that will become its destination.
      <br/>
      Only the FIROB line number needs to be carried around since the entry number will correspond to a fixed dispatch position from 0 to 3.
      <br/>
      DTAG (destination tags) can only be 0-- 0 to 5-- 3 which represents four dispatch positions and six FIROB lines.
    </p>
    <p num="1088">Allocation and Dispatch</p>
    <p num="1089">
      Once the opcode has been dispatched to a reservation station (station 0, 1, or 2), the station then watches the result bus tags for the remaining operands that will be forwarded to it.
      <br/>
      Issue from the reservation stations to the functional units can be done out of order on Processor 500.
      <br/>
      The oldest opcode (in program order) which has all of its operands will be issued to the functional unit and the functional unit cannot stall.
      <br/>
      The decoder/dispatcher communicates with the FPU, LSSEC, and SRB, and FIROB and will stall if a new opcode( ready to be dispatched) has no place to go.
      <br/>
      As an example, when all six FIROB lines are allocated or when all eight LSSEC entries are allocated, the dispatcher must stall.
    </p>
    <p num="1090">
      Opcodes, tags, and operands for the reservation stations are always dispatched into RS2.
      <br/>
      Issue to the functional unit can then come from RS2, RS1, or RS0.
      <br/>
      When a another opcode is dispatched into RS2, the previous opcode in RS2 is shifted down to RS1.
      <br/>
      If an opcode was in RS1, it would in turn be shifted to RS0.
    </p>
    <p num="1091">Reservation Station Sub-Blocks</p>
    <p num="1092">
      The reservation station logic (per dispatch/issue position) is divided into a control sub-block named RSCTL and three reservation stations named RS2, RS1, and RS0.
      <br/>
      Opcodes, tags, and operands are only dispatched to RS2, while any of the reservation stations can issue to the FNCU.
      <br/>
      If an operation gets all of its operands from the REGF and FIROB data section and has no higher priority requests in the reservation stations before it, it can go from the operand steering section directly to the FNCU for evaluation; otherwise, the operation waits in the reservation station until its operands are forwarded to it.
      <br/>
      The entry being issued to the FNCU is driven on a set of tristate busses.
      <br/>
      Another set of tristate busses is used by the Multiplier for source operands.
      <br/>
      These tristate busses (SAOPND and SBOPND) are shared by all four reservation block positions, and a multiplier request/grant protocol determines which position drives them.
    </p>
    <p num="1093">
      The RSCTL decides which operations end up in which reservation stations.
      <br/>
      A set of operands will stay in their current reservation station entry unless they are shifted to the next entry or sent to the FNCU for evaluation.
      <br/>
      No attempt is made to keep all operations pushed up against one side or the other of the reservation station chain.
      <br/>
      A block diagram of reservation station logic is shown as FIG. 29. A timing diagram for the reservation stations is shown as FIG. 30.

    <p num="1094">Reservation Station Protocols</p>
    <p num="1095">Various protocols are used to indicate how the reservation station should use the two vectors stored in the VCBS (vector control bit store) section of the FNCU and which operands are needed.</p>

      Sometimes incorrect data will be sent by the Dcache or the LSSEC.
      <br/>
      The reservation station will resend the cancelled cycle after the correct data comes from the data cache in the case of a hit in a mispredicted way.
      <br/>
      When the DCUNPAHIT or DCUNPBHIT (Dcache hit in unpredicted way) signal is detected, the R_VALID status is changed to an R_NONE status by the FNCU and the reservation station will latch in the correct data next cycle.
      <br/>
      The correct data from an unpredicted way will have to wait one extra cycle to be issued since the reservation station has already prioritized another entry for issue.
      <br/>
      DCUNPAHIT and DCUNPBHIT correspond to Dcache results for the data on LSRES0 and LSRES1 respectively.
      <br/>
      A Dcache miss is detected when valid tags match on LSTAGO bus but no DCUNPAHIT or DCPRPAHIT is detected.
      <br/>
      The DCUNPBHIT and DCPRPBHIT signals are for the LSTAG1 bus status.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC uses a similar protocol for miss only by sending the LSCANFWD signal which indicates that the forwarded data was incorrect.
      <br/>
      When load data is received on the LSRES bus, the reservation station keeps the corresponding entry for a cycle after it is issued to the FNCU and checks to see if its tags needed to be set again for the miss condition.
      <br/>
      Keeping the reservation station entry valid for an extra cycle is not needed in the case of an FPU load linear address calculation.
      <br/>
      The FPU reservation station must be responsible for detecting and handling the incorrect load data conditions.
      <br/>
      Another side note is that AHBYTE data is not sent back to bits 15:8 for "store" data.
    </p>
    <p num="1102">SRB, FPU, and MULT handling</p>
    <p num="1103">
      SRB opcodes look like a move instruction with the exception that a STAT_SRB signal is asserted to let the LSSEC know the 32 bit value needs to be latched into the 4 entry SRB file.
      <br/>
      FPU opcodes go to uCode and get dispatched on a single FIROB line which uses the first three positions for calculating linear addresses and the last position for the entry point into the Fcode (FPU microcode).
      <br/>
      FPU entry points are sent directly from dispatch to the FPU.
    </p>
    <p num="1104">
      Each of the four dispatch positions can send a multiply request signal to the multiplier unit, and wait to see which position receives a grant signal.
      <br/>
      Once a reservation station position has the grant it can use the SAOPND and SBOPND busses to send its sources to the multiplier.
      <br/>
      It also starts counting three cycles.
      <br/>
      Nothing except a DTAG, valid status, and a selection signal are sent to the FNCU at the end of the count.
      <br/>
      The multiply result will be multiplexed onto the FNCU's RES bus.
      <br/>
      If two results are going to be written by the multiplier, the reservation station that gets the multiplier grant will send a count start signal to the (I+1) reservation station position.
      <br/>
      After four cycles the (I+1) reservation station will finish its count and let the second multiply result pass onto the RES bus for it's FNCU.

    <p num="1117">Operand Steering</p>
    <p num="1118">
      The operand steering sections purpose is to give an extra cycle to gather source data together for the reservation station or functional unit and to provide time to decode opcodes into two vectors of fully decoded control signals for the functional unit.
      <br/>
      Since several units may be sending data/tags to the operand steering block at the same time, the operand steering section uses the following priority: 1) tags, 2) FIROB data, 3) REGF.
      <br/>
      The incoming data for the two sources may also be in the incorrect position, and the operand steering section will need to swap the sources to the correct positions for the A and B operands.
      <br/>
      The operand steering section will also need to detect any forwarding and have RS2 latch in the forwarded data.
      <br/>
      The operand steering section cannot issue directly to the functional unit while using forwarded data.
      <br/>
      Reservation station entries however can be issued to the functional unit while forwarded busses arrive at the FNCU inputs at the same cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="1119">Tag Bus</p>
    <p num="1120">
      The ATAG and BTAG busses are used for renaming when the actual operand value is not available to be sent to the reservation station.
      <br/>
      The tag takes the form of three bits representing the FIROB line.
      <br/>
      The entry position on the FIROB line is understood by the physical placement of each operand steering section.
      <br/>
      Since each functional unit only drives its own dedicated result bus, the reservation stations compare for the FIROB line value on the three bits of the corresponding result bus The tag entry on a given FIROB line is known by the physical placement of the FNCU and its dedicated result bus.
      <br/>
      The only exception is data for the LSRES1 and LSRES0 busses; the tag of the entry that made the load request is driven on the LSTAG0 or LSTAG1 busses.
      <br/>
      For example when the operation for FIROB line 2 entry 3 is waiting on the LSSEC for the load data, it will compare both the LSRES0 and LSRES1 busses for the 010-- 11 tag.
      <br/>
      Instead of watching for a tag from another FNCU, the reservation station is watching its own tag to be sent along with load data from the LSSEC.
    </p>
    <p num="1121">Vector Generation for the Vector Bit Control Store (VBCS)</p>
    <p num="1122">
      During the operand steering cycle, the two vectors per dispatch position entry will be generated.
      <br/>
      The FNCU does not have time to decode an opcode, execute the opcode, and generate flags in one cycle.
      <br/>
      The opcode generation has been pushed back in to the operand steering section while the flag generation has been pushed out to the cycle after execution.
      <br/>
      A seven bit opcode comes from decode to the operand steering section along with five bits of reservation station control protocol.
      <br/>
      This information and some other signals such as size, ahbyte, etc. are used by the operand steering section to generate the two vectors.
      <br/>
      Sometimes the first vector will be used for linear address generation while the second is used for the actual opcode.
      <br/>
      For the divide opcodes there will be a division direction signal held locally at the FNCU0.
      <br/>
      This signal determines when to use vector0 (ADD) or vector1 (SUB).

    <p num="1131">Functional Unit (FNCU)</p>
    <p num="1132">
      This section covers the functional unit (FNCU) which contains the ALU, branch evaluation, and shifter.
      <br/>
      The six sub blocks of the FNCU are the CBVS (control bit vector store), the OPSEL (operand selection and alignment), the ALU (for logical and arithmetic operations), the SHFT (shifter), the FLGCC (flag generations, branch/condition code evaluation), and the MXDVR (output multiplier, alignment, and drivers).
      <br/>
      An overview of basic flow (shown in FIG. 31) is that all opcode, tag, and operand information goes to the operand steering section where the appropriate information is determined and driven onto the A operand, B operand, A tag, B tag, and other busses.
      <br/>
      Also some decode is done in the operand steering section for such information as the P and G bits for the given opcode.
      <br/>
      The operand steering section drives RS2 of the reservation station block.
      <br/>
      Reservation station control logic latches in tags at the beginning of the cycle, compares to determine if forwarding can be done, and prioritizes which reservation station will drive the FNCU.
      <br/>
      At the beginning of the next cycle the DTAG for the opcode to be executed that cycle is driven out to allow other reservation stations to forward during the following cycle.
      <br/>
      Then a short delay is given to allow the latched in MUX controls, the P and G bits, and other input information to set up the adder or shifter.
      <br/>
      Then if needed, the B operand can be aligned (bits 15:8 to 7:0, or scaled 1 * ,2 * ,4 * ,8 * ) or complemented.
      <br/>
      The execution (add, and, shift, etc) then takes place, and the output of the adder is driven ASAP for bits 14:0 to the RESLA bus.
      <br/>
      Two control bit vectors can be used by each entry in the reservation station.
      <br/>
      These vectors come from decoding logic in the operand steering block and the Idecode block.
      <br/>
      For example one vector could be for linear address calculation while the second is for the actual operation.
      <br/>
      Another example is that one vector could represent an ADD while the other represents a SUB and the division direction flag would be used to choose the vector to use.
      <br/>
      The FDRES bus drives (with minimum capacitive load) to the input MUXes of the FNCUs.
      <br/>
      The FDRES bus also is buffered to become the RES (result) bus which goes to the reservation stations (not for immediate forwarding), LSSEC, and the FIROB data block.
    </p>
    <p num="1133">
      Branch evaluations are performed in the FNCU with a branch address being generated along with a branch status.
      <br/>
      Logical load/store address are calculated in the FNCU and sent out on the LSSEC bus (also RESLA) bus with a corresponding encoding on the status bus to identify them.
      <br/>
      Multiply operands are sent from the reservation station onto the A operand and B operand busses and then onto the shared tristate SAOPND and SBOPND busses (shared A operand) to the multiplier and the floating point unit.
    </p>
    <p num="1134">
      RFLAGs (result flags: +ZF,AF,PF,SF,DF,OF}) are generated the during the cycle following the execution of the corresponding opcode.
      <br/>
      The carry flag +CF} is generated the same cycle that the result gets generated.
      <br/>
      A block diagram of a functional unit is shown as FIG. 32.

    <p num="1135">Basic Flow of Operands to the FNCU</p>
    <p num="1136">
      This section will cover the general flow of operands meeting up with their opcodes.
      <br/>
      For more detailed descriptions, refer to the sections on operand steering and on dependency checking.
      <br/>
      Forwarding is used here to indicate that a unit other than the FIROB has watched the DTAG busses and LSTAG busses for a renamed value (eg: EAX renamed to DTAG=2-- 0) and latched the value off of the corresponding result bus.
      <br/>
      The operand steering blocks, the 12 reservation stations, and the FNCU can all receive data by forwarding; the multiplier cannot.
      <br/>
      In some cases such as receiving load data from the LSRES busses, both the FNCU and the reservation station can receive the forwarded data.
      <br/>
      The FNCU will execute the opcode using the forwarded data, and the reservation station that issued that opcode would hold the entry for an extra cycle just in case a miss or way_misprediction signal comes back.
      <br/>
      In the following example, the B, C, and D instructions are all waiting for data that is generated by the A instruction.

      The B instruction uses forwarding to get the operand steering section to receive the EAX result from the A instruction.
      <br/>
      The C instruction gets its EAX data from the FIROB, and the D instruction gets its EAX data from the REGF.
      <br/>
      The "A" result tags are driven through cycle 3 so that any other reservation stations or the operand steering section can detect BTAG=1-- 0 and latch the "A" result value at the end of cycle 3.
      <br/>
      No "A" result tag information is being broadcast in cycle 4, so the C instruction cannot receive EAX by forwarding.
      <br/>
      This example assumes that the FIROB is writing back every cycle; otherwise, the D instruction would also get its EAX data from the FIROB if EAX had not been written back yet.
      <br/>
      The operand steering must have tag compare logic inside it to get the EAX operand.

    <p num="1146">
      This sub-block is used for calculating linear addresses needed by the LSSEC, performing comparisons, and for computing arithmetic operations.
      <br/>
      Operations such as DAA, DAS, AAA, AAS, AAM, and AAD will be done in microcode and will not receive direct support from the ALU except maybe for flag handling.
      <br/>
      The adder uses propagates and generates which are setup in the reservation stations based on the type of operation.
    </p>
    <p num="1147">Shifter Sub Block</p>
    <p num="1148">
      The FNCU contains a barrel shifter which shifts the A operand by the amount indicated on the B operand.
      <br/>
      This unit handles bit manipulation instructions, counting leading zeroes/ones, and shifts and rotates.
      <br/>
      RCL and RCR by one is handled but microcode is used for RCL and RCR by more than one.
      <br/>
      There is a SHFT block which contains the data path portion of the shifter while the control logic is contained along with the ALU control logic in the FNCUCTL block.
      <br/>
      The output of the shifter has tristate drivers which drive the result bus.
      <br/>
      At the beginning of the cycle the opcode type is latched in from the reservation station and this information is used to decide if the ALU or the SHFT block will drive the result bus.
    </p>
    <p num="1149">Branch Evaluation</p>
    <p num="1150">
      For branch instructions, the EIP value is sent on the A operand bus while the relative jump value is sent on the displacement bus.
      <br/>
      The B operand bus is used for the predicted address.
      <br/>
      For "jump near indirect" the jump address is the r/m16 or r/m32 loaded into the EIP.
      <br/>
      The control section of the functional unit evaluates whether the condition codes and the forwarded flags result in a branch taken or not taken.
      <br/>
      The same logic is also used for the SETcc opcode.
      <br/>
      Branch prediction information is sent by the branch prediction unit to the dispatch unit and then to the IFCORE.
      <br/>
      Four different cases for conditional branches are handled.

    <p num="1157">
      This block muxes the output data from either the adder, shifter, exception vector, or the MULTFP bus (for FNCU0).
      <br/>
      The linear address calculation uses the adder.
      <br/>
      Some bits, RESLAn(14:5), for the linear address are sent out to the data cache early while the entire result goes out on FDRESn(31:0) at the end of the cycle.
      <br/>
      The purpose of the FDRESn bus is to forward quickly to the input MUXes of all four functional units.
      <br/>
      RESn is a buffered version of FDRESn which is less time critical than FDRESn.
      <br/>
      The RESn bus drives the LSSEC, the FIROB, and all of the reservation stations.
      <br/>
      To determine which sub-block will be MUXed onto the FDRES bus, the opcode group indicator, the multiply request (also MULH mnemonic), exception information, linear address indication, and branch information are used.
    </p>
    <p num="1158">Condition Flags Sub Block</p>
    <p num="1159">
      Three flag groups are defined as follows: +CF}, +OF,ZF,SF,AF,PF,DF}, and +TF,IF,IOPL,NT,RF,VM,AC,VIF,VIP,ID}. These flags are generated during the next cycle after the FNCU executes.
      <br/>
      The carry flag will simply be the carry out from cell 31, 15, or 7 based on operand size.
      <br/>
      For the case of a subtract opcode, the carry flag is used to represent the borrow and is the inverted bit from the bit 31, 15, or 7 carry out.
      <br/>
      The parity flag is the even parity on the lowest byte which requires about 2*Order(log2n)=6 gate levels.
      <br/>
      The sign flag is a mux of the highest order bit (31, 15, or 7).
      <br/>
      These flags are latched by the FIROB at the beginning of the next cycle and also forwarded to any FNCU looking for them.
      <br/>
      The dependency checking will be done individually on each of the three groups.
      <br/>
      The first two flag groups allow forwarding of the results while the last group will require serialization when a dependency is detected.
      <br/>
      The reservation station receives an early use signal from decode which corresponds to the two flag groups.
      <br/>
      This means that for a given opcode which is sitting in a reservation station entry and waiting on flags, an early use entry can issue the cycle right after the flag match is detected.
      <br/>
      Any other reservation station entry must wait an additional cycle before issuing to the functional units.
      <br/>
      The additional cycle is because the flags are generated the cycle after the functional unit executes.
      <br/>
      For instructions like ADC, the carry flag will be needed at the beginning of the cycle.
      <br/>
      For instructions like jump, the flags and condition codes start evaluating during the middle of the cycle.
      <br/>
      The conditional jumps, MOVCC, and SETCC opcodes get their flags forwarded during mid-cycle while all others wait until the beginning of one additional cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="1160">
      In addition to the standard EFLAGS register (EFLAGS0) there is also a scratch EFLAGS register (EFLAGS1) for microcode.
      <br/>
      The FNCU knows nothing about these two different EFLAGS registers.
      <br/>
      It simply gets forwarded flag data off the RFLAGSn busses or off its flag input bus.
      <br/>
      The cycle after every opcode execution, the flags block generates a complete set of flags according to the flag equations mnemonics generated by the IDECODE.
    </p>
    <p num="1161">
      The flag section also takes the B operand (predicted branch address) and compares it the result (EIP+d32).
      <br/>
      If the two are equal for a branch evaluation, the ZF (zero flag) is set during the next cycle.
      <br/>
      If the ZF is not set, then the FIROB knows that for a predicted branch taken and actual branch taken case, the IFETCH did not branch to the correct address.

    <p num="1165">Method of Sending Data Cache Linear Addresses to LSSEC</p>
    <p num="1166">
      The FNCU can be used to calculate a linear address using the displacement bus and either the A or B operand bus.
      <br/>
      The result is sent to the LSSEC using the RES bus.
      <br/>
      This assumes that a segment with no offset is being used.
      <br/>
      When the segment offset needs to be added in, the LSSEC handles the segment offset addition.
      <br/>
      AXBnLAC lets the functional unit know if the AOPND or BOPND bus will be added to the displacement bus.
      <br/>
      RQnLAC indicates that the functional unit is performing a linear address calculation.
      <br/>
      In the case of �EAX� Which has no displacement, the decode block will have sent a zero constant on the displacement bus.
    </p>
    <p num="1167">Linear address calculations will be handled as follows:</p>
    <p num="1168">
      1) SIB will be mapped to two dispatch positions such that the first one adds the base with the scaled index; this result goes to the second dispatch position which operates like a regular opcode but gets results from the first (eg: OPCODE �1st_result+d32�,r32.
      <br/>
      The reason for dividing the SIB into two opcodes is to get dependency checking performed on three source operands.
    </p>
    <p num="1169">
      2) All other linear address calculations (one forwarded variable and one displacement) go to the reservation station where they wait for the forwarded variable.
      <br/>
      Then for a Load or Load followed by store, the reservation station keeps its information with the forwarded variable and displacement go to the functional unit to be added.
      <br/>
      Then the result bus is used to send the Load linear address to the LSSEC.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC must be able to latch one linear address from each functional unit during a cycle.
      <br/>
      Dispatch/decode makes sure that no more than 8 loads and stores are pending at any one time.
      <br/>
      If a non-zero segment offset is present, four adders are used in the LSSEC to complete the calculation from logical to linear address.
    </p>
    <p num="1170">3) For a Load and Store, once the Load linear address is calculated by the functional unit this linear address is both saved for the subsequent store and also sent to the LSSEC for the Load.</p>
    <p num="1171">
      In the case of a load, the reservation station remains valid and waits for the LSSEC to return the data.
      <br/>
      The status bus indicates whether the RES bus contains an FOSTAT_NONE, FOSTAT_LD, etc.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC can do Loads in any order but also checks them with the Store buffer (in parallel) for any dependencies.
      <br/>
      DTAG Information is sent from the decode/dispatch directly to the LSSEC to indicate the true store order, since the functional units (FNCU) may give stores to the LSSEC in out of order sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="1172">
      The typical flow for forwarding from a Load-OP instruction followed by an operation only instruction is shown.
      <br/>
      Note that after the BTAG changes from its original value (don't care for this case) to the DTAG value of its opcode.
      <br/>
      When the LSSEC sends back the data the DTAG of the receiving opcode will be on the LSTAG bus.

    <p num="1174">Push/Pop Linear address calculations will be handled as follows:</p>
    <p num="1175">
      For a PUSH, the first vector will subtract 2h or 4h from the ESP and the result will be both latched by the FIROB as the new ESP and latched by the LSSEC as the store linear address.
      <br/>
      The second vector is a move of some register (passes through the FNCU) to the LSSEC, and to memory.
      <br/>
      A push memory will require two dispatch positions (see reservation station document for more details).
    </p>
    <p num="1176">
      For a POP, two dispatch positions are always required because there are two register destinations that must be updated.
      <br/>
      Vector 0 of the first dispatch position passes the ESP value through the FNCU and the LSSEC latches it as a load linear address.
      <br/>
      The reservation station waits for the load data to be returned and uses the next vector to pass the load through the FNCU and onto the RES bus where the FIROB latches it and eventually writes it back to a the correct register.
      <br/>
      The second dispatch position is to add 2h or 4h to ESP.

    <p num="1177">Interface for Multiply, Divide, SRB, and FPU</p>
    <p num="1178">
      Each of the four issue positions has AOPND and BOPND busses which are tristated and transfer operands from the operand steering unit, RS2, RS1, and RS0 to the FNCU.
      <br/>
      No forwarding is allowed on these AOPND and BOPND busses.
      <br/>
      Forwarding from the RES busses is multiplexed directly at the input to the FNCU.
      <br/>
      These AOPND and BOPND busses also have tristate drivers onto the SAOPND and SBOPND busses which are shared operand busses going to the integer multiplier block.
    </p>
    <p num="1179">
      Floating point instructions go to the Integer uCode to have one FIROB line with four entries assigned to it.
      <br/>
      If needed, the first three dispatch positions will contain linear address calculations for the 3 possible floating point loads (32 bits, 32 bits, and 16 bits), and those integer reservation station entries free up after the linear address calculations for the FPU.
      <br/>
      The last dispatch position is a NOOP from the functional unit point of view.
      <br/>
      The uCode sends an Fcode entry point (corresponding to the last dispatch position) directly to the FPU.
      <br/>
      For floating point stores, the integer reservation stations perform the linear address calculations, and the LSSEC latches the linear addresses.
      <br/>
      Those integer reservation station entries then free up.
      <br/>
      Later, the FPU would request the multiplier for use of the MUL result bus and indicate to the reservation station control for position 3 that it needs to drive store data from the FPU to the MUL result bus to the FNCU3 result MUX to the RES3 bus.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC latches the data off the RES3 bus and performs the stores.

      The SRB instructions go to issue positions in any order.
      <br/>
      They use a similar protocol to the LOAD/STORE instructions.
      <br/>
      The SRB contains a four entry file which receives tags and other information from the IDECODE/DISPATCH.
      <br/>
      SRB opcodes can pass through the functional units in any order and then be reordered in the SRB file before the SRB executes them.
      <br/>
      No renaming is done on the SRB registers (CR0, CR4, various array entries, etc.).
      <br/>
      Data from the SRB to a standard x86 register or temporary register is returned to the FIROB using the LSRES0 bus and can be forwarded to the reservation stations at the same time.

      The following example shows how information is sent to the SRB and how information is forwarded from the LSRES0 bus.

    <p num="1184">
      When a byte operand such as AH is not located in the lowest bits, the functional unit needs to shift the AH operand from bits (15:8) to bits (7:0), perform the operation, and shift the result back to bits (15:8).
      <br/>
      The AHBYTE information will tell the functional unit when this alignment is required.
      <br/>
      SIB (scale, index, and base) addressing forms are sent as two dispatch positions because the instructions require dependency checking and renaming on three source operands.
      <br/>
      During the first opcode the base and the scaled index are added together, the result is given to the second opcode to perform the actual operation.

      IDECODE will send scale information to the functional unit indicating shifts by (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4).

    <p num="1192">
      The restoring division algorithm is done using uCode and FNCU0 only.
      <br/>
      Local divide direction bits are kept by FNCU0 and can be used to select between two different. vectors (one for ADD and one for SUB).
      <br/>
      Numerous signals are supplied from the control bit vector to the FNCU0 special logic so that proper handling of the division direction bit and proper multiplexing of the result can be performed.

      Fully decoded control vectors are stored in the Control Bit Vector Store sub-block.
      <br/>
      The reservation station and/or division direction flag determine which vector to use.
      <br/>
      As an example vector 0 and 1 could be used by the entry 2 of the reservation station.
      <br/>
      To do the linear address calculation for a load, entry 2 of the reservation station could select vector 0 and perform the add.
      <br/>
      When the load data came back, entry 2 of the reservation station would detect the tag match and use vector 2 along with the forwarded data to perform the actual operation.
      <br/>
      Only vector 2 can be used for shifting.

    <p num="1222">Overview of the Processor 500 FIROB</p>
    <p num="1223">
      This section describes the Four-Issue Re-Order Buffer (FIROB), including methods of reducing the dependency checking time.
      <br/>
      The Processor 500 FIROB has a structure including the data array, the status and control arrays with associated control logic, and the special registers.
      <br/>
      The four-issue ROB is line-oriented which means that the number of dispatched instructions is always 4 (some of the instructions may be NOOP), and the number of retired instructions is always 4.
      <br/>
      The FIROB size is 6 lines of 4 instructions for a total of 24 entries.
      <br/>
      There are a few exceptions to retire the partial line such as branch mis-prediction, interrupt, and re-synchronization.
      <br/>
      There are 8 read buses and 4 retire buses to support a line of Processor 500 instructions.
      <br/>
      The number of result buses are 6, 4 result buses are for results from 4 functional units and 2 results buses are for load/store and special register instructions to return data to the FIROB.
      <br/>
      The buses are 32-bits wide.
      <br/>
      The FIROB supports a massive number of comparators to dispatch 4 instructions in a line.
      <br/>
      To support the push/pop instructions with indirect references to the ESP, the FIROB includes 6 ESP latches.
      <br/>
      The latches are strictly for updating the ESP in the register file correctly.
    </p>
    <p num="1224">Top Level of the FIROB</p>
    <p num="1225">
      The FIROB is accessed by a line of instructions instead of an individual instruction.
      <br/>
      The line has 4 instructions, some instructions can be NOOP.
      <br/>
      Line-oriention has the advantage of a single input and allocation in the FIROB.
      <br/>
      The logic to deal with one line is much simpler than logic to deal with a combination of 0 to 4 instructions.
      <br/>
      Since the clock cycle time is short, a new method has to be implemented to do the dependency checking in one clock cycle and driving the data in the next cycle.
      <br/>
      The FIROB includes of 6 lines of instructions, where each line has 4 instructions.
      <br/>
      FIROB will have one clock cycle to compare the read addresses of the dispatched line to the destination entries of the previous 5 lines for dependency and to check the dependency within the dispatched line.
      <br/>
      The FIROB implements new status bits to indicate the most up-to-date destination to reduce the dependency checking time.
      <br/>
      The X86 instructions allow 2 operands, wherein one of the operands can be both destination and source.
      <br/>
      The FIROB checks dependency on both source and destination operands, the dependency of the destinations sets the last-in-line status which reduces the future dependency checking.
      <br/>
      A set of ESP latches are implemented to provide fast execution of the push/pop instructions.
      <br/>
      The FIROB can keep track and generate dependency data for the ESP without stalling or serializing any ESP instructions.
    </p>
    <p num="1226">Organization of the FIROB</p>
    <p num="1227">
      Processor 500 uses fixed issue positions for the decode units and the functional units.
      <br/>
      The FIROB and the register file conform to this arrangement.
      <br/>
      The operand addresses from the decode unit and the result buses from the functional unit individually access the fixed positions of the FIROB.
      <br/>
      The proposed arrangement of the FIROB is to have the address and data registers, the comparator, and the control status bits for the comparator in the data path between the decode units and the functional units.
      <br/>
      Other status bits and control logic are on one side of the data path as shown in FIG. 33. A proposed layout of the FIROB and register file is described below.
      <br/>
      The read buses can come from any entry in the FIROB because of forwarding.
      <br/>
      An operand bus steering may be needed to take the inputs from the FIROB or REGF and route to the functional units.
    </p>
    <p num="1228">
      FIROB is organized as 6 lines of 4 instructions each.
      <br/>
      The pointer to the entries has two parts: a 3-bit line pointer and a 2-bit entry pointer.
      <br/>
      The line pointer increases after every dispatch, and the whole line is dispatched or retired at one time.
      <br/>
      This is 3-bit incrementor and wraps around at the count of 5.
      <br/>
      Other reorder buffers (ROBs) are implemented with read and write pointers, the read pointer increases as instructions are dispatched and the write pointer increases as the instruction are retired.
      <br/>
      Since Processor 500 FIROB allocates or retires one line of instructions at a time and the number of dependency comparator is large, FIROB should be a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) instead of moving the pointers.
      <br/>
      The dependency comparators are always at lines 0-4.
      <br/>
      No dependency checking is needed in line 5, and the retire line (write pointer) is always from line 0.
      <br/>
      As a line of instructions is retired from line 0, lines 1-5 will shift up by 1.
      <br/>
      The read pointer increases as a new line is dispatched and decreases as a line is retired.
      <br/>
      To track the FIROB line number for the instructions in the reservation station, functional units, and load/store section, a virtual line pointer is assigned to each line as the line is dispatched from the decode units.
      <br/>
      The virtual line pointer is used by the reservation stations for result forwarding, by the functional unit and the load/store section to return result data to the FIROB, and by the load/store buffer to access the data cache in program order.
      <br/>
      The FIROB use the virtual line pointer to latch the result data.
      <br/>
      The virtual line pointer is attached to each line in the FIROB and circular shifted as the line is retired from the FIROB.

    <p num="1229">
      From FIG. 33, the result data of the FIROB and the register file drive the source data to 8 horizontal buses.
      <br/>
      Each functional unit receives 2 read buses from these horizontal buses.
      <br/>
      The layout of the result data of the FIROB and the register file sis adjacent to access the horizontal buses directly.
      <br/>
      A suggested layout organization is illustrated in FIG. 34.

    <p num="1303">Basic Operations</p>
    <p num="1304">
      The FIROB interfaces with the decode units for dispatching instructions, with the functional units and LSSEC for results, and with the register file for retiring instructions.
      <br/>
      The FIROB updates the special registers correctly with each retiring instructions, handles trap/interrupt gracefully, and re-synchronizes the pipeline after branch mis-prediction, self-modifying code, or changing the code segment register.
    </p>
    <p num="1305">Dispatch Interface</p>
    <p num="1306">
      Every cycle, the FIROB indicates the space status to the decode unit via ROBFULL or ROBEMPTY.
      <br/>
      As long as the FIROB is not full a line of instructions can be dispatched.
      <br/>
      The empty status is for serialized instructions.
      <br/>
      The dependency checking is performed for the operands and flags of the top 5 valid lines of the FIROB.
      <br/>
      The FIROB performs the dependency checking for 2 register operands and validates the results with decode information and hit signals.
      <br/>
      The FIROB keeps the destination operands of the X86 instructions.
    </p>
    <p num="1307">
      The FIROB provides the dependency tags for the source operands and flags.
      <br/>
      The destination tags is by the virtual line number.
      <br/>
      The fixed location of the instructions is simple for returning of the results.
      <br/>
      The FIROB implements a FIFO shifter to limit the dependency checking to the first 5 lines.
      <br/>
      The virtual line number is shifted along with retiring line to keep track of the instructions in the functional units.
    </p>
    <p num="1308">Result Bus Interface</p>
    <p num="1309">
      The result buses are dedicated between the functional units and the destination buffers of the FIROB.
      <br/>
      The FIROB compares the line number for returning results.
      <br/>
      The exceptions are the floating point unit and LSSEC.
      <br/>
      The line number and the entry number are compared in this case.
      <br/>
      The functional units send the data and address to the LSSEC for data cache access.
      <br/>
      The result buses contain the status flags, and results.
      <br/>
      Various status/control bits in the FIROB will be set and cleared for the benefit of the retire logic.
      <br/>
      Since the store and move-to-special-register instructions must access the data cache in the program order, all previous instructions must be completed with valid results.
      <br/>
      The FIROB broadcasts the top two entries which do not have the valid results to the LSSEC and SRB.
      <br/>
      If the broadcasted entries match the store or load-miss instructions, the LSSEC can access the data cache and returns results.
      <br/>
      Similar procedure is used for the move-to-special-register instruction in the SRB.
    </p>
    <p num="1310">
      The result data and tag are returned to the FIROB in the execution and data cache access cycle.
      <br/>
      The status can be a cycle later because of the zero-detect, carry, and tag-hit in the data cache.
      <br/>
      The retire logic may not be able to retire the instructions with late result immediately (require some work in logic and circuit design).
      <br/>
      There may be a cycle delay in retiring instructions with late statuses.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the limit violation checking on data access in the LSSEC can be later in the next clock cycle along with the late tag-hit status.
      <br/>
      The limit violation results in trap instead of retiring the instruction.
    </p>
    <p num="1311">Write-Back Interface</p>
    <p num="1312">
      The write-back interface of the FIROB is to ensure the retiring of instructions in program order.
      <br/>
      In addition to controlling write back to the register file, the FIROB updates the EIP register and flags registers and controls the order of the load-miss, store accesses and move-to-special-register instructions.
      <br/>
      In normal operation, the FIROB retires an entire line of instructions at a time.
      <br/>
      All instructions in the line must have the valid results from the functional units or LSSEC.
      <br/>
      All entries with valid result destination will write back to the register file.
      <br/>
      The LIL and NC status bits of the FIROB ensures that none of the write-back destinations are the same.
      <br/>
      The destination address includes the selected bytes for writing back data.
      <br/>
      In the case LIL and NC status bits are set for destinations of different size, and the FIROB masks the selected bytes before sending to the register file.
      <br/>
      In some special case, the FIROB retires a partial line.
      <br/>
      The LIL and NC status bits must be checked and reset before retiring, an extra cycle is needed for this case.
      <br/>
      The LIL and NC status bits are also used for the flags to simplify updating the flags registers.
    </p>
    <p num="1313">
      A branch mis-prediction causes a partial line to be retired.
      <br/>
      The register file destination addresses are compared to all the previous destinations within the partial line and reset the LIL and NC bits before retiring the store instruction in the next cycle.
      <br/>
      The write-back data is in the correct byte position with byte enables for the register file.
      <br/>
      The bytes are put in the correct position from the functional units, no shifting is needed in the FIROB.
    </p>
    <p num="1314">
      Two PC's are kept for each line.
      <br/>
      The first PC is for the first instruction in the line, the second PC is for a second instruction which crosses the 16-byte boundary or the branch target within the line.
      <br/>
      The PC offset is concatenated with line PC to get the current PC for retired instructions.
      <br/>
      A real register for the flags and program states is updated with the retired instruction.
      <br/>
      As the taken branch instruction is retiring, the PC is updated with the branch target or next line instruction.
    </p>
    <p num="1315">Updating the EIP Register</p>
    <p num="1316">
      The EIP is used to keep track of the X86 instruction execution.
      <br/>
      Instructions can be aligned on any byte boundary so 32 bits of EIP are implemented.
      <br/>
      Each retiring instruction updates the EIP register, and there is no concept of freezing.
      <br/>
      The MROM instructions do not update the EIP register, indicatds by ROBEXIT, except for the last MROM instruction in the sequence.
      <br/>
      The EIP update falls into one of three categories:
    </p>

      The FIROB keeps the floating point instruction pointer, data pointer, floating point status and opcode registers for floating point interfacing.
      <br/>
      The data pointer is updated on each floating point load with the instruction pointer and opcode registers are updated on floating point exception.
      <br/>
      The data pointer is implemented in the load/store section.
      <br/>
      The floating point status register is implemented with working and backup copies to ensure correct operation of floating point stores.

    <p num="1323">Trap and Interrupt Processing</p>
    <p num="1324">
      For internal exceptions from the functional units, LSSEC, and SRB, the exception entry in the FIROB will be retired in order.
      <br/>
      Similar to the branch mis-prediction, the pipe and fetching should stop on an exception indication.
      <br/>
      When all entries before the exception entry have completed and retired, the exception procedure is initiated.
      <br/>
      All entries in the FIROB, the functional units, and LSSEC will be purged.
      <br/>
      The exception routine will be fetched.
      <br/>
      The FIROB is responsible to generate the entry point to the MROM exception routine or new PC to the Icache.
      <br/>
      No state is updated when a trap is taken.
      <br/>
      The processor fetches from an appropriate entry point and allows the microcode to perform the necessary state modifications.
      <br/>
      It is up to the microcode to save the current EIP on the stack before the user's trap handler is called.
    </p>
    <p num="1325">Dependency Checking &amp; Dispatching</p>
    <p num="1326">
      The FIROB is responsible for checking dependency of the source operands of the dispatched line of instructions against the destination operands of the previous lines of instructions.
      <br/>
      The dependency comparators are needed for the first 5 lines in the FIROB and within the current line.
      <br/>
      The source addresses are checked for dependency against the previous destination addresses, and the dependency tags are generated by the end of this cycle.
      <br/>
      The forwarding data from the FIROB is driven in the next clock to the reservation station.
      <br/>
      Since the X86 instruction can only have 2 operands, the operand can be both destination and source which is indicated by the operand's tag bits, the current destination addresses are checked for dependency against the previous destination addresses with no extra cost in hardware.
      <br/>
      The write-after-write dependency information is used to set three new status bits for most up-to-date destination and the previously match destination.
      <br/>
      The three new status bits are referred to as Last-In-Line (LIL) bit for each line, and No-Compare (NC) bit for the whole FIROB.
      <br/>
      The NC bits ensure that there is only a single HIT for any read operand.
      <br/>
      The NC bits are used to qualify the dependency checking comparator, and the LIL bits are used to restore the most up-to-date status of the destination in case of partial-line retiring by branch mis-prediction.
      <br/>
      Other ROBs can have multiple HITs and search for the most current HIT.
      <br/>
      The procedure for dependency checking on this type of ROB is:
    </p>
    <p num="1327">Compare source addresses to previous destination addresses.</p>
    <p num="1328">Search for the most current HIT from multiple HITs.</p>
    <p num="1329">Encode for the dependency tag.</p>
    <p num="1330">Route tag and data to reservation station.</p>
    <p num="1331">
      On Processor 500, the two intermediate steps are eliminated, since there is only a single HIT, the HIT signal can be used as control to mux the tag and data directly.
      <br/>
      The NC and LIL bits are also used for retiring the line to the register file.
      <br/>
      No two entries have the same destination pointer for the line of instruction.
      <br/>
      The same method can be applied to the status flags.
      <br/>
      The FNC and FLIL bits are used for the status flags.
      <br/>
      The status flags are in three groups, OF, +SF,ZF,AF,PF}, and CF.
    </p>
    <p num="1332">
      As illustrated in FIG. 35, the matrix for dependency checking is 20 6-bit destination addresses against the 8 source operand addresses.
      <br/>
      For read operand, if there is a hit in the FIROB, the FIROB has the highest priority to drive the data on the operand bus to the functional unit.
    </p>
    <p num="1333">
      If there is a branch mis-prediction, all instructions in the same line after the mis-predicted branch with the LIL bit set feed back to the RD0PTR to check and reset the previous entries with the NC bit set.
      <br/>
      An extra cycle is used to retire instructions.
      <br/>
      The CANCEL status bits for all instruction after the branch mis-prediction should be used to qualify the instructions as NC.
    </p>
    <p num="1334">Operand's Size Dependency</p>
    <p num="1335">
      The size of the operands in dependency checking is quite complex for the X86 instruction set.
      <br/>
      Processor 500 checks for dependency from wide to narrow and stalls the dispatch line in decode for the narrow to wide dependency.

    <p num="1349">Handling of Load/Store</p>
    <p num="1350">
      Handling of store and load-miss can also be done with the broadcasted entry.
      <br/>
      The FIROB broadcasts the next-in-line entry which does not yet have a the result from a functional unit.
      <br/>
      With this FIROB entry, WRPTR(4:0), the LSSEC knows when to execute the store or load-miss instruction without any handshake from the FIROB.
      <br/>
      This implementation will eliminate the signals between the FIROB and the load/store unit.
      <br/>
      An extra signal, CANENTRY, will accompany the WRPTR to indicate that this entry has been canceled by mis-prediction.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC and the reservation stations can use this information to return the results without any execution, and any data dependency in the load/store buffer is ignored.
      <br/>
      The FIROB treats the load/store instructions the same as other ALU instructions with this method.
    </p>
    <p num="1351">
      The LSSEC implements a store buffer to keep track of the store instructions in the pipe for address dependency checking.
      <br/>
      The store buffer is capable of issuing 2 store instructions to the data cache if the store instructions are next-in-line for retiring.
      <br/>
      To accomplish this, the FIROB will broadcast another pointer, WRPTR1(4:0), and CANENTRY1 to the store buffer, if the first two entries in the store buffer match the WRPTR and WRPTR1, two stores can be executed concurrently as long as they accesses two different banks in the data cache.
      <br/>
      The WRPTR and WRPTR1 point to two entries in the FIROB which need results.
      <br/>
      The two entries do not necessarily point to store instructions.
    </p>
    <p num="1352">
      A similar procedure is also used for in-order execution of the move-to-special-register instructions.
      <br/>
      A buffer in the load/store special register is used for the special register instructions, the ROB tag is compare to the WRPTR to execute the instruction and return result to the FIROB.

    <p num="1353">

      <br/>
      The results are speculatively latched into the data buffer.

      The validation of the load/store is from the HIT signal of the data cache early in the next cycle.
      <br/>
      The result valid bits of the load/store is clear in the next cycle if miss in the data cache.

    <p num="1354">Unaligned Accesses</p>
    <p num="1355">
      Processor 500 is optimized for aligned 8/16/32 bits accesses.
      <br/>
      For aligned access, the operand comparison is for bit 31:2 with indication for checking of 8/16/32 bits.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC takes two or more clock cycles to execute the instruction.
      <br/>
      The operation of the LSSEC for unaligned load is as followed:
    </p>
    <p num="1356">
      First cycle: Access the data cache (DC) to read data with the current address, another access may be concurrent.
      <br/>
      Increase the address by 4 for the second access.
    </p>
    <p num="1357">
      Second cycle: Access the DC to read data with the increased address, other access can be concurrent.
      <br/>
      Latch the data of the first access at the beginning of this cycle.
      <br/>
      The DC puts the 8 or 16 bits at the least significant byte (same as any narrow access), and the LSSEC puts the first half data of the unaligned at the most significant byte of the result bus.
    </p>
    <p num="1358">
      A miss in either part of the unaligned access must wait for the WRPTR or WRPTR1 of the FIROB to execute the instruction in program order.
      <br/>
      The load/store buffer must keep the status to access the data cache and send the results correctly on the buses.
    </p>
    <p num="1359">
      Both halves of the unaligned store are written into the cache at one time to avoid any intermediate exception.

    </p>
    <p num="1360">
      First cycle: Access the data cache (DC) with the current address, do not write data, another access may be concurrent.

    <p num="1362">The advantages of the above procedure are:</p>
    <p num="1363">

    <p num="1373">Handling of Branch and Re-synchronization</p>
    <p num="1374">
      Since branches may be executed in parallel in multiple functional units, branch mis-prediction is handled in order.
      <br/>
      The mis-prediction of branches is handled by the FIROB.
      <br/>
      There are two types of branches, the conditional branch and the unconditional branch.
      <br/>
      The unconditional branch is always taken and includes call, return, and unconditional jump.
      <br/>
      The mis-prediction is when the targets do not match.
      <br/>
      For conditional branch, the mis-prediction is from taken/non-taken prediction and/or matching target address.
      <br/>
      Branch mis-prediction stops the pipe which can be done from the functional units, and all instructions in decode are cleared, and the new target is fetched by the Icache at a later time.
      <br/>
      The functional units may send the mis-predicted signal to stop the pipe and return the correct logical PC address to the FIROB.
      <br/>
      Because of the branch holding register, the branch mis-prediction does not update the ICNXTBLK until the next branch mis-prediction.
      <br/>
      The FIROB can speculatively send the branch mis-prediction to the Icache.
      <br/>
      If there is another mis-predicted branch prior to the last one, the FIROB can invalidate the branch holding register in the ICNXTBLK.
      <br/>
      The Icache uses an extra cycle to update the previously mis-predicted branch into the ICNXTBLK, and the FIROB uses this cycle to update the NC status bit and retire the instruction to the register file.
      <br/>
      The new logical PC address from branch mis-prediction should be sent to the Icache and allow the code segment to be added to generate the linear address for accessing the Icache.
      <br/>
      When an entry in the FIROB is completed with mis-prediction status, entries after the branch are marked with cancelled status.
      <br/>
      The cancelled entries can have incorrect result data from the functional units or LSSEC.
    </p>
    <p num="1375">
      Another condition to re-fetch the instructions is re-synchronization.
      <br/>
      There is a possibility of executing a wrong instruction from self-modifying code and updating the code segment register.
      <br/>
      The stream of instructions must be re-fetched.
      <br/>
      From external snooping which cause an invalidation of a line in the instruction cache or an internal store instruction which can change a line in the instruction cache, the FIROB is re-synchronized at this point.
      <br/>
      As soon as the write to code-segment register is detected, following instructions are re-fetched upon completion of the code segment register write.
    </p>
    <p num="1376">Recover of Status Bits from Branch Mis-prediction</p>
    <p num="1377">
      The status bits are no longer correct with branch mis-prediction.
      <br/>
      The FIROB takes one clock cycle to reset the status bits for each line of the FIROB after the branch mis-prediction.
      <br/>
      First, the line with the branch mis-prediction will be corrected.
      <br/>
      Within the line if there is any LIL bit is set after the branch mis-prediction, the destination is compared against the previous destinations before the branch mis-prediction.
      <br/>
      A match will set the LIL bit and clear the NC bit for that entry
    </p>
    <p num="1378">Updating PC</p>
    <p num="1379">
      Each line of the FIROB has two PCs, and each entry has a PC offset of the next instruction and one status bit to indicate if the offset is related to the second PC.
      <br/>
      As the line is retired, the current PC pointer will point to the next line PC.
      <br/>
      For partial retiring of the line, the line PC is updated with the offset of the present entry in the FIROB.
      <br/>
      For the MROM entry, the offset is with the last MROM instruction, and all other MROM instruction should have the same offset with the line PC.
      <br/>
      With this technique, handling of the PC is relatively simple.
      <br/>
      In the case of branch mis-prediction for sequential fetch, (the branch prediction is taken) the PC can be calculated by concatenating the line PC with the offset.
      <br/>
      If the PC is at the end of the line, the sequential PC is+16.

    <p num="1390">
      A function of the FIROB is to detect and prioritize the traps and interrupts and to initiate specific redirections at appropriate times.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC and functional units send the highest exceptions to the FIROB.
      <br/>
      The basic mechanism for redirection is:
    </p>
    <p num="1391">Assert EXCEPTION to clear out instructions in the pipe.</p>
    <p num="1392">One cycle later, assert REQTRAP and drive new entry point to the MROM.</p>
    <p num="1393">Correct look-ahead registers at decode and in the branch units.</p>
    <p num="1394">
      The FIROB initiates the microcode routine from the MROM by REQTRAP and does not wait for LSSEC to be idle.
      <br/>
      There are three groups of traps and interrupts:
    </p>
    <p num="1395">Exception results from functional units, FPU, and LSSEC.</p>
    <p num="1396">External interrupts (maskable and non-maskable).</p>
    <p num="1397">Single step traps.</p>
    <p num="1398">The FIROB includes a set of entry point vectors which can be sent to MROM on REQTRAP indication.</p>
    <p num="1399">Internal Traps and Interrupts</p>
    <p num="1400">
      The internal exception results are coded into 3 bits of ROBEXC:
      <br/>
      000--no exception
      <br/>
      001--load/store breakpoint
    </p>
    <p num="1401">
      This is set when any load or store breakpoint status is returned.
      <br/>
      The instruction is retired normally.
      <br/>
      The debug entry point is generated and the B bits of the debug status register are set according to the 2-bit debug register hit code reported with the result.
      <br/>
      The redirection starts when the whole instruction is completed; the ROBEXIT bit is set.
      <br/>
      Another trap or interrupt can have higher priority while the load/store breakpoint is waiting for the rest of the instruction to complete.
      <br/>
      The floating point exception causes the FIROB to update all the floating point exception registers but the debug trap has higher priority.
      <br/>

    <p num="1407">External Interrupts</p>
    <p num="1408">
      The external interrupts include both maskable and non-maskable interrupts.
      <br/>
      The non-maskable interrupt (NMI) is a normal, precise, external interrupt.
      <br/>
      The NMI should only be seen by the FIROB.
      <br/>
      The external interrupt is only recognized during selected windows:
    </p>
    <p num="1409">Partially retired valid instructions in the bottom line with ROBEXIT status and did not cause a trap or resynchronization.</p>
    <p num="1410">Frozen due to having retired a floating point exception with NE=0 and IGNNE=0.</p>
    <p num="1411">
      On external interrupts, the entry point is generated locally by the FIROB at the time the redirection is initiated.
      <br/>
      The maskable interrupt is level sensitive while the NMI is edge sensitive.
      <br/>
      FLUSH and INIT are also treated as edge sensitive asynchronous interrupts, similar to NMI.
      <br/>
      If the NMI is taken, it cannot be taken again before an IRET is executed.
      <br/>
      The microcode maintains a series of global flags that are inspected and modified by many of the trap handler entry points, and the IRET instruction.
      <br/>
      It is also the responsibility of the microcode to detect the NMI and delay the NMI until after executing of the IRET.
      <br/>
      The MROM allows only one level of NMI.
      <br/>
      Many other aspects of nested trap control (double fault, shutdown, etc.) will be handled with this microcode mechanism.
      <br/>
      There is no hardware support for this.
      <br/>
      When an enabled trap condition arises, the FIROB takes it at the next available window.
    </p>
    <p num="1412">
      The HALT instruction causes the FIROB to update the EIP before entering shutdown mode.
      <br/>
      If the shutdown is entered as a result of a failed NMI, microcode should also clear the IF bit before halting.
    </p>
    <p num="1413">Single Step Traps</p>
    <p num="1414">
      When the TF bit of the EFLAGS register is set, a debug trap is taken at the successful completion of each instruction, not including the instruction that actually caused TF to be set (i.e. the POP or IRET).
      <br/>
      The FIROB takes a single step trap on the successful retirement of the second instruction after the setting of the TF bit.
      <br/>
      When the TF bit is clear the effect is immediate.
      <br/>
      When a single step trap is taken, the entry point is generated locally by the FIROB, and the BS bit of the debug status register is set.
      <br/>
      The TF bit of the EFLAGS register is not cleared by hardware; it is cleared by microcode after pushing EFLAGS onto the stack.
    </p>
    <p num="1415">Debug Interface</p>
    <p num="1416">
      A summary of each type of debug trap is presented in this section.
      <br/>
      Load and store breakpoints are detected by the LSSEC and returned as a status to the FIROB with a 2-bit code identifying the breakpoint register matched.
      <br/>
      When the instruction is retired the FIROB initiates a debug trap and sets the corresponding B bit in the debug status register.
      <br/>
      The entry point for this trap is generated locally.
      <br/>
      The instructions with load/store breakpoint trap are considered to have completed successfully.
    </p>
    <p num="1417">
      Instruction breakpoints are not handled by the FIROB.
      <br/>
      The pre-decode disables the Icache and sends a special serializing instruction to each new instruction, whenever any of the debug registers are enabled for code breakpoints.
      <br/>
      The special instruction is serially dispatched to the LSSEC where it compares the pre-decode PC to the breakpoint registers, accounting for the state of the RF bit.
      <br/>
      If a breakpoint is detected, a normal exception status is returned to the FIROB and a trap is taken.
      <br/>
      The provided entry point depends upon which breakpoint register got the hit, and the setting of the appropriate B bit is the responsibility of the microcode.
      <br/>
      The FIROB is unaware of the nature of the trap being taken.
      <br/>
      The RF bit is cleared automatically by the FIROB on the successful retire of the second instruction following its low to high transition.
    </p>
    <p num="1418">
      Single step debug traps are handled in hardware by the FIROB as was described in previous section.
      <br/>
      The setting of the BS bit is done automatically by the FIROB but the handling of the TF bit is the responsibility of the microcode.
    </p>
    <p num="1419">
      The global detect debug trap is handled by the SRB, by inspecting the state of the GD bit in the debug control register whenever a move to or from any debug register is attempted.
      <br/>
      If it is set, no move is performed and a trap status is returned.
      <br/>
      The setting of the BD bit when the trap is taken is performed by microcode; the FIROB is unaware of the nature of the trap being taken.

      The FIROB updates the EIP register (which is one byte for the INT 3 instruction) and traps to the provided entry point.

      They are used for instruction execution.
      <br/>
      These registers can be accessed using move to/from protocol of the SRB.
      <br/>
      The special registers located in the FIROB are:
      <br/>
      ROBEIP--PROCESSOR PC--32-bit--The register is updated on-the-fly by retiring instructions.
      <br/>
      It tracks the real instruction execution, regardless of the current state of the processor i.e. there is no concept of freezing the PC.

      <br/>
      It is used by microcode to recover the PC of a branch to an illegal address.
      <br/>
      This is necessary since the limit violation is not detected until the branch instruction is fetched.

      EFLAGS bits are cleared by IRESET.
      <br/>
      The non-status bits can be accessed via the move to/from protocol of the SRB by 10 different pointers.

      The FPSR can be accessed either by using the standard move to/from protocol of the SRB or by a unique pointer to clear the exception bits.
      <br/>
      A move to FPSR must be accompanied by a move to the look-ahead copy which is the responsibility of the microcode.

    <p num="1595">
      Processor 500 has the standard x86 register file (EAX to ESP) which is read from four dispatch positions and written to from the FIROB using four writeback positions.
      <br/>
      It is the FIROB's responsibility to make sure that no two writebacks go to the same register.
      <br/>
      There are also 16 scratch registers available to all 4 dispatch positions.
      <br/>
      Eight registers are currently in the design for microcode use.
      <br/>
      Only the real (non-speculative) states are stored in the register file.
      <br/>
      No floating point registers are stored in the integer register file.
      <br/>
      Each of the 8 visible registers and the 16 temporary registers have enables to selectively write/read to bits (31:16), (15:8), or (7:0).
      <br/>
      The FIROB send bytes enable bits and valid write bits to the register file.
      <br/>
      Read valid bits and read byte enables will be sent by the dispatch/decode unit.
      <br/>
      Constants are not handled in the register file but rather get sent on the BOPND bus using the decode unit.

    <p num="1598">Register File Timing</p>
    <p num="1599">
      A register file timing diagram is illustrated in FIG. 37. Instead of the normal method of a write to the register file followed by a read from the register file, Processor 500 does a read first followed by a write.
      <br/>
      The early read allows sufficient time for multiplexing between the register value (the one actually read) and forwarding from the incoming writes.
      <br/>
      The end of the cycle is needed to drive the read value over to the operand steering unit.
      <br/>
      A self timing circuit is used to provide sufficient delay for the write and read decoding logic to complete before the read and write actually take place.
      <br/>
      Both the read and write decoding sections start decoding immediately after the ALAT's latch in the read and write pointer busses.
      <br/>
      There are sixteen 5 bit comparators which detect if forwarding is needed from a writeback port to a read port.
      <br/>
      The forwarding will bypass the delay through the register latch and help allow the read to complete within the cycle.
      <br/>
      The Read outputs from the register file will drive on a dedicated bus over to the operand steering unit.
      <br/>
      For maintaining fast logic, 3 input nand gates are used in the decode section.
      <br/>
      The 4 input nand gate is a large decrease in speed, and the 5 bit pointer bus along with an enable signal fit a two 3 input nand gate structure.
      <br/>
      There is not any reset logic for the register array.

      <br/>
      The ability to both read and write in during the same cycle is important to this block, and careful attention needs to be paid to the layout, capacitive loading and the bussing.
      <br/>
      Due to problems with fringing capacitance between adjacent metal lines, the register file does not contain precharge/discharge logic.

    <p num="1613">LOAD/STORE SECTION Overview</p>
    <p num="1614">
      The load store section in Processor 500 can perform single-cycle access of two memory based operands (2 loads or 1 load and 1 store).
      <br/>
      It can also perform out-of-order loads requested by the functional units.
      <br/>
      The stores go in-order and are performed as pure writes.
      <br/>
      The data cache is a linear cache, dual ported for the two concurrent accesses, 16KB 8-way set associative with way prediction.
      <br/>
      FIG. 39 shows the basic organization of the load/store section.
      <br/>
      It is comprised of a special unified load-store buffer.
      <br/>
      The information on whether an instruction is a load or a store is sent to the LSSEC by the decode unit.
      <br/>
      The linear address and data are computed by the functional units and sent to the LSSEC on the RESLA and result buses.
      <br/>
      The load/store unit then performs two data cache accesses.
      <br/>
      The loads may be performed out-of-order, but the stores are always in order.
      <br/>
      The unified load-store buffer is 8-entries deep.
      <br/>
      It can accept up to four instructions per cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="1615">Other Features are:</p>
    <p num="1616">Unaligned accesses have at least one cycle penalty (2-cycle latency).</p>
    <p num="1617">The current scheme supports non-blocking loads.</p>
    <p num="1618">Note: Unaligned accesses in this section means accesses crossing double word boundaries.</p>
    <p num="1619">Unified Load-Store Buffer (LDSTBUF)</p>
    <p num="1620">
      The loads and stores are buffered up in a common queue, called the unified load-store buffer.
      <br/>
      The load and store instructions are buffered up in this common queue in program order with the earliest instruction at the bottom and the latest instruction at the location pointed to by LDSTPTR-1, as shown in FIG. 40.
    </p>
    <p num="1621">The advantages of this scheme over the conventional scheme where the loads and stores are buffered up in different queues are:</p>
    <p num="1622">
      1.
      <br/>
      Efficient utilization of space due to which the dispatch would stall based on the total number of loads and stores as opposed to the number of loads or number of stores in the conventional method.
    </p>
    <p num="1623">
      2. Also, since communication is between the decode unit and load-store section, the functional units would never stall.
      <br/>
      They can keep executing the instructions in their reservation stations.
    </p>
    <p num="1624">3. The order of loads and stores are known since they are dispatched directly to the load-store section, instead of going through the functional units which could send requests out of order.</p>
    <p num="1625">
      Each entry (as shown in FIG. 41) in the buffer is broken down into three fields.
      <br/>
      The first field is made up of the FIROB instruction tag and the instruction type (load, store or load-op-store).
      <br/>
      The source of updates for this field is the decode unit/FIROB.
      <br/>
      The second field has the linear address and store data and the associated valid bits, the update source being the functional units.
      <br/>
      The third field is made up of some control information (for e.g. M bit indicating that this entry missed in the data cache on a prior access, D bit indicating that the load in the entry is dependent on a store in the buffer), the update source being the load-store section itself.
    </p>
    <p num="1626">
      LSCNT�2:0� indicates to the decode unit the number of free entries in the buffer so that decode can take the necessary action.
      <br/>
      It is the difference between 8 and LDSTPTR.
    </p>
    <p num="1627">Updating the entries</p>
    <p num="1628">
      FIG. 42 illustrates a timing diagram of when the different fields of each entry in the buffer are updated.
      <br/>
      The instruction types (ITYPEnB�1:0�) and ROB tags (DTAGnB�2:0�) are sent in a given(i)th ICLK. The corresponding mux select lines are generated and the entries updated.
      <br/>
      Also the LDSTPTR is incremented/decremented and by the end of that cycle LSCNT�2:0� is generated.
      <br/>
      At the beginning of the (i+1)th ICLK, the functional units send the tags of the instructions they are currently processing.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC looks at the tag information from the functional units, compares against the DTAG information in the LDSTBUF and sets up the appropriate mux select lines to latch in the linear address and store data.
      <br/>
      Also, the corresponding valid bits (LV and DV) are set up at this point so that they can be latched when the address and data get latched on the rising edge of (i+2)th ICLK.
      <br/>
      The load-store section then accesses the data-cache.
    </p>
    <p num="1629">Prioritizing the accesses</p>
    <p num="1630">
      The accesses to be performed sit in the unified load-store buffer with or without the linear addresses and store data.
      <br/>
      The load-store section is able to forward the linear addresses from the functional units for data cache accesses.
      <br/>
      In general, the processing of instructions is prioritized according to the following:
    </p>
    <p num="1631">
      1.
      <br/>
      Misses and stores have the highest priority.
      <br/>
      They are processed as soon as they are known to be non-speculative.
      <br/>
      The reason that the stores have higher priority over loads is because of the line-oriented nature of the reorder buffer and we would want to retire instructions as quickly as possible.
    </p>
    <p num="1632">
      2. Loads can go out of order.
      <br/>
      The linear address for a load can be in the buffer or can be forwarded directly from the functional units.
      <br/>
      The result can come back from the data cache or the unified load-store buffer from stores that have not been retired.
      <br/>
      The results are returned on the dedicated load-store result buses LSRES0 and LSRES1.
    </p>
    <p num="1633">
      Forwarding the linear address from the functional units directly for data cache accesses is based on the assumption that there is no valid outstanding load in the buffer.
      <br/>
      If there is any load (even one) in the buffer, it is sent to access the data cache and the linear addresses from the functional units are latched in the LDSTBUF.
      <br/>
      This scheme is followed because of cycle time constraints.
    </p>
    <p num="1634">Data-Cache Accesses</p>
    <p num="1635">
      The data-cache accesses are performed through the LSLINAD0 and LSLINAD1 buses.
      <br/>
      LSLINAD0 is connected to port A and LSLINAD1 is connected to port B of the data cache.
      <br/>
      The results are returned on LSRES0 and LSRES1 buses.
      <br/>
      The data for store accesses is driven on SBADAT and SBBDAT buses.
    </p>
    <p num="1636">Hits</p>
    <p num="1637">
      Bits 13:0 of the linear address are presented to the data cache just before a given clock edge, so that the DCACHE has enough time to latch it.
      <br/>
      The array is accessed and the tag is compared with the upper 17-bits of the linear address to generate the hit signal.
      <br/>
      The data is driven to the functional units prior to the hit being generated.
      <br/>
      A cancel signal is sent in the next cycle based on whether the access hits/hits in unpredicted way/misses.
    </p>
    <p num="1638">Misses</p>
    <p num="1639">
      If there is a miss, the M bit (Miss) for that entry is set.
      <br/>
      The load/store section based on the WRPTR information determines whether the instruction is non-speculative in order to go external to fetch the data.
      <br/>
      There is no handshaking between LSSEC and FIROB.
      <br/>
      Once the data is written to the data cache, the LSSEC performs the access again.
    </p>
    <p num="1640">Handling Branch Mispredictions</p>
    <p num="1641">
      Whenever a branch misprediction is encountered, the FIROB asserts the BRNMISP signal.
      <br/>
      The load-store section then sets a latch based on this signal.
      <br/>
      When a new load or store instruction gets dispatched, the load-store section sets the NF bit for all stores in the buffer and clears the latch.
      <br/>
      Setting the NF bit for a store indicates that the data from that store should not be forwarded.
      <br/>
      If there is a load that is dependent on a store with the NF bit set, it is serialized by setting the S bit.
      <br/>
      The loads keep returning results as they would normally.
      <br/>
      The stores and load misses are canceled when the FIROB asserts CANENTRY for that instruction.
    </p>
    <p num="1642">Handling Misses</p>
    <p num="1643">
      After a data cache miss, the load-store section performs speculative MMU/PT accesses for possible alias.
      <br/>
      If an alias exists, the data cache tag is updated and the access performed again.
      <br/>
      If cache master reports a miss in the physical tags, the load-store section marks the M bit in the entry.
      <br/>
      The miss is processed after the instruction becomes non-speculative.
      <br/>
      This is similar to stores based on the WRPTR information.
    </p>
    <p num="1644">If the CMASTER reports that the line is in the ICACHE (self-modifying code) and if the access happens to be a store, the LSSEC sends a "store-with-resync" status to the ROB to flush out the instructions after the store.</p>
    <p num="1645">Unaligned Accesses</p>
    <p num="1646">
      Unaligned loads are performed as 2-cycle single port accesses.
      <br/>
      When a load access is unaligned, the LSSEC splits that access into 2 single port accesses and issues them in two separate cycles to the data cache.
      <br/>
      Another aligned load or store can accompany the access on the other port.
      <br/>
      In the first cycle as the first half of the access is occurring, the address is incremented by 4 and in the second cycle, the other half of the access is performed.
      <br/>
      The merging is done by the LSSEC.
    </p>
    <p num="1647">
      Unaligned stores as single port accesses have a problem if they cross a line boundary.
      <br/>
      If one access hits and the other misses, and if a fault occurs while processing the miss, it could leave the processor in an undesirable state.
      <br/>
      The safest and probably the easiest approach is to let the LSSEC perform a dual port access so that if any of the two accesses misses, the other is canceled and is performed only after the appropriate line is brought in.
    </p>
    <p num="1648">Checking for unaligned accesses</p>
    <p num="1649">
      To determine whether an access is unaligned or not, the LSSEC detects the least significant two bits of LSLINAD0 and LSLINAD1 and the corresponding data operand sizes.
      <br/>
      An access is unaligned if the operand size is 32-bits and any one of the two least significant address bits is set or if the operand size is 16 bits and both the least significant bits of the linear address are set.
    </p>
    <p num="1650">Aliasing problem and solution</p>
    <p num="1651">
      The data cache is a linear cache with two ports.
      <br/>
      There is a potential that two or more linear addresses map to the same physical address (aliasing).
      <br/>
      There can never be more than one location in the data cache for a physical address.
      <br/>
      The problem is with the loads going out-of-order.
      <br/>
      A load with linear address LA1 has the potential of going out-of-order and if that location exists in the data cache, it hits and returns the result.
      <br/>
      A store with linear address LA2 ahead of the load might be mapped to the same physical address.
      <br/>
      Then, the result that the load returned is wrong since the load was not able to see the dependency.
      <br/>
      The solution to the problem is the way load-store dependency checking is performed (described later).
    </p>
    <p num="1652">Non-blocking loads</p>
    <p num="1653">
      The gap between microprocessor and memory speeds is widening with every new generation of microprocessors.
      <br/>
      This speed discrepancy can impact performance if the load-store section of the processor stalls whenever a data cache miss occurs.
      <br/>
      To prevent stalling of the load-store section, loads in the buffer can access the data cache as any miss is being processed.
      <br/>
      The following describes, in brief, the method that Processor 500 uses to perform non-blocking loads.
    </p>
    <p num="1654">
      Load and store instructions in Processor 500 are sent to a unified load-store buffer.
      <br/>
      Each entry in this buffer has a bit M that indicates if the load or store in the entry missed on a prior access.
      <br/>
      Whenever a data cache access misses, the M bit (miss) is set in the entry.
      <br/>
      Since the processor allows speculative execution, the miss cannot be processed immediately.
      <br/>
      It can be processed only when the instruction is no longer speculative.
      <br/>
      In conventional implementations, when a miss is being processed, loads or stores in the queue are held up till the miss gets resolved.
      <br/>
      The load-store section requests the Cache Master (CMASTER) to perform an external access to process a miss.
      <br/>
      The CMASTER goes external and takes a long time before it can fetch the line of interest.
      <br/>
      The fetched line comes in packets of 64 bits over the data bus to CMASTER which in turn sends the packet over to the data cache.
      <br/>
      The data cache latches the packets in a local buffer (BUF1).
      <br/>
      In the mean time, the load-store section can keep sending load accesses to the data cache.
      <br/>
      If the accesses hit in the cache, the results are returned.
      <br/>
      If an access misses, the M bit for that entry is set and the remaining loads in the buffer can be sent to the data cache.
      <br/>
      Once the data cache receives the entire line from CMASTER, it initiates the reload sequence.
      <br/>
      This reload sequence involves reading the line to be replaced into another local buffer (BUF2) and then updating the line and tag with the contents of BUF1.
      <br/>
      When it performs the line write, the load-store section clears the M bit for all the entries in the LDSTBUF, so that if any of the accesses missed on the line that was being brought in, it need not go external again.
      <br/>
      If the line in BUF2 is dirty, the load-store section initiates an external write cycle through the CMASTER.

    <p num="1671">
      When the load-store section performs data cache accesses, it also performs dependency checking against the stores in the store buffer.
      <br/>
      Bits 11:2 of the linear addresses are compared against the corresponding bits of the linear addresses of the stores ahead of the load �Also, the operand sizes and other misaligned address information are used in the equation to figure out dependency�. If the addresses match, the data of the latest store to that address is forwarded on to the result bus.
      <br/>
      To perform dependency checking and forward the store data, the load-store section has one whole cycle.
      <br/>
      In the following cycle, the rest of the bits (31:12) are compared.
      <br/>
      If this compare fails, the LSSEC signals FIROB and the functional units to cancel that result just the way the data cache does and the LSSEC serializes that load.
    </p>

      The advantage of using 10/12-bit comparators instead of 32-bit comparators is the reduction in hardware and increase in speed.

    <p num="1685">
      During prefetch, the CMASTER snoops the LDSTBUF entries to check if there are valid pending stores to that line.
      <br/>
      If there is a pending load to the line, then the prefetch holds till the store is done.
      <br/>
      To limit hardware supporting this feature, eight dedicated 8-bit comparators are provided for partial comparison of the line address.
      <br/>
      This structure can be used for the general snooping issues.
    </p>
    <p num="1686">
      No snooping structures are required in the load-store buffer.
      <br/>
      The reasoning goes as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="1687">
      In previous processors, a store sitting in the store buffer is retired as far as the ROB and the execution core of the machine are concerned.
      <br/>
      The ROB can retire instructions that are past the store even before the store is written to the data cache.
    </p>
    <p num="1688">
      During prefetch of a cacheable line, the store buffer entries need to be snooped make sure that a store in the store buffer is not to the same prefetched line.
      <br/>
      If it is (self-modifying code case), the prefetch stalls till the store is written.
    </p>
    <p num="1689">
      The reservation stations need not be snooped in this case since the store has not performed the data cache lookup yet.
      <br/>
      When the store does the lookup (a speculative read), it is going to miss in the data cache and the Physical Tags (PT) will assert IC_CACHED signal indicating the LSSEC to return with the "store with resync" status.
      <br/>
      The ROB will then flush all instructions after the store and instructions are redispatched.
    </p>
    <p num="1690">
      If the prefetched line is non-cacheable, prefetch stalls if there are stores in the store buffer to the same line or if there isa store in the reservation stations.
      <br/>
      The reason for making sure that the reservation stations do not have stores is that Physical Tags (PT) will not assert IC_CACHED since the prefetched line is not cached and might not be in the prefetch buffer.

    <p num="1700">
      The discussion above assumes that the linear addresses are sent over to the load store section by the functional units.
      <br/>
      This is true if the corresponding segment base is zero.
      <br/>
      If the segment base is non-zero, the functional units send the logical address.
      <br/>
      This logical address when added to the segment base in the corresponding segment register generates the linear address.
      <br/>
      The buffer stores linear addresses and therefore, the following scheme where an extra cycle is taken to compute the linear address is proposed.
    </p>
    <p num="1701">
      For null segment indications from microcode and when all the segment bases are zero, there is a bypass path to the load-store buffer from the functional units.

    <p num="1705">
      Special Registers in the load store section include the segment registers and the debug registers.

      The addresses that are generated by the functional units do not account for the segment base.
      <br/>
      If the appropriate segment base is not zero, it has to be added to the result generated by the functional units.
      <br/>
      In the case of non-zero segment base, an extra clock cycle is taken to compute the linear address.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC maintains all the segment registers and their invisible portion--the 8-byte descriptor.

      <br/>

    <p num="1732">Misses:</p>
    <p num="1733">Load Miss �Paging on, DCACHE on�</p>
    <p num="1734">
      When a load access to the data cache misses, the LSSEC does a speculative lookup of the TLB/PT to check if there is an alias.
      <br/>
      It does this by asserting LS_MMU_RD signal with the linear address on the DADDR�31:0� bus.
      <br/>
      The CMASTER can respond with the following signals
    </p>
    <p num="1735">
      TLB_MISS--The look up in the TLB missed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a true miss.
    </p>
    <p num="1736">
      PT_MISS--The lookup hit in the TLB but missed in the PT.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a true miss.
    </p>
    <p num="1737">CM_DC_ALIAS--There is an alias in the data cache.</p>
    <p num="1738">IC_CACHED--The line requested is in the instruction cache.</p>
    <p num="1739">Load Miss--Data cache on, paging off</p>
    <p num="1740">
      When paging is off, the linear address and the physical address are the same.
      <br/>
      If a load accesses misses in the data cache, it is also going to miss in the TLB.
      <br/>
      So, in this case, as soon as there is a data cache miss, LSSEC goes external to get the data of interest.
      <br/>
      The M bit for the load is set when a dcache miss is encountered.
    </p>
    <p num="1741">
      As soon as the instruction becomes non-speculative, the address is sent on the DADDR bus and the signals LS_MMU_RD and LS_NOT_SP are asserted.
      <br/>
      At this point in time, the CMASTER and the DCACHE go through the reload sequence.
      <br/>
      After reload is done, the data cache asserts the DCDATRDY signal and in the next cycle the dcache drives the result on the LSRES bus while the lssec drives the LSTAG bus.
    </p>
    <p num="1742">Load Miss--Data cache on, paging on</p>
    <p num="1743">
      In this case, when the load-store section encounters a data cache miss, it does a speculative TLB/PT access.
      <br/>
      It does so by asserting LS_MMU_RD and driving the DADDR bus with the load linear address. �It is noted that LS_NOT_SP signal is not asserted during speculative lookups.
      <br/>
      During speculative look up, the CMASTER can assert one of the following three signals--TLB_LS_MISS �access missed in the TLB�, CM_DC_ALIAS �access hit in the TLB and the physical tags reported an alias�, PT_MISS �access hit in the TLB but missed in the physical tags�, MMULSPGFLT �encountered a protection violation in the TLB�. For the case of CM_DC_ALIAS, the CMASTER sends the column information to the data cache and the LSSEC drives the address and LSUPDATERD signal to the data cache which will then update its tag and drive the result.
      <br/>
      For TLB_LS_MISS and PT_MISS cases, the M bit in the entry is set.
      <br/>
      When the instruction becomes non-speculative, the address is sent on the DADDR bus and the signals LS_MMU_RD and LS_NOT_SP are asserted.
      <br/>
      It is now the responsibility of the CMASTER to resolve TLB miss and get the line of interest from memory.
      <br/>
      For the case of page fault, the LSSEC sends a page fault status to the FIROB with a page fault vector on the result bus.
      <br/>
      If the instruction is non-speculative, the FIROB then asserts EXCEPTION and drives the entry point of the page fault routine.
    </p>
    <p num="1744">Handling Physical Addresses from Microcode:</p>
    <p num="1745">
      The microcode can send physical addresses for HDT mode, microcode patch, etc.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC and the cache master handles this.
      <br/>
      There is an indication on the INSLS bus if an address from the functional unit is a physical address.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC latches this information in the unified load-store buffer.
      <br/>
      It treats this access as a non-cacheable access.
      <br/>
      The address is driven on the DADDR bus to the CMASTER and the signal LS_PHYSICAL is asserted.
      <br/>
      The cache master, when it sees this signal, disables translation and performs a physical tags look up.
      <br/>
      If there is an alias, the CMASTER asserts CM_DC_ALIAS signal and drives the column information over to the data cache.
      <br/>
      After the data cache signals that it is ready to receive the access, the LSSEC drives the index without LSUPDATERD being asserted.
      <br/>
      The data cache then drives the data and presents the hit status to the functional units and FIROB.
    </p>
    <p num="1746">If there is no alias, the access is treated as a non-cacheable access.</p>
    <p num="1747">
      There is a problem with this approach--load-store dependency checking is disabled when there is a combination of physical and linear addresses.
      <br/>
      But, this may be handled if only linear addresses and only physical addresses are used.
      <br/>
      The best solution is if microcode introduces serialization when switching between HDT (patch) and non-HDT (non-patch) modes.
      <br/>
      Dependency checking can now be handled in the same way for all the modes.

    <p num="1770">
      The data cache (henceforth referred to as dcache) on Processor 500 is a 16KB linearly addressed, 8-way set associative cache.
      <br/>
      In order to facilitate single cycle dcache access, a way prediction scheme is used.
      <br/>
      This section discusses a 16KB dcache.
    </p>
    <p num="1771">Some of the other salient features of this dcache are 8-way interleaving, two concurrent accesses per cycle if they are not to the same bank, random replacement policy and one cycle penalty for unaligned loads and unaligned stores.</p>
    <p num="1772">Dcache Organization</p>
    <p num="1773">
      The dcache on Processor 500 is a 16KB linearly addressed cache implementing the MESI protocol.
      <br/>
      The line size is 32 bytes and the arrays are organized in a 8-way set associative structure with 8 banks.
      <br/>
      The 8 banks allow two concurrent accesses per cycle as long as the two accesses are not to the same bank.
      <br/>
      Bits 4:2 of the two linear addresses from the Processor 500 core are used for bank selection and identifying bank conflicts.
      <br/>
      Due to the interleaving, the data arrays are effectively dual ported and do not need to be implemented as actual dual ported structures.
      <br/>
      FIG. 52 shows a diagram of the dcache organization.
    </p>
    <p num="1774">
      The dcache is partitioned into three functionally separate arrays.
      <br/>
      They are the tag array, data array and the way prediction array.
      <br/>
      The tag arrays are physically dual-ported.
      <br/>
      Since it is a 16KB dcache with a 32 byte line size, there are 64 tags per way.
      <br/>
      Bits 10:5 of the linear address are used to index the tag array with bits 31:11 used for comparison to determine hit or miss.
    </p>
    <p num="1775">
      The data arrays are organized as 8 set arrays in each of the 8 banks.
      <br/>
      In order to facilitate 8/16 bit accesses as well as unaligned accesses, the LSSEC will generate byte enables for each of the two accesses.
      <br/>
      Bits 10:5 of the linear address are used to index the data arrays.
      <br/>
      The two ports that allow two concurrent accesses per clock cycle will henceforth be called Port A and Port B. The actions supported on Port A are: aligned loads/stores, unaligned loads/stores, reloads, SRB accesses, line reads(both snoop and non-snoop) and line invalidations.
      <br/>
      The actions supported on Port B are aligned/unaligned loads, unaligned stores(since a unaligned store uses both ports) and snoop invalidations.
    </p>
    <p num="1776">
      Way prediction will allow the Processor 500 dcache to attain single cycle access at our targeted clock speeds while using a set-associative cache array.
      <br/>
      Single cycle dcache access is feasible only when the predicted way hits in the tag compare.
      <br/>
      If a hit occurs in any of the unpredicted ways then there is a one cycle penalty which would be equivalent to a replacement cache performance.
      <br/>
      However, unlike a replacement cache there will be no swap penalty.
      <br/>
      The way prediction array entry is updated with the new predicted value.
      <br/>
      Bits 13:5 of the linear address are used to index the way prediction array.
      <br/>
      Like the tag array, the way prediction array is also dual ported.
      <br/>
      The details of the way prediction scheme are described below.
    </p>
    <p num="1777">Tag Array</p>
    <p num="1778">
      The tag array is organized into an 8-way set associative structure.
      <br/>
      It is dual ported so as to allow two concurrent accesses per cycle and is laid out as one 64 rows * 200 column array.
      <br/>
      This is optimal since the speed target does not allow a contiguous array larger than 64 rows.
      <br/>
      Bits 10:5 of the port linear address will be used to index the array.
      <br/>
      This will be true for both port A and B accesses.
      <br/>
      A tag array entry per way consisting of 25 bits is as shown in FIG. 53.
    </p>
    <p num="1779">
      A description of the various fields is as follows:
      <br/>
      Tag is bits (31:11) of the linear address.
    </p>
    <p num="1780">
      D is the dirty bit that indicates that the line has been previously modified.
      <br/>
      This information is used during a store by the LSSEC when the TLB is accessed to determine whether the corresponding dirty bit in the page table entry is correctly set.
      <br/>
      If the dirty bit in the page table entry is not set then an exception must occur to write the dirty bit in the external page table entries so that the page gets written back to external memory.
    </p>
    <p num="1781">
      U/S* is the user/supervisor bit that indicates the access privilege of the dcache line.
      <br/>
      If this bit is 0 then user level programs cannot access this dcache entry.
      <br/>
      The supervisor can access any line regardless of this bit.
    </p>
    <p num="1782">
      R/W* indicates the read/write privilege for user level programs.
      <br/>
      Supervisor level programs ignore this bit when the WP bit in CR0 register is 0.
      <br/>
      If the WP bit is set to 1 then supervisor level programs will use the R/W* bit.
      <br/>
      The dcache does the protection checking and sends an exception to the LSSEC if a violation occurs.
    </p>
    <p num="1783">
      V is the linear valid bit.
      <br/>
      This bit is 0 on reset and is set to 1 when a new line gets loaded into the dcache.
      <br/>
      This bit is also reset to 0 on invalidation.
    </p>
    <p num="1784">
      The tag and the protection bits (D, U/S* and R/W*) are always accessed together.
      <br/>
      The V bit can be accessed independently for invalidations and resets.
    </p>
    <p num="1785">Data Array</p>
    <p num="1786">
      The data array is effectively dual ported due to banking.
      <br/>
      Each bank is physically laid out as one 64 row * 256 column array.
      <br/>
      This again is optimal since the speed target for Processor 500 does not allow a contiguous array larger than 64 rows.
      <br/>
      During a clock cycle (regular load/store accesses), at most two banks can be accessed.
      <br/>
      The banks are selected by the bank select bits 4:2 of the port addresses.
      <br/>
      Bits 10:5 of the port linear address will be used to index each selected bank.
      <br/>
      The data array is byte addressable.
      <br/>
      Two sets of byte enables are generated per clock corresponding to the two banks being accessed.
      <br/>
      The byte enables are generated using the operand size information as well as bits 1:0 of the linear address.
      <br/>
      The byte enables are critical to doing stores in a single cycle for aligned accesses since stores are done as pure writes.
      <br/>
      Unaligned accesses and 8/16 bit accesses use byte enable information in the same fashion as well.
      <br/>
      All 8 banks are accessed on port A only during a reload or during a writeback.
      <br/>
      At this time (i.e. during reload or writeback) port B is unused.
    </p>
    <p num="1787">Way Prediction Array</p>
    <p num="1788">
      The way prediction array is a 512 rows * 8 columns direct mapped cache that is physically organized into eight 64 * 8 arrays.
      <br/>
      Each column corresponds to one of the eight ways of the data and tag arrays as shown in FIG. 54. The way prediction array is implemented as a dual ported array to allow two concurrent accesses per cycle.
      <br/>
      It is indexed by bits 13:5 of the port A and B linear addresses.
      <br/>
      Note that unlike the data and tag array the index here is 9 bits wide.
      <br/>
      Therefore for each tag/data array index, there are 8 possible indexes in the way predict array (provided by extra index bits 13:11).
      <br/>
      It is noted here that greater the mapping (i.e. more index bits for way prediction array), the more accurate the way prediction.
      <br/>
      This mapping was determined to be optimal based on performance/implementation tradeoffs.
      <br/>
      Each of the eight arrays will be addressed by bits 10:5 of the linear address.
      <br/>
      Bits 13:11 will select the output of one of the eight arrays.
    </p>
    <p num="1789">Aligned Loads</p>
    <p num="1790">
      There are two cases to be considered here.
      <br/>
      (a) 32 bit aligned loads and
      <br/>
      (b) 8/16 bit aligned loads.
    </p>
    <p num="1791">FIG. 56 shows a block diagram of the hardware to do aligned loads for both these cases.</p>
    <p num="1792">
      The dcache receives the linear address before the end of the 7th XICLK.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC also sends the index conflict and way conflict signals before the end of the 7th XICLK.
      <br/>
      At the beginning of the 8th XICLK, the dcache latches these signals, does the row decode and also the bank selection.
      <br/>
      The index conflict and way conflict signals are used to fire only one port of the dual ported tag and way prediction arrays.
      <br/>
      If a bank conflict occurs the LSSEC serializes the two accesses.
      <br/>
      Therefore, for that clock cycle, only one dcache access will be issued on port A. The LSSEC should also in the 8th XICLK send the shift code that is based on the operand size and bits 1:0 of the port linear address and also the byte enables.
      <br/>
      For the 32 bit load, the shift code is zero.
      <br/>
      The data from the predicted way will be driven on the LSRESn (n=0 or 1) and XLSRESn buses differentially towards the end of the 8th XICLK.
      <br/>
      The appropriate functional unit latches this data at the beginning of the 9th XICLK and uses it.
      <br/>
      The dcache meanwhile computes the hit/miss indication for the 8 ways and sends that indication to the functional unit and LSSEC.
      <br/>
      If there was a hit in the predicted way, then there is single cycle dcache access and the dcache can proceed with the next pending access.
      <br/>
      If there was a miss in the predicted way and a hit in one of the unpredicted ways, the LSSEC will cancel the next access that it had initiated on that port and drive the previous tag again on the LSTAGn bus.
      <br/>
      The functional unit will then cancel the operation and wait for data to be driven to it again in the 9th XICLK.
      <br/>
      The data from one of the unpredicted ways is driven to the functional unit during the 9th XICLK and is latched at the beginning of the 10th XICLK.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a one cycle penalty when there is a miss in the predicted way and a hit in one of the unpredicted ways.
      <br/>
      Also, the way prediction array will be updated with the new prediction in the 9th XICLK.
      <br/>
      FIG. 55 shows a timing diagram of the above stated actions.
    </p>
    <p num="1793">
      For the 8/16 bit loads that are contained within one doubleword, the flow is the same except that the shift logic that is present before the bus driver is utilized.
      <br/>
      This logic is present for the 32 bit loads also, but it is a shift by 0.
      <br/>
      This shift logic can be implemented using transmission gate muxes.
      <br/>
      For the 8 bit data, we can have either a shift by 0, 8, 16 or 24.
      <br/>
      For 16 bit data, it is a shift by 0, 8 or 16.
      <br/>
      The shift will be determined by the operand size information and bits 1:0 of the port linear address.
      <br/>
      Both of these controls should be known at the beginning of the 8th XICLK and the muxes can be setup before the data is available.
    </p>
    <p num="1794">
      If there is a miss on all the ways, the LSSEC marks that access as a miss and proceeds with the next dcache access if one is pending.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC also sends the address of the missed access to the CMASTER to check for an alias.
      <br/>
      If no aliasing has occurred, the LSSEC waits until the missed access is no longer speculative and then will initiate a reload sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="1795">Aligned Stores</p>
    <p num="1796">
      Stores on Processor 500 are done as pure writes.
      <br/>
      The dcache on Processor 500 supports byte write capability which allows pure writes.
      <br/>
      The byte enables used to do this are generated based on the operand size and bits 1:0 of the port linear address.
      <br/>
      Processor 500 dcache supports single cycle dcache access for stores if the store is to the predicted way.
      <br/>
      FIG. 57 is timing sequence of the actions that take place during the store.
    </p>
    <p num="1797">
      The sequence of actions until the dcache access are similar for both the load and store accesses.
      <br/>
      When the senseamps are turned on, the arrays are isolated from the senseamp to prevent the bit lines from being pulled down.
      <br/>
      Thus, the senseamp provides an automatic latch structure to hold the read data.
      <br/>
      When the way prediction is available, the write strobe for the predicted way is turned on thereby writing the store data speculatively into the predicted way.
      <br/>
      At the beginning of the 9th XICLK, the hit/miss indications are generated and protection violations detected.
      <br/>
      If there was a hit to the predicted way and no protection violation, then a single cycle dcache store access has been performed.
      <br/>
      If there is a miss in the predicted way but a hit in one of the unpredicted ways and no protection violations, then in the 9th XICLK the store data is written into the way that hit and the predicted way is restored with the data that was read out in the 8th XICLK.
      <br/>
      Also the way prediction array is updated with the new prediction.
      <br/>
      If there is a protection violation, then the predicted way is restored with the data that was read out in the 8th XICLK.
      <br/>
      The protection violation information is sent to LSSEC to generate an exception.
      <br/>
      The access is thus terminated and the dcache can proceed with the next pending access on the following clock cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="1798">For 8/16 bit stores, the above actions still hold except that depending on the byte enables that are active, only enabled bytes are updated with the new store data.</p>
    <p num="1799">Unaligned Loads</p>
    <p num="1800">
      Unaligned loads on Processor 500 require at least a two cycle dcache access.
      <br/>
      FIG. 58 illustrates the sequence of actions for unaligned loads when both accesses hit in the predicted way.
    </p>
    <p num="1801">
      In the 8th XICLK, the LSSEC will access the dcache with the current address.
      <br/>
      During this time, the LSSEC also increments the address by 4 to set up for the second half of the unaligned access.
      <br/>
      The dcache latches the first half of the unaligned load at the beginning of the 9th XICLK and does the shift necessary to set up the data to drive on the appropriate bits of the LSRESn and XLSRESn buses.
      <br/>
      During the 9th XICLK, the dcache reads the second half of the unaligned load.
      <br/>
      The actions taken are exactly the same as for a 8/16 bit aligned load.
      <br/>
      The two halves of the data will be driven on the LSRESn and XLSRESn buses at the end of the 9th XICLK.
      <br/>
      Note that in this process, the byte enables are used to select the appropriate bytes from the two doublewords that have been read out.

    <p num="1802">There are three more cases that are considered:</p>
    <p num="1803">
      (a) Unpredicted way hit in first access--Predicted way hit in second access.
      <br/>
      FIG. 59 shows the timing diagram for handling this case.
      <br/>
      This case occurs both when the unaligned load is contained within a line and when the load crosses a line boundary.
      <br/>
      As can be seen from FIG. 59, this case requires 3 clock cycles.

      FIG. 60 shows the timing diagram for handling this case.
      <br/>
      This case occurs when the unaligned load crosses a line boundary.
      <br/>
      This is because if the access were completely contained within the same line, there would not be a unpredicted way hit in the second access.
      <br/>
      This case also requires 3 clock cycles.
    </p>
    <p num="1805">
      (c) Unpredicted way hit in first access--Unpredicted way hit in second access.
      <br/>
      This case will also occur when the unaligned load crosses the line boundary.

      This case will require 4 clock cycles to complete.

      The cases covered so far only involved hits in the dcache.

      There are two cases of misses: Miss in first access and miss in second access.

      When there is a miss during the first access, the LSSEC will mark that load as a miss.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC will then process the miss as described below.
      <br/>
      If there is a miss on the second half of the unaligned load, the first half of the unaligned load that has been read out will be discarded.
      <br/>
      This case would occur when the load crosses a line boundary.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC sets the M2 bit in the LSSEC buffer and then processes the miss as described below.

    <p num="1808">
      Unaligned stores are executed in a slightly different fashion from unaligned loads.

      In the 9th XICLK, port A is accessed with the original address and port B with the incremented address.
      <br/>
      The byte enables for both the ports are used to write the appropriate bytes of the two doublewords.
      <br/>
      If there is a miss on any one of the ports then the old data that is read out on the other port is restored in the next cycle.

    <p num="1812">Processing a Load Miss</p>
    <p num="1813">
      On a load miss, the LSSEC sends the address on the DADDR bus to the CMASTER to check for aliasing.
      <br/>
      If it is a speculative request, then LSSEC does not assert the ROB_REL signal.
      <br/>
      The CMASTER in this case checks for an alias.
      <br/>
      If aliasing has occurred, the CMASTER sends the CM_DC_ALIAS signal back to LSSEC and dcache and also drive the way to be replaced to the dcache on the CM_REPCOL bus and the protection information on PAGE_PROT(2:0).
      <br/>
      The LSSEC, upon receiving the aliasing indication, drives the LSLINAD0 bus with the tag and index on the following cycle and also assert the LSUPDATERD signal.
      <br/>
      This causes the new tag and protection bits to be written in the selected way on the next cycle.
      <br/>
      The valid bit for that way also set.
      <br/>
      See FIG. 65 for timing diagram.
    </p>
    <p num="1814">
      If there is a miss in the physical tags, the CM_MISS is asserted.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC then waits until the dcache request that caused the miss is no longer speculative and then again sends the address on DADDR bus.
      <br/>
      The ROB_REL signal is now asserted.
      <br/>
      The CMASTER latches the address and checks for aliasing again.
      <br/>
      If no aliasing has occurred, it will initiate the bus cycle and fetch the line in four packets of 64 bits each (external data bus=64 bits).
      <br/>
      The CMASTER can transfer each packet to the dcache on the DATB bus as soon as it is received.
      <br/>
      The dcache will latch each packet into the appropriate location in a 256 bit buffer (BUF1).
      <br/>
      The dcache on receiving the first packet asserts DCFSTPCK to the LSSEC.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC, on the next cycle, sends the reload address(tag and index) to dcache.
      <br/>
      After this point the LSSEC does not issue any more requests to dcache.
      <br/>
      The CMASTER also selects the way in the dcache to be replaced and sends that selection to the dcache along with the last packet on the CM_REPCOL(2:0) bus. The last packet will be flagged by the CMASTER by the assertion of CM2LS.
      <br/>
      The replacement policy is pseudo-random and is determined in the CMASTER.
      <br/>
      After all 4 packets have been received, the dcache asserts the DCBUSY signal and then initiates the line swap.
      <br/>
      The dcache reads the line to be replaced into another 256 bit buffer (BUF2) and writes the line in BUF1 into that way.
      <br/>
      This swap can be done in one clock cycle.
      <br/>
      Note that this is a store to all eight banks and hence there is no port B access.
      <br/>
      The dcache will also update the tag and way prediction arrays.
      <br/>
      The way into which the new line was put will be the new way prediction for that index.
      <br/>
      See FIG. 66 for a timing diagram for reloads.
      <br/>
      If the line that was replaced was dirty, the CMASTER requests the dcache to send the line from BUF2.
      <br/>
      The dcache sends the line in four packets of 64 bits each on the DATB bus.
      <br/>
      The CMASTER then initiates an external write cycle to send each of these packets as they are received.
    </p>
    <p num="1815">Processing a Store Miss</p>
    <p num="1816">
      The Processor 500 dcache implements a no-write allocate policy for store misses.
      <br/>
      A no write allocate policy will still require the CMASTER to check for aliasing using the same protocol described for load misses.
      <br/>
      If no aliasing occurred, the LSSEC initiates a memory write cycle through the CMASTER.
      <br/>
      The data is sent to the CMASTER from the LSSEC on the DATB bus.
      <br/>
      The dcache is not involved in this transaction.
    </p>
    <p num="1817">Non-cacheable accesses</p>
    <p num="1818">
      Non-cacheable accesses are detected in three ways: The first is when the PCD bit is set.
      <br/>
      The second is through the sampling of KEN- inactive during the same clock that the first BRDY- is sampled active.
      <br/>
      The third is when the CD and NW bits in the CR0 register are programmed as follows CD=1, NW=0.
      <br/>
      The actions when a miss occurs are the same for all these three cases.
    </p>
    <p num="1819">
      For a miss (load or store), the LSSEC still sends the address to the CMASTER to check for aliasing.
      <br/>
      If aliasing has occurred then the procedure for handling of non-cacheable accesses is the same as for cacheable accesses (see above).
      <br/>
      For a load miss, the LSSEC requests the CMASTER to initiate an external memory read cycle.
      <br/>
      The CMASTER reads the requested doubleword (or less if a byte or word is requested) and sends it to the dcache over the DATB bus.
      <br/>
      This data is latched in the dcache.
      <br/>
      The dcache will inform the LSSEC that the data has been transferred.
      <br/>
      The LSSEC then drives the tag for that load on the LSTAG0 bus and also commands the dcache to route/mux the data so as to drive the appropriate bits of the LSRES0 and XLSRES0 buses.

      The array to be accessed (e.g. dcache, icache . . . ) and the action performed are specified in the first packet sent on the SRBB bus with the SRB_VAL signal in cycle N. The SRB will then send out the array locator doubleword on the SRBB bus in cycle N+2.
      <br/>
      The dcache will latch this array locator at end of cycle N+2 and read the appropriate word in cycle N+6.
      <br/>
      The dcache drives the requested data on the SRBB bus and also assert the DCTARVAL signal during cycle N+7.

      This signal is used for a very specific case.
      <br/>
      Consider the case as follows: There are two load accesses to the dcache on cycle I. The port A access hits in the predicted way while the port B access hits in unpredicted way.
      <br/>
      Now in cycle I+1, there can be a new access on port A while the data from unpredicted way will be driven out on port B. Also, the way prediction array will be updated.
      <br/>
      Now if there is a way conflict between the new port A access and the old port B access, the way predict array need not be read since the port B update to way predict array is the prediction for port A. DCWYXFER will facilitate transfer of this update from one port to the other port in such a case.

      Turning now to FIG. 67, a computer system 1000 including microprocessor 200, an interrupt controller 1004, a plurality of input/output (I/O) devices 1006A-1006N (referred to collectively as I/O devices 1006), a bus bridge 1008, a main memory 1010, and a cache 1012 is shown.
      <br/>
      Microprocessor 200, interrupt controller 1004, bus bridge 1008, main memory 1010, and cache 1012 are coupled to a CPU bus 1014 which effects high speed, high bandwidth communication between the connected devices.
      <br/>
      Lower speed, lower bandwidth communication is provided for I/O devices 1006 via input/output bus 1016. I/O devices 1006 are coupled to interrupt controller 1004 via an interrupt bus 1018.
    </p>
    <p num="2065">
      Interrupt bus 1018 includes at least one interrupt conductor per I/O device 1006A-1006N.
      <br/>
      An interrupt request signal conveyed on the associated interrupt conductor is indicative of a request for interrupt of microprocessor 200 by the associated I/O device 1006A-1006N.
      <br/>
      Interrupt controller 1004 is configured to receive the interrupt request signals and to convey an interrupt signal to microprocessor 200 upon CPU bus 1014 in response to the interrupt request signals.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, interrupt controller 1004 is an 8259A interrupt controller used in IBM compatible personal computer systems.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, interrupt controller 1004 includes multiple interrupt controllers similar to the 8259A cascaded to allow a larger number of I/O devices 1006 to be connected.
      <br/>
      Interrupt controller 1004 is programmable, and may be enabled to assert the interrupt signal individually for each interrupt request signal.
      <br/>
      In other words, interrupt controller may be enabled to assert the interrupt signal if the interrupt request signal from I/O device 1006A is asserted but not if the interrupt request signal from I/O device 1006B is asserted (or vice-versa).
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, interrupt controller 1004 may be programmed with a priority scheme for the interrupt request signals.
      <br/>
      The priority scheme is devised such that, if multiple interrupt request lines are asserted concurrently: the highest priority interrupt request is service first; followed by the next highest priority interrupt request; etc.
    </p>
    <p num="2066">
      Interrupt controller 1004 provides an interrupt vector which identifies the location of the interrupt service routine associated with the interrupting I/O device 1006A-1006N.
      <br/>
      The interrupt vector is transferred across CPU bus 1014 after microprocessor 200 acknowledges receipt of the interrupt signal.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, microprocessor 200 issues an interrupt acknowledge transaction on CPU bus 1014 when acknowledging the interrupt signal, and then issues a second interrupt acknowledge transaction to collect the interrupt vector.
      <br/>
      Other transactions upon CPU bus 1014 are used to transfer data among devices coupled to CPU bus 1014.
      <br/>
      An exemplary bus implementing such an interrupt acknowledge transaction may be found within the publication entitled: "16-bit and 32-bit Microprocessors Architecture, Software and Interfacing Techniques" by Singh, et al, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1991. This publication is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

    <p num="2067">
      Bus bridge 1008 is provided to assist in communications (other than interrupt requests) between I/O devices 1006 and devices coupled to CPU bus 1014. I/O devices 1006 typically require longer bus clock cycles than microprocessor 200 and other devices coupled to CPU bus 1014.
      <br/>
      Therefore, bus bridge 1008 provides a buffer between CPU bus 1014 and input/output bus 1016.
      <br/>
      Additionally, bus bridge 1008 translates transactions from one bus protocol to another.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, input/output bus 1016 is an Enhanced Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus and bus bridge 1008 translates from the CPU bus protocol to the EISA bus protocol.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, input/output bus 1016 is a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus and bus bridge 1008 translates from the CPU bus protocol to the PCI bus protocol.
      <br/>
      It is noted that many variations of CPU bus protocols exist.
      <br/>
      Microprocessor 200 may employ any suitable bus protocol.

    <p num="2068">
      I/O devices 1006 provide an interface between computer system 1000 and other devices external to the computer system.
      <br/>
      Exemplary I/O devices include a modem, a serial or parallel port, a sound card, etc. I/O devices 1006 may also be referred to as peripheral devices.
      <br/>
      Certain I/O devices 1006 may also be used to enhance the performance of computer system 1000 by performing certain tasks such that microprocessor 200 may perform other tasks.
      <br/>
      Exemplary devices include hardware accelerators.
      <br/>
      Main memory 1010 stores data and instructions for use by microprocessor 200.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, main memory 1010 includes one or more dynamic random access memory (DRAM) cells and a DRAM memory controller.
      <br/>
      It is understood that main memory 1010 may be configured as multi-banked or interleaved memory.
      <br/>
      Cache 1012 is a small, high speed memory for temporarily storing data and instructions from main memory 1010.
      <br/>
      If microprocessor 200 requests an address from main memory 1010 and cache 1012 is storing data associated with the requested address, then cache 1012 provides the data.
      <br/>
      Cache 1012 is an optional component, and computer system 1000 is fully functional without it.
      <br/>
      However, cache 1012 may improve the performance of computer system 1000.
      <br/>
      It is noted that cache 1012 may also be inserted between microprocessor 200 and CPU bus 1014 in other embodiments.
      <br/>
      Although FIG. 67 shows a computer system 1000 including one microprocessor 200, computer system 1000 may include multiple microprocessors similar to microprocessor 200 coupled to CPU bus 1014.

    <p num="2072">
      In accordance with the above disclosure, a data cache capable of performing store accesses in a single cycle has been disclosed.
      <br/>
      For many store accesses, single cycle cache access is achieved by speculatively storing to the data cache according to a way prediction.
      <br/>
      In cases where the way prediction is correct, the store access is advantageously completed in one clock cycle.
      <br/>
      Data cache bandwidth is increased by the removal of extra store access cycles.
      <br/>
      A superscalar microprocessor employing such a data cache may achieve increased performance due to the increased access to the data cache that is available.
      <br/>
      Additionally, since the way prediction structure is used, the associative cache may be characterized by an access time consistent with a direct-mapped cache.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the data cache is suitable for high frequency applications.
