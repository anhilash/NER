    <heading>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates generally to new and novel improvements in overhead garage door position monitoring systems.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to overhead garage door position monitoring systems which are capable of monitoring parameters such as the carbon monoxide level, the temperature and the overhead garage door position and reporting out the status of these parameters using a voice synthesizer and speaker.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Attached garages are becoming increasingly popular across the United States to shelter motor vehicles from inclement weather and allow access to the motor vehicles without exposure to the elements.
      <br/>
      However, attached garages can present hazards.
      <br/>
      For example, the operating temperature of a motor vehicle is relatively high and includes electrical wiring and thus, a fire hazard may exist.
      <br/>
      In addition, if a motor vehicle is left running in an enclosed attached garage, dangerous levels of carbon monoxide can be present.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is often difficult to determine the position of the overhead garage door and, if left open, for example, overnight or during a work day, animals and/or unauthorized individuals can have access into the garage and perhaps even the dwelling through the garage.
    </p>
    <p num="3">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is the provision of overhead garage door position monitoring systems which can sense parameters such as the level of carbon monoxide, the temperature and the position of the overhead garage door and report out the status of such parameters through, for example, a voice synthesizer and a speaker output.</p>
    <p num="4">
      This and other objects of the present invention are attained by the provision of an overhead garage door position monitoring system including a carbon monoxide monitor, a thermal sensor and a magnetic sensor to measure the carbon monoxide level, the temperature and the position of an overhead garage door, respectively.
      <br/>
      These sensors are controlled by and report the status of parameters to a controller, such as a microcontroller.
      <br/>
      This controller is programmed to report the status of parameters through, for example, a visible message display, such as a low power liquid crystal display (LCD), and/or a voice synthesizer and audio speaker.

    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="6">
      In the following detailed description of preferred embodiments of the present invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which, in conjunction with this detailed description, illustrate and describe a first and a second preferred embodiment of an overhead garage door position monitoring system.
      <br/>
      Referring now to the drawings, in which like-identified characters represent corresponding elements throughout the several views, attention is first directed to FIGS. 1 and 2, which illustrate a flowchart of the parameters monitored and processes performed by a overhead garage door position monitoring system in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention, generally identified by reference number 10 and affront view, a back view and an inside view, respectively, of controller 18 used in overhead garage door position monitoring system 10 in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Overhead garage door position monitoring system 10 includes carbon monoxide sensor 12, thermal sensor 14 and magnetic sensor 16.
      <br/>
      Carbon monoxide sensor 12 measures the carbon monoxide level in, for example, an enclosed garage, which may become elevated due to, for example, a motor vehicle left running in the enclosed garage.
      <br/>
      Thermal sensor 14 measures the temperature, or alternatively, can be a smoke detector sensor, to determine if a fire is present in, for example, an enclosed garage, which has started from, for example, a motor vehicle engine or electrical wiring or from flammable materials stored in the enclosed garage.
      <br/>
      In a particularly preferred embodiment of overhead garage door position monitoring system 10, thermal sensor 14 is positioned outside of the garage to measure outside temperature and smoke detector sensor 48 is positioned inside the garage to determine if a fire is present in, for example, the enclosed garage.
      <br/>
      Magnetic sensor 16 is positioned to monitor the position of one or more conventional overhead garage doors.
      <br/>
      Carbon monoxide sensor 12, thermal sensor 14, magnetic sensor 16 and smoke detector sensor 48 are all controlled by and report the parameters measured to controller 18, preferably a microcontroller.
      <br/>
      Controller 18 provides instructions to voice synthesizer 20 which, in turn, transmits audio signals through audio speaker 22.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Turning now to the operation of overhead garage door position monitoring system 10, when conventional overhead garage door is closed (S1), magnetic sensor 16 is closed, and no messages are sent from magnetic sensor 16 to controller 18 (S2).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when conventional overhead garage door is open by more than a specified distance (S3), magnetic sensor 16 is opened, and a continuous signal is sent from magnetic sensor 16 to controller 18.
      <br/>
      Controller 18, upon receipt of the continuous signal from magnetic sensor 16, forwards appropriate instructions to voice synthesizer 20 (S4) to provide an audible warning at preselected intervals of time.
      <br/>
      For example, voice synthesizer 20 can initiate an audible warning such as "Garage door is ajar for `x` amount of time and the outside temperature is `x (degree) `" which is output through audio speaker 22 (S5).
      <br/>
      If smoke detector sensor 48 senses less than a predetermined concentration of smoke, or alternately if the temperature measured inside the garage is less than a predetermined temperature, for example, 110 (degree)  F., no signal is sent from smoke detector sensor 48 to controller 18.
      <br/>
      However, if a greater than a predetermined concentration of smoke is detected by smoke detector sensor 48 (S15), or alternatively if the temperature measured inside the garage is more than a predetermined temperature, for example 110 (degree)  F., a signal is sent by smoke detector sensor 48 to controller 18 (S16).
      <br/>
      Upon receipt of a signal from smoke detector sensor 48, controller 18 sends an immediate instruction to voice synthesizer 20 which, in turn, provides a signal to audio speaker 22 to announce a repeated audible warning, such as "Smoke Detected--Check Carefully" (S17).
      <br/>
      If magnetic sensor 16 is positioned where the conventional garage door is completely open, magnetic sensor 16 will be triggered upon downward movement of the conventional overhead garage door and magnetic sensor 16 will send a signal to controller 18 (S6).
      <br/>
      Upon receipt of a signal from magnetic sensor 16 that the conventional overhead garage door is closing, controller 18 sends instructions to voice synthesizer 20 (S7) which, in turn, initiates a signal to audio speaker 22 to announce an audible warning, such as "Garage door is closing, please stand clear" (S8).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Similarly, if carbon monoxide sensor 12 senses less than a predetermined concentration of carbon monoxide, no signal is sent from carbon monoxide sensor 12 to controller 18.
      <br/>
      However, if a greater than a predetermined concentration of carbon monoxide is detected by carbon monoxide sensor 12, a signal is sent by carbon monoxide sensor 12 to controller 18 (S9).
      <br/>
      Upon receipt of a signal from carbon monoxide sensor 12, controller 18 sends an immediate instruction to voice synthesizer 20 (S10) which, in turn, provides a signal to audio speaker 22 to announce an audible warning such as "A high level of carbon monoxide has been detected" (S11).
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Another feature of overhead garage door position monitoring system 10 allows a user to record a short message on controller 18 which can be played at some later time by, for example, another family member.
      <br/>
      This is done by pushing a button on controller 18 and speaking into a microphone to leave a short message which is stored in controller 18 (S12).
      <br/>
      Later, when an individual presses a play button, the short message is sent from controller 18 to voice synthesizer 20 (S13) and voice synthesizer 20 plays back the message last recorded through audio speaker 22 (S14).
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Referring now to FIG. 2, which shows a front view, of controller 18 for overhead garage door position monitoring system 10 in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 1, controller 18 preferably includes controller housing 24, which can be fabricated from a plastic or metallic material.
      <br/>
      An opening in controller housing 24 permits viewing of message display 26, which is preferably a low power liquid crystal display (LCD) type display.
      <br/>
      Various types of information can be displayed on message display 26 such as, for example, the date, time, temperature, battery condition, overhead garage door position, carbon monoxide level or other desired information.
      <br/>
