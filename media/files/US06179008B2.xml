    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Rubber hoses are usually composed of an inner tube, a reinforcing layer, and an outer cover with the inner tube and outer cover composed of a vulcanized rubber.
      <br/>
      Such a rubber hose requires a vulcanization step, and therefore, there is the problem that the manufacturing process becomes complicated.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, there is known a so-called thermoplastic resin tube which is simpler in the manufacturing process thereof in the point that the inner tube and outer cover are composed of a thermoplastic resin and no vulcanization step is required.
      <br/>
      However, the thermoplastic resin comprising this resin hose is generally harder compared with vulcanized rubber, and therefore, it is difficult to obtain a flexible hose.
      <br/>
      In addition, the thermoplastic resin will soften by heating and therefore, it is usually difficult at a temperature of 120 (degree)  C. or more.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Therefore, attempts have been made in the past to improve the flexibility by adding, to the thermoplastic resin, amorphous polymers such as a rubber (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 5-25374, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 6-64102, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 6-207086), but there is the problem that the compatibility of the thermoplastic resin with rubber is poor and, if the blending amount of the rubber is increased to improve the flexibility in an acrylic rubber (ACM)/thermoplastic copolyester elastomer thermoplastic elastomer material, where the ACM composition is EA (ethyl acrylate)=40, BA (butyl acrylate)=32, MEA (methoxyethyl acrylate)=19, GMA (glycidyl methacrylate)=9 (wt %), the elongation will fall and, as a result, the breaking energy will be reduced and, in turn, the problem will arise of the hose performance falling.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Further, to improve the flexibility of a thermoplastic resin, there is known a resin hose comprised of a polyester thermoplastic elastomer having an inner tube of polybutylene terephthalate as a hard segment and polytetramethylene glycol or polycaprolactone as a soft segment, but this polyester thermoplastic elastomer is limited in the extent to which the hardness can be reduced to obtain the necessary heat softening resistance and strength properties.
      <br/>
      It is not possible to obtain a hose having a sufficient flexibility and heat resistance like that of a vulcanized rubber.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Therefore, development of a hose having sufficient flexibility which can be produced by a simple process not requiring a vulcanization step and a hose provided with heat resistance as well enabling use for transmission of pressure or transport of liquids at a high temperature has been desired.
      <br/>
      In response to this, there has been proposed a hose having an inner tube and an outer cover comprising a thermoplastic elastomer composed of a thermoplastic resin in which a vulcanized rubber (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 6-64102) is dispersed.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      This hose has an inner tube composed of a thermoplastic elastomer composition comprising a thermoplastic copolyester elastomer in which a vulcanized composition of at least one acrylic rubber having an acryl group and epoxy group is dispersed and has an outer cover composed of a thermoplastic elastomer composed of a thermoplastic resin in which a vulcanized rubber is dispersed.
      <br/>
      Further, the reinforcing layer is composed of a rayon fiber, polyester fiber, or hard steel wire or other organic fiber or inorganic wire such as stainless steel wire bonded with the inner tube and outer cover via an ordinary temperature-curing type urethane adhesive, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      By this configuration, it is possible to obtain a hose which is flexible at ordinary temperature and does not require a vulcanization step, but this hose is not necessarily satisfactory in terms of the low temperature properties, in particular, the flexibility at low temperature and cold resistance.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the improvement in the oil resistance has been required.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Further, the high pressure resin hoses for use in construction machinery etc. should preferably be improved in abrasion resistance, heat softening resistance, flexibility, etc.
      <br/>
      In particular, there has been a strong need for the improvement in the abrasion resistance, resistance to heat softening resistance, flexibility, weather resistance, etc. of the outer cover of the hose.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, regarding the abrasion resistance, there is vibration and rocking in the environments where hoses are used, and therefore, the surface of the outer cover of the hose often rubs against adjacent metal members etc. and is abraded.
      <br/>
      In the past, an ether based polyurethane or other thermoplastic resin having abrasion resistance was used for the outer cover of such a hose, but this was insufficient for long term use.
      <br/>
      Therefore, studies have been made how to improve the problem by the polymer structure, but there have been the defects of impairment of the flexibility.
      <br/>
      In this way, up until now, there has not been a thermoplastic elastomer composition which is superior in abrasion resistance, heat softening resistance, flexibility, etc. and can be suitably used for the outer cover of a hose.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In the past, in the bonding of an olefin thermoplastic elastomer composition and polyester fiber, no technique for stably bonding them, in particular, no olefin thermoplastic elastomer composition having a high temperature resistant bondability capable of withstanding, stress due to repeated deformation at a high temperature such as 120 (degree)  C. was known.
      <br/>
      This was because an olefin thermoplastic elastomer composition is a nonpolar substance and has a low surface energy, while a polyester fiber has polarity.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in general the bondability between the composition and the fiber is poor.
      <br/>
      In particular, it is not possible to maintain the strength of the bond at a high temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="12">To solve this problem, for example, a formulation using a so-called primer and adhesive system/adhesive resin has been proposed, but there is still not known an adhesive formulation or an olefin thermoplastic elastomer composition giving a bond of a strength capable of withstanding the repeated deformation at a high temperature such as 120 (degree)  C. In particular, in a hose, a dynamically vulcanized olefin thermoplastic elastomer composition has suitable properties as the outer cover material comprising the hose and a polyester fiber has suitable properties as a reinforcing fiber layer material comprising the hose, but there is not yet known an adhesive formulation for bonding the composition and the fiber, in particular, an adhesive formulation of a strength capable of withstanding the stress of repeated deformation at the environment of use of high pressure flexible hoses, that is, a high temperature such as 120 (degree)  C. No hose combining these materials is therefore known.</p>
    <p num="13">Accordingly, there has been a desire for an olefin thermoplastic elastomer composition having bondability with a polyester fiber and capable of withstanding the stress of repeated deformation at a high temperature such as 120 (degree)  C. and a laminate using the above thermoplastic elastomer composition and a polyester fiber.</p>
    <p num="14">
      There is known a hose comprising an inner tube, reinforcing layer, and outer cover laminated in that order.
      <br/>
      In this hose, the inner tube and outer cover are composed of a vulcanized rubber or urethane, polyester, or nylon, or other plastics and the reinforcing layer is composed of nylon, polyester, rayon, vinylon, or aromatic polyamide fiber or other fiber braided or wrapped in a spiral.
      <br/>
      Between these layers, bonding is performed using a rubber cement or urethane adhesive etc.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      However, the so-called "rubber hose" using rubber in the outer cover requires a vulcanization step, and therefore, the manufacturing process becomes complicated.
      <br/>
      Further, a so-called resin hose using just a thermoplastic resin for the inner tube and outer cover is hard and poor in flexibility and, when bent, has the problem of formation of kinks.
      <br/>
      As one proposal for solving this problem, there has been proposed a hose using a thermoplastic elastomer composition comprising a polyolefin based thermoplastic resin, polyvinyl chloride based thermoplastic resin, polyamide based thermoplastic resin, polyester based thermoplastic resin, or other thermoplastic resin in which an at least partially cross-linked vulcanized rubber phase, is dispersed (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 6-64102).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Among these thermoplastic elastomer compositions, a thermoplastic elastomer composition composed of a polyolefin thermoplastic resin and an at least partially cross-linked elastomer component blended therein, is high in flexibility and suitable as a material for the inner tube and outer cover of the hose.
      <br/>
      However, there has not yet been developed an adhesive exhibiting excellent bondability to both a fiber reinforcing layer composed of a polyester, nylon, rayon, or other fiber and a thermoplastic elastomer composition composed of a polyolefin thermoplastic resin and an at least partially cross-linked elastomer component blended therein.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      For example, as methods for improving the adhesiveness of the main component of the thermoplastic elastomer composition, that is, the polyolefin thermoplastic resin, there are known corona discharge, UV irradiation, flame treatment, strong acid treatment, and other surface activation methods.
      <br/>
      With these methods, however, not only is it difficult to secure the level of bonding required for hoses and other durable products composed of a thermoplastic elastomer composition, but also the process of application to a manufacturing line of a hose is extremely complicated and very high in cost, and therefore, is not practical.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Further, elastomer compositions are used as various sealing agents, rubber hoses, and other industrial products and also for other rubber products.
      <br/>
      In particular, epoxy group-containing acrylate copolymer rubbers containing (meth)acrylic acid esters etc. are elastomer compositions known to be superior in oil resistance and aging resistance and, when cross-linked, cold resistance or strength properties as well.
      <br/>
      There is the problem, however, that a sufficient elongation and compression set resistance cannot be obtained with a conventional cross-linking agent (polyfunctional carboxylic acid).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      On the other hand, in recent years, thermoplastic elastomer compositions provided with both the advantages of a rubber and thermoplastic resin have been developed using the dynamic vulcanization (dynamic cross-linking) of rubber, but when selecting an acrylate copolymer as the rubber component, in particular when using an epoxy group as the cross-linking site of the acrylate copolymer so as to obtain an elastomer composition not including an amine component, since an amine component would promote the deterioration of the polyester, there is the problem that a sufficient elongation and compression set resistance cannot be obtained.
      <br/>
      For example Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 1-92251 discloses a rubber composition composed of an ethylene copolymer rubber and acrylic rubber offering a balance of cold resistance, oil resistance, resistance to aging by heat, and strength properties.
      <br/>
      Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 5-25347 discloses a high stress resistant thermoplastic elastomer composition composed of a thermoplastic copolyester or copolyamide elastomer and epoxy-containing (meth)acrylate copolymer rubber which is flexible and gives a superior heat resistance and compression set resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Further, Y. Tsukahara et al, International Rubber Conference Full Texts, p. 74 (1995) and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 7-304902 disclose a natural rubber composition as an environmentally friendly elastomer material composed of epoxylated natural rubber and terminal carboxylated polycaprolactone which is excellent in fluidity and is superior in the elastic modulus of the rubber, elongation, and oil resistance.</p>
    <p num="21">As explained above, these various elastomer compositions and thermoplastic elastomer compositions have superior performance, but have the problem that a practically sufficient elongation and compression set resistance cannot be obtained.</p>
    <p num="22">
      The present inventors previously proposed a hose having at least an inner tube, reinforcing layer, and outer cover, where the inner tube is a thermoplastic elastomer composition having a structure of a matrix of a thermoplastic copolyester elastomer and vulcanized rubber particles of an acrylic rubber having an acryl group and epoxy group dispersed therein and containing 30 to 90% by weight of the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer component and 70 to 10% by weight of the vulcanized rubber component of the acrylic rubber, the reinforcing layer is composed of a polyester fiber etc., the outer cover is a thermoplastic elastomer having a structure of a matrix of a thermoplastic copolyester elastomer and vulcanized rubber particles of an acrylic rubber having an acryl group and epoxy group dispersed therein and containing 30 to 90% by weight of the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer component and 70 to 10% by weight of the vulcanized rubber of the acrylic rubber component, and an adhesive is disposed at least between the reinforcing layer and the outer cover (Japanese Patent Application No. 8-23903).
      <br/>
      That is, they proposed a hose wherein, by selection of the material of the inner tube and outer cover of the hose, it was possible to improve the hose flexibility at ordinary temperature and low temperature, oil resistance, and cold resistance and further reduce the production costs by making it possible to produce it, without requiring a vulcanization step.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In this hose, however, a urethane ordinary temperature-curing type adhesive etc. are used as the bonding layer.
      <br/>
      Since the adhesive was a reactive type, heat curing occurred due to the heat during use, and therefore, the bonding layer became hard and in turn the filaments of the fibers of the reinforcing layer broke causing the reinforcing layer to break and the durability to fall.
      <br/>
      Even if using a polyester type hot melt adhesive resin in place of this, the adhesive resin detracts from the thermoplasticity and is poor in heat softening resistance, and therefore, a hose which is satisfactory in durability (high temperature impact pressure test: 120 (degree)  C., 27.5 MPa) cannot be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In the past, hoses composed of an inner tube, reinforcing layer, and outer cover with an inner tube and outer cover made out of a thermoplastic resin composition, thermoplastic elastomer composition, or other thermoplastic material have been capable of reducing production costs since they do not require a vulcanization step.
      <br/>
      These hoses have, therefore, come into wide use.
      <br/>
      In these conventional hoses, the bonding between the inner tube and the reinforcing layer and the bonding between reinforcing layers have been performed using moisture curing type urethane adhesives and other ordinary temperature-curing type adhesives or using copolyester resin or olefin resin or other hot melt type adhesive resins and heating after the formation of the inner tube, reinforcing layer, and outer cover so as to melt the adhesive resin and cause bonding.
      <br/>
      Further, hoses which use a high rigidity thermoplastic resin for at least one of the inner tube and outer cover, whereby do not require bonding of the inner tube and reinforcing layer or bonding between the reinforcing layers are being used.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      However, with a hose using an ordinary temperature-curing type adhesive, since the adhesive is a reactive type, it cures with heat during use.
      <br/>
      The bonding layer becomes hard and, when the hose is subjected to repeated bending or pressure changes, the hardening of the bonding layer causes the fibers of the reinforcing layer to break and causes a problem in the durability of the hose.
      <br/>
      Further, if a hot melt type adhesive resin is used, due to the limitations in the order of formation of the layers, with ordinary processes of production, there is no bond between the bonding layer and the layer above it, and therefore it is necessary to heat the bonding layer to cause it to bond with the layer above it.
      <br/>
      Since this means heating from the outside of the hose after the formation of the outer cover until the adhesive resin melts, an excessive amount of heat is given to the hose.
      <br/>
      This causes dimensional changes in the hose or uneven tension to the fibers of the reinforcing layer, whereby the uniformity of the hose is impaired and sufficient durability is made impossible.
      <br/>
      Further, in recent years, there have been strong demands for making hoses more flexible for the purpose of hose attachment, but a hose using a low rigidity (or flexible) thermoplastic material for the inner tube and not having the layers bonded to each other has problems in terms of its durability, and therefore, large problems in use.
      <br/>
      Further, in the case of an ordinary temperature-curing type adhesive, an organic solvent is used, and therefore, there are problems in terms of the environment.
      <br/>
      In the case of a hot melt type adhesive, there are problems in the productivity due to the heat treatment step after the formation of the outer cover.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In the past, further, a high pressure hose has, for example, been composed of an inner tube having a thermoplastic resin material for at least the outer circumference of the inner tube, at least one reinforcing layer composed of reinforcing yarn braided around the outer circumference of the inner tube, and an outer cover covering the surface of the same.
      <br/>
      In such a hose, however, the bondability between the inner tube having a thermoplastic resin material for at least the outer circumference of the inner tube and the reinforcing yarn braided around the outer circumference of the inner tube and the bondability between two or more reinforcing layers has a major influence on the flexibility and durability of the hose.
      <br/>
      If the bondability is poor, the inner tube and the reinforcing yarn will separate or the reinforcing layers will separate--adversely influencing the performance of the hose.
      <br/>
      In the past, the reinforcing yarn was braided around the outer circumference of the inner tube composed of the thermoplastic resin material or, further, when there were two or more reinforcing layers, a solvent based adhesive was used, the reinforcing yarn braided around the outer circumference of the inner tube, and the reinforcing layers bonded.
      <br/>
      There were also cases of use of means other than solvent type adhesives such as the use of infrared rays, far infrared rays, near infrared rays, ultrasonic waves, high frequency heating, electrical induction heating, etc. to heat an inner tube composed of a thermoplastic resin material or an adhesive resin layer composed of a thermoplastic resin material arranged between two or more reinforcing layers after the formation of the hose by an oven or other heating apparatus from the outer surface of the outer cover so as to bond the inner tube and the reinforcing yarn or the reinforcing layers.
      <br/>
      When a solvent type adhesive is used, however, there tend to be problems in safety and health or problems of pollution due to the evaporation of the solvent, one or two days are required for the aging for achieving a practical strength, and it was difficult to improve the productivity.
      <br/>
      Further, in the case of the latter method of using a heating apparatus, the component parts have been subjected to aggravated dimensional changes, aging, etc. and therefore, the effect on the quality has been high (heating of just the surface of the target object has been impossible), there have been limitations as to the installation space, the equipment has been high in price and large in size, and there have been other problems.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is clear that there have been many problems in the method of bonding the above conventional inner tube and the reinforcing yarn or the bonding between reinforcing layers.

    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="58">
      The thermoplastic elastomer composition constituting the-inner tube and outer cover of the hose according to the first embodiment of the present invention means one which comprises a blend of a sufficient amount of a thermoplastic copolyester elastomer to give thermoplasticity to the hose and a sufficient amount of an at least partially vulcanized acrylic rubber to give rubbery elasticity wherein the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer component at least partially forms a continuous phase (matrix phase) in which the at least partially vulcanized acrylic rubber is present in the rubber component as a discontinuous phase (dispersed phase).
      <br/>
      A thermoplastic resin may further be dispersed in the discontinuous phase (rubber phase) to form a so-called "salami" structure.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The thermoplastic copolyester elastomer, which is the first component of the thermoplastic elastomer composition according to the present invention, is known as a multiple block copolymer having a polyester and a polyether as main recurring units.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, such known thermoplastic copolyester elastomers are used.
      <br/>
      As typical examples of such thermoplastic copolyester elastomers, for example, the following may be mentioned.
    </p>
    <p num="60">The thermoplastic copolyester elastomers usable in the present invention are a random and multiple block copolyester composed of recurring units of a polyester and polyether, recurring units of a polyester, (poly)lactone, and polyether, or recurring units of a polyester and polyimide ether and include a copolyether ester elastomer, (poly)lactone-modified copolyether ester elastomer, and copolyether imide ester elastomer.</p>
    <p num="61">A suitable thermoplastic copolyether ester elastomer and (poly)lactone-modified copolyether ester elastomer is produced by the conventionally employed esterification/condensation polymerization method from (i) at least one diol, (ii) at least one dicarboxylic acid, (iii) at least one long chain ether glycol and, if necessary, (iv) at least one lactone or polylactone.</p>
    <p num="62">
      The diol (i) usable in the production of the copolyether ester elastomers and their (poly)lactone-modified forms include saturated and unsaturated aliphatic and alicyclic dihydroxy compounds and aromatic dihydroxy compounds.
      <br/>
      These diols preferably have low molecular weights, that is, molecular weights of approximately 300 or less.
      <br/>

      By using such a process of production, the resultant thermoplastic elastomer composition becomes one comprised of a thermoplastic resin phase at least partially forming a continuous phase in which a vulcanized rubber phase at least partially forming a discontinuous phase is finely dispersed, so the thermoplastic elastomer composition exhibits similar behavior to vulcanized rubber.

      The relationship of the following formula is preferable at the time of ordinary mixing in a range of temperature of 180 (degree)  C. to 350 (degree)  C. and a shear rate of 1000 to 8000 s-1 :
      <br/>
      ETA 2 / ETA 1 &lt;4.0
      <br/>
      ( ETA 1 / ETA 2)( PHI 2 / PHI 1)&lt;1 0 (slashed zero)
      <br/>
      Where,  ETA 1 : Viscosity of thermoplastic copolyester elastomer (a) at time of melt mixing
      <br/>
      ETA 2 : Viscosity of rubber composition (b) at time of melt mixing
      <br/>
      PHI 1 : Volume fraction of thermoplastic copolyester elastomer (a)
      <br/>
      PHI 2 : Volume fraction of rubber composition (b)
    </p>
    <p num="202">
      Here, the viscosity at the time of melt mixing means the melt viscosity of the component at any temperature or shear rate at the time of melt mixing.
      <br/>
      The melt viscosity of the polymer material is dependent on the temperature, shear rate (s-1), and shear stress, and therefore, the stress and shear rate of the polymer material at any temperature at the molten state able to flow through a capillary tube, in particular, the temperature region at the time of mixing, are measured and the melt viscosity q calculated by the following formula:
      <br/>
      ETA = SIGMA  GAMMA
    </p>
    <p num="203">where,  SIGMA : shear stress,  GAMMA : shear rate</p>
    <p num="204">Note that the melt viscosity was measured using a capillary rheometer (Capillograph IC) made by Toyo Seiki.</p>
    <p num="205">By mixing in the range of the above formula, the kneadability is stabilized, the rubber ratio is controlled, a high rubber ratio can preferably be achieved, and a thermoplastic elastomer composition which is flexible and has a high elongation at break can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="206">
      The thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention obtained is improved in the compatibility of the rubber component and resin component by the addition of the compatibilizer and as a result has less of a reduction of the elongation at break, which had been a problem in the conventional acrylic rubber/polyester based thermoplastic elastomer composition, so can give a composition superior in the breakage resistance.
      <br/>
      Due to this, it is possible to obtain a composition satisfactory in the oil resistance, heat resistance, and breakage resistance required for a high pressure hose.
      <br/>
      By using this composition, production of a hose satisfactory in the hose impulse durability becomes possible.
      <br/>
      This composition is not limited to use for just hoses and can be used for various materials where oil resistance, heat resistance, and breakage resistance are demanded.

    <p num="207">
      Specific examples will now be given of the above three processes of production to give a more detailed explanation.
      <br/>
      Note that these examples do not particularly limit the processes of production.
    </p>
    <p num="208">The first process mixes the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer (a), rubber composition (b), and compatibilizer (c) by a twin-screw mixer/extruder etc. in the molten state while imparting compatibility and adds the vulcanizing agent while mixing to dynamically vulcanize the rubber composition.</p>
    <p num="209">When this process is performed using a twin-screw mixer/extruder, this is provided with inlets for simultaneously or separating charging at least the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer, rubber composition, and compatibilizer and an inlet for charging the vulcanization agents and with a mixing use screw portion for the vulcanization and mixing of the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer, rubber composition, and compatibilizer and a mixing using screw portion for the dynamic vulcanization after charging the vulcanizing agents between the inlets for the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer, rubber composition, and compatibilizer and the inlet for the vulcanizing agents.</p>
    <p num="210">The temperature of the portion performing the heating and mixing and the dynamic vulcanization is preferably 180 to 300 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="211">The screw configuration, volume rate of flow, and the like are preferably adjusted so that the residence time at the portion performing the dynamic vulcanization is becomes 15 to 300 sec.</p>
    <p num="212">The screw speed is preferably adjusted so that the shear rate becomes 1000 to 8000 sec-1.</p>
    <p num="213">Here, the residence time at the portion for performing the dynamic vulcanization is calculated by multiplying the filling rate with the total volume of the portion for performing the dynamic vulcanization and dividing this by the volume rate of flow.</p>
    <p num="214">
      The shear rate is calculated by taking the product obtained by multiplication of the number of rotations of the screw around the circle drawn by the front ends of the screw for 1 sec. and dividing by the distance between the front ends.
      <br/>
      That is, the shear rate is a value obtained by dividing the speed of the front ends by the distance between the front ends.
    </p>
    <p num="215">
      In the thus configurated twin-screw mixer/extruder, first the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer for forming the continuous phase is pelletized and charged from the resin component inlet, then the compatibilizer is pelletized and charged from the compatibilizer inlet.
      <br/>
      They are then heated, melted, and mixed together.
      <br/>
      Next, the unvulcanized rubber composition in which is blended all of the components other than the vulcanizing agents are pelletized and charged from the rubber component inlet.
      <br/>
      The mixture is mixed to disperse this finely in the thermoplastic resin phase forming the continuous phase.
    </p>
    <p num="216">Here, the compatibilizer may be charged after the rubber component or may be charged at the same time as the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer or the rubber composition.</p>
    <p num="217">After the rubber composition is dispersed in the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer, the vulcanizing agents (cross-linking agent, vulcanization accelerator, vulcanization aid, or other additive required for the cross-linking reaction) is charged from the vulcanizing agent inlet in the state with the two mixed and the rubber component (rubber composition) is dynamically vulcanized while mixing.</p>
    <p num="218">Further, if necessary, an antioxidant or other compounding agents may be charged and mixed at the same time as or separately from the resin component, rubber component, and vulcanizing agents.</p>
    <p num="219">The composition is held in the twin-screw mixer/extruder until the dynamic vulcanization is completed and is discharged and cooled rapidly after the dynamic vulcanization ends so as to obtain the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="220">
      By performing the dynamic vulcanization in this way, a state where the rubber composition is sufficiently dispersed in the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer is obtained.
      <br/>
      Further, since the rubber composition is vulcanized, this state of dispersion will not change even after the mixing and can be held stably.
      <br/>
      Further, since the mixing time is short, there is little degradation of the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer or rubber composition.
    </p>
    <p num="221">
      Accordingly, the resultant thermoplastic elastomer composition will not change in structure even when shaped by heating, so can be shaped using an ordinary resin extruder or injection molding machine etc.
      <br/>
      The shaped article therefore has rubber elasticity even without applying any particular vulcanization step.
    </p>
    <p num="222">The second process mixes the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer and rubber composition by a twin-screw mixer/extruder etc. in the molten state, adds the vulcanizing agent while mixing to dynamically vulcanize the rubber composition, and further adds a compatibilizer during the mixing.</p>
    <p num="223">The third process mixes the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer, rubber composition, and a partial amount of the compatibilizer to be added in a twin-screw mixer/extruder etc. in a molten state, adds the vulcanizing agent and the remaining compatibilizer while mixing, and mixes while dynamically vulcanizing the rubber composition so as to further enhance the compatibility.</p>
    <p num="224">In the second and third processes, the compatibilizer may be charged simultaneously with or separately from the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer or rubber composition.</p>
    <p num="225">The second and third processes can give the desired thermoplastic elastomer composition by a process of a twin-screw mixer/extruder the same as the first process except for the difference in timing of the addition of the compatibilizer.</p>
    <p num="226">
      As explained above, the compatibilizer may be mixed in at the time of addition of the rubber composition and thermoplastic copolyester elastomer, may be mixed in at the time of addition of the vulcanizing agents, and may be added divided into two times, that is, the time of addition of the rubber composition and thermoplastic copolyester elastomer and the time of addition of the vulcanizing agent.
      <br/>
      Preferably it is added by the above first process.
    </p>
    <p num="227">Therefore, the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention is improved in the compatibility at the interface between the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer and rubber composition since a compatibilizer is added and vulcanization is performed while mixing until the rubber composition finely disperses as a discontinuous phase in the continuous phase of the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer.</p>
    <p num="228">
      That is, the present invention gives a composition which is improved in the elongation at break of the resultant composition, has an enhanced breakage resistance, and has physical properties excellent for a high pressure hose by further blending into the thermoplastic elastomer composition comprised of a rubber composition and thermoplastic copolyester elastomer a compatibilizer comprised of an acrylate unit A(x), epoxy group unit B(y), and olefin unit C(z).
      <br/>
      By using this composition, it becomes possible to produce a hose satisfactory in impulse durability.
    </p>
    <p num="229">The second embodiment of the present invention relates to a hose comprising the thermoplastic elastomer composition according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="230">
      The hose of the present invention has the structure shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The hose 1 is composed of an inner tube 2, reinforcing layer 3, and outer cover 4.
      <br/>
      At least one of the inner tube 2 and outer cover 4 is formed from the thermoplastic elastomer composition according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      So long as it is in the range where the properties of the hose of the present invention are not impaired, a composition other than the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention may also be used for one of the inner tube and outer cover.
      <br/>
      By using the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention in this way for one of the inner tube or outer cover, a hose having the desired performance can be obtained, but the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention may also be used for both of the inner tube and outer cover.
      <br/>
      When using the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention for one of the inner tube or outer cover, the composition constituting the other tube is not particularly limited so long as it has a flexibility and heat resistance of an extent which does not impair the properties of the hose of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Thermoplastic elastomer compositions composed of other combinations of thermoplastic resins and rubber compositions may be exemplified.
      <br/>
      In particular, a thermoplastic elastomer composition composed of an ethylene-propylene-diene copolymer rubber (EPDM) and polypropylene (PP) etc. may be preferably mentioned.
      <br/>
      A thermoplastic elastomer composition having the same configuration as the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention but not containing the compatibilizer (c) and containing just (a) polyester thermoplastic resin and (b) vulcanized rubber composition of the rubber having the acryl group and epoxide group may be used as the other composition.
      <br/>
      Which of the inner tube and outer cover the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention is used for is not particularly limited, but, for example, when using a combination of Santoprene (made by AES), SARLINK (made by DSM), or another EPDM/PP thermoplastic elastomer composition and the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention, the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention is preferably used for the inner tube.
      <br/>
      This is because if the composition of the present invention with its high elongation and breakage resistance is used for the inner tube, the breakage resistance such as higher pressure resistance of the hose becomes high.
    </p>
    <p num="231">The reinforcing layer constituting the hose of the present invention is not particularly limited, but like the reinforcing layer of a conventional hose may be a layer of a yarn produced from a vinylon fiber, rayon fiber, polyester fiber, nylon fiber, aromatic polyamide fiber, etc. or a hard steel wire etc. braided or wrapped in a spiral.</p>
    <p num="232">Such a hose of the present invention may be easily produced by a known process, that is, by extruding a thermoplastic elastomer composition.</p>
    <p num="233">
      Further, the hose of the present invention may be changed in the composition of the thermoplastic elastomer composition constituting the inner tube and outer cover or may use another resin at the same time in accordance with its application.
      <br/>
      Further, in accordance with need, it may have a filler, stabilizer, coloring agent, etc. blended in it.
    </p>
    <p num="234">
      Further, in the production of the hose of the present invention, it is possible to produce the inner tube by a known extrusion process, provide a bonding layer on its outer surface if necessary by coating an adhesive etc., braid the reinforcing fiber over the same, provide a bonding layer on it, if necessary, by coating an adhesive etc., and cover the same with an outer cover by extrusion so as to bond the layers of the hose integrally by bonding layers.
      <br/>
      For the bonding layers between the inner tube and reinforcing layer, reinforcing layer and other reinforcing layer, and reinforcing layer and outer cover, an adhesive or adhesive resin etc. may be used.
      <br/>
      When using an adhesive resin, it is possible to form the bonding layer by an ordinarily used resin extruder.
      <br/>
      As the hose adhesive used in the past, a generally used urethane based ordinary temperature-curing type adhesive etc. may be exemplified.
      <br/>
      Further, as an adhesive resin, an olefin based, polyamide based, polyester based, and polyurethane based or other thermoplastic resin or thermoplastic elastomer and their compositions may be exemplified.
      <br/>
      Note that whichever adhesive material is used as the bonding layer, the thickness of the bonding layer is preferably 10 to 500  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="235">According to the fourth embodiment of the present invention, the silicone used as the component (A) of the thermoplastic elastomer is an organosiloxane, preferably polydimethylsiloxane and its modified forms, preferably methyl methacrylate (MMA), ethylenevinyl acetate (EVA), polyethylene (PE), or other graft modified form.</p>

    <p num="331">
      In the process of production of the thermoplastic elastomer composition according to the present invention, the process of production for a known thermoplastic resin composition may be used.
      <br/>
      A batch type process of production may be used or a continuous process of production using a twin-screw mixer/extruder etc. where the thermoplastic resin is continuously fed, melted, mixed, and transported while successively adding the rubber composition or vulcanizing agent etc. to produce the elastomer composition may be used.
      <br/>
      The components a and b are sufficiently mixed and dynamically vulcanized to make the component A, then the components B and C are mixed.
    </p>
    <p num="332">An example of a preferable process of production of the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention will now be explained.</p>
    <p num="333">
      The machine usable for mixing the component A (components a and b) and component B and component C in the production of the thermoplastic elastomer composition is not particularly limited, but a screw extruder, kneader, Banbury mixer, twin-screw mixer/extruder, etc. may be exemplified.
      <br/>
      Among these, when considering holding a melt of the component a (thermoplastic resin) and the component b (rubber composition) in these devices, mixing the rubber phase to finely disperse in the same, adding the vulcanizing agent (cross-linking agent) of the component c, and mixing until the cross-linking of the rubber phase is finished at a temperature for accelerating the cross-linking for dynamic vulcanization, use of a twin-screw mixer/extruder is preferable.
      <br/>
      Further, two or more types of mixers may be used for successive mixing.
    </p>
    <p num="334">
      That is, the component A is a thermoplastic elastomer composition produced by dynamic vulcanization (Dynamic Cure or Dynamic Cross-linking) in which the vulcanization of the rubber is promoted while mixing the thermoplastic resin and rubber composition, that is, the vulcanization of the rubber is dynamically promoted.
      <br/>
      By using such a process of production, the resultant thermoplastic elastomer composition becomes one composed of a thermoplastic resin phase at least partially forming a continuous phase in which a vulcanized rubber phase at least partially forming a discontinuous phase is finely dispersed, and therefore, the thermoplastic elastomer composition exhibits similar behavior to vulcanized rubber.
      <br/>
      Further, since at least the continuous phase is a thermoplastic resin phase, processing like with a thermoplastic resin is possible at the time of shaping for each products.
    </p>
    <p num="335">Next, an example of the process of production will be explained in more detail based on the usual mixing by a twin-screw mixer/extruder.</p>
    <p num="336">First, pellets of the component a are charged from a first inlet of the twin-screw mixer/extruder and blended, mixed, kneaded, and heated by the twin screws.</p>

      On the other hand, the component b is mixed using a Banbury mixer or other rubber use mixer such as kneader while adding to the rubber component, in accordance with need, a reinforcing agent, antioxidant, processing aid, etc., then is formed into a sheet of a thickness of 2 to 2.5 mm by a rubber use roll etc. as a so-called "master batch" not containing a vulcanization system.
      <br/>
      The sheet is then pelletized by a rubber use pellitizer.
      <br/>
      As explained above, the component a is melted and heated by the twin-screw mixer/extruder, then the thus pelletized component b is charged from the second inlet of the twin-screw mixer/extruder to make the component b disperse in the component a.
    </p>
    <p num="338">
      Note that when adding the component b, use may be made at the same time of stearic acid, zinc stearate, wax, or another processing aid.
      <br/>
      In this case, the component b and the stearic acid etc. are mixed by a Banbury mixer etc., then pelletized and charged into the twin-screw mixer/extruder component.
    </p>
    <p num="339">After this, the vulcanizing agent or vulcanization aid is charged from a third inlet of the twin-screw mixer/extruder to cause vulcanization (dynamic vulcanization) of the component b while mixing.</p>
    <p num="340">
      By vulcanizing in this way, the vulcanization is performed in the state with the component b fully dispersed in the component a and further in the state with the component b of a sufficient fineness so a component A is prepared comprising the component a forming the continuous phase (i.e., matrix) in which the at least partially partially vulcanized component b is stably dispersed as the dispersed phase (i.e., domain).
      <br/>
      Such a thermoplastic elastomer composition (i.e., component A) is preferably comprised with at least part of the thermoplastic resin forming the continuous phase and at least part of the rubber composition forming the discontinuous phase and with a particle size of the vulcanized rubber composition forming the discontinuous phase of not more than 50  MU m, more preferably 10 to 1  MU m.

      <br/>
      Next, an extruder having a melt extrusion mechanism or a simplified extruder or a general resin use injection molding machine or simplified injection molding machine may be used to extrude or injection mold the same into various shapes needed for each products.

    <p num="345">
      As the melt mixing conditions of the component a and the component b, the mixing temperature is, for example, 150 to 350 (degree)  C., in particular, 150 to 300 (degree)  C. is preferable, but it is not particularly limited so long as it is at least the temperature where the olefin thermoplastic resin component melts.

      The shear rate is calculated by taking the product obtained by multiplication of the number of rotations of the screw around the circle drawn by the front ends of the screw for 1 sec. and dividing by the distance between the front ends.

      That is, the shear rate is a value obtained by dividing the speed of the front ends by the distance between the front ends.

    <p num="368">
      In the composition of the present invention, the epoxy group-containing thermoplastic resin (i.e., component C) works as a compatibilizer, contributes to the bonding with the rubber particles dispersed in the olefin thermoplastic resin at the interface of the thermoplastic resin, improves the elongation and tear properties, and therefore enables production of a thermoplastic elastomer composition superior in both elongation and tear properties and having a high breakage resistance and, further, enables a high bonding strength even when used as a bonding layer.
      <br/>
      By using this composition of the present invention, it becomes possible to produce a hose satisfactory in the impulse resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="369">Such a hose of the present invention can be easily produced by a known process, that is, by extruding a thermoplastic elastomer composition.</p>

      The sixth aspect of the present invention is one in which a laminate is successfully obtained between a layer of a thermoplastic elastomer composition comprised of a polyolefin thermoplastic resin in which is blended an at least partially cross-linked elastomer component and a fiber reinforcing layer by using a thermoplastic adhesive resin such as a modified polyolefin resin or polyester resin.
      <br/>
      For example, the thermoplastic adhesive resin is interposed between the hose inner tube/fiber reinforcing layer, the fiber reinforcing layers, or the fiber reinforcing layer/outer cover and bonds the same by hot melting under a heat reaction.
      <br/>
      Since it is possible to obtain a strong bond between all of the above layers, it becomes possible to remarkably improve the hose durability.
      <br/>
      Further, it becomes possible to bond a thermoplastic elastomer composition composed of a difficult to bond material--a polyolefin thermoplastic resin--in which is blended an at least partially cross-linked elastomer component.

      In the present invention, as the thermoplastic adhesive resin, a maleic anhydride or epoxy-modified polyolefin resin or polyester resin is used.

      Further, as the polyester resin used here, there are ones obtained by condensation polymerization of a polyhydric alcohol and a polyhydric carboxylic acid, but a polyester resin comprised mainly of terephthalic acid and 1,4-butanediol and containing another copolymerization component (for example isophthalic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, or other carboxylic acid or ethylene glycol or other polyhydric alcohol) is preferably used.

    <p num="375">
      Further, a blend of the maleic anhydride-modified polyolefin resin and/or epoxy-modified polyolefin resin with a polyester resin sometimes requires improvement of physical properties in terms of the compatibility.

      Further, the ratio of the thermoplastic resin component and elastomer component constituting the above thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention is not particularly limited, but the elastomer component is preferably 10 to 90% by weight, based upon the weight of the thermoplastic resin.
      <br/>
      If the amount of the thermoplastic resin blended is too large, the rubber elasticity of the resultant thermoplastic elastomer composition falls and the heat softening resistance drops.
      <br/>
      Conversely, if too small, the melt fluidity of the thermoplastic elastomer composition falls and shaping becomes difficult.
      <br/>
      If further smaller, the thermoplastic resin component serving as the continuous phase and the elastomer component serving as the dispersed phase will not physically works and mixing will become difficult.

      The cross-linking of the elastomer component may be performed by mixing the thermoplastic resin and the elastomer component not containing the cross-linking agent in a molten state in a twin-screw mixer/extruder etc. to cause the elastomer component to disperse as the dispersed phase (i.e., domain) in the thermoplastic resin forming the continuous phase (i.e., matrix) and, simultaneously, adding and mixing the cross-linking agent for cross-linking the elastomer component, that is, by dynamic cross-linking.

      The dynamic cross-linking is not limited to the above method.

      <br/>
      Further, the fiber reinforcing layer may be formed by cutting a fiber woven fabric into a tape and wrapping this around the tube in a spiral manner.

      Further, when there are two or more fiber reinforcing layers in the hose of the present invention, arrangement of the thermoplastic adhesive resin of the present invention between the fiber reinforcing layers is more preferable from the viewpoint of the resistance to bursting pressure of the hose.

      In this case, for the bonding between the fiber reinforcing layer and this other thermoplastic elastomer composition or other resin layer, in addition to the thermoplastic adhesive resin of the present invention, an isocyanate based, phenol resin based, epoxy resin based, or urethane based adhesive may be used.

      When using the thermoplastic adhesive resin of the present invention, it is possible to simultaneously melt and extrude this with the inner tube so as to form the bonding layer.

      In the case of a process forming the thermoplastic adhesive resin of the present invention between the fiber reinforcing layer and outer cover, the thermoplastic adhesive resin and the thermoplastic resin or thermoplastic elastomer composition for forming the outer cover may be simultaneously melt extruded.

      While a mandrel was used in the process of production of the above hose, since the hose of the present invention does not require a vulcanization step after cross-linking the rubber such as in an ordinary rubber hose or a hose of a composite rubber/resin structure, there is no compression deformation due to the heat at the time of pressing and heating or deformation etc. due to the pressure applied at the time of heating, therefore the dimensional precision of the hose is easy to maintain.

      This thermoplastic copolyester elastomer composition has at least part of the rubber component constituting it cross-linked.
      <br/>
      The thermoplastic copolyester elastomer composition may be produced by using a Banbury mixer, Brabender mixer or other mixer/extruder (twin-screw mixer/extruder) etc., holding a melt of for example the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer and the acrylic rubber in these devices, adding a vulcanizing agent (cross-linking agent) while mixing and finely dispersing the rubber phase, and mixing at a temperature accelerating the cross-linking until the rubber phase is completely cross-linked.

      <br/>
      By using such a process of production, the resultant thermoplastic elastomer composition becomes one comprised of a thermoplastic resin phase at least partially forming a continuous phase in which a vulcanized rubber phase at least partially forming a discontinuous phase is finely dispersed, so the thermoplastic elastomer composition exhibits similar behavior to vulcanized rubber.

      The shear rate is calculated by taking the product obtained by multiplication of the number of rotations of the screw around the circle drawn by the front ends of the screw for 1 sec. and dividing by the distance between the front ends.

      The reinforcing layer of the hose of the present invention may use various types of fibers used for hoses in the past.

      For the bonding layer used between the reinforcing layer and outer cover in the present invention, in particular, in the present invention, a thermoplastic resin composition containing at least 50 % by weight of a thermoplastic polyester copolymer resin where the dicarboxylic acid constituting the polyester is an aromatic dicarboxylic acid and the Young's modulus at 120 (degree)  C. is at least 3.0 MPa is selected for use.

      Further, if this is over 1000 Pa * s, the extrudability of the bonding layer becomes poor and the amount of permeation into the reinforcing layer becomes excessively low, and therefore, the bonding with the reinforcing layer becomes poorer.

    <p num="465">The fiber material comprising the reinforcing layer of the hose produced by the process for producing a hose according to the present invention is a generally used reinforcing yarn made from a vinylon fiber, rayon fiber, polyester fiber, nylon fiber, aromatic polyamide fiber, etc.</p>
    <p num="466">The thermoplastic resin usable for the bonding layer of the hose produced by the production process of the present invention may be any thermoplastic resin and is not particularly limited so long as it has bondability with the inner tube and/or the reinforcing layer and does not cause a remarkable decline in performance due to softening, deterioration, etc. of the bonding layer at the temperature of use, but a modified olefin thermoplastic resin, thermoplastic polyester copolymer resin, etc. having a softening temperature of at least 110 (degree)  C. may be preferably exemplified.</p>

    <p num="469">In the production process of the hose 1 of FIG. 3, a copolyester resin or other thermoplastic material is extruded in a tubular form from an extruder to form the inner tube 2, the inner tube 2 is passed through the center of an annular heater which contacts the outer surface of the inner tube 2 to transfer heat to the same, whereby the outer surface of the inner tube 2 is heated to the melting temperature of the thermoplastic material or more so as to convert it to a molten state.</p>
    <p num="470">Next, a polyester fiber or another reinforcing material is knitted by a braider to form the reinforcing layer 3, then a urethane adhesive or other ordinary temperature-curing type adhesive is coated on the outer surface of the reinforcing layer 3 by a coater to form the bonding layer 6 between the outer cover and the reinforcing layer.</p>

      Note that in the case of the hose of FIG. 4, even if the inner tube is a vulcanized rubber or other flexible material, the inner tube 2 and the reinforcing layer 3 are firmly bonded by the bonding layer 5 between the inner tube 2 and the reinforcing layer.
    </p>
    <p num="476">Next, in the production process of the hose 1 of FIG. 5, the copolyester resin or other thermoplastic material is extruded in a tube by an extruder to form the inner tube 2, then the inner tube is passed through the center of an annular heater which transfers heat to it by contact with the outer surface of the inner tube so as to heat the outer surface of the inner tube 2 to at least the melting temperature of the thermoplastic material and convert it to a molten state.</p>

      Next, polyester fiber or another reinforcing material is braided by a braider to form the first reinforcing layer 8, then a thermoplastic material is extruded on the outer surface of the first reinforcing layer 8 in a tubular form by an extruder to form the bonding layer between the reinforcing layers 7.
      <br/>
      Next, continuously or discontinuously, this is passed through the center of an annular heater which contacts the outer surface of the bonding layer between the reinforcing layers 7 to conduct heat and heats the bonding layer between the reinforcing layers 7 to at least the melting temperature of the thermoplastic material to convert it to a molten state.
    </p>
    <p num="478">
      Next, the same reinforcing material as mentioned above is braided by a braider on the outer surface of the molten state bonding layer between the reinforcing layers 7 to form the second reinforcing layer 9, then a urethane adhesive or other ordinary temperature-curing type adhesive is coated by a coater on the outer surface of the second reinforcing layer 9 to form the bonding layer 6 between the outer cover 4 and the reinforcing layer 9.
      <br/>
      Next, a thermoplastic material is extruded in a tubular form by an extruder over the outer surface of the bonding layer 6 between the outer cover 4 and the reinforcing layer 9 to form the outer cover 4.
    </p>
    <p num="479">Next, in the production process of the hose 1 of FIG. 6, the copolyester resin or other thermoplastic material of the thermoplastic elastomer composition is extruded in a tube by an extruder to form the inner tube 2, then the thermoplastic material is extruded over the outer surface of the inner tube 2 by an extruder to form the bonding layer 4 for between the inner tube 2 and the reinforcing layer.</p>
    <p num="480">Next, continuously or discontinuously, this is passed through the center of an annular heater which transfers heat to it by contact with the outer surface of the bonding layer between the inner tube 2 and the reinforcing layer 8 so as to heat the bonding layer 4 between the inner tube 2 and the reinforcing layer 8 to at least the melting temperature of the thermoplastic material and convert it to a molten state.</p>

      Next, polyester fiber or another reinforcing material is braided by a braider to form the first reinforcing layer 8, then a thermoplastic material is extruded on the outer surface of the first reinforcing layer 8 in a tubular form by an extruder to form the bonding layer 7 between the reinforcing layers.
      <br/>
      Next, continuously or discontinuously, this is passed through the center of an annular heater which contacts the outer surface of the bonding layer 7 between reinforcing layers to conduct heat and heat the bonding layer 7 between the reinforcing layers to at least the melting temperature of the thermoplastic material to convert it to a molten state.
    </p>
    <p num="482">
      Next, the same type of reinforcing material is braided by a braider over the outer surface of the molten state bonding layer 7 between the reinforcing layers to form the second reinforcing layer 9, then a urethane adhesive or other ordinary temperature curing type adhesive is coated by a coater over the outer surface of the second reinforcing layer 9 to form the bonding layer 6 for between the outer cover and reinforcing layer.
      <br/>
      Next, a thermoplastic material is extruded by an extruder in a tubular form over the outer surface of the bonding layer 6 between the outer cover and the reinforcing layer to form the outer cover 4.
      <br/>
      Note that in this case as well, like in the case of the hose 1 of FIG. 4, it is possible to use a vulcanized rubber composition or other flexible material for the inner tube.
    </p>
    <p num="483">
      The hoses of the above FIG. 3 to FIG. 6 may all be made using a thermoplastic material other than at the reinforcing layers, so unlike hoses made of vulcanized rubber, will cure even without a vulcanization step when the temperature of the hose falls.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible for the individual steps of production of the hose to be performed continuously on a single manufacturing line.
      <br/>
      Further, even when a vulcanized rubber composition or other flexible material is used for the inner tube, it is possible to produce the hose by a single manufacturing line by the so-called "continuous vulcanization" or other manufacturing process.
    </p>
    <p num="484">As the heating means of the heater, hot air, infrared rays, far infrared rays, near infrared rays, ultrasonic waves, electroinduction, etc., may be used.</p>
    <p num="485">
      Further, the above hot melting can be performed, without the use of a heater, in the step of extruding the thermoplastic materials.
      <br/>
      That is, a similar effect can be obtained by heating the thermoplastic material in the extruder to at least the melting temperature, holding that temperature after extruding the thermoplastic material in the tubular form to form the inner tube or bonding layer, then proceeding to the next step, while maintaining that molten state.
    </p>
    <p num="486">
      A particularly preferable method is to raise the temperature of the bonding layer by bringing the heater into contact with the thermoplastic material.
      <br/>
      This enables the temperature of the bonding layer to be effectively raised.
      <br/>
      Further, it is possible to use these heating means at the same time, that is, to pass the tube through a heater after extrusion to hold the molten state.
    </p>
    <p num="487">A similar effect can be obtained even if performing the hot melting of the inner tube and the bonding layers after forming the reinforcing layers on the outer surfaces of the inner tube and the bonding layers.</p>
    <p num="488">
      The thermoplastic material usable for the bonding layer between the inner tube and the reinforcing layer, the bonding layer between the reinforcing layers, and the inner tube when the bonding layer between the inner tube and reinforcing layer is not used is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      Any thermoplastic material having bondability can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="489">
      However, the softening temperature of the material is preferably at least 110 (degree)  C. If less than 110 (degree)  C., the hose will easily soften at the time of use and the durability may fall.
      <br/>
      The structure of the reinforcing layer may be either a braided structure or a spiral structure.
    </p>
    <p num="490">A conventionally used urethane adhesive or other ordinary temperature curing type of adhesive will excessively cure due to the heat, during the use thereof, causing the bonding layer to become hard, and therefore, the repeated bending or changes in pressure of the fluid will cause the fiber reinforcing layer to break and the durability to fall, but the bonding layer of the present invention is composed of a polyester resin or other thermoplastic material, which is superior in heat aging resistance and resistance to bending fatigue and will not harden during the use thereof, and therefore it is possible to provide a flexible hose superior in the durability.</p>
    <p num="491">
      Further, the bonding layer of the present invention becomes molten by heating to above the softening temperature and can come into contact with the reinforcing layer in this molten state at least once, and therefore, the bonding layer penetrates into the reinforcing Layer at this time, causing a sprouting effect and an increase in the area of contact.
      <br/>
      This causes the bond to become stronger.
      <br/>
      The bonding strength is sustained over a long period with almost no fatigue, and therefore, a hose having excellent durability is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="492">A thermoplastic material having a softening temperature of less than 110 (degree)  C., however, may soften somewhat in a high temperature environment or through excessive repeated stress, whereby the durability is impaired.</p>
    <p num="493">
      Further, since the heating of the bonding layer in the present invention is performed at least before the formation of the outer cover, the amount of heat applied to the reinforcing layers and the other parts of the hose is far smaller than with heating after formation of the outer cover.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the heat degradation of the reinforcing layers etc. which can occur at the time of heating after formation of the outer cover does not occur in the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="494">
      Further, since the heating of the bonding layer in the present invention can be performed just by passing the tube through an annular heater or other simple construction heater, the heating can be performed in a continuous manufacturing line.
      <br/>
      Therefore, compared with the case where a heater generating a large amount of heat is used, such as heating after formation of the outer cover, the production process of the present invention does not require the many steps and is superior in the productivity.
      <br/>
      Further, in a process where the bonding layer is hot melted at the same time as being formed by an extruder, no separate heating step is required, and therefore, the productivity is even greater.
      <br/>
      Note that it is more preferable to use a thermoplastic resin for the bonding layer between the reinforcing layer and the outer cover as well.
    </p>
    <p num="495">
      In both of the first embodiment and the second embodiment of the ninth embodiment of the present invention, the heating means was a heater which heated the surface layer of the inner tube or the adhesive resin layer to a molten state just before braiding the reinforcing yarn.
      <br/>
      The heating means may also be constituted by a preheater which preheats the surface layer of the inner tube or the adhesive resin layer and a heater which heats the surface layer of the inner tube or the adhesive resin layer to a molten state immediately before braiding the reinforcing yarn.
    </p>
    <p num="496">
      Further, the preheater uses a hot air recirculating preheating system which preheats by blowing hot air on to the surface layer of the inner tube or the adhesive resin layer.
      <br/>
      The heater provided at the braiding die has a mechanism which contacts the outer surface layer of the inner tube or the adhesive resin layer and moves back and forth in the axial direction of the inner tube.
    </p>
    <p num="497">
      Further, by using a mechanism which contacts the outer surface layer of the inner tube or the adhesive resin layer, it is possible to efficiently heat the outer surface layer of the inner tube composed of a thermoplastic resin material or the surface of the adhesive resin layer by heat conduction by the minimum amount of heat until the molten state.
      <br/>
      Further, since the minimum amount of heat is used for the heating, energy is saved and it is possible to keep minimum the effect of heat degradation etc. of the thermoplastic resin material or other material constituting the hose.
    </p>
    <p num="498">Further, by using a mechanism which moves back and forth in the axial direction of the inner tube, it is possible to adjust the position where the reinforcing yarn is wound by the braider, that is, the distance between the braiding point and the melted part of the surface, and therefore, it is possible to control the molten state of the thermoplastic resin material at the braiding point, along with the heating temperature and the braiding speed and possible to obtain the optimal braided, heating, and bonding state depending upon the type and properties of the thermoplastic resin material.</p>
    <p num="499">The distance between the heater and the braiding point, the heating temperature, the braiding speed, and other braiding, heating, and bonding conditions, as explained above, may be suitably set, depending upon the type and the properties of the thermoplastic resin material, the production speed, and other conditions, but the distance between the heater and braiding point is preferably not more than 50 cm, the heating temperature at least the melting temperature of the thermoplastic resin material, and the braiding speed at least 0.1 m/min.</p>
    <p num="500">
      The heating mechanism of the heater may be any which satisfies the above requirements and may be attached to the portion of the braiding die through which the inner tube passes.
      <br/>
      It may be constituted by a heating tool, constituted by a band heater attached to the outer circumference of the braiding die and attached integrally to heat the braiding die as a whole, or constituted by a heater embedded in the braiding die for heating the braiding die as a whole.
    </p>
    <p num="501">Further, it is desirable to provide a heat insulating mechanism or cooling mechanism to at least one of the outer circumference of the heating apparatus and the outer circumference of the braiding die so as to prevent the other mechanism of the braider and the reinforcing yarn before braiding from being overly heated by the heat generated from the heater.</p>
    <p num="502">The present invention was achieved as described above and calls for heating at least one of the outer surface layer of an inner tube, with at least the outer circumference of the inner tube composed of a thermoplastic resin material extruded from an extruder, and an adhesive resin layer, composed of a thermoplastic resin material extruded from an extruder on reinforcing yarn, until at least one of the surface layers of the surface layer of the outer circumference of the inner tube and the adhesive resin layer melts in a step before the braiding of the reinforcing yarn by a braider.</p>
    <p num="503">By braiding the reinforcing layer in this state, it is possible to improve the bonding performance, without the use of a conventional solvent type adhesive or infrared ray, ultrasonic wave, or other expensive apparatus, possible to reliably bond the inner tube with the reinforcing yarn or the reinforcing layers with each other, possible to produce a hose efficiently, and possible to improve the productivity of a flexible, durable hose.</p>
    <p num="504">The thermoplastic resin material which may be used for the hose produced by the braider of the present invention means a generally used thermoplastic resin and thermoplastic elastomer and their compositions and is not particularly limited, but a polyolefin resin, polyamide resin, polyester resin, or other thermoplastic resin and their compositions, a polyolefin thermoplastic elastomer, polyamide thermoplastic elastomer, polyester thermoplastic elastomer, polyurethane thermoplastic elastomer, or other thermoplastic elastomer and their compositions, and thermoplastic elastomer compositions composed of these thermoplastic resins and thermoplastic elastomers in which a rubber composition containing a vulcanized rubber composition dispersed in a particle state may be exemplified.</p>
    <p num="505">
      Further, the material usable for the inner tube of the hose produced by the braider of the present invention is not limited to a thermoplastic resin material.
      <br/>
      It may be any hose where at least the outer circumference of the inner tube is composed of a thermoplastic resin material.
    </p>
    <p num="506">That is, it is possible to produce an integrally bonded hose composed of an inner tube of a vulcanized rubber composition on which a thermoplastic resin material is extruded for bonding with the same by the braider of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="507">Further, the fiber material constituting the reinforcing layer of the hose produced by the braider of the present invention is a generally used reinforcing yarn produced by a vinylon fiber, rayon fiber, polyester fiber, nylon fiber, aromatic polyamide fiber, etc.</p>
    <p num="508">
      Next, an explanation will be made of Examples of the present invention with reference to the attached drawings taking, as an example, the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 is a view of the general configuration of a vertical braider for a hose of a first example of the present invention.
      <br/>
      A hose 11 formed up to the inner tube composed of the thermoplastic material or the adhesive resin layer extruded from the not shown extruder is fed through a guide roller 12 into the braider 13.
      <br/>
      In the braider 13, a reinforcing yarn 14 is braided, then taken up by a take-up device 5, and supplied to the next step.
    </p>
    <p num="509">
      In the braider 13 are provided plurality of bobbins 16 on which a reinforcing yarn 14 is wrapped and a braiding die 17 for braiding the reinforcing yarn 14 on the hose 11 formed up to the inner tube or adhesive resin layer.
      <br/>
      There is further provided a heating means 18 for continuously heating the surface layer of the hose 11 formed up to the inner tube or the adhesive resin layer in a step before braiding the reinforcing yarn 14 on the hose 11 formed up to the inner tube or adhesive resin layer.
    </p>
    <p num="510">The heating means 18, as shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, is composed by a preheating device 19 for preheating the inner tube surface layer and a heating apparatus 20 provided at the braiding die 7 for heating the inner tube surface layer to a molten state immediately before braiding the reinforcing yarn 14.</p>
    <p num="511">Note that it is also possible not to use the preheating device 19 for preheating the inner tube surface layer, but to use the heating apparatus 20 to directly heat the inner tube surface layer to the molten state.</p>
    <p num="512">
      The preheating device 19, as shown in FIG. 8, is composed of a tubular body 21 of a predetermined length covering the hose 11 composed of the inner tube or adhesive resin layer at the step before the heating apparatus 20.
      <br/>
      The tubular body 21 is connected at a part thereof with a hot air supplying tube 21a for supplying hot air from a hot air supply device (not shown).
      <br/>
      This forms a hot air recirculating preheating system which preheats by blowing hot air circulated to the surface layer of the hose 11 formed up to the inner tube or adhesive resin layer.
    </p>
    <p num="513">Note that the temperature of the hot air may be freely set depending upon the melting temperature of the thermoplastic resin constituting the hose 11 formed up to the inner tube or adhesive resin layer.</p>
    <p num="514">Further, the heating apparatus 20 provided at the braiding die 17, as shown in FIG. 8 and FIG. 9, is provided with a heating tool 22, in the portion of the braiding die 17 through which the inner tube passes 17a, which contacts the outer surface layer 11a of the hose 11 formed up to the inner tube or adhesive resin layer and which moves back and forth in the axial direction (X--X direction) of the hose 11 formed up to the inner tube or adhesive resin layer.</p>
    <p num="515">
      That is, the inner diameter of the portion of the heating tool 22 which is inserted into the inner tube through portion 17a is formed to be the same diameter as the outer diameter dimension of the hose 11 formed up to the inner tube or adhesive resin layer.
      <br/>
      The hose 11 formed up to the inner tube or the adhesive resin layer always moves in contact with the heating tool 22.
    </p>
    <p num="516">
      The heating tool 22 is connected with a not shown heater by which it is heated to a certain temperature.
      <br/>
      It is formed so as to be able to move in the axial direction of the hose 1 formed up to the inner tube or the adhesive resin layer along with the movement of the braiding point P of the reinforcing yarn 14 to the hose 11 formed up to the inner tube or the adhesive resin layer.
    </p>
    <p num="517">
      Further, FIG. 10 shows a second example of the heating apparatus 20 provided at the braiding die 17.
      <br/>
      The heating apparatus 20 in this example has integrally attached thereto a band heater 23 for heating the braiding die 17 as a whole, at the outer circumference surface 17b of the braiding die 7.
    </p>
    <p num="518">
      Note that the band heater 23 is connected to a heating means (not shown).
      <br/>
      Therefore, this example forms an integral type braiding die 7 provided with a heating apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="519">
      Further, FIG. 11 shows a third example of the heating apparatus 20 provided at the braiding die 17.
      <br/>
      The heating apparatus 20 in this example is configured so that, when the braiding die 17 is produced from a casting, the heater 24 for heating is embedded inside the braiding die 17 integrally so as to heat the braiding die 17 as a whole.
    </p>
    <p num="520">Accordingly, in this example as well, in the same way as the above second example, the braiding die 17 is integrally provided with the heating apparatus.</p>
    <p num="521">As explained above, in the examples of the present invention, when braiding a reinforcing yarn 14 by a braider 13 over the outer circumference of a hose 11 formed up to an inner tube and an adhesive resin layer, with at least the outer circumference of the inner tube composed of an extruded thermoplastic resin material, just the outer surface layer 11aof the hose 11 formed up to the inner tube or adhesive resin layer is preheated by a preheater 19 to soften it, then the heating apparatus 20 is used to convert the softened outer surface layer 11a to a molten state, then immediately thereafter braiding is performed by a reinforcing yarn 14 taken up from a plurality of bobbins 16, the reinforcing yarn 14 is integrally embedded Inside the molten outer surface layer 11a, the braided hose 11 thus formed up to the inner tube or adhesive resin layer is taken up by a take-up device 15, then is formed integrally with an outer cover in a next outer cover forming step.</p>
    <p num="522">
      Note that it is also possible not to use the preheater 19 and to directly melt the outer surface layer 11a of the hose 11 formed up to the inner tube or adhesive resin layer by the heating apparatus 20, then immediately braid the reinforcing yarn 14.
      <br/>
      Further, when forming a plurality of reinforcing layers composed of reinforcing yarns 14, since intermediate layers are interposed, the intermediate layers are hot melted by a heating apparatus 20 and then the reinforcing layer 14 braided, and therefore, it is possible to form them integrally without using an adhesive etc.
    </p>
    <p num="523">As explained above, in the step before braiding the reinforcing yarn 14 by a braider 13 over the outer circumference of a hose 11 formed up to an inner tube or adhesive resin layer, with at least the outer circumference of the inner tube composed of a thermoplastic resin material extruded from an extruder, the outer circumference surface layer 11a of the hose 11 formed up to the inner tube or adhesive resin layer is heated to a molten state and the reinforcing layer braided therein, and therefore, it is possible to improve the bonding performance, without using a conventional solvent type adhesive or an infrared, ultrasonic wave, or other expensive piece of the equipment.</p>
    <p num="524">
      Further, this may be also applied to the case of formation of two or more reinforcing layers as in the second embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      By heating the adhesive resin layer and knitting the reinforcing yarn, it is possible to reliably bond the hose 11 formed up to the inner tube or the adhesive resin layer and the reinforcing yarn 14 or between the reinforcing layers, produce the hose efficiently, and raise the productivity of a hose having flexibility and a high durability.
    </p>
    <p num="525">Note that, while the above embodiments were explained with reference to a vertical braider, a horizontal braider may also be used.</p>

    <p num="536">1) Flexural Rigidity Test</p>
    <p num="537">Flexural Rigidity of Hose</p>
    <p num="538">The sample hoses were bent along arcs of various radii and the flexural force (kg) measured.</p>
    <p num="539">More specifically, the measurement started from a bending radius of 10 times the outer diameter of the sample hose, then the bending radius was successively changed up to 3 times and the flexural force measured.</p>
    <p num="540">
      From the results of the measurement, a graph was prepared showing the relationship between the flexural force and the bending radius.
      <br/>
      From the obtained graph, the flexural force at the time of the prescribed radius (4 times) was read and made the flexural rigidity of the hose.
    </p>
    <p num="541">Hoses with an equal flexibility in use in a range of flexibility of  +- 20% of the flexural rigidity 2 kg of an ordinary rubber hose (Comparative Example 1) were evaluated as "good" and those with +20% or more rigidity were evaluated as "poor".</p>
    <p num="542">2) Impact Pressure Test: According to JIS K6379</p>
    <p num="543">Using, as a test oil, a mineral oil corresponding to Type 2 defined in JIS K2213 (Turbine Oil), a rectangular wave of a maximum pressure of 27.5 MPa was repeatedly applied 200,000 times at an oil temperature of 93 (degree)  C. and the hose checked for bursting ("good" indicating no bursting).</p>
    <p num="544">
      Comparative Example I-1 is a hose made of a vulcanized rubber, not the thermoplastic elastomer of the present invention, and therefore, does not require a vulcanization step.
      <br/>
      Examples I-1 to I-4 of the present invention on the other hand do not require a vulcanization step, and therefore, can be dramatically reduced in manufacturing costs compared with the conventional example of Comparative Example I-1.
    </p>
    <p num="545">
      Further, there is the advantage that the flexural rigidity at the time of a low temperature is lower than Comparative Examples I-2 to I-4 which show hoses out of the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Comparative Examples I-2 to I-4 use thermoplastic elastomers according to the present invention, and therefore, do not require a vulcanization step and therefore have the advantage of being able to be dramatically reduced in manufacturing costs, but the acrylic rubber used does not satisfy the desired conditions, and therefore, the advantage of flexibility at low temperatures cannot be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="546">Accordingly, it is learned that hoses using the composition of the present invention can be reduced in manufacturing costs since they do not require vulcanization steps and further are superior in the flexibility at low temperatures.</p>

    <p num="593">
      First, the rubber and the compounding agents other than the vulcanization agent were charged into a hermetic type rubber use Banbury mixer, then formed into sheets using a rubber use roll.
      <br/>
      The sheets were then pelletized by a rubber use pelletizer.
    </p>
    <p num="594">
      Next, the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer, the pelletized rubber, and the compatibilizer were charged into a twin-screw mixer/extruder where they were mixed.
      <br/>
      Next, the vulcanizing agent was continuously added so as to dynamically vulcanize a rubber component dispersed as a domain in a matrix comprised of the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer and compatibilizer.
    </p>
    <p num="595">
      The mixing conditions were a melting temperature of 180 to 350 (degree)  C., a residence time in the portion performing the dynamic vulcanization of 15 to 300 seconds, and a shear rate of 1000 to 8000 sec-1.
      <br/>
      After the dynamic vulcanization, the composition was continuously extruded in strands from the twin-screw mixer/extruder, cooled, and cut by a cutter to lengths of about 3 mm (diameter about 2 mm) to obtain pellets of the thermoplastic elastomer composition.
    </p>
    <p num="596">The melt viscosity was measured by a capillary rheometer (Capillograph 1C) made by Toyo Seiki at a measurement temperature of 230 (degree)  C., a shear rate of 2432 s-1, an orifice diameter of 1 mm, and a capillary length of 10 mm.</p>
    <p num="597">
      Next, pellets of the thermoplastic elastomer composition were formed into sheets of a thickness of 2.0 mm by a usually used press forming machine for resin use at 230 (degree)  C. for 5 minutes and a pressure of 2.9 MPa and made into test pieces of the JIS standard No. 3 dumbbell shape (JIS K6251) and tear crescent shape (JIS K6252).
      <br/>
      The obtained test pieces were measured for elongation at break at 20 (degree)  C. (JIS K6251), tear strength crescent shape (JIS K6252), and Type A durometer hardness (JIS K6253) according to the JIS standards.

      Comparative Examples III-1 and III-3 are thermoplastic elastomer compositions not including (c), while Comparative Examples III-2 and III-4 use compounds not including an acrylate unit, which is the essential component of (c) of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As compared with these Comparative Examples, Examples III-1 to III-4 in which were blended the epoxy-modified olefin based polymer (c) comprised of the essential components of the present invention, that is, the acrylate unit A(x), epoxy group unit B(y), and olefin unit C(z) each had a high elongation at break and tensile strength and further were lower in hardness.

      That is, it was learned that they were superior in breakage resistance and flexibility.

      Comparative Example III-5 has a molar percentage y less than 0.005 and a small amount of y so is out of the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Comparative Example III-6 conversely has a molar percentage y more than 0.200 and a large amount of y so also is out of the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Comparative Example III-5 has too little of y, so the imparting of compatibility, the effect of blending in (c), is not sufficiently achieved.
      <br/>
      Compared with Comparative Example III-1, there was almost no improvement of the elongation at break and tear strength or reduction of the hardness.
      <br/>
      Comparative Example III-6 had too much of y, so the reactivity of (c) became excessive, self-curing due to the heat of the epoxy groups proceeded excessively during the mixing, and the desired thermoplastic elastomer composition was not obtained.
      <br/>
      Compared with the comparative examples, Examples III-5 to III-8 with amounts of y in the range of the present invention all could be mixed and were compatibized, the effect of blending of (c), so the thermoplastic elastomer compositions were also superior in the physical properties of bursting resistance and flexibility.

      These explain the range of the amount of blending of (a) in 100 parts by weight of the sum of the weight of the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer (a) and the weight of the rubber composition (not including the vulcanization agent) (b) containing an acryl group and epoxy group.
      <br/>
      Comparative Example III-7 has an amount of (a) of over 90 parts by weight or a larger amount of blending of (a) so is out of the range of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Comparative Example III-8 conversely has an amount of (a) of less than 30 parts by weight or a smaller amount of blending of (a) and therefore is also out of the range of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In both cases (c) is blended in the range of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Comparative Example III-7 has too much of (a) blended, so is high in hardness and inferior in flexibility.
      <br/>
      Comparative Example III-8 has too little amount of (a) blended, so (a) does not form a matrix phase, phase inversion is caused, and the mixing of the thermoplastic elastomer composition becomes impossible.
      <br/>
      Further, these results can be confirmed from the fact that the conditions of the mixability, that is, the relationship of the melt viscosity at the time of melt mixing arid the volume fraction, is not satisfied.
      <br/>
      Compared with the Comparative Examples, Examples III-9 to III-10, which are in the range of the present invention, are all mixable.

      Comparative Example III-9 shows the case where (c) is not blended, Comparative Example III-10 the case where the amount of (c) blended is less than 1 part by weight, that is, the amount of blending of (c) is small and out of the range of the present invention, and Comparative Example III-11 is conversely the case where the amount of (c) blended is more than 25 parts by weight, that is, the amount of (c) blended is large and out of the range of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Compared with Comparative Example III-9, since Comparative Example III-10 has too little an amount of blending of (c), the effects of (c) are not obtained and the improvement of the elongation at break and tear strength and the reduction of the hardness are insufficient.
      <br/>
      Further, since Comparative Example III-11 has too much of an amount of blending of (c), the amount of the epoxy groups, which are essential components of (c), becomes excessive and the self-curing due to the heat of the epoxy groups during mixing proceeds excessively so the desired thermoplastic elastomer composition could not be obtained.
      <br/>
      As opposed to the comparative examples, Examples III-11 to III-13, where the amount of blending of (c) is in the range of the present invention, all could be mixed.

    <p num="657">a) Abrasion Resistance=Abrasion Resistance Test</p>
    <p num="658">The abrasion resistance was measured by rubbing the surface of the outer cover of the hose by reciprocating motion of the corner portion 27 of the tester shown in FIG. 12 so as to abrade the outer cover and determining the number of reciprocating movements (in units of 10,000 * ) of the corner portion 27 until the reinforcing layer was exposed.</p>
    <p num="659">
      In this test, the tested hose 25 was passed through the axial center 26 and affixed, the corner portion 27 was brought into contact with the surface of the outer cover of the tested hose 25 by pushing down by a weight 28, the corner portion 27 was moved back and forth by the cylinder 29 and the piston 30 through the arm 31, and the arm 31 was held rotatably to the piston 30 by the pin 32.
      <br/>
      The corner portion 27 formed an angle of 90 (degree)  and had a front end of an arc shape with a radius of 0.4 mm. The corner portion 27 pressed against the surface of the outer cover of the tested hose 25 by a force of 14.7N (1.50 kgf).
    </p>
    <p num="660">b) Resistance to Softening Under Heat=High Temperature Bursting Test (120 (degree)  C.)</p>
    <p num="661">Predetermined metal fittings were attached to the two ends of the hose and the hots was tested for bursting at high temperatures in the following manner.</p>
    <p num="662">The pressure resistance test (bursting test) described in the JIS standard (JIS K 6349) was performed at a temperature of 120 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="663">The pressure until bursting was measured and evaluated as the bursting pressure (MPa).</p>
    <p num="664">c) Flexibility=Flexural Rigidity</p>
    <p num="665">The sample hoses were bent along arcs of various radii and the bending force (N) measured.</p>
    <p num="666">More specifically, the measurement started from a bending radius of 10 times the outer diameter of the sample hose, then the bending radius was successively changed up to 3 times and the bending force (N) measured.</p>
    <p num="667">
      From the results of the measurement, a graph was prepared showing the relationship between the bending force and the bending radius.
      <br/>
      From the obtained graph, the flexural force at the time of the prescribed radius (4 times) was read and made the flexural rigidity (N) of the hose.
    </p>
    <p num="668">These are examples showing the dependency on the amount of addition of the component (A) silicone and explain the effect of addition of silicone.</p>
    <p num="669">
      Reference Example IV-1 is a conventional plastic hose which uses an ether based polyurethane thermoplastic elastomer for the outer cover.
      <br/>
      It explains the effect of the present invention based on the abrasion resistance of the hose.
    </p>
    <p num="670">
      Comparative Example IV-1 is a hose of a thermoplastic elastomer composition not containing the component (A) silicone of the present invention and has an abrasion similar to the Reference Example, that is, a poor abrasion resistance.
      <br/>
      The thermoplastic elastomer composition, however, has a low hardness at ordinary temperature and a superior Young's modulus at 120 (degree)  C. compared with an ether based polyurethane thermoplastic elastomer, and therefore has a low flexural rigidity at ordinary temperature and flexibility and has a high bursting pressure in a high temperature bursting test and is superior in resistance to heat softening.
    </p>
    <p num="671">
      Examples IV-1 to IV-5 are thermoplastic elastomer compositions and hoses in which polydimethylsiloxane is blended as the component (A) silicone of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the production of the thermoplastic elastomer composition, the component (A) was added at the time of mixing of the components (B) and (C).
    </p>
    <p num="672">
      As shown in Example IV-1, with blending of 0.5 part by weight of silicone, the abrasion resistance is improved about two fold.
      <br/>
      The effect of improvement of the abrasion resistance by the blending of the component (A) is therefore learned.
      <br/>
      Further, in comparison with Comparative Example IV-1, the hardness at ordinary temperature and the Young's modulus at 120 (degree)  C. are similar while the flexibility and resistance to heat softening are equal to or superior to Comparative Example IV-l.
    </p>
    <p num="673">Further, as shown in Examples IV-2 to IV-5, if the amount of the silicone blended is increased, the abrasion resistance is further improved, while there is almost no change in the flexibility or resistance to heat softening which both remain excellent.</p>
    <p num="674">
      Comparative Example IV-2 is a thermoplastic elastomer composition and hose in which 15 parts by weight of the component (A) silicone is added.
      <br/>
      It is excellent in all of the abrasion resistance, flexibility, and resistance to heat softening, but compared with Example IV-5, no improvement is observed in the abrasion resistance.
      <br/>
      That is, when over 10 parts by weight of the component (A) are added, there is no longer any effect of improvement.
      <br/>
      Considering economy, it is learned that blending not more than 10 parts by weight is suitable.
    </p>
    <p num="675">
      These thermoplastic elastomer compositions and hoses have blended in them as the silicone of the component (A) MMA (methyl methacrylate) modified polydimethyl siloxane.
      <br/>
      The thermoplastic elastomer composition is obtained by the method of adding the component (A) at the time of mixing the components (B) and (C) (Example IV-6) and the method of producing a thermoplastic elastomer composition not including the component (A) and then adding it at the time of extrusion (Examples IV-7 and IV-8).
      <br/>
      The MMA modified polydimethyl siloxane can be pelletized, so can be fed without fouling the hopper etc. at the time of later addition by a single-screw extruder etc., so can be more preferably used.
    </p>
    <p num="676">
      Example IV-6 shows similar properties compared with Examples IV-1 to IV-s.
      <br/>
      It is learned that even if MMA modified polydimethyl siloxane is used as the component (A), the effect of improvement of the abrasion resistance similar to that of polydimethyl siloxane, flexibility, and resistance to heat softening can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="677">
      Further, in Examples IV-7 and IV-8 where the component (A) was added later, it was learned that a similar effect of improvement of the abrasion resistance could be obtained with a smaller amount of blending compared with Example IV-6.
      <br/>
      This is believed to be because, compared with the method of addition of the component (A) at the time of mixing the components (B) and (C), the component (A) is concentrated at the phase of the component (B) forming the matrix phase and, as a result, the state is formed where the concentration of the component (A) at the abrasion surface is high.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is learned that as the method of addition of the component (A), the method of producing a thermoplastic elastomer composition not containing the component (A) and then later blending the component (A) to form the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention is a more preferable method.
    </p>
    <p num="678">
      These thermoplastic elastomer compositions and hoses have blended in them as the silicone of the component (A) EVA (ethylvinyl acetate) modified polydimethyl siloxane.
      <br/>
      The thermoplastic elastomer composition is obtained by the method of adding the component (A) at the time of mixing the components (B) and (C) (Example IV-9) and the method of producing a thermoplastic elastomer composition not including the component (A) and then adding it at the time of extrusion (Examples IV-10 and IV-11).
      <br/>
      The EVA modified polydimethyl siloxane can be pelletized, and therefore, can be fed without fouling the hopper etc. at the time of later addition by a single-screw ex-ruder etc., and therefore, can be more preferably used.
    </p>
    <p num="679">
      Example IV-9 shows similar properties compared with Examples IV-1 to IV-5.
      <br/>
      It is learned that even if EVA modified polydimethyl siloxane is used as the component (A), the effect of improvement of the abrasion resistance similar to that of polydimethyl siloxane, flexibility, and resistance to heat softening can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="680">
      Further, in the same way as Examples �V-6 and IV-8, Examples IV-10 and IV-11 showed a similar effect of improvement of the abrasion with a smaller amount of blending compared with Example IV-9.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is learned that as the method of addition of the component (A), the method of producing a thermoplastic elastomer composition not containing the component (A) and then later blending the component (A) to form the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention is a more preferable method.

    <p num="681">Examples V-1 to V-8 and Comparative Examples V-1 to V-6</p>
    <p num="682">Various types of thermoplastic elastomer compositions shown in the following Table V-1 were prepared as explained below using the following component a (olefin based thermoplastic resin), unvulcanized component b (rubber composition), and compounding agents comprised of the component B, component C, and vulcanization system.</p>
    <p num="683">
      First, the compounding agents constituting the component b other than the vulcanization agent were charged into a hermetic type rubber use Banbury mixer where they were mixed.
      <br/>
      Next, the mixture was formed into rubber sheets of a thickness of 2.5 mm using a rubber use roll to prepare a master batch.
      <br/>
      The sheets of the master batch were then pelletized by a rubber use pelletizer to prepare pellets of the component b.
    </p>
    <p num="684">
      Next, the component a and the pelletized component b were charged into a twin-screw mixer/extruder where they were mixed.
      <br/>
      Next, the vulcanization agent was continuously added so as to dynamically vulcanize a rubber component dispersed as a domain in a matrix comprised of the polyester and compatibilizer.
      <br/>
      The mixing conditions were a melting temperature of 160 to 200 (degree)  C., a residence time in the portion performing the dynamic vulcanization of 30 to 90 seconds, and a shear rate of 1000 to 4000 sec-1.
      <br/>
      After the dynamic vulcanization, the composition was continuously extruded in strands from the twin-screw mixer/extruder, cooled by water, and cut by a cutter to lengths of about 3 mm (diameter about 2 mm) to obtain pellets of the thermoplastic elastomer composition (component A).
      <br/>
      Further, the pelletized component A and the components B and C were melt mixed at a mixing temperature of 200 to 280 (degree)  C. and a shear rate of 50 to 200 sec-1 to obtain pellets of the composition of the present invention in the same way as above.
    </p>
    <p num="685">
      Next, pellets of the thermoplastic elastomer composition were formed into sheets of a thickness of 2 mm by a usually used resin use press forming machine at 200 (degree)  C. for 5 minutes and a pressure of 2.9 MPa and made into test pieces of the JIS standard No. 3 dumbbell shape (JIS K6251) and tear crescent shape (JIS K6252).
      <br/>
      The obtained test pieces were first evaluated as to hot melt adhesiveness at 120 (degree)  C. Next, they were measured for tensile strength at room temperature and elongation at break according to JIS K6251 and tear strength crescent shape according to JIS K6252.
      <br/>
      Further, they were measured for elongation at break at 120 (degree)  C. as an indicator of high temperature physical properties and measured for elongation at break after being allowed to stand at 120 (degree)  C. for 336 hours as an indicator of resistance to heat aging.

      Comparative Example V-2 did not have the component C added, and therefore, the components A and B were not compatible and therefore phase separation occurred and a sufficient strength could not be obtained.

      Comparative Example V-3 had too much of the component B, therefore was inferior in high temperature properties.

      Comparative Example V-4 had too little of the component B, so was inferior in the adhesiveness of the COPE resin (3) and the polyester fiber.

      The adhesion strength between a polyester fiber fabric (warp 1000d, weft 1000d, density 50 * 50/5 cm flat weave) and a thermoplastic elastomer composition (a thermoplastic elastomer composition composed of a polyolefin thermoplastic resin, that is, polypropylene PP, in which was dispersed as a dispersed phase an elastomer component, that is, EPDM rubber, in a cross-linked state, wherein the weight ratio of the PP/EPDM rubber composition was 45/55, PP was RB121D made by Tokuyama, and EPDM was EPT4070 made by Mitsui Petrochemical Industries) was measured for the above obtained thermoplastic adhesive resin nos. 1 to 22 as shown in Table VI-1.

      The EPDM rubber composition was comprised of 100 parts by weight of EPDM, 60 parts by weight of HAF carbon black, 20 parts by weight of paraffinic oil, 5 parts by weight of zinc oxide, and 1 part by weight of stearic acid.

      Further, as the dynamic vulcanization system at the time of twin-screw mixing the PP and EPDM composition, 0.5 part by weight of sulfur, 1 part by weight of a vulcanization accelerator BZ (zinc di-n-butyldithiocarbamate), 0.5 part by weight of a vulcanization accelerator TRA (dipentamethylene thiuram tetrasulfide), 0.5 part by weight of a vulcanization accelerator TT (tetramethylthiuram disulfide), and 1 part by weight of a vulcanization accelerator CZ (N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazyl sulfenamide) were added with respect to 100 parts by weight of the copolymer to cause dynamic vulcanization and prepare the thermoplastic elastomer composition.
      <br/>
      For the adhesion test pieces, a thermoplastic adhesive resin sheet was gripped between a polyester fabric and sheets of the thermoplastic elastomer composition, pressed at 230 (degree)  C. for 2 minutes at 10 kgf/cm2, cooled to room temperature, then cut into short strips of 25 mm length.

      As a Comparative Example, use was made of a commercially available adhesive, that is, a wet curing type urethane based adhesive (Tyrite 7411 made by Lord Far East).
      <br/>
      In this case, the adhesive was coated on both of the polyester fiber fabric and the thermoplastic elastomer material sheet, the two adhered together and allowed to wet cure for one week, then the result used for the test.
      <br/>
      The peeling adhesion strength was measured in the same way as in the examples using these test pieces.
      <br/>
      The results are shown in Table VI-1.
      <br/>
      Further, a peeling adhesion test was performed at room temperature (25 (degree)  C.) and 100 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="721">From the results of Table VI-1, it was learned that with a known adhesive of the Comparative Example, that is, a urethane adhesive, there is easy breaking of the adhesive at the interface at the thermoplastic elastomer side and almost no adhesion strength is obtained.</p>
    <p num="722">On the other hand, it was learned that when the thermoplastic adhesive resin of the present invention was used, the adhesion strength is clearly improved compared with the conventional urethane adhesive.</p>
    <p num="723">
      Further, it was learned that in the thermoplastic adhesive resins of the present invention, modified resins of a polypropylene resin (Examples VI-l to VI-3) with a melt index, measured under measurement conditions of 230 (degree)  C., a load of 2.16 kgf, an orifice diameter of 1 mm, and 10 minutes, of not more than 5.0 g/10 min. were more preferable as they had a high adhesion strength at high temperature conditions of 100 (degree)  C. Further, it was learned that in the thermoplastic adhesive resins of the present invention, modified resins of a polyethylene resin (Examples VI-4 to VI-12) with a melt index, measured under measurement conditions of 190 (degree)  C., a load of 2.16 kgf, an orifice diameter of 1 mm, and 10 minutes, of not more than 5.0 g/10 min. were more preferable as they had a high adhesion strength at high temperature conditions of 100 (degree)  C. Further, it was learned from Examples VI-13 to VI-18 that in modified resins of an ethylene-acrylic acid ester copolymer, a melt index, measured under the conditions of 190 (degree)  C., a load of 2.16 kgf, an orifice diameter of 1 mm, and 10 minutes, of at least 6.0 g/10 min. gives a more preferable bond.
      <br/>
      Further, it was learned from Examples VI-19 to VI-22 that in a polyester resin, a melt index, measured under the conditions of 190 (degree)  C., a load of 2.16 kgf, an orifice diameter of 1 mm, and 10 minutes, of not more than 20.0 g/10 min. gives a more preferable bond.
    </p>
    <p num="724">Examples VI-23 to VI-36</p>
    <p num="725">Further, as shown in Table VI-2, the above obtained thermoplastic adhesive resin nos. 1, 19, and 22 and a compatibilizer consisting of epoxy modified ethylene-methyl acrylate (EMS) were used to confirm the effects of blends of modified polyolefin based resins and polyester based resins.</p>
    <p num="726">In the same way as in the examples, the adhesion strength of polyester fiber fabrics and thermoplastic elastomer compositions (PP/EPDM based thermoplastic elastomer composition) was measured.</p>
    <p num="727">
      For the adhesion test pieces, a thermoplastic adhesive resin sheet was gripped between a polyester fabric and sheets of the thermoplastic elastomer composition, pressed at 230 (degree)  C. for 2 minutes at 10 kgf/cm2, cooled to room temperature, then cut into short strips of 25 mm length.
      <br/>
      The peeling adhesion strength was measured using these as peeling test pieces.
      <br/>
      The results are shown in Table VI-2.
      <br/>
      Further, a peeling adhesion test was performed at room temperature (25 (degree)  C.) and 100 (degree)  C. in the same way as the examples.
    </p>
    <p num="728">It was learned that when using a blended adhesive resin of the thermoplastic adhesive resin of the present invention, that is, a modified olefin based resin, and a polyester based resin, the adhesion strength at 100 (degree)  C. is superior.</p>

    <p num="730">
      Using the thermoplastic adhesive resins 1 to 36 of Table VI-1 and Table VI-2, hoses of the structure shown in Table VI-2 were produced.
      <br/>
      The obtained hoses were tested for bursting pressure and durability.
      <br/>
      The hoses were prepared in the same way as above by a structure of an inner tube of a thermoplastic elastomer composition comprised of a copolyester thermoplastic resin (COPE) in which was dispersed a partially cross-linked acrylic rubber (ACM) as a dispersed phase (COPE consisting of Hytrel made by Toray, ACM consisting of AR997 made by Nippon Zeon, weigh ratio of 70/30), a reinforcing layer of a polyester fiber (1500 d/4) braided into two layers, and an outer cover of a thermoplastic elastomer composition composed of a polyolefin based thermoplastic resin of the present invention, that is, propylene, in which is blended an elastomer component, that is, EPDM rubber, in a partially cross-linked state as a dispersed phase (PP/EPDM composition weight ratio of 45/55, PP consisting of PB 121D made by Tokuyama, and EPDM consisting of EPT4070 made by Mitsui Petrochemical Industries).
      <br/>
      The results of the tests on the hoses are also shown in Table VI-3.
    </p>
    <p num="731">
      Further, an ordinary commercially available adhesive, that is, a wet curing type urethane adhesive (made by Lord Far East, brand name Tyrite 7411) was used in Comparative Example VI-2 between the inner tube and the outer cover and in Comparative Example VI-3 between each of the inner tube, fiber reinforcing layer, and outer cover.
      <br/>
      The results are also shown in Table VI-3.

      The bursting test of the hoses was performed based on the pressure resistance test (bursting test) of JIS K 6349 measured at 100 (degree)  C. The durability test was performed based on SAE J 188 Type 1.
      <br/>
      The oil used was automatic transmission use oil.
      <br/>
      Repeated impulse pressure, 1,000,000 * , was given at a temperature of 120 (degree)  C. and a pressure of 210 kgf/cm .
      <br/>
      After this, the state of attachment of the metal fittings to the hoses and the state of bursting of the hoses themselves were checked.
      <br/>
      Hoses which burst before 1,000,000 *  were evaluated as having durabilities according to the number of repeated impulses withstood before bursting.

      From Table VI-3, it is learned that Comparative Example VI-2 is inferior in adhesiveness between the outer cover and fiber reinforcing layer, and therefore, is inferior in hose bursting pressure and durability compared with general plastic hoses.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, all of the examples of the present invention clearly showed performances superior to Comparative Example VI-2 and Comparative Example VI-3 in both hose bursting pressure and durability.
      <br/>
      Further, from Examples VI-37 to VI-41, it was learned that, in the thermoplastic adhesive resins of the present invention, modified resins of modified resins of a polypropylene resin with a melt index, measured under the conditions of 230 (degree)  C., a load of 2.16 kgf, an orifice diameter of 1 mm, and 10 minutes, of not more than 5.0 g/10 min. were more preferable in terms of the durability of the hoses.
      <br/>
      Further, it was learned from Examples VI-42 to VI-56 that in the thermoplastic adhesive resins of the present invention, modified resins of a polyethylene resin with a melt index, measured under the conditions of 190 (degree)  C., a load of 2.16 kgf, an orifice diameter of 1 mm, and 10 minutes, of not more than 5.0 g/10 min. were more preferable in terms of the durability of the hoses.
      <br/>
      Further, it was learned from Examples VI-57 to VI-66 that in modified resins of an ethylene-acrylic acid ester copolymer, a melt index, measured under the conditions of 190 (degree)  C., a load of 2.16 kgf, an orifice diameter of 1 mm, and 10 minutes, of at least 6.0 g/10 min. gives a more preferable hose durability.
    </p>
    <p num="737">Further, it was learned from the results of Examples VI-67 to VI-71 that in a polyester resin, a melt index, measured under the conditions of 190 (degree)  C., a load of 2.16 kgf, an orifice diameter of 1 mm, and 10 minutes, of not more than 20.0 g/10 min. gives a more preferable hose durability.</p>
    <p num="738">
      Further, when there are two fiber reinforcing layers, it was learned from Comparative Example VI-3 that when interposing a urethane adhesive between the reinforcing layers, fatigue of the fibers derived from penetration and hardening of the adhesive in the fiber reinforcing layers causes deterioration of both of the bursting pressure and durability of the hose, while interposition of the thermoplastic adhesive resin of the present invention between the reinforcing layers raises the bursting pressure of the hose further.
      <br/>
      This is clear from a comparison of Example VI-37 and Example VI-39, Example VI-42 and Example VI-44, Example VI-47 and Example VI-49, Example VI-52 and Example VI-54, Example VI-57 and Example VI-59, Example VI-62 and Example VI-64, and Example VI-67 and Example VI-69.
    </p>
    <p num="739">Further, using a thermoplastic adhesive resin of the present invention instead of the urethane based adhesive at the inner tube side further increases the bursting pressure of the hose as is clear from a comparison of Example VI-39 and Example VI-40, Example VI-44 and Example VI-45, Example VI-49 and Example VI-50, Example VI-54 and Example VI-55, Example VI-59 and Example VI-60, Example VI-64 and Example VI-65, and Example VI-69 and Example VI-70.</p>
    <p num="740">
      Further, Examples VI-72 to VI-85 are hoses where an adhesive resin consisting of a blend of the modified polyolefin based resin and polyester resin of the present invention is interposed between the outer cover and the fiber reinforcing layer.
      <br/>
      From the results of Examples VI-72 to VI-77, it is learned that a hose having a ratio of the maleic anhydride modified PP and copolymer copolyester resin in the range of 95/5 to 5/95 is superior in both bursting pressure and durability.
      <br/>
      Examples VI-78 to VI-81 use an adhesive resin in which an epoxy modified EMA is added as a compatibilizer, so the bursting pressure of the hoses is further improved, it was learned.
      <br/>
      Examples VI-82 to VI-85 use block copolymer copolyester resin as the polyester resin and an adhesive resin in which epoxy modified EMA is added as a compatibilizer, so it is learned are further improved in bursting pressure of the hoses.

    <p num="746">A wet curing type urethane based adhesive was coated on this, then a reinforcing fiber layer was formed by a braider using a polyester fiber.</p>
    <p num="747">3) Formation of Adhesion Layer</p>
    <p num="748">A wet curing type urethane adhesive shown in Table VII-1 was coated on this or a thermoplastic elastomer copolymer resin shown in Table VII-1 was extruder from a resin extruder to form an adhesion layer.</p>
    <p num="749">4) Extrusion of Outer Cover</p>

      Note that as the adhesion layer between the inner tube/reinforcing layer, a Tyrite 7411 wet curing type urethane adhesive made by Lord Far East was used.
      <br/>
      For the adhesion layer between the reinforcing layer/outer cover layer, urethane adhesives (Comparative Example VII-1) and thermoplastic polyester copolymer resins (Comparative Examples VII-2 to VII-5 and Examples VII-1 to VII-8) of the compositions shown in Table VII-1 were used.
      <br/>
      The formations of the compositions used for the inner tubes and outer covers in Table VII-1 were as shown in Table VII-2.
      <br/>
      These were produced as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="752">
      First, the acrylic rubber and the compounding agents other than the vulcanization agent were charged into a hermetic type rubber use Banbury mixer, then formed into sheets using a rubber use roll.
      <br/>
      The sheets were then pelletized by a rubber use pelletizer.
    </p>
    <p num="753">
      Next, the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer, the pelletized rubber, and the compatibilizer were charged into a twin-screw mixer/extruder where they were mixed.
      <br/>
      Next, the vulcanization agent was continuously added so as to dynamically vulcanize a rubber component dispersed as a domain in a matrix composed of the thermoplastic copolyester elastomer and compatibilizer.
    </p>
    <p num="754">
      The mixing conditions were a melting temperature of 180 to 350 (degree)  C., a residence time in the portion performing the dynamic vulcanization of 15 to 300 seconds, and a shear rate of 1000 to 8000 sec-1.
      <br/>
      After the dynamic vulcanization, the composition was continuously extruded in strands from the twin-screw mixer/extruder, cooled, and cut by a cutter to lengths of about 3 mm (diameter about 2 mm) to obtain pellets of the thermoplastic elastomer composition.
    </p>
    <p num="755">The physical properties of the adhesion layers shown in Table VII-1 (hardness, Young's modulus, and melt viscosity) were measured by preparing the following test pieces and testing these by the following methods:</p>
    <p num="756">(Preparation of Test Pieces)</p>
    <p num="757">Pellets of the thermoplastic elastomer composition were formed into sheets of a thickness of 2.0 mm by a usually used resin-use press former at 230 (degree)  C., 5 minutes, and a pressure of 2.9 MPa.</p>
    <p num="758">(Measurement Methods)</p>
    <p num="759">
      Test pieces of a JIS standard No. 3 dumbbell shape (JIS K 6251) were prepared by punching.
      <br/>
      The obtained test pieces were measured for the Young's modulus at 120 (degree)  C. and Type D Durometer hardness (Shore D: JIS K 6253) according to the JIS standards.
    </p>
    <p num="760">Further, the melt viscosity was measured by a capillary rheometer (Capillograph IC) made by Toyo Seiki at a measurement temperature of 230 (degree)  C., a shear rate of 122 s-1, an orifice diameter of 1 mm, and a capillary length of 10 mm.</p>
    <p num="761">Metal fittings were attached to the two ends of the hoses after they were produced and were subjected to impulse durability tests in the following way for the predetermined times shown in Table VII-1.</p>
    <p num="762">Impulse Test and Evaluation</p>
    <p num="763">
      The test was performed based on SAE J 188 Type 1. 600,000 impulses were given using automatic transmission use oil (Idemitsu), 120 (degree)  C., and a pressure of 27.5 MPa, then detachment of the metal fittings and hose bursting were checked for.
      <br/>
      The evaluation criteria was made 400,000 * .
      <br/>
      Hoses with no abnormalities above this were judged as having passed.
    </p>

    <p num="768">From the results, the following may be understood.</p>
    <p num="769">Comparative Example VII-1</p>
    <p num="770">
      Comparative Example VII-1 is a hose using a conventionally used urethane ordinary temperature curing adhesive.
      <br/>
      The hose burst due to heat curing at 120 (degree)  C. The targeted 400,000 *  durability was not reached and the desired performance was not obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="771">Comparative Examples VII-2 to VII-3 and Examples VII-1 to VII-7</p>
    <p num="772">
      Comparative Example VII-2 to VII-3 are hoses using a thermoplastic polyester copolymer resin as an adhesion layer.
      <br/>
      Since they include an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid for the dicarboxylic acid constituting the polyester and have a Young's modulus at 120 (degree)  C. of less than 3.0 MPa, they are inferior in the resistance to softening under heat of the adhesion layer, early detachment of the metal fittings occurs, and the desired performance cannot be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="773">
      Example VII-1 to VII-7 are Examples of hoses where the dicarboxylic acid constituting the polyester is an aromatic dicarboxylic acid and a thermoplastic polyester based copolymer resin having a Young's modulus at 120 (degree)  C. of at least 3.0 MPa is used as the adhesion layer.
      <br/>
      The desired durability is achieved and the desired performance is satisfied.
    </p>
    <p num="774">
      From a comparison of the comparative examples and the Examples, it is learned that when the dicarboxylic acid constituting the polyester is an aromatic dicarboxylic acid and the Young's modulus at 120 (degree)  C. is at least 3.0 MPa, the desired hose durability can be obtained.
      <br/>
      Further, the melt viscosity at 230 (degree)  C. and 122 s-1 were all under 1000 Pa * s and the effect of permeation into the reinforcing layers was obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="775">Examples VII-8 and Comparatives Example VII-4 to VII-5</p>
    <p num="776">
      Example VII-8 and Comparative Example VII-4 to VII-5 are all blends of a thermoplastic urethane elastomer in the thermoplastic polyester copolymer resin of Example VII-7 and show that an increase in the amount of the thermoplastic urethane elastomer blended is accompanied with a fall in the Young's modulus at 120 (degree)  C. In Comparative Example VII-4, however, despite the fact that the Young's modulus at 120 (degree)  C. is more than 3.0 MPa, since the content of the thermoplastic polyester based copolymer resin is less than 50% by weight, the adhesion strength is insufficient, the target durability is not achieved, the metal fittings detach, and the desired performance cannot be obtained.
      <br/>
      As opposed to this, it was learned, according to Example VII-8, that the desired performance can be satisfied if the content of the thermoplastic polyester copolymer resin, even in the same type of system, is 50% by weight or more.
    </p>
    <p num="777">Further, the melt viscosity at 230 (degree)  C. and 122 s-1 was in each case under 1000 Pa * s and an effect of permeation in to the reinforcing layer was obtained.</p>
    <p num="778">
      In the Examples, Examples VII-5 to VII-8 are more preferable Examples.
      <br/>
      That is, ones where the Young's modulus at 120 (degree)  C. is at least 3.0 MPa, the thermoplastic polyester copolymer resin is contained in an amount of at least 50% by weight, and, further, the thermoplastic polyester based copolymer resin contains at least 40 mol % of recurring units of a polyester comprising an aromatic dicarboxylic acid and a diol (in Example VII-2 to VII-3, less than 40 mol %).
    </p>
    <p num="779">
      Further, Example VII-1 and Example VII-4 respectively show more preferable ranges of the Young's modulus and melt viscosity.
      <br/>
      That is, in Example VII-1, the Young's modulus at 120 (degree)  C. is less than 5.0 MPa, while in Example VII-4, the melt viscosity at 230 (degree)  C. and 122 s is over 500 Pa * s.
    </p>
    <p num="780">
      The hoses of the present invention (Example VII-1 to Example VII-30) and conventional hoses (Comparative Example VII-1 to Comparative Example VII-17) were prepared and tested for durability.
      <br/>
      The configuration of the hoses produced, the materials of their different components, the methods of adhesion, and the results of evaluation of a durability test are shown in the following Table VII-1 to Table VII-7.
    </p>
    <p num="781">
      The hoses of Example VII-1 to VII-12 and Comparative Example VII-1 to VII-2 shown in Table VII-1 and Table VII-2 have one reinforcing layer and evaluate the adhesion of the inner tube and reinforcing layer.
      <br/>
      Further, the hoses of Example VII-13 to VII-30 and Comparative Example VII-3 to VII-17 shown in Table VII-3 to Table VII-7 have two reinforcing layers and evaluate the adhesion between reinforcing layers.
    </p>
    <p num="782">Note that, Example VII-27 to VII-30 simultaneously evaluate the adhesion of the inner tube and the reinforcing layer and the adhesion between reinforcing layers.</p>
    <p num="783">The production process of the hoses of the Examples and Comparative Examples was as follows:</p>
    <p num="784">The inner tube was formed by an extruder to an inner diameter of 9.5 mm and a thickness of 1.0 mm. The adhesion layer between the inner tube and the reinforcing layer was coated on the outer surface of the inner tube and naturally dried in the case of an ordinary temperature curing type urethane based adhesive and was extruded on the inner tube in a tubular shape of a thickness of 0.1 mm by a cross head resin extruder in the case of a thermoplastic material.</p>
    <p num="785">
      The reinforcing layer was braided by a braider.
      <br/>
      The adhesion layer between reinforcing layers was coated on the outer surface of the reinforcing layer and naturally dried in the case of an ordinary temperature curing type urethane based adhesive and was extruded on the reinforcing layer in a tubular shape of a thickness of 0.1 mm by a cross head extruder in the case of a thermoplastic material.
    </p>
    <p num="786">
      The adhesion layer between the outer cover and reinforcing layer was coated on the outer surface of the reinforcing layer and naturally dried in the case of an ordinary temperature curing type urethane adhesive and was extruded on the inner tube in a tubular shape of a thickness of 0.1 mm by a cross head resin extruder in the case of a thermoplastic material.
      <br/>
      The outer cover was extruded by a cross head resin extruder over the adhesion layer between the outer cover and reinforcing layer to a tubular shape of an outer diameter of 17.5 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="787">The methods of heating of the adhesion layers shown in the table were as follows: "Heating by an oven after formation of the outer cover" means heating the adhesion layer to over the melting temperature, and therefore, the hose having the outer cover formed on it is placed in an oven and heated to the predetermined time for the predetermined temperature.</p>
    <p num="788">"Direct heating of the inner tube just before braiding" means heating and melting by a heater before forming the reinforcing layer on the outer surface of the inner tube. "Heating just before braiding" means heating and melting the adhesion layer by a heater before braiding the reinforcing layer on the adhesion layer. "Melt extrusion" means heating the adhesion layer by extruding the thermoplastic material at least at the softening temperature and then immediately thereafter braiding the reinforcing layer.</p>
    <p num="789">The durability test was a so-called impulse durability test based on SAE J188 Type I performed at a temperature of 120 (degree)  C., a pressure of 27.5 MPa, and 400,000 impulses.</p>

      Further, Comparative Example VIII-2 uses a thermoplastic material for the adhesion layer between the inner tube and reinforcing layer, but heats the hose in an oven after formation of the outer cover, so excessive heat is applied to the fibers of the reinforcing layer and the fibers degraded under the heat, resulting in inferior durability.

    <p num="835">
      Next, examples of the production of a hose of a ninth embodiment of the present invention will be given to explain specifically the Examples of use and effects of the braider of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The invention is not however limited to these Examples.
    </p>
    <p num="836">(1) Structure of Inner Tube</p>
    <p num="837">Using a thermoplastic polyester elastomer (Hytrel 5557, made by Toray-Du Pont, melting point 208 (degree)  C.) for the inner layer of the inner tube and a thermoplastic polyester elastomer (Hytrel 2551, made by Toray-Du Pont, melting point 164 (degree)  C.) for the outer layer of the inner tube and using a resin extruder and two-layer extruding head, an inner tube with an inner diameter of 9.5 mm, a thickness of the inner layer of the inner tube of 1.0 mm, and a thickness of the outer layer of the inner tube of 0.1 mm was extruded in a hollow shape.</p>
    <p num="838">(2) Braiding of First Reinforcing Layer</p>
    <p num="839">Using the braider shown in FIG. 7, FIG. 8, and FIG. 9, the outer circumference of the inner tube was heated to a molten state then a reinforcing layer comprised of polyester fiber was braided on the inner tube to thereby both form the reinforcing layer and bond the inner tube and reinforcing layer.</p>
    <p num="840">The braiding conditions were as follows:</p>
    <p num="841">
      The preheating device was a hot air recirculating type.
      <br/>
      The temperature of the hot air was adjusted to 120 (degree)  C. The temperature of the outer surface of the inner tube of the hose at the outlet of the preheating device was 100 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="842">The distance between the heating tool attached to the braiding die and the hose inner tube was 20 mm and the distance from the outlet of the heating tool to the braiding point was 10 mm.</p>
    <p num="843">The heating tool attached to the braiding die was adjusted to a temperature of 200 (degree)  C. and the braiding speed was made 1.0 m/min The temperature of the outer surface of the inner tube of the hose at the outlet of the heating tool was 180 (degree)  C. The molten state of the outer surface of the hose inner tube was visually confirmed. (Melting point of thermoplastic material was 164 (degree)  C.)</p>
    <p num="844">Note that the time of passage through the preheating device was 42 seconds, the time of passage through the heating tool was 1.2 seconds, and the time until braiding after leaving the heating tool was 0.6 second.</p>
    <p num="845">(3) Formation of Adhesive Resin Layer</p>
    <p num="846">An adhesive resin layer was formed using a thermoplastic polyester elastomer (Hytrel 2551, made by Toray-Du Pont, melting point 164 (degree)  C.) and a resin extruder and cross head to a thickness of 0.1 mm.</p>
    <p num="847">(4) Braiding of Second Reinforcing Layer</p>
    <p num="848">Using the same braider and braiding conditions as the braiding of the first reinforcing layer, the outer circumference of the adhesive resin layer was heated to the molten state and a reinforcing layer composed of polyester fiber was braided on the adhesive resin layer to thereby both form the reinforcing layer and bond the first reinforcing layer and the second reinforcing layer through the adhesive resin layer.</p>
    <p num="849">(5) Formation of Outer Cover</p>
    <p num="850">Using a thermoplastic polyester elastomer (Hytrel 2551, made by Toray-Du Pont, melting point 164 (degree)  C.) for the inner layer of the outer cover and a thermoplastic polyester elastomer (Hytrel 4777, made by Toray-Du Pont, melting point 200 (degree)  C.) for the outer layer of the outer cover and using a twin-screw resin extruder and cross head, the inner layer of the outer cover and the outer layer of the outer cover were consecutively extruded to form an outer cover with a thickness of the an inner tube inner layer of the outer cover of 0.1 mm, and a thickness of the outer layer of the outer cover of 1.0 mm.</p>
    <p num="851">(6) Evaluation of Hose</p>
    <p num="852">
      The dimensional stability of the hoses produced by the above steps (1) to (5) was evaluated by measuring the inner diameters.
      <br/>
      The durability of the hoses was evaluated by a high temperature impulse pressure test.
    </p>
    <p num="853">Note that the high temperature impulse pressure test was performed according to SAE J188 Type 1 at a temperature of 120 (degree)  C., a pressure of 27.5 MPa, and a target durability of 200,000 impulses.</p>
    <p num="854">The dimensional stability was excellent with an inner diameter of 9.3 mm or inside the prescribed dimensions.</p>
    <p num="855">The hose durability was excellent with the hose not breaking up to the target durability and no abnormalities being observed even with later confirmation.</p>
    <p num="856">(7) Comparative Examples</p>
    <p num="857">
      As Comparative Examples of the Examples, a hose was produced by a configuration the same as the Examples except for using a urethane based ordinary temperature wet curing type adhesive (Tyrite 7411, made by Lord Far East) instead of the adhesive resin and using a braider with no heating apparatus (Comparative Example IX-1) and a hose was produced by a configuration the same as the examples but using a braider with no heating apparatus and heating the hose after formation of the outer cover in an oven of 200 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes for adhesion by hot melting (Comparative Example IX-2).
      <br/>
      These were evaluated in the same way as the above (6).
    </p>
    <p num="858">
      Comparative Example IX-1 was a conventional hose.
      <br/>
      It was excellent in dimensional stability and hose durability, but since it used an adhesive had problems in evaporation of the solvent and the aging period.
    </p>
    <p num="859">
      Comparative Example IX-2 was poor in dimensional stability and had an inner diameter of 8.2 mm, i.e., suffered from extreme changes in the inner diameter making it substandard.
      <br/>
      Further, the hose durability was poor.
      <br/>
      Due to heat degradation of the constituent material, the hose bursting at 50,000 impulses.
    </p>
    <p num="860">From the results of evaluation of these hoses, the superiority in the production of the hose due to the use of the braider of the present invention and the superiority of a hose produced became clear.</p>
    <heading>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
    <p num="861">
      As explained above, according to the present invention, by using a thermoplastic elastomer composition containing a thermoplastic copolyester elastomer and an acrylic rubber as the hose inner tube and/or outer cover, it is possible to obtain a hose superior in oil resistance, flexibility, and cold resistance which does not require a processing (vulcanization) step.
      <br/>
      According to the second embodiment of the present invention, by blending a specific terminal carboxyl group modified polycaprolactone into the elastomer composition or thermoplastic elastomer composition, it is possible to obtain an elastomer material which is improved in elongation or compression set resistance, is superior in oil resistance, flexibility, and cold resistance, and is useful as various types of sealing agents, hoses, etc.
      <br/>
      According to the third embodiment of the present invention, compatibilizer it is possible to obtain a hose superior in oil resistance, flexibility, cold resistance, and heat resistance and further superior in heat curing resistance and heat aging resistance and exhibiting a high durability.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the hose of the present invention is particularly useful as a hose for a high pressure fluid etc.
    </p>
    <p num="862">According to the present invention, further, it is possible to obtain an olefin thermoplastic elastomer composition having a never before existing excellent adhesiveness with a polyester fiber, in particular an adhesiveness capable of withstanding stress due to repeated deformation under a high temperature of 120 (degree)  C., and a hose or other laminate using such an elastomer composition.</p>
    <p num="863">
      According to the present invention, further, a desired high adhesion strength is obtained and the hose durability is improved by using the thermoplastic adhesive resin for either of the hose inner tube/fiber reinforcing layer, fiber reinforcing layer/fiber reinforcing layer, and fiber reinforcing layer/outer cover.
      <br/>
      Further, since a heat reaction can be used, it is possible to adhere a thermoplastic elastomer composition comprised of a difficult to adhere material like a polyolefin based thermoplastic resin in which an at least partially cross-linked elastomer component is blended.
    </p>
    <p num="864">
      According to the present invention, further, by using a composition composed of a thermoplastic copolyester elastomer and an acrylic rubber for the inner tube and outer cover, using a polyester fiber for the reinforcing layer, and using a thermoplastic resin composition containing at least 50% by weight of a thermoplastic polyester copolymer resin with a dicarboxylic acid constituting the polyester of an aromatic dicarboxylic acid and a Young's modulus at 120 (degree)  C. of at least 3.0 MPa as the adhesion layer between the reinforcing layer and outer cover, it is possible to obtain a hose superior in oil resistance, flexibility, and cold and heat resistance and further, superior in resistance to heat curing and resistance to heat aging and therefore having a high durability.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the hose of the present invention is particularly useful as a high pressure fluid use hose.
    </p>
    <p num="865">According to the process of production of the eighth embodiment of the present invention, since the adhesion layer becomes molten in state due to heating to at least the softening temperature and since the adhesion layer and inner tube contact each other in the molten state, a strong adhesion between layers is obtained, the thermoplastic material constituting the adhesion layer will not harden even with long term use, and the hose will be superior in resistance to heat aging and fatigue resistance, so it is possible to produce a flexible hose superior in durability.</p>
    <p num="866">Further, since the heating of the adhesion layer and inner tube is performed before the formation of the outer cover, there is little heat applied to the parts such as the reinforcing layer and there is no heat degradation of the parts such as the reinforcing layer due to heating in the manufacturing process.</p>
    <p num="867">Further, in the production process of this inventions the heating of the adhesion layer and inner tube is performed simultaneously with the shaping by a simple heater or the extruder for forming the adhesion layer and inner tube, and therefore it is possible to perform heating continuously in the manufacturing line and possible to provide a production process with a high productivity.</p>
    <p num="868">Further, since no adhesive containing a solvent is used, the environmental problem caused by a solvent does not arise.</p>
    <p num="869">
      According to the ninth embodiment of the present invention, since the braiding die of the braider is provided with a heating means for continuously heating the surface layer of the inner tube at a step before braiding the reinforcing yarn on the inner tube, the following effects are exhibited.
      <br/>
      a) it becomes possible to improve the adhesion performance without using a conventional solvent based adhesive or an expensive facility using infrared light, ultrasonic waves, etc. and as a result the problems in safety and health and in the environment can be solved and, further, a high quality hose can be produced so there is little effect such as the heat degradation of the constituent materials.
      <br/>
      b) it becomes possible to produce a flexible, high durability hose by a similar number of production steps as in the past and to improve the productivity.
      <br/>
      c) it becomes possible to make the production process continuous, to reduce the work in process, and contribute to the shortening of the lead time.
      <br/>
      d) it becomes possible to deal inexpensively and simply with the diversification of types of braiders.
