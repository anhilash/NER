    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The present invention relates to a cement slab surface beveling device which comprises a plate-like support member having a bottom surface, a top side, a first end and a second end; and also comprises a handle member fastened to the top side of the plate-like member; and further comprises a tapered beveling member which extends downwardly from the bottom surface of the support member and which has an end, a bottom edge and a flat bottom surface which is angled relative to the flat bottom surface of the support member.
      <br/>
      Once the cement slab is poured and allowed to semi-harden, the user slides the cement slab surface beveling device along the edge of the floor with a second exposed flat portion of the bottom surface of the support member being movably supported upon the slab surface and a first exposed flat portion of the bottom surface at the second end of the support member being movably supported upon the cement slab frame and with a portion of the cement being removed by the tapered beveling member to form the beveled surface.

    <p num="10">One objective of the present invention is to provide a cement slab surface beveling device which effectively reduces the amount of time to professionally form a beveled surface.</p>
    <p num="11">Another objective of the present invention is to provide a cement slab surface beveling device which allows the user to effectively and efficiently form a consistent and even beveled surface throughout.</p>
    <p num="12">Further objectives and advantages of the present invention will become apparent as the description proceeds and when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      Referring to the drawings in FIGS. 1-4, in particular, the cement slab surface beveling device comprises a plate-like support member 15 having a top side 15B, a bottom surface 15A, a first end 15D and a second end 15C; and further comprises a handle member 30 which is conventionally fastened to and extends outwardly from the top side 15B of the support member 15; and also comprises a beveling member 20 which has substantially the same width as the support member 15 and which is either integral to or securely fastened with conventional fasteners to the bottom surface 15A of the support member 15 and which also has an end 20B which is disposed near but yet spaced from the second end 15C of the support member 15C thus defining a first exposed flat portion 15E of the bottom surface 15A of the support member 15 of approximately an inch between the end of the beveling member 20 and the second end 15C of the support member 15.
      <br/>
      The beveling member 20 also has a bottom edge 20C which is spaced anywhere from one half inch to two inches from the bottom surface 15A of the support member 15, a flat bottom surface 20A and is tapered such that the flat bottom surface 20A is angled relative to the length of the bottom surface 15A of the support member 15 with the angle being anywhere from 1 degree to 89 degrees.
      <br/>
      As a further limitation, the flat bottom surface 20A is angled within the range of 2 to 20 degrees relative to the bottom surface 15A of the support member 15.
      <br/>
      The depth or thickness of the beveling member 20 at the end thereof is anywhere from one half inch to two inches.
      <br/>
      The flat bottom surface 20A of the beveling member 20 extends from the bottom edge 20C of the beveling member 20 to the bottom surface 15A of the support member 15 preferably intermediate between the first and second ends of the support member 15 thus defining a second exposed flat portion 15F of the bottom surface 15A of the support member 15 between an intermediate portion of the support member 15, where the flat bottom surface 20A of the beveling member 20 terminates, and the first end 15D of the support member 15.
      <br/>
      But, as an alternate embodiment, the bottom surface 20A terminates at the first end 15D of the support member 15.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In use, the cement slab surface beveling device is primarily used along a selected edge or end of a cement slab 40 with the user placing the first exposed flat portion 15E of the bottom surface 15A movably upon the cement slab frame 45 used to build and form the cement slab 40 with the end 20B of the beveling member 20 essentially contacting a side of the cement slab frame 45 and being disposed in the semi-harden cement 40 and with the second exposed flat portion 15F of the bottom surface 15A of the support member 15 movably contacting the cement slab surface near the selected edge or end thereof.
      <br/>
      As the user moves the cement slab surface beveling device along the selected edge or end of the cement slab and upon the cement slab frame 45 from one side to the other, the beveling member 20 removes and displaces a portion of the cement with the selected edge or end of the cement slab taking on the beveled and tapered shape of the beveling member 20 as viewed from the side thereof.
      <br/>
      This particular device allows the user to quickly and effectively form a smooth and even beveled surface throughout like that found along the edge or end of a cement garage floor especially at the entrance thereto.
      <br/>
      The garage floor is essentially elevated above the ground surface to substantially prevent water from entering upon the garage floor.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Various changes and departures may be made to the invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is not intended that the invention be limited to that specifically described in the specification or as illustrated in the drawings but only as set forth in the claims.
