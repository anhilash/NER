    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), also referred to as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), is a decapeptide that plays a key role in human reproduction.
      <br/>
      The hormone is released from the hypothalamus and acts on the pituitary gland to stimulate the biosynthesis and secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).
      <br/>
      LH released from the pituitary gland is primarily responsible for the regulation of gonadal steroid production in both sexes, whereas FSH regulates spermatogenesis in males and follicular development in females.
      <br/>
      GnRH agonists and antagonists have proven effective in the treatment of certain conditions which require inhibition of LHIFSH release.
      <br/>
      In particular, GnRH-based therapies have proven effective in the treatment of endometriosis, uterine fibroids, polycystic ovarian disease, precocious puberty and several gonadal steroid-dependent neoplasia, most notably cancers of the prostate, breast and ovary.
      <br/>
      GnRH agonists and antagonists have also been utilized in various assisted fertilization techniques and have been investigated as a potential contraceptive in both men and women.
      <br/>
      They have also shown possible utility in the treatment of pituitary gonadotrophe adenomas, sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, irritable bowel syndrome, premenstrual syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hirsutism, as an adjunct to growth hormone therapy in growth hormone deficient children, and in murine models of lupus.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the invention may also be used in combination with bisphosphonates (bisphosphonic acids) and other agents, such as growth hormone secretagogues, for the treatment and the prevention of disturbances of calcium, phosphate and bone metabolism, in particular, for the prevention of bone loss during therapy with the GnRH antagonist, and in combination with estrogens, progesterones, antiestrogens, antiprogestins and/or androgens for the prevention or treatment of bone loss or hypogonadal symptoms such as hot flashes during therapy with the GnRH antagonist.
    </p>
    <p num="3">Additionally, a compound of the present invention may be co-administered with a 5a-reductase 2 inhibitor, such as finasteride or epristeride; a 5a-reductase 1 inhibitor such as 4,7b-dimethyl-4-aza-5a-cholestan-3-one, 3-oxo-4-aza-4,7b-dimethyl-16b-(4-chlorophenoxy)-5a-androstane, and 3-oxo-4-aza-4,7b-dimethyl-16b-(phenoxy)-5a-androstane as disclosed in WO 93/23420 and WO 95/11254; dual inhibitors of 5a-reductase 1 and 5a-reductase 2 such as 3-oxo-4-aza-17b-(2,5-trifluoro-methylphenyl-carbamoyl)-5a-androstane as disclosed in WO 95/07927; antiandrogens such as flutamide, casodex and cyproterone acetate, and alpha-1 blockers such as prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, and alfuzosin.</p>
    <p num="4">Further, a compound of the present invention may be used in combination with growth hormone, growth hormone releasing hormone or growth hormone secretagogues, to delay puberty in growth hormone deficient children, which will allow them to continue to gain height before fusion of the epiphyses and cessation of growth at puberty.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Further, a compound of the present invention may be used in combination or co-administered with a compound having luteinizing hormone releasing activity such as a peptide or natural hormone or analog thereof.
      <br/>
      Such peptide compounds include leuprorelin, gonadorelin, buserelin, triptorelin, goserelin, nafarelin, histrelin, deslorelin, meterlin and recirelin.

    <p num="6">Additionally, a compound of the present invention may be used as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,286 which discloses the administration of peptide GnRH antagonists such as Antide and azaline B to premenopausal women to enhance the readability of mammographic film relative to a mammogram effected in the absence of the administration.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Current GnRH antagonists are GnRH-like decapeptides which are generally administered intravenously or subcutaneously presumably because of negligible oral activity.
      <br/>
      These have amino acid substitutions usually at positions one, two, three, six and ten.

      The compounds of the invention are prepared according to the following reaction schemes.
      <br/>
      All of the substituents are as defined above unless indicated otherwise.  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)

    <p num="40">
      A preferred method for the synthesis of the substituted tryptamines described in this invention utilizes a palladium-catalyzed cross coupling reaction as a key step as shown in Scheme A. This 6-azaindole synthesis involves the reaction of a suitably functionalized 3-amino-4-iodopyridine (1) with substituted acetylenes such as 2 in the presence of a base like sodium carbonate, lithium chloride, and a palladium catalyst such as (dppf)PdCl2 * CH2 Cl2.
      <br/>
      The reaction is conducted in an inert organic solvent such as dimethylformamide at elevated temperatures, for instance at 100 (degree)  C., and the reaction is conducted for a period of about 30 minutes to about 24 hours.
      <br/>
      A standard workup and isolation affords the substituted isomeric indole derivatives 3 and 4, and the isomer of general formula 3 is the preferred isomer.
      <br/>
      The acetylene utilized in this reaction may be a terminal acetylene (2a) or be optionally substituted on the terminal carbon atom with a substituent Z (2b, 2c).
      <br/>
      The substituent abbreviated PG1 indicates an alcohol protecting group such as a benzyl ether, tert-butyl ether or the like.
      <br/>
      The nature of the Z substituent determines the distribution of the 6-azaindole isomers (3 and 4) produced in the reaction.
      <br/>
      For example, if the substituent Z on the acetylene is a hydrogen atom then the isomer 4a is the major product of the reaction.
      <br/>
      When the substituent Z is chosen to be a substituted silyl group such as trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl (as shown), or the like, then isomer 3b is formed almost exclusively.
      <br/>
      When Z is a substituted aryl group, then both isomers 3c and 4c may be formed and the product mixture is separated using chromatographic or crystallization techniques to afford the individual isomers.
    </p>
    <p num="41">If the synthesis is conducted with a silyl-substituted acetylene 2b to produce a silyl-substituted 6-azaindole 3b, then the silyl group is next converted to an aryl or substituted aryl group of general formula 3c using the reactions described later in Scheme E. The 2-arylsubstituted 6-azaindole derivatives 3c formed either directly from arylacetylenes (2c) as shown in Scheme A or from 2-trialkylsilyl-6-azaindoles using the method of Scheme E are then further elaborated as described below to produce the novel 6-azaindole derivatives described in this invention.  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="42">
      Scheme B illustrates the preparation of substituted 3-amino-4-iodopyridines (1) which are utilized in the 6-azaindole synthesis described in Scheme A. Substituted 3-nitropyridine derivatives such as 5 are useful starting materials for the preparation of 3-amino-4-iodopyridines (1).
      <br/>
      The 3-nitropyridines (5) bearing the desired substituents can in turn be prepared by the nitration of a pyridine derivative, by a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction from a suitable halogenated nitropyridine or by other methods known in the chemical literature.
      <br/>
      The nitro substituent of a 3-nitropyridine is readily reduced to the required 3-amino group using a variety of methods such as catalytic hydrogenation and the resulting 3-amino group can then serve as a directing group for the subsequent introduction of an iodine at the 4 position of the pyridine.
      <br/>
      To facilitate the introduction of the iodine atom the 3-amino group is first converted to a good ortho-directing substituent such as a pivalamide (7).
      <br/>
      This is achieved by reacting the 3-aminopyridine 6 with pivaloyl chloride in the presence of an amine base like triethylamine in a suitable inert solvent followed by a standard workup and isolation.
      <br/>
      The resulting pivalamide 7 is then subjected to ortho-lithiation by treatment with a strong organolithium base such as tert-butyl lithium in the presence of a N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylene-diamine.
      <br/>
      The ortho-lithiation is conducted in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at low temperature, typically -78 (degree)  C., and the 4-lithiated derivative is the predominant regioisomer formed.
      <br/>
      Once the lithiation reaction is complete the reaction mixture is then treated with an iodinating reagent like iodine or iodine monochloride in a compatable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and then allowed to warm to room temperature.
      <br/>
      Workup and product purification affords the 4-iodopyridine derivative 8 which in the final step is converted to the substituted 3-amino-4-iodopyridines of general formula 1 by removal of the ortho-directing group.
      <br/>
      In the case illustrated in reaction Scheme B where a pivaloyl group was chosen as the ortho-directing group it may be removed by hydrolysis under acidic conditions such as treatment with sulfuric acid at anelevated temperature.  (Chemical Structure image '8' not included in text)

    <p num="43">
      Acetylenic compounds of general structure 2 are prepared using one of several methods depending upon the choice of the desired substituents.
      <br/>
      When the substituents R9, R9a, R10 and R10a are selected to be hydrogen or lower alkyl groups, compounds of formula 2 may be prepared from known acetylenic alcohols such as 3-butyn-1-ol, 4-pentyn-2-ol or similar acetylenic alcohols reported in the chemical literature.
      <br/>
      The conversion of acetylenic alcohols of general formula 10 to acetylene derivatives of general formula 2 is shown in Scheme C. For clarity the hydroxyl protecting group (PG1) illustrated in Scheme C is exemplified as an O-benzyl ether.
      <br/>
      Thus, reaction of 10 with O-benzyl-2,2,2-trichloroacetimidate in the presence of a catalytic amount of a strong acid such as trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and in a suitable inert organic solvent like carbon tetrachloride at room temperature affords after 2 to 24 hours the protected acetylenic alcohol 2a.
      <br/>
      Compounds of formula 2a may in turn be converted to acetylenes (2b) of general formula 2 wherein Z is a trialkylsilyl group by deprotonation of the acetylene with a base such as n-butyllithium in an inert organic solvent like tetrahydrofuran followed by reaction with a trialkylsilyl chloride such as triethylchlorosilane.
      <br/>
      The deprotonation and silylation reactions are generally conducted at low temperatures, for instance between about -78 (degree)  C. and room temperature, and after standard workup and purification a silylacetylene of formula 2b is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      As previously stated, acetylenes of general formula 2c wherein Z is an aryl or substituted aryl group, are also useful in the 6-azaindole synthesis illustrated in Scheme A. Arylacetylenes 2c may be prepared using a coupling reaction of cuprous acetylides derived from acetylenic alcohols of formula 2a with various aryl halides or aryl triflates (11).
      <br/>
      Such coupling reactions produce aryl acetylenes of general formula 12 as shown at the bottom of Scheme C. These reactions are generally carried out in a basic organic solvent like triethylamine at elevated temperatures, typically between about 60 (degree)  C. and about 120 (degree)  C., and the coupling reaction is catalyzed by copper(I) salts such as cuprous iodide and a palladium catalyst such as palladium acetate in combination with triphenylphosphine.
      <br/>
      The hydroxyl group of the arylacetylenes of general formula 12 can be protected with a suitable protecting group such as the O-benzyl ether group shown in Scheme C, to afford an arylacetylene (2c) of general formula 2 wherein Z is an aryl or substituted aryl group.
      <br/>
      It is also recognized that in some cases it may be preferable to reverse the order of the steps illustrated in Scheme C. For instance, acetylenic alcohols (7) may be subjected to silylation or arylation prior to the hydroxyl group protection step.  (Chemical Structure image '9' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Another useful approach for the preparation of acetylenic compounds of general formula 2a employs an ethynylation reaction sequence of aldehydes of general formula 16 as shown in Scheme D. The aldehydes (16) used in the ethynylation sequence may be prepared using various methods known in organic synthesis starting with hydroxy-esters of general formula 13, from protected hydroxyesters of formula 14, or from alcohols related to the mono-hydroxyl protected diols of formula 15.
      <br/>
      The choice of preferred starting material depends upon the nature of the substituents R9, R9a, R10, and R10a selected.
      <br/>
      Scheme D illustrates this strategy begining with the generalized hydroxy ester 13.
      <br/>
      Protection of the hydroxyl group of 13, for instance as the O-benzylether shown, affords a protected hydroxy ester of formula 14.
      <br/>
      The ester group of compounds of formula 14 can then be converted to an aldehyde of formula 16 either directly using a reagent like diusobutylaluminum hydride in a solvent like toluene, or through a two step process.
      <br/>
      In the two step process, reduction of the ester group with a reagent such as lithium aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran affords alcohols of formula 15 which are then subjected to reoxidation, for instance using a Swern-Moffatt oxidation, to afford the desired aldehydes of formula 16.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The ethynylation of aldehydes of formula 16 is accomplished in two steps.
      <br/>
      First, aldehydes (16) are reacted with carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in an inert organic solvent like dichloromethane to produce the dibromo olefins of formula 17.
      <br/>
      Next, the dibromo olefins (17) are treated with two equivalents of a strong base such as n-butyllithium in tetrahydrofuran at low temperature, for instance at about -78 (degree)  C. The strong base induces dehydrohalogenation and metalhalogen exchange to afford lithium acetylides which upon quenching and workup afford acetylenes of general formula 2a.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the intermediate lithium acetylides formed in the reaction may be treated with a trialkylsilyl chloride, such as triethylchlorosilane, to afford silylacetylenes of general formula 2b.  (Chemical Structure image '10' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The conversion of 2-silyl-substituted 6-azaindoles of general formula 3b to 2-aryl-substituted 6-azaindoles of general formula 3c may be accomplished in two steps as shown in Scheme E. The first step is a halodesilylation reaction which converts silyl-substituted 6-azaindoles of formula 3b into 2-halo-6-azaindoles of general formula 18.
      <br/>
      Scheme E illustrates this process using iodine monochloride so that the product obtained is a 2-iodoindole of general formula 18.
      <br/>
      Silver tetrafluoroborate is also employed in this example to increase the reactivity of the halogenating reagent.
      <br/>
      It is possible to effect the halodesilylation reaction with other electrophilic halogenating reagents such as N-bromosuccinimide in dichloromethane which affords a 2-bromo-6-azaindole derivative.
      <br/>
      Both 2-bromo and 2-iodo-6-azaindoles of formula 18 are useful in the subsequent step.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The second step is a palladium-catalyzed cross coupling reaction of the 2-halo-6-azaindole 18 with a suitable aryl or substituted aryl organometallic reagent 19.
      <br/>
      Scheme E illustrates this process with an aryl or substituted arylboronic acid as the organometallic reagent, however, other organometallic reagents known to participate in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions such as arylboronic esters or arylstannanes may also be employed.
      <br/>
      In the example, a 2-iodo-6-azaindole of general formula 18 is coupled with a generalized boronic acid (19) using a catalyst such as �1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene� dichloropalladium(II) complex with dichloromethane (shown), tetrakis (triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0) or the like.
      <br/>
      The reaction is usually conducted at temperatures between room temperature and about 100 (degree)  C., for instance at about 80 (degree)  C. This palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reaction may be effected using various combinations of palladium catalysts and solvent compositions known in organic chemistry, and the selection of the conditions is made depending upon the type of organometallic reagent (19) used and the identity of the substituent groups in the two starting materials.
      <br/>
      When the organometallic reagent is a boronic acid or boronate ester then a preferred solvent mixture consists of toluene, ethanol and an aqueous solution of a base like cesium or sodium carbonate.
      <br/>
      If instead the organometallic reagent 19 is an arylstannane, then no additional base is required, and a polar aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide is employed.  (Chemical Structure image '11' not included in text)

    <p num="49">
      The next stage of the synthesis of the novel 6-azaindole derivatives is illustrated in Scheme F. This sequence of reactions begins with protection of the 6-azaindole with an amine protecting group (PG2) to afford compounds of general formula 20.
      <br/>
      The protection step is required to avoid competing side reactions of the 2-aryltryptophol of formula 21 (where PG2 is H) in the later conversion of compounds of formula 21 to compounds of formula 22.
      <br/>
      The indole protection is followed by removal of the hydroxyl protecting group (PG1) from the side chain at the C-3 position of the 6-azaindole ring to afford compounds of general formula 21.
      <br/>
      Finally, the hydroxyl group of 21 is converted to a primary amine of general formula 23 which is then further functionalized as shown below in the following schemes.
      <br/>
      The choice of an appropriate amine protecting group (PG2) for the 6-azaindole is determined primarily by which protecting group (PG1) is present on the hydroxyl group in the C-3 sidechain, and by consideration of the chemical stability of the amine protecting group (PG1) required in the remaining steps of the synthesis.
      <br/>
      When the hydroxyl protecting group (PG1) is an O-benzyl ether as illustrated previously in Schemes C and D, the 6-azaindole may be protected as a carbamate derivative such as a tert-butylcarbamate (BOC).
      <br/>
      In this case, the BOC-protected 6-azaindole is stable under the hydrogenolysis conditions which are used to remove the O-benzyl ether and it may be conveniently removed at the end of the synthesis using acidic conditions.
      <br/>
      If it is desired to synthesize compounds of formula (I) wherein R0 is alkyl, substituted alkyl or the like, then it is possible to introduce that substituent at this point and the use of a protecting group and its subsequent removal is not required.

      An alcohol of general formula 21 may be converted to a primary amine of general formula 23 using a variety of methods known in the literature of organic chemistry.
      <br/>
      The bottom of Scheme F illustrates a process where the alcohol 21 is first converted to an azide of general formula 22, followed by reduction to afford the amine derivative 23.
      <br/>
      The synthesis of an azide of general formula 22 from alcohols like 21 is best accomplished by performing a Mitsunobu reaction in the presence of an appropriate azide source such as diphenylphosphoryl azide or zinc azide pyridine complex.
      <br/>
      Scheme F illustrates the reaction of alcohol 21 with triphenylphosphine, diethylazodicarboxylate, zinc azide pyridine complex and a proton source such as imidazole in an inert solvent like methylene chloride or tetrahydrofuran.
      <br/>
      The reaction is usually conducted at room temperature for periods between 1-24 hours, typically overnight or about 15 hours, and affords the azide of general formula 22 in good yield.
      <br/>
      Finally, an azide of formula 22 may then be reduced to an amine of formula 23 using one of several methods common in organic synthesis.
      <br/>
      One preferred method is catalytic hydrogenation in a solvent like methanol or ethanol in the presence of a catalyst such as 10% palladium on carbon.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, azides like 22 may be reacted with triphenylphosphine to form an iminophosphorane which upon hydrolysis with water affords the amine of formula 23 and triphenylphophine oxide.  (Chemical Structure image '12' not included in text)

      The final stage of the synthesis of the novel 6-azaindole derivatives (I) involves elaboration of the sidechain at the C-3 position of the 6-azaindole core.
      <br/>
      One method for the completion of the synthesis is illustrated in Scheme G. As shown, the 2-aryltryptamine (23) may be condensed with a carboxylic acid of type 24 using the coupling reagent 1-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), 1,3-dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide (DCC) or the like with or without 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and a tertiary amine base such as N-methylmorpholine (NMM), triethylamine or the like in an inert organic solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, dimethylformamide, or mixtures thereof at or near room temperature for a period of 3-24 hours to provide the corresponding amide derivative (25).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, 2-aryltryptamine 23 can be treated with an active ester or acid chloride of formula 26 in an inert organic solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, or the like and a tertiary amine base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine or the like at a temperature of 0 (degree) -25 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes to 4 hours to give compound 25.

    <p num="53">As shown in reaction Scheme I, the 2-aryltryptamine 23 can be modified by treatment with an aldehyde or ketone of type 28 in the presence of a weak acid such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), acetic acid or the like, with or without a dessicant such as 3  Angstrom  molecular sieves or magnesium sulfate, and a hydride source such as sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride, in an inert organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, chloroform, or mixtures thereof at a temperature of about 0 (degree)  to about 25 (degree)  C. for a period of 1-12 hours to give the corresponding secondary or tertiary amine derivative 29.

      <br/>
      The tryptamine 23 may be reacted with an arylsufonyl chloride such as 2-nitrobenzene-sulfonyl chloride, 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride or 2,4-dinitrobenzene-sulfonyl chloride and a hindered amine base such as 2,4,6-collidine, 2,6-lutidine or the like in an inert organic solvent such as methylene chloride to provide the corresponding sulfonamide 30.

      Scheme K also employs the Fukuyama modification of the Mitsunobu reaction similar to that illustrated in reaction Scheme J. However in this instance, the alcohol partner employed is a 2-aryltryptophol of general formula 21 which has been described previously in reaction Scheme F. The 2-aryltryptophol (21) is reacted with a substituted sulfonamide of general formula 33, triphenylphosphine and diethylazodicarboxylate in a suitable inert organic solvent such as benzene, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane or the like.
