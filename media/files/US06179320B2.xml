    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      It is known that a motor vehicle is equipped with a rear bumper assembly in order to protect its body in a low speed vehicle collision condition.
      <br/>
      It is also known that a separate tow hitch assembly may be equipped to a rear end of the motor vehicle in order to provide the motor vehicle with additional towing capacity.
      <br/>
      The rear bumper assembly typically includes a beam that extends transversely across the rear end of the motor vehicle.
      <br/>
      The tow hitch assembly typically includes a tow hitch receiver which is welded to a transverse tubular cross member and the tubular cross member is mounted to a frame of the motor vehicle through a pair of mounting brackets.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Although the above separate rear bumper and tow hitch assemblies have worked well, it is desirable to integrate these two assemblies into a single assembly in order to share their rigidity for both functions.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable to have an assembly, which will be lightweight and more durable while still meeting the motor vehicle towing requirement.
      <br/>
      It is further desirable to provide an integrated assembly that will enhance the rear bumper protection function in a low speed vehicle collision condition.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a need in the art to provide an integrated tow hitch and rear bumper assembly for a motor vehicle.

      The hitch plate 34 includes at least one, preferably a pair of apertures 38 with one of the apertures 38 located on each side of the hitch receiver 30.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated that the apertures 38 allow tow chains (not shown) to be attached thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The tow hitch rear bumper assembly 10 further includes an arch shaped reinforcement 40 connected to the tow hitch 28 and the frame 14 of the motor vehicle 12.
      <br/>
      The arch shaped reinforcement 40 has a generally vertical side wall 41 and horizontal bottom wall 42 forming an L shaped cross-section.
      <br/>
      The arch shaped reinforcement 40 extends transversely in a generally curved or arcuate shape.
      <br/>
      The arch shaped reinforcement 40 is made of a metal material such as steel.
      <br/>
      The arch shaped reinforcement 40 has its ends connected to an inboard side of the frame 14.
      <br/>
      Each end of the arch shaped reinforcement 40 has at least one, preferably a pair of apertures 43 and 44 which are offset and extend through the side wall 41 and bottom wall 42 respectively.
      <br/>
      The ends of the arch shaped reinforcement 40 are connected by suitable fasteners 48 extending through the apertures 43 and 44 and corresponding apertures 45 and 46 in the side rails 16 and 18.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated that the bottom wall 42 is connected to a bottom face 50 of the side rails 16 and 18 and the side wall 41 is connected to an inboard face 52 of the side rails 16 and 18.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The arch shaped reinforcement 40 is vertically inclined to lower its elevation to the level of the hitch receiver 30 and diagonally arch braced against a center span of the rear bumper beam 21 behind the hitch receiver 30.
      <br/>
      The arch shaped reinforcement 40 has a center thereof connected to a back side of the hitch receiver 30 by suitable means such as welding or fastening with bolts.
      <br/>
      The arch shaped reinforcement 40 is also connected to the hitch plate 34 by suitable means such as welding.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In operation, one function of the arch shaped reinforcement 40 is to provide support for the hitch receiver 30.
      <br/>
      Another function of the arch shaped reinforcement 40 is to absorb low speed vehicle collision energy.
      <br/>
      In a low speed vehicle collision, the arch shaped reinforcement 40 will help the rear bumper 20 to rebound back to its original shape through the arch force to minimize repair cost as illustrated in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      In a high speed vehicle collision by an object 60 as illustrated in FIG. 5, the arch shaped reinforcement 40 will first bend forward to prevent the premature bending of the side rails 16 and 18 and the rear bumper beam 21.
      <br/>
      This will allow the rear bumper 20 and frame 14 of the motor vehicle 12 to crush axially to maximize their energy absorption.
      <br/>
      Under towing conditions, the rear bumper beam 21 will act like a horizontal cross member to support the tow hitch 28.
      <br/>
      The arch shaped reinforcement 40 will also serve as the "tension rod" and diagonal bracing for eccentric loading in the towing condition.
