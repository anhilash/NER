      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a color filter applicable to color liquid crystal display devices used in color televisions, personal computers, navigation systems for automobile, etc., a production process thereof, a liquid crystal display device using this color filter and a process for the production of black matrix.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A black matrix called a light-screening film has heretofore been incorporated in a color filter for liquid crystal display device for the purpose of preventing color mixing between R (red), G (green) and B (blue) colors and enhancing contrast.
      <br/>
      The black matrix has heretofore been formed by patterning a film of a metal such as chromium using a photolithographic process.
      <br/>
      The black matrix formed by using this process has a high reflectance.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a color filter in which such a black matrix has been incorporated is high in light reflectance and a problem has hence arisen as to the visibility of images.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It has therefore been proposed to realize low reflecting property by sandwiching a metal chromium film between oxide layers such as chromium oxide films.
      <br/>
      A black matrix formed by such metal and metal compound has had merits that it is high in absorption constant against visible rays, thin in film thickness and high in optical density.
    </p>
    <p num="6">In view of environmental problems in recent years, however, chromium has not only have a possibility that it may change to chromium (VI) injurious to the human body, but also involved a problem that a heavy metal-containing oxidizing agent such as ammonium cerium (IV) nitrate must be used.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In order to solve these problems, resinous black matrix materials of the negative black resist type have been proposed in recent years.
      <br/>
      Such a black resist may be developed with a dilute solution of alkali such as sodium carbonate and has no possibility that it may change to a substance injurious to the human body when it is left to stand in the natural world.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      As the resinous black matrix material, there is generally used that obtained by dispersing a black pigment such as carbon black having a particle diameter of 0.2  MU m or smaller in an alkali-soluble type negative resist.
      <br/>
      Since this resinous black matrix contains the black pigment, light energy does not reach the lower part of the resist material upon exposure to light.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a photo-set portion by the exposure is limited to a surface layer portion of the resist layer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the whole resist layer is set by a heat treatment or the like after development.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The resinous black matrix is lower in absorption coefficient compared with the metallic black matrix, and so the film thickness must be thickened in order to obtain the prescribed optical density.
      <br/>
      When the film thickness is thickened, however, the sectional form of the black matrix has not become an ideal rectangle in some cases as illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5.
      <br/>
      These drawings each illustrate the sectional form of a black matrix right after development.
      <br/>
      In the drawings, reference numeral 1 indicates a transparent substrate, 2a is an unset portion of a black resist layer, and 2b is a set portion of the black resist layer.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows a case where side etching has occurred at the unset portion 2a upon the development, while FIG. 5 shows a case where the set portion 2b formed in a reverse-tapered shape by the side etching at the unset portion 2a has become fragile and chipped.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      When the sectional form becomes such a form as illustrated in FIG. 4 or 5, the optical path length of light transmitted through the edge portion of the black matrix becomes shorter than that of light transmitted through a portion having the prescribed thickness.
      <br/>
      Therefore, such light is not fully absorbed in the black matrix.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in a color filter formed by using such a black matrix, the edges of the black matrix blur, and disadvantages such as lowering of contrast and the occurrence of blank areas in color pixels arise.
    </p>
    <p num="11">When the set portion 2b weakened by the occurrence of the side etching chips in a subsequent step, the chipped set portion forms the cause of generation of dust or particles.</p>
    <p num="12">
      In order to solve such a problem, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 7-248412 discloses a two-layer film composed of a black resist and a chromium film.
      <br/>
      In this method, after the black resist is exposed to light, the chromium film is formed, and thereafter an exposed portion or unexposed portion is developed to lift off the chromium film.
      <br/>
      A black matrix in a reverse-tapered shape may be formed according to the conditions of the development, and moreover the chromium film formed on the set portion can also prevent the set portion from chipping to generate dust.
      <br/>
      In addition, even when the black matrix is formed in the reverse-tapered shape, disadvantages such as blurring of the edges thereof do not arise because the light-screening property of chromium is high.
      <br/>
      Since the resist is developed to lift off the chromium film, there is also no need to use an expensive developing solution for directly etching the chromium film.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      However, such a method requires an expensive sputtering apparatus for forming the chromium film.
      <br/>
      In addition, when a chromium oxide film is intended to form by reactive sputtering for the purpose of enhancing the adhesion of the resulting chromium film upon the formation of the chromium film by the sputtering or providing a low-reflective chromium film, it is general to conduct heating.
      <br/>
      However, such heating is infeasible, since a resist is thermoset by the heating when the resist is formed, and such a chromium film is then formed thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Accordingly, there has been a demand for development of a process for producing a resinous black matrix with good precision at a low cost.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">It is an object of the present invention to provide a color filter having a resinous black matrix which can meet the environmental problems, and being free of blank area and color unevenness, a production process thereof, a liquid crystal display device using this color filter, which permits excellent color display and high contrast and a process for the production of black matrix.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="22">According to the present invention, a black matrix having an ideal sectional form can be produced with high precision by severely limiting development conditions in producing a resinous black matrix using a black resist.</p>
    <p num="23">As illustrated in FIG. 1, in the black matrix according to the present invention, an angle  THETA  formed between a side 2c of each element 2 of the black matrix and a surface 11a of a transparent substrate 11 is 70 to 88 (degree) . Incidentally, when a side is curved as illustrated in FIG. 4 or 5, and an angle formed between the side and a transparent substrate is unfixed, a tangential line is drawn from a top edge of a black matrix element to a bottom edge thereof as illustrated in FIG. 4 or 5, and an angle  THETA  formed between the tangential line and the transparent substrate is regarded as the angle formed between the side and the transparent substrate.</p>
    <p num="24">Since the angle  THETA  illustrated in FIG. 1 is 77 to 88 (degree) , an area of a surface (bottom surface 2d) of the black matrix element 2 coming into contact with the substrate 11 is broader than that of a surface (top surface 2e) opposite to this surface.</p>
    <p num="25">
      The angle  THETA  is preferably narrower, since an ink is fully filled in a corner at which the side 2c of the black matrix element 2 intersects with the surface 11a of the transparent substrate 11.
      <br/>
      If the angle  THETA  is too narrow, however, the black matrix fails to fully absorb light at the edge portion thereof, which forms the cause of lowering of contrast, and blank areas.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, reference numerals 2a, 2b and 2c are unset portion, set portion and aperture, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In order to provide the color filter according to the present invention with good yield, in a developing step after exposing a black resist layer to light, the present invention limits a pH value, a temperature and an ejection pressure toward the black resist layer of a developing solution used in the developing step to 10 to 12, 26 (degree)  C. or lower and 3 MPa or lower, respectively, and controls a time interval between the termination of feed of the developing solution and the initiation of feed of purified rinse water to the substrate to 2 seconds or shorter.
      <br/>
      In the production process of a color filter according to the present invention, a spin-developing process is preferably adopted.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      So far as the pH of the developing solution is within the range of from 10 to 12, etching can be conducted at high speed under a low pressure without impairing the set portion on the surface of the black resist layer.
      <br/>
      When the pH is controlled to 12 or lower in particular, the influence of side etching can be suppressed.
      <br/>
      Many of the conventional developing solutions have had a pH lower than 10.
      <br/>
      However, the pH lower than 10 requires to enhance the physical energy of such a developing solution with a view toward surely removing the unexposed portion.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is conducted to apply ultrasonic waves to the developing solution or feed the developing solution under a high pressure from a nozzle to the black resist layer.
      <br/>
      As a result, the angle  THETA  is made narrower than 70 (degree) .
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In the present invention, the developing solution is used at a temperature of 26 (degree)  C. or lower, thereby making it possible to stabilize the etching speed against the resist and moreover inhibit the etching of the unset portion under the set portion due to rise in temperature, i.e., side etching.
      <br/>
      The inhibition of the side etching also comes to solve the problems that the set portion formed in a reverse-tapered shape by the side etching becomes fragile and chips, and that the chipped set portion becomes dust or particles.
      <br/>
      The temperature of the developing solution is preferably at least 15 (degree)  C., more preferably at least 20 (degree)  C. in order to keep the rate of development at a certain degree.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In the present invention, the ejection pressure of the developing solution toward the black resist layer is limited to 3 MPa or lower, thereby making it possible to inhibit etching against the upper set portion of the photoresist set by the light exposure and etch only the unexposed portion with its rectangular shape retained.
      <br/>
      The ejection pressure is preferably at least 1 MPa.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The developing solution used in the present invention is preferably a dilute aqueous solution of an inorganic alkali metal hydroxide or alkali metal carbonate such as sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or a dilute aqueous solution of an organic alkali, such as an amine solvent such as triethanolamine or diethanolamine, or a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide (for example, tetramethylammonium hydroxide TMAH).
      <br/>
      Although the concentration of such an aqueous solution may be suitably preset according to the developing speed, transferability of mask shape in the formation of a pattern, etc., it is preferably of the order of from 0.01% by weight to 30% by weight.
      <br/>
      The developing solutions usable in the present invention are not limited to those mentioned above, and any developing solution may be used so far as it can dissolve a coating film of a black resist therein and control the end (edge) shape of the black resist according to developing conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In the present invention, a time interval between the termination of feed of the developing solution and the initiation of feed of purified rinse water to the substrate is controlled to 2 seconds or shorter, thereby making it possible to inhibit the progress of side etching at the unset portion of the black resist layer by the developing solution remaining on the patterned substrate after the development to terminate the development with such a portion retained in a rectangular shape.
      <br/>
      In some cases, the purified rinse water may be fed just after terminating the feed of the developing solution without providing the time interval.
    </p>
    <p num="32">The resinous black matrix of the present invention according to the present invention is preferably formed so as to have an optical density of at least 3 and a thickness of 1.0 to 1.4  MU m.</p>
    <p num="33">
      As the black resist, there may be preferably used that generally comprising an alkali-soluble acrylic resin, a photo-induced polymerization initiator and a pigment for coloring the resulting resist black, and optionally containing a crosslinking agent, an epoxy resin, a solvent for adjusting its viscosity, a filler, a leveling agent and a dispersing agent.
      <br/>
      The alkali-soluble acrylic resin is such that contains a carboxyl group as a nucleus and has a polymerizable acrylic resin on at least one side chain thereof.
      <br/>
      As the photo-induced polymerization initiator, there may be used a publicly known initiator disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 7-191462, 9-325494 or 10-171119.
      <br/>
      As the pigment for coloring the resist black, any pigment may be used irrespective of organic or inorganic so far as it is a material exhibiting black and having high light- screening property.
      <br/>
      Typical examples thereof include carbon black, titanium black, etc. for the inorganics, and such techniques as dyes of red, blue and green colors are mixed to develop a black color, for the organics.
      <br/>
      However, the pigments are not limited to these pigments.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The resinous black matrix is suitably used in a production process of a color filter using an ink-jet system making good use of its thickness.
      <br/>
      An embodiment thereof will be described with reference to FIGS. 2A through 2D.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 2A through 2D are schematic cross-sectional views corresponding to the following Steps a through d, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Step a</p>
    <p num="36">
      A resinous black matrix 12 is formed on a transparent substrate 11 by the production process of a black matrix according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      Each element of the black matrix 12 also functions as a partition wall member for preventing color mixing between adjacent inks of different colors.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Step b</p>
    <p num="38">Respective inks 14 of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) colors are applied to the substrate using an ink-jet recording apparatus 13 according to the prescribed coloring pattern in such a manner that apertures 20 shown in FIG. 2A provided in the black matrix 12 are filled.</p>
    <p num="39">The inks used in the present invention comprise each a resin composition comprising its corresponding colorant.</p>
    <p num="40">
      As the colorant, general dyes and pigments may be used.
      <br/>
      Examples of usable dyes include anthraquinone dyes, azo dyes, triphenylmethane dyes and polymethine dyes.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      As the resin used in each ink, is used a resin settable by the application of energy, such as heat treatment or light irradiation.
      <br/>
      Specifically, as a thermosetting resin, a combination of any known resin and a crosslinking agent may be used.
      <br/>
      Examples thereof include an acrylic resin, a melamine resin or a mixture of a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group-containing polymer and melamine; a mixture of a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group-containing polymer and a polyfunctional epoxy compound; a mixture of a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group-containing polymer and a reactive cellulose compound; a mixture of an epoxy resin and a resol resin; a mixture of an epoxy resin and an amine; a mixture of an epoxy resin and a carboxylic acid or an acid anhydride.
      <br/>
      As a photosetting resin, any known ones, for example, a commercially available negative-type resist may preferably be used.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Various kinds of solvents may be used in the above-described inks.
      <br/>
      A mixed solvent of water and at least one water-soluble organic solvent is particularly preferably used from the viewpoint of ejectability in the ink-jet system.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Further, the inks may contain, in addition to the above-described components, surfactants, antifoaming agents, antiseptics and the like as needed to provide them as inks having desired properties.
      <br/>
      Commercially-available water-soluble dyes and/or the like may also be added thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Of the above-described photo- or thermosetting resins, those insoluble in water or water-soluble organic solvents may also be used with any other solvent than water and water-soluble organic solvents so far as the resulting ink can be stably ejected.
      <br/>
      In the case where a monomer of the type that polymerization is induced by light in particular is used, a dye is dissolved in the monomer to prepare an ink of the solvent-free type.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      As the ink-jet system used in the present invention, a bubble-jet type using an electrothermal converter as an energy-generating element, a piezo-jet type making use of a piezoelectric element, or the like may be used.
