    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates generally to a coaxial resonator used as a filter in a microwave band and a dielectric filter constructed using the coaxial resonator.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">As microwave remote communication has been put into practice, there has been a demand for a communication equipment that is more lightweight and smaller in size; thereby, leading to a demand to miniaturize a duplexer which is an essential component in such an equipment.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Examples of a filter used for a duplexer in a microwave band generally includes a so-called coaxial resonator constituted by an outer conductor provided on an outer peripheral surface of a dielectric member having a through hole provided therein and an inner conductor provided on an inner peripheral surface of the through hole, and a strip-line type resonator using a strip line.
      <br/>
      As filters, a quarter-wavelength type filter which resonates at one-fourth of a wavelength at a resonance frequency f by producing the filter in one side short-circuited construction has been generally well known.
      <br/>
      In addition, a coaxial dielectric resonator constructed using a material having a high dielectric constant (.di-elect cons.r=40 to 90) has been widely used as one suitable for miniaturization.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Particularly in a portable telephone, a receiving band and a transmission band are used proximate to each other.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a so-called polarized method having an attenuation pole is adopted for a filter for a duplexer.
      <br/>
      Examples of such a polarized method include a method of obtaining an anti-resonance frequency by connecting a capacitor or an inductor in series with a coaxial dielectric resonator (see Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Gazette No. 4566/1987) and a method of coupling resonators which are not adjacent to each other (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open Gazette No. 108801/1988).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      FIGS. 24A and 24B illustrate a polarized filter explaining the former method, where FIG. 24A is a perspective view showing the filter, and FIG. 24B is a diagram showing an equivalent circuit thereof.
      <br/>
      Three coaxial resonators are used to fabricate a polarized band-pass filter.
      <br/>
      In this polarized band-pass filter, three coaxial resonators 62 are provided on a dielectric substrate 61 (see, FIG. 24A).
      <br/>
      Antiresonance capacitances 63a, 63b and 63c (see, FIG. 24B) are respectively connected to the coaxial resonators 62.
      <br/>
      In addition, chip capacitors 64a to 64d are provided on the dielectric substrate 61.
      <br/>
      The two chip capacitors 64b and 64c out of the chip capacitors 64a to 64d are inter-stage coupling capacitors for coupling the coaxial resonators to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      However, in the above described filter shown in FIG. 24A and 24B, an inter-stage coupling portion is required.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the dielectric substrate 61 must be made relatively large so as to form the inter-stage coupling portion, thereby to making it impossible to miniaturize the filter.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in the above described method of coupling the resonators which are not adjacent to each other, a jump coupling substrate is required, thereby similarly making it impossible to miniaturize the filter.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">The present invention has been made in view of the above described circumstances and has for its object to provide a small-sized dielectric filter and to provide a coaxial resonator used for the small-sized dielectric filter.</p>
    <p num="11">In a quarter-wavelength type coaxial resonator in which an outer conductor is formed on an outer peripheral surface of a dielectric block having at least four side surfaces and having a through hole provided in its approximately central part and an inner conductor is formed on an inner peripheral surface of the through hole, and one of two end faces perpendicular to the through hole is opened and the other end face is short-circuited, a coaxial resonator according to the present invention is characterized in that a pair of an input electrode and an output electrode which are not brought into electrical contact with the outer conductor and are independent of each other is provided in a position in proximity to the opened end face on the outer peripheral surface of the dielectric block, and respective portions of both the electrodes are extended to the side surfaces which are respectively adjacent to the electrodes.</p>
    <p num="12">
      According to the present invention, the input electrode and the output electrode are capacitively coupled to each other, and the input electrode and the output electrode are respectively capacitively coupled to the inner conductor.
      <br/>
      Coupling capacitances can be adjusted depending on the areas of the above described electrodes.
      <br/>
      Coaxial resonators can be connected to each other by electrode portions extended to the above described side surfaces (extended portions).
    </p>
    <p num="13">Furthermore, the dielectric filter according to the present invention is characterized in that a plurality of coaxial resonators as described above are arranged side by side, the above described input and output electrodes formed in the respective coaxial resonators are positioned on the same plane, the opened end faces and the short-circuited end faces in the respective coaxial resonators are arranged in the same direction, and the extended portion of the input electrode and the extended portion of the output electrode respectively formed in the adjacent coaxial resonators are brought into close contact with each other.</p>
    <p num="14">Consequently, the necessity of using a dielectric substrate for carrying chip capacitors and the like in constructing the dielectric filter as a polarized filter is eliminated, thereby making it possible to miniaturize the dielectric filter.</p>
    <p num="15">Furthermore, in a quarter-wavelength type coaxial resonator in which an outer conductor is formed on an outer peripheral surface of a dielectric block having at least four side surfaces and having a through hole provided in its approximately central part and an inner conductor is formed on an inner peripheral surface of the through hole, and one of two end faces perpendicular to the through hole is opened and the other end face is short-circuited, a coaxial resonator according to the present invention is characterized in that an independent conductor for capacitance is provided so as not to be brought into electrical contact with the outer conductor in a position in proximity to the opened end face on the outer peripheral surface of the dielectric block, or an independent conductor for induction is provided so as to be brought into electrical contact with the inner conductor through a conductor on the short-circuited end face and so as not to be brought into electrical contact with the outer conductor in a position in proximity to the short-circuited end face on the outer peripheral surface of the dielectric block.</p>
    <p num="16">
      According to the present invention, the above described coaxial resonator comprises the conductor for capacitance or the conductor for induction on the outer peripheral surface of the dielectric block.
      <br/>
      The conductor for capacitance or the conductor for induction provides a place where in coupling the coaxial resonators to each other by reactance constituted by a chip component, the chip component is carried.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Furthermore, a dielectric filter according to the present invention is characterized in that a plurality of coaxial resonators each comprising the above described conductor for capacitance are used, all or a part of the conductors for capacitance formed in the respective coaxial resonators are positioned on the same plane, the opened end faces and the short-circuited end faces in the respective coaxial resonators are arranged in the same direction, and the conductors for capacitance in the adjacent coaxial resonators are coupled to each other by reactance, or a plurality of coaxial resonators comprising the above described conductor for induction are used, all or a part of the conductors for induction formed in the respective coaxial resonators are positioned on the same plane, and the opened end faces and the short-circuited end faces in the respective coaxial resonators are arranged in the same direction, and the conductors for induction in the adjacent coaxial resonators are coupled to each other by reactance.</p>
    <p num="18">Consequently, in the dielectric filter in which a plurality of coaxial resonators as described above are arranged side by side, chip components constituting the above described reactance are carried on the coaxial resonators to couple the coaxial resonators to each other, the necessity of using a dielectric substrate for carrying chip capacitors and the like in constructing the dielectric filter as a polarized filter as in the conventional example is eliminated, thereby to make it possible to miniaturize the dielectric filter.</p>
    <p num="19">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

      Coaxial resonators 31a, 31b and 31c in FIG. 3 are respectively the above described coaxial resonator according to the present invention shown in FIG. 1, and inner peripheral surfaces of dielectric block through-holes are respectively provided with inner conductors 32a, 32b and 32c coated with a conductive member such as silver.
      <br/>
      Outer peripheral surfaces of the dielectric blocks are respectively provided with outer conductors 33a, 33b and 33c coated with a conductive member such as silver.

      <br/>
      The output electrodes 35a, 35b and 35c and the input electrodes 34a, 34b and 34c are respectively opposed to each other with a corresponding gap G parallel to the axial direction of each of the coaxial resonators being provided therebetween.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The respective input and output electrodes are so formed as to be extended to side surfaces which are respectively adjacent to the input and output electrodes, as in the above described coaxial resonator according to the present invention.

      The input electrode 34a and the output electrode 35c respectively function as input and output electrodes of the coaxial resonators and at the same time, also respectively function as input and output electrodes of the dielectric filter according to the present invention.

      <br/>
      Specifically, when the areas are equal to each other but the shapes are different from each other, both the electrodes cannot be completely brought into contact with each other over the whole areas irrespective of an attempt to bring both the electrodes into contact with each other by providing the dielectric resonators side by side, which causes capacitances or the like to vary to adversely affect the characteristics.
