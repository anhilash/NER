      In one embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus for retaining a printed circuit board includes a hollow shell structure having an aperture and an inner slot for receiving the printed circuit board and a mounting bracket including a frame portion for receiving the shell structure.
      <br/>
      A rim extends around the perimeter of the aperture and flexible flanges extend from at least a portion of the rim.
      <br/>
      The flexible flanges include a neck portion and a lower tab that provide means to retain the shell structure in the mounting bracket.
      <br/>
      The inner slot is sized to fit snugly around the perimeter of the printed circuit board when the printed circuit board is inserted in the shell structure.
      <br/>
      The shell structure is constructed of a dielectric material that substantially insulates the printed circuit board from electro-static discharge and/or other types of electrical damage or interference, as well as shock and vibrations.
      <br/>
      The present mounting bracket optionally includes support structure for mounting additional hardware components within a device and a mounting tab for attaching the mounting bracket within a device.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates generally to an apparatus for retaining a printed circuit board and, more particularly, to an apparatus for retaining a printed circuit board including a flexible shell structure for enclosing the printed circuit board and mounting it on a frame.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Currently, microprocessors are embedded in an increasing variety of devices.
      <br/>
      Hardware components associated with the microprocessors, such as printed circuit boards, must be placed in a variety of differently sized and shaped locations.
      <br/>
      Packaging means adaptable for use in a variety of spaces is desired.
      <br/>
      In spaces that do not allow easy access, packaging means that do not require fasteners is also desired.
      <br/>
      Further, it is desirable to provide means for insulating the hardware from vibration, shock, and electro-static discharges.
    </p>
    <p num="3">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems as set forth above.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      In one embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus for retaining a printed circuit board includes a hollow shell structure having an inner slot and an aperture for receiving the printed circuit board and a mounting bracket including a frame portion for receiving the shell structure.
      <br/>
      A rim extends around the perimeter of the aperture and flexible flanges extend from at least a portion of the rim.
      <br/>
      The flexible flanges include a neck portion and a lower tab that provide means to retain the shell structure in the mounting bracket.
      <br/>
      The inner slot is sized to fit snugly around the perimeter of the printed circuit board when the printed circuit board is inserted in the shell structure.
      <br/>
      The shell structure is constructed of dielectric material that electrically insulates the printed circuit board from electro-static discharge and/or other types of electrical damage or interference, as well as shock and vibrations.
      <br/>
      The present mounting bracket optionally includes support structure for mounting additional hardware components within a device and a mounting tab for attaching the mounting bracket within a device.

    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      Referring to FIG. 1, components of an assembly for retaining a printed circuit board 20 are shown including a hollow shell structure 22 that may be inserted in mounting bracket 24.
      <br/>
      The shell structure 22 is shown in greater detail in FIGS. 2 through 5.
      <br/>
      An aperture in some portion of the shell structure 22 is provided to allow printed circuit board 20 to be inserted in the shell structure 22.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment of the present invention shown in FIGS. 2 through 5, the bottom of the shell structure 22 is substantially open, providing an aperture 26 for receiving printed circuit board 20.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A rim 28 extends around the perimeter of the aperture 26 as best shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The present invention includes flexible flanges 30 extending from at least a portion of rim 28 in a manner that provides means to retain the shell structure 22 in the mounting bracket 24.
      <br/>
      Various configurations of flexible flanges 30 are anticipated as the shell structure 22 may have any shape required for retaining different printed circuit boards 20.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, a flexible flange 30 extends from each side of rim 28, however, other embodiments having only two flexible flanges 30, each extending from adjacent or opposite sides, is anticipated.
      <br/>
      Other embodiments having one flexible flange 30 extending completely or substantially around the rim 28, or three flexible flanges 30 extending from three sides of the rim 28, are also anticipated.
      <br/>
      The flexible flanges 30 may be substantially straight, or curved, depending on the shape of rim 28.
      <br/>
      The flexible flange 30 is capable of bending in a manner that allows the flexible flanges 30 to be inserted and removed from mounting bracket 24 as described hereinbelow.
      <br/>
      The flexible flanges 30 are also capable of returning substantially to the shape they had prior to having been bent during insertion or removal from mounting bracket 24.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, flexible flange 30 has an L-shape to create a neck portion 32 between the rim 28 and a lower tab 34 of flexible flange 30.
      <br/>
      The neck portion 32 engages an inner edge of a frame in the mounting bracket 24 as described hereinbelow to retain the shell structure 22 in the mounting bracket 24.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The shell structure 22 advantageously includes an inner slot 35 as shown in FIG. 4a that is sized to fit snugly around the perimeter of printed circuit board 20 when the printed circuit board 20 is inserted in the shell structure 22.
      <br/>
      The inner slot 35 may extend wither partially or completely around the perimeter of printed circuit board 20.
      <br/>
      The inner slot 35 helps prevent breakage of components on the printed circuit board 20, which might otherwise occur if the printed circuit board 20 was allowed to move within the shell structure 22.
      <br/>
      Further, this helps maintain connections with any connectors (not shown) attached to components on the printed circuit board 20.
      <br/>
      To protect the printed circuit board 20, the shell structure 22 may be constructed of a highly dielectric material that electrically insulates printed circuit board 20 from electro-static discharge and/or other types of electrical damage or interference.
      <br/>
      The shell structure 22 may also be constructed from material that absorbs shock and vibrations, to further protect the printed circuit board 20 and components thereon from damage.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      FIGS. 6 through 9 show mounting bracket 24 in greater detail including a frame portion 36 for engaging the flexible flanges 30 of shell structure 22.
      <br/>
      The frame portion 36 includes an inner perimeter 38 around opening 40.
      <br/>
      The opening 40 and inner perimeter 38 are shaped and sized to retain shell structure 22 by engaging neck portion 32 with inner perimeter 38 and supporting shell structure 22 on frame portion 36.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The flexible flanges 30 and shell structure 22 are constructed of material that allows them to bend when force is applied.
      <br/>
      The material also has elastic properties that cause the flexible flanges 30 and shell structure 22 to spring substantially back to the shape they originally had before being bent.
      <br/>
      The rim 28 snaps over printed circuit board 20 to insert printed circuit board 20 into inner slot 35 in shell structure 22.
      <br/>
      The flexible flanges 30 may be bent outwardly away from aperture 26 to facilitate inserting printed circuit board 20 into the slot 35 in shell structure 22.
      <br/>
      In order to insert shell structure 22 in opening 40, flexible flanges 30 are bent inwardly toward aperture 26 as shell structure 22 is lowered into opening 40.
      <br/>
      Since the flexible flanges 30 spring substantially back to their original shape when they are released, the shell structure 22 is retained in the frame by lower tab 34.
      <br/>
      To remove the shell structure 22, force is applied to bend lower tabs 34 toward aperture 26.
      <br/>
      With the lower tabs 34 bent inwardly, the shell structure 22 may be lifted from the frame portion 36.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      An important feature of the present invention is that means for retaining shell structure 22 and printed circuit board 20 in frame portion 36 are integrated with the structure of the shell structure 22.
      <br/>
      No additional fasteners or structure is required to retain printed circuit board 20 in shell structure 22, or to retain shell structure 22 in frame portion 36.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      An optional feature that may be included with mounting bracket 24 is additional support structure 42 attached to, or integrally formed with, frame portion 36 for mounting additional hardware components within a device.
      <br/>
      The support structure 42 may be configured to support various hardware components as required, such as one or more control switches.
      <br/>
      The hardware components may or may not be connected to printed circuit board 20.
      <br/>
      The support structure 42 may include means for attaching hardware components such as holes 44, 46 for attachment screws.
      <br/>
      Other attachment means such as clips and flanges may be included in addition to or instead of holes 44, 46.
