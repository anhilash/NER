    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to the stabilization of vitamin A derivatives by encapsulation in lipid vesicles formed with long chain alkylammonium fatty acid salts.
      <br/>
      The present invention also relates to compositions comprising such liposomes for the cosmetic or dermatological treatment of imperfections or complaints of the skin, including the scalp.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention relates to a composition for treating the skin comprising at least one vitamin A derivative as an active agent encapsulated in the long chain alkylammonium fatty acid salt liposomes of the invention and methods of using such compositions.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Liposome formation is a natural result of the amphipathic nature of the molecules of which they are comprised.
      <br/>
      Amphipathic molecules are those molecules with distinct regions of the molecule having hydrophilic character and distinct regions of the same molecule having hydrophobic character.
      <br/>
      When dispersed in water, amphipathic molecules form three types of macro-molecular structure: micelles, hexagonal phase and lipid bilayers.
      <br/>
      The exact macromolecular structure which is formed depends on the relative sizes of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of the molecule.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Micelle formation is favored when the cross sectional area of the hydrophilic region of the molecule is greater than that of the hydrophobic part of the molecule.
      <br/>
      Detergents are examples of such molecules, e.g., sodium palmitate.
      <br/>
      Detergents contain a hydrocarbon chain (the hydrophobic portion of the molecule) and an ionic base (the hydrophilic portion of the molecule), and act as emulsifying agents to bind water and oil phases.
      <br/>
      That is, detergents allow oil and water to be broken into tiny droplets suspended or dispersed in water.
      <br/>
      Particular detergents 1 may be classified as anions (negatively charged at the hydrophilic portion) and may be represented, as shown in FIG. 1, as having a hydrophilic head 2 with a hydrocarbon (hydrophobic) tail 4.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a representation of a micelle structure 5 formed of a number of detergent molecules due to their hydrophilic/hydrophobic character.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In the opposite conformation, i.e., when the cross sectional area of the hydrophobic region of the molecule is greater than that of the hydrophilic part of the molecule, the formation of hexagonal phase structures is favored, e.g., dimyristoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE).
      <br/>
      FIG. 4A is a representation of a hexagonal phase structure, sometimes referred to as an inverse micelle.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      For molecules in which the cross sectional area of the hydrophilic region of the molecule is slightly less than, or equal to, that of the hydrophobic part of the molecule, such as many phospholipids, the formation of bilayers is favored, e.g., dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC).
      <br/>
      Phospholipids are an amphipathic type of lipid which contain phosphate, that is, molecules containing one phosphate, a glycerol and one or more fatty acids.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 is a simplified representation of a phospholipid molecule 6, including a hydrophilic head 8 (i.e., the phosphate and glycerol) and a hydrophobic tail 10 (i.e., the one or more fatty acids).
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 is a representation of a phospholipid bylayer 12, where the hydrophobic regions 14 of the phospholipid molecules are caused to turn inward due to the aqueous environment, and the hydrophilic portions 16 face outward.
      <br/>
      These bilayers are two dimensional sheets in which all of the hydrophobic portions, e.g., acyl side chains, are shielded from interaction with water except those at the ends of the sheet.
      <br/>
      An energetically unfavorable interaction of the acyl chains with water results in the folding of the bilayers to form three-dimensional, vesicles.
      <br/>
      These vesicles are referred to as "liposomes".
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Liposomes may be formed as a single bilayer enclosing a single aqueous space (small unilamellar vesicles; SUVS) or may be composed of concentric bilayers with many aqueous spaces alternating with the bilayers (multilamellar vesicles; MLVS).
      <br/>
      Liposomes can be used to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials.
      <br/>
      Hydrophobic payloads are typically partitioned within the bilayers whereas hydrophilic payloads are typically trapped within the aqueous compartments.
      <br/>
      The advantages of using liposomes as a carrier/encapsulation system is that they are stable and can protect their payload from degradation, e.g., by oxygen, digestive enzymes, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,957,971, issued May 15, 1976, discloses liposome-formed moisturizing units which are capable of moisturizing and improving flexibility, plasticity, and softness of keratinous matter, particularly mammalian skin.
      <br/>
      The liposomes within which the moisturizer is stored include a matrix of a ternary lipid mixture of lecithin, dicetyl phosphate, and a sterol, and include cavities disposed within the liposome.
      <br/>
      The cavities (lamellar space) contain an humectant, such as sodium pyroglutamate, in an aqueous medium.
      <br/>
      Moisturizing liposomes are also disclosed therein which function osmotically, serving as traps for water, which may be shared with the keratin constituents as required.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Liposomes also may be used for the timed delivery of a wide variety of materials including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and nutrients.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,016,100, issued Apr. 5, 1977, discloses a method of producing a pharmaceutical composition comprised of an aqueous suspension of an active agent entrapped in a spherule of a phospholipid (liposome) The composition, or drug delivery vehicle, is prepared by dispersing a phospholipid uniformly in water to give an aqueous phospholipid dispersion, adding a medicament to the aqueous dispersion and freezing the thus-obtained aqueous dispersion to entrap the medicament in lipid spherules formed.
      <br/>
      The frozen dispersion is then thawed to realize an aqueous suspension of spherules having diameters of less than 5.0 microns.
      <br/>
      The timed release of an active agent is directly related to the amount of active agent trapped in the liposomes.
      <br/>
      The greater the amount of active agent, the longer the release process lasts.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      A goal of the liposome research has been the development of a liposomal delivery system that would deliver its payload not over time as in the '100 patent mentioned above, but on cue, i.e., a controlled release, for example, in a mammalian body.
      <br/>
      For example, a delivery system that delivers its payload when applied to the skin or when arriving at a tumor.
      <br/>
      A bulk of the research has been based on admixtures of liposomes and other biological macromolecules such as antibodies and lecithins.
      <br/>
      Various degrees of success have been achieved with these systems but none have produced a liposome that will release its payload, or not, depending on the prevailing conditions.
      <br/>
      The invention described herein is just such a liposome: the degree of, payload encapsulation may be altered by changes in pH and/or ionic strength of the surrounding medium thereby realizing a triggered delivery system in a form of a liposome.
    </p>

      Vitamin A derivatives are desirable ingredients in cosmetic formulations.
      <br/>
      Retinol (vitamin A) is an endogenous compound which occurs naturally in the human body and is essential for normal epithelial cell differentiation.
      <br/>
      Natural and synthetic vitamin A derivatives have been used extensively in the treatment of a variety of skin disorders and have been used as skin repair or renewal agents.
      <br/>
      Retinoic acid has been employed to treat a variety of skin conditions, e.g., acne, wrinkles, psoriasis, age spots and discoloration.
      <br/>
      See e.g., Vahlquist, A. et al., J. Invest. Dermatol., Vol. 94, Holland D. B. and Cunliffe, W. J. (1990), pp. 496-498; Ellis, C. N. et al., "Pharmacology of Retinols in Skin", Vasel, Karger, Vol. 3, (1989), pp. 249-252; Lowe, N.J. et al., "Pharmacology of Retinols in Skin", Vol. 3, (1989), pp. 240-248; PCT Patent Application No. WO 93/19743.
    </p>
    <p num="12">It is believed that the use of retinol and retinyl esters would be preferred over the use of retinoic acid in the treatment of skin due to the fact that retinol is both an endogenous compound found in the body and are considered much safer than retinoic acid.</p>
    <p num="13">
      Retinol and retinyl esters are known for their beneficial effects on the skin, in particular in topical application.
      <br/>
      Retinol and retinyl esters have for a long time been used in the treatment of acne.
      <br/>
      However, it is in the field of repair of damage caused either by age or by over-exposure to the sun that retinol has proven to be extremely active.
      <br/>
      Thus, the effects of retinol retinyl esters on cell differentiation make it possible to envisage their use thereof for effectively combating the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, and for combating dryness, roughness and/or stiffness of the skin.
      <br/>
      In addition, they are active as antioxidants in the regeneration of tissues.
      <br/>
      Repeated application of cosmetic compositions containing retinol and/or retinyl esters have enabled wrinkles to be removed, the skin to be rendered smooth and small cracks in the epidermis to be repaired.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      On account of these beneficial effects, it has for a very long time been sought to formulate retinol and retinyl esters in cosmetically acceptable compositions in a form which is stable over time at room temperature.
      <br/>
      However, retinol and retinyl esters have been shown to be unstable when stored over time and are thus difficult to formulate into cosmetic compositions.
      <br/>
      Particularly, retinol and retinyl esters are highly sensitive to elevated temperatures and result in significant color changes upon degradation.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Thus, although retinol and retinyl esters are considered safer to use than retinoic acid, they are less effective than retinoic acid at providing skin benefits due to their decreased stability which leads to inactivation.
      <br/>
      It would thus be highly desirable to stabilize the unstable vitamin A derivatives, retinol and/or retinyl esters, for use in the treatment of skin.
    </p>
    <p num="16">A number of methods have been adopted to stabilize the breakdown of vitamin A.</p>
    <p num="17">U.S. Pat. No. 5,738,858 discloses skin care compositions containing fatty hydroxyethyl imidazoline surfactants in combination with retinol and/or retinyl esters for use in stabilizing such compounds.</p>
    <p num="18">U.S. Pat. No. 5,756,109 discloses skin care compositions containing geranyl geraniol in combination with retinol and/or retinyl esters for use in stabilizing such compounds.</p>
    <p num="19">U.S. Pat. No. 5,759,556 discloses skin care compositions containing cyclic aliphatic unsaturated aldehydes, ketones alcohols or esters in combination with retinol and/or retinyl esters for use in stabilizing such compounds.</p>
    <p num="20">U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,148 discloses skin care compositions containing emulsions of unstable retinol and/or retinyl esters in an oil phase for use in stabilizing such compounds.</p>
    <p num="21">Encapsulation of retinol into liposomes has also been shown to be effective in enhancing the stability of the encapsulated vitamin A derivatives, however, none of these liposomes incorporate the preferred cationic long chain alkylammonium fatty acid salt liposomes of the invention.</p>
    <p num="22">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,679,374 discloses the encapsulation of retinol into two different types of liposome compositions which allow for the simultaneous action of two different active agents, one of which may be retinol and its derivatives.
      <br/>
      The different liposomes used provide for penetration into different areas of the skin, i.e. surface layers and deep layers.
      <br/>
      The liposomes used are not cationic liposomes and there is no enhancement of the stability of the retinol is shown.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      WO 96/31194 discloses the encapsulation of retinoids into non-phospholipid, non-ionic liposomes which provide for increased chemical stability over a long period of time.
      <br/>
      However, the liposomes used are non-ionic and do not display the characteristics of the cationic liposomes of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="24">U.S. Pat. No. 5,192,544 discloses the encapsulation of a retinoid compound into phospholipid liposomes with the concomitant incorporation of a pyrimidine derivative which is used to enhance stabilization.</p>
    <p num="25">It has now surprisingly been found that unstable vitamin A derivatives, when encapsulated in liposomes formulated with long chain alkylammonium fatty acid salts as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,874,105, issued Feb. 23, 1999, show a significant improvement in long term stability.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="26">It is an object of the present invention to provide a composition comprising liposome encapsulated vitamin A derivative or derivatives which enhances the stability of the vitamin A derivative or derivatives encapsulated therein.</p>
    <p num="27">The liposome composition of the invention is formed with long chain alkylammonium fatty acid salts as described in the above-identified U.S. Pat. No. 5,874,105 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
    <p num="28">
      The long chain alkylammonium fatty acid salt liposomes used to encapsulate the vitamin A derivative or derivatives deliver their entrapped load at the occurrence of a preset condition and display cationic characteristics.
      <br/>
      The liposomes are formed with trialkylammonium fatty acid salts, of long chain amides such that a portion of the molecular structure defined thereby includes a portion which readily adheres to protein and like molecules.
      <br/>
      Such liposomes are capable of delivering their load upon the occurrence of a trigger or control condition.
      <br/>
      It has surprisingly been found that the encapsulation of vitamin A derivatives in such liposome compositions provides for enhanced stability of the encapsulated vitamin A derivative or derivatives at various temperatures over time.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Upon being passed from an environment characteristic of a particular pH or temperature, the molecular structure of the long chain alkylammonium fatty acid salt liposomes becomes unstable in the changed environment causing the liposomes to deliver their vitamin A derivative(s) load.</p>
    <p num="30">The particular liposomes of the invention which are used to encapsulate the vitamin A derivative or derivatives may be formed in accordance with the process or processes of manufacture disclosed in the above-identified U.S. Pat. No. 5,974,105. An example of such liposomes is marketed under the tradename CATEZOMES (tm) .</p>
    <p num="31">It is another object of the invention to provide topical skin treatment formulations in the treatment of skin imperfections, dry skin, photodamaged skin, wrinkles, age spots, acne, skin lightening, psoriasis, and atopic dermatosis</p>
    <p num="32">It is yet another object of the invention to provide a method for treating the skin comprising administering to the skin a topical skin treatment formulation comprising at least one vitamin A derivative as an active agent encapsulated in the long chain alkylammonium fatty acid salt vesicles of the invention.</p>

      <br/>
      A particularly preferred concentration range is from about 5.0% w/w to about 20% w/w.
    </p>
    <p num="39">The emollients to be used in the invention may be classified under such general chemical categories as esters, fatty acids and alcohols, polyols and hydrocarbons.</p>

    <p num="42">
      Among the polyols which may serve as emollients are linear and branched chain alkyl polyhydroxyl compounds.
      <br/>
      For example, propylene glycol, sorbitol and glycerin are preferred.
      <br/>
      Also useful may be polymeric polyols such as polypropylene glycol and polyethylene glycol.
      <br/>
      Butylene and propylene glycol are also especially preferred as penetration enhancers.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Exemplary hydrocarbons which may serve as emollients are those having hydrocarbon chains anywhere from 12 to 30 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Specific examples include mineral oil, petroleum jelly, squalene and isoparaffins.
      <br/>
      Additional hydrocarbon oils which can be used as emollients include but are not limited to corn, safflower and vegetable oils.
    </p>
    <p num="44">The Vitamin A derivative or Vitamin A derivative/emollient mixture are added to the liposome formulation mixture prior to incorporation into liposomes to give a concentration range of vitamin A derivative in the liposome formulation mixture of from at least about 0.01% w/w to at least about 50% w/w, preferably from at least about 0.1% w/w to at least about 30% w/w, and most preferably from at least about about 1% w/w to about 20% w/w.</p>
    <p num="45">
      The A-ADDA molecules to be used in the formulation of the liposomes of the invention are incorporated into the liposome formulation mixture prior to incorporation into liposomes in a concentration range of from about 0.01% w/w to about 20% w/w.
      <br/>
      A preferred concentration range is from about 0.1% w/w to about 10% w/w.
      <br/>
      A particularly preferred concentration range is from about 1% w/w to about 5% w/w.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In a further embodiment, a co-solvent may also be incorporated with the liposomes of the invention.
      <br/>
      The co-solvent is not required in the liposome formulations of the invention.
      <br/>
      Such incorporation may be carried out either prior to or following liposome formulation by incorporating the co-solvent either into the liposome formulation mixture or into the liposome formulation after the liposomes have been made.
      <br/>
      Examples of such co-solvents to be incorporated include but are not limited to propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol butylene glycol or any combination thereof.

      A preferred concentration range for the co-solvent is from about 0% w/w to about 10% w/w.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      In yet a further embodiment, a germicide may also be incorporated in the liposomes of the invention.
      <br/>
      The germacide is not required in the liposome formulations of the invention.
      <br/>
      As with the co-solvent, such incorporation may be carried out either prior to or following liposome formulation by incorporating the germacide either into the liposome formulation mixture or into the liposome formulation after the liposomes have been made.
      <br/>
      Such germicide acts as a preservative to prevent the growth of bacteria during storage of either the liposomes or formulations incorporating such liposomes.
      <br/>
      Such germicides are well known in the art of cosmetic formulations.
      <br/>
      Non-limiting examples of such germicides include Germazide MPB (tm) , Midtect TF-60 (tm) , Midpol 2000 (tm) , Midpol PHN (tm) , Germall II (tm) , Glydant (tm) , Glydant PIus (tm) , Paragon II (tm) , Myavert C (tm) , Germall 115 (tm) , Glycacil-L (tm) , Kathon CG (tm) , Merguard 1190 (tm) , Merguard 1200 (tm) , Phenonip (tm) , Uniphen P-23 (tm) , GermnabenIl (tm) , Germaben II-E (tm) , Dowicil 200 (tm) , Suttocide A (tm)  and Irgasan DP-300 (tm) . The germacide to be used in the compositions of the invention are incorporated into the liposome formulation mixture or into the liposome formulation in a concentration range of from about 0% w/w to about 10% w/w.
      <br/>
      A particularly preferred concentration range is from about 0% w/w to about 3% w/w.
    </p>
    <p num="48">All of the components of the liposome formulation mixture are preferably dispersed in water or any suitable buffering solution having a pH of around 5 to 11 and an ionic strength of less than about 1 molar NaCl along with the vitamin A derivative(s), along with any co-solvent or gemacide to be added either before or after liposome formulation.</p>
    <p num="49">The processing and formulation of retinol and/or retinyl esters into the liposome compositions described herein provide for a highly stable vitamin A derivative product which is easily formulated into cosmetic bases.</p>
    <p num="50">
      This invention thus relates to the encapsulation of vitamin A derivative in water-insoluble lipid vesicles (liposomes) prepared from alkylammonium fatty acid salts.
      <br/>
      While liposomes are not new, the liposomes disclosed in the above-identified U.S. Pat. No. 5,874,105, which can be inexpensively and efficiently formed and which display cationic characteristics as well as an ability to deliver their loads at the occurrence of a predetermined triggering condition were heretofore unknown.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,721,612, discloses a method and composition for the preparation of conventional lipid vesicles (liposomes) the bilayers of which comprise a salt form of an organic acid derivative of a sterol, such as the tris-salt form of a sterol hemisuccinate.
      <br/>
      The method disclosed therein allows for liposome formation which may be used to entrap compounds which are insoluble in aqueous solutions, such as bioactive agents of limited solubility.
      <br/>
      This conventionally formed liposome, however, includes no method for controlling delivery.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In contrast, liposomes used in the present invention, because of their unique construction are highly sensitive to both pH and ionic strength of the surrounding medium in which they reside and are therefore specifically deliverable.
      <br/>
      This unique property results in part because they are formed of alkylammonium fatty acyl salts which are stabilized by a salt bridge.
      <br/>
      Such a characteristic provides the method to control the release of the load.
      <br/>
      The liposomes of the invention deliver their loads at the occurrence of a predetermined triggering condition.
      <br/>
      Examples of such triggering conditions include drying, heating, increased ionic strength and changes in pH.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the liposomes of this invention are formed with molecules which consist of the following parts: a fatty acid of between 12 and 28 carbon atoms; an Nn,Nn -dimethyl-1,n-diamino alkyl (DDA) chain with the number of carbons (n) being equal to 2-8, for example N3,N3 -dimethyl-propyl-1,3-diamine �NH2 (CH2)3 N(CH3)2 �; and a fatty acid of between 10 and 30 carbon atoms, together forming the ADDA.
      <br/>
      To form its basic structure, one molecule of fatty acid is linked via an amide bond to the primary amino group of the DDA to form an acyl-DDA (ADDA), for example, behenyl-DDA or palmitol-DDA.
      <br/>
      Such ADDA material is available under the trade name Catemol from the Phoenix Chemical Co. of Somerville, New Jersey, i.e., Catemol 220 and 160, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      When the fatty acid is behenic acid (C22) and the DDA has 3 carbon atoms, the molecule would be N1 -behenamido-N2,N2 -dimethyl-propyl-1,3-diamine �CH3 (CH2)20 CONHCH2 CH2 CH2 N(CH3)2 �, (BDDP).
      <br/>
      Phoenix also sells another major group of chemicals which are a mixture of Catemol 220 and behenic acid, or Catemol 160 with palmitic acid to get Catemol 220B and 160P respectively.
      <br/>
      These are referred to herein as A-ADDAs (B-BDDP and P-PDDP).
      <br/>
      The ADDAs are cationic due to the quaternary amine; the A-ADDPs are inherently neutral.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that at pH less than about 10.5, the tertiary amine of the DDA will be protonated to form a quaternary amine with a positive charge.
      <br/>
      Free fatty acid carboxyl groups, attached to the tertiary amine group via the salt bridge, such as behenyl, have a pK of approximately 5 and so above a pH of 5 will be deprotonated and display a negative charge.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      To form A-ADDAS, the ADDA is mixed with a second fatty acid of between 12 and 28 carbon atoms in equimolar proportions and at a pH between 6 and 10 such that a salt is formed between the quaternary amine group of the ADDA and the carboxyl group of the fatty acid to form acyl ADDA (A-ADDA).
      <br/>
      An example where the ADDA is BDDP and the first fatty acid is behenic acid (C22) would be behenyl-N1 -behenamido-N2,N2 -dimethyl-propyl-1,3-diamine �CH3 (CH2)20 COO- * CH3 (CH2)20 CONHCH2 CH2 CH2 N(CH3)2 �, (B-BDDP).
      <br/>
      An energy minimized molecular model of B-BDDP is presented in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      It is apparent from the molecular model shown in FIG. 5 that these molecules are amphipathic: the salt bond region of the molecule being polar, the alkyl chain region of the molecule being hydrophobic.
      <br/>
      The molecule is also approximately cylindrical in cross-section and thus would be predicted to form bilayers and liposomes in aqueous media as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The long chain (greater than twelve carbons) A-ADDA is dispersed in a suitable vehicle (water or any aqueous solution having a pH range between 4.5 and 10.5 and an ionic strength of less than, or equivalent to 1 molar NaCI) either by using a mechanical homogenizer at ambient temperature or by stirring at a temperature above that of the melting point of the components of the mixture.
      <br/>
      Following dispersion of the hydrocarbons in the vehicle, the mixture is subjected to high-sheer processing.
      <br/>
      The precise conditions for the high-sheer processing step must be established empirically for each mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      In this context, high-sheer processing refers to any technique which is capable of mixing ingredients (liquid, solid or mixtures of both) in such a manner that significant energy is imparted to the mixture.
      <br/>
      Examples would include sonnicators, high-speed mixers and microfluidizers, which are conventional.
      <br/>
      In particular, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,533,254 and 4,908,154, disclose conventional methods and apparatus for forming emulsions, a term used to include microemulsions, which could be utilized herein.
      <br/>
      A sheet within an emulsion-forming liquid mixture is forced under pressure to impinge upon itself in a low-pressure turbulent zone of the liquid utilizing an apparatus comprising a plurality of nozzles with elongated orifices for ejecting, under pressure, sheets of the emulsion-forming liquid.
      <br/>
      The jets are arranged to effect impingement of the sheets along a common liquid jet interaction front, thereby imposing mechanical energy.
      <br/>
      Such devices offer great flexibility in choice and amounts of immiscible liquids and emulsifying agents.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Similarly, mixing ADDA with a long chain alcohol (C12, C28), e.g., behenyl alcohol, will also result in a molecule with cylindrical cross-section.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, the cationic charge of the DDA is not neutralized and the liposomes which are formed have a large cationic surface charge.
    </p>
    <p num="57">The A-ADDA molecules used in the formulation of the liposomes of the invention form bilayers and liposomes which encapsulate the vitamin A derivative(s) of the invention into the bilayer regions.</p>
    <p num="58">
      The liposomes of the invention deliver their loads at the occurrence of a predetermined triggering condition.
      <br/>
      Examples of such triggering conditions include drying, heating, increased ionic strength and changes in pH.
      <br/>
      The Catezomes (tm)  liposomes of the invention preferentially deliver and keep their payloads at the stratum corneum of the skin.
      <br/>
      The liposomes of the invention release their payload slowly over time, thus providing for delivery of the vitamin A derivative(s) over a prolonged period.
      <br/>
      The increased stabilization of the vitamin A derivative(s) by encapsulation in lipid vesicles formed with alkylammonium fatty acid salts allows for such long term delivery by preserving the vitamin A derivative(s) and protecting them from degradation.
    </p>
    <p num="59">The final liposome products of the invention are comprised of retinol or retinyl ester in a final concentration range of from about 0.001% to about 20%, preferably in an amount of from about 0.01% to about 10%, most preferably in an amount of from about 0.01% to about 5.0%.</p>

    <p num="62">
      Vehicles other than water can include liquid or solid emollients, solvents, humectants, thickeners and powders.
      <br/>
      Especially desirable are mixtures of low and high viscosity silicones.
      <br/>
      These silicones are available from the General Electric Company under trademarks Vicasil, SE and SF and from the Dow Coming Company under the 200 and 550 Series.
      <br/>
      Amounts of silicone which can be utilized in the compositions of this invention range anywhere from at least about 5 to at least about 95%, preferably from at least about 25 to at least about 90% by weight of the composition.
      <br/>
      Gums such as Carbomer (tm) , Natrosol (tm)  and Jaguar (tm)  are additional examples of cosmetic vehicles to be used in the formulation.
      <br/>
      Additional cosmetic vehicles and methods of formulating cosmetically acceptable topical skin treatment will be well known to those of skill in the art.

    <p num="78">Use of the Composition</p>
    <p num="79">
      The composition according to the invention is intended primarily as a product for topical application to human skin.
      <br/>
      Especially for the cosmetic or dermatological treatment of imperfections or complaints of the skin, including the scalp.
      <br/>
      The composition according to the invention is particularly useful as an agent for conditioning and smoothing the skin, and preventing or reducing the appearance of wrinkled or aged skin and can thus be formulated into a topical skin treatment formulation for use in cosmetic applications.
      <br/>
      The topical skin treatment formulation of the invention is thus useful in the removal of oxidants from the skin and in the dermatological treatment of the skin including, but not limited to, skin imperfections, dry skin, photodamaged skin, wrinkles, age spots, acne, skin lightening, psoriasis, and atopic dermatosis
    </p>
    <p num="80">In use, a small quantity of the topical skin treatment composition of the invention, for example from 1 to 5 ml, is applied to exposed areas of the skin, from a suitable container or applicator and, if necessary, it is then spread over and/or rubbed into the skin using the hand or fingers or a suitable device.</p>
    <p num="81">The topical skin treatment composition of the invention contains at least about 0.05% to at least about 5.0% of vitamin A derivative in the final composition.</p>
    <p num="82">Product Form and Packaging</p>
    <p num="83">
      The topical skin treatment composition of the invention for use in cosmetic applications can be formulated as a lotion, a fluid cream, a cream or a gel.
      <br/>
      The composition can be packaged in a suitable container to suit its viscosity and intended use by the consumer.
      <br/>
      For example, a lotion or fluid cream can be packaged in a bottle or a roll-ball applicator, or a capsule, or a propellant-driven aerosol device or a container fitted with a pump suitable for finger operation.
      <br/>

    <p num="84">Stabilization of Vitamin A Derivatives in Cationic Vesicles</p>
    <p num="85">Encapsulation of vitamin A derivative in the CATEZOMES (tm)  liposomes has a pronounced positive effect upon the stability of vitamin A derivative.</p>
    <p num="86">
      The liposome vesicles containing vitamin A derivative as prepared according to the invention with high pressure, high shear processing improve the long-term stability of the vitamin A derivative under all storage conditions.
      <br/>
      The encapsulated vitamin A derivative of the invention is thus well suited for formulation into the topical cosmetic formulations of the invention due to their increased stability.
      <br/>
      In addition, due to its cationic nature, the liposome composition of the invention remains on the skin for a prolonged period, and the increased stabilization of the vitamin A derivative provides for a longer term of delivery for the normally unstable vitamin A derivative payload.
      <br/>
      Destabilizing conditions may include storage temperature ranges of from 4 (degree)  C. to 100 (degree)  C. and acidic or basic environments.
      <br/>
      The stability of the encapsulated vitamin A derivative of the invention was tested herein using HPLC analysis to determine breakdown of the vitamin A derivative following storage at 4 (degree)  C., 25 (degree)  C., 40 (degree)  C. and 50 (degree)  C. for one month. (See Examples 4-11 below.)
    </p>
    <p num="87">The encapsulated vitamin A derivatives of the invention are thus stabilized against degradation during storage and are preferred for use in cosmetic formulations.</p>
    <p num="88">
      The liposomes of the invention are also used for encapsulating other hydrophobic and hydrophilic substances (ie., a "load material").
      <br/>
      Examples of such hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials include water, active agent, genetic material or a personal care element.

      B-BDDP is dispersed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 140 mM NaCI) by stirring at a temperature of 70 (degree)  C. for 20 minutes.
      <br/>
      The dispersion is then subjected to high-sheer processing by passage through a microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton, Mass.) five times, occurring at an operating pressure of 10,000 psi and an operating temperature between 10 (degree)  C. and 20 (degree)  C. It should be noted that any materials) to be incorporated into the liposomes are added either at the initial mixing stage or immediately prior to high-shear processing.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the above process is also applicable to the production of CATEZOMES (tm)  liposomes using other A-ADDA's, including, S-SDDP and P-PDDP.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      The integrity of the liposomes formed in accordance with Example 1 was affirmed using differential scanning calorimetry.
      <br/>
      The presence of a transition temperature characteristic of molecules in a liquid crystal arrangement, such as the alkyl chains of the liposome membranes, is shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Further demonstration of the formation of liposomes by B-BDDP is shown in a representative electron micrograph of FIG. 7.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      The testing utilized to determine the payload efficiency of the CATEZOMES (tm)  liposomes formed according to Example 1 is described in Example 2.
      <br/>
      In Example 2, Glucose was chosen as a model substance to examine the encapsulation capabilities of the subject liposomes because it is a low-molecular weight (180 g/mole), water-soluble, non-charged molecule.
      <br/>
      These characteristics make for the most difficulty in encapsulation for the following reasons.
      <br/>
      The low molecular weight means that even small, transient imperfections in the lipid membrane would permit leakage of the glucose from the vesicular space to the extra-vesicular space and thus the glucose will rapidly leave any but the most perfect liposomes.
      <br/>
      The fact that glucose is entirely water-soluble, lipid-insoluble means that there is no chance of the glucose partitioning into the lipid phase and therefore no "false encapsulation" will be apparent.
      <br/>
      Since the ADDAs have a positive charge due to the amine group, a negatively charged molecule would tend to be attracted to the membranes.
      <br/>
      Again this would be apparent as false encapsulation.
      <br/>
      Thus, although glucose is very difficult to encapsulate in liposomes, it constitutes the perfect test material to prove the existence of stable, flawless, enclosed vesicles.
    </p>
    <p num="97">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="98">
      Glucose was added to a Catemol 22OB/buffer dispersion at a concentration of 10% w/w and then the CATEZOMES (tm)  liposomes were formed as described above in Example 1.
      <br/>
      Non-encapsulated, i.e., extra-vesicular, glucose was then removed by placing the liposomes into a dialysis bag (molecular weight cut-off 5,000 daltons), placing the dialysis bag into a beaker of PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and then replacing the PBS with freshly made PBS every two hours for a twenty-four hour period.
      <br/>
      The concentration of glucose in the extravesicular volume (unencapsulated glucose) was measured by assaying the glucose in a liposome suspension in the presence or absence of 10% (v/v) Octoxynol-9 detergent manufactured by Union Carbide Corporation, of Danbury Connecticut.
      <br/>
      Octoxynol-9 is a non-ionic detergent which disrupts the liposomes and permits the equilibration of glucose between intra- and extra-vesicular spaces.
      <br/>
      An assay kit, purchased from Sigma Chemical Company of St.
      <br/>
      Louis, Mo. (product number 115), was used according to the manufacturer's instructions.
      <br/>
      This assay is based on the, enzymatic conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate with the concomitant reduction of nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) which can be detected spectrophotometrically.
      <br/>
      The absorption (520  MU m) of the test sample is then extrapolated by comparison to a linear progression of standard (known) concentrations of glucose.
      <br/>
      Statistical analysis results of the slopes of these standard curves in the absence or presence of octoxynol-9 is presented in Table 1.

      As mentioned above, the molecular shape of the A-ADDAS, which precipitates bilayer and liposome formation, is in part dependent on the salt bridge comprising the molecule.
      <br/>
      Concomitantly, the stability of the liposomes is dependent upon changing pH and/or ionic strength, which acutely affects the salt bridge.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 shows the latency over time of B-BDDP liposomes prepared in buffers of various pH but identical ionic strength.
      <br/>
      The B-BDDP liposomes containing glucose were prepared as described above (Example 1.) Samples of these liposomes were then placed into phosphate buffers of various pH as shown, but with constant ionic strength.
      <br/>
      The latency (Equation 2) of the liposomes was then measured, as described in the text, at various times following the onset of the experiment.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      The measurement results clearly establish that the CATEZOMES (tm)  liposomes are very stable at pH around neutrality, but become permeable to low molecular weight molecules such as glucose when the pH falls below 3 or increases above 10.
      <br/>
      This is entirely consistent with the notion that the salt bridge stabilizing the molecules is disruptable by pH.
      <br/>
      FIG. 9 shows the effect of increasing the ionic strength of the medium surrounding the CATEZOMES (tm)  liposomes to 1.4 M NaCl. Clearly, the increased ionic strength disrupts the molecular structure of the B-BDDP and causes the liposomes to become permeable.
