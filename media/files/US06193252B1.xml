      A trailing rod assembly is provided to couple front ends of two lower beams of a baby carrier to a bicycle chain stay.
      <br/>
      The trailing rod assembly includes a substantially S-shape rod, a front coupler mounted to a front end of the rod, a rear coupler mounted to a rear end of the rod, a wheel seat mounted to a mediate portion of the rod, and a beam-fixing seat mounted between the wheel seat and the rear coupler.
      <br/>
      The front coupler includes a main plate, a movable plate, a fixing knob, and a flexible tube, wherein the chain stay is securely held between the main plate and the movable plate.
      <br/>
      The wheel seat includes an L-shape slot for retaining an axle of a front wheel of the baby carrier.
      <br/>
      The rear coupler includes a lower plate, an upper plate, and two fixing knobs, wherein the rear end of the rod is soldered to a surface of a mediate groove of the lower plate.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a trailing rod assembly for coupling a baby carrier, e.g., a stroller, to a bicycle.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Bicycles are often used for both sporting and recreation.
      <br/>
      A baby carrier may be trailed to the bicycle by a trailing rod assembly such that the baby may have fun together with parents.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, the existing trailing rod assembly merely provides a point connection between the baby carrier and the bicycle and thus provides poor safety.
      <br/>
      In addition, the front wheel of the baby carrier that is removed for trailing purpose cannot be carried along with the baby carrier trailed by the bicycle.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is impossible to push the baby carrier when the bicycle reaches the destination.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a trailing rod assembly for coupling front ends of two lower beams of a baby carrier to a bicycle chain stay, thereby providing a reliable connection.
      <br/>
      The trailing rod assembly includes a front coupler for securely connecting a front end of a rod of the trailing rod assembly to the bicycle chain stay.
      <br/>
      The trailing rod assembly further includes a rear coupler for securely connecting the front ends of the two lower beams of the baby carrier to a rear end of the rod.
      <br/>
      Thus, double positioning effect is obtained to ensure safety.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It is a secondary object of the present invention to provide a trailing rod assembly that includes a wheel seat for retaining the front wheel of the baby carrier in place.
      <br/>
      The front wheel of the baby carrier is thus carried along with the baby carrier trailed by the bicycle for convenient use.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Other objects, advantages, and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="8">
      Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a trailing rod assembly in accordance with the present invention is used to couple front ends of two lower beams 31 of a baby carrier 3, e.g., a stroller, to a bicycle chain stay 2.
      <br/>
      The trailing rod assembly includes a substantially S-shape rod 1, a front coupler 4 mounted to a front end of the rod 1, a rear coupler 6 mounted to a rear end of the rod 1, a wheel seat 5 mounted to a mediate portion of the rod 1, and a beam-fixing seat 7 mounted between the wheel seat 5 and the rear coupler 6.

    <p num="15">Referring to FIG. 1, the beam-fixing seat 7 is provided to receive front ends of the lower beams 31 of the baby carrier 3 and has a pin 71 extended therethrough, thereby reliably fixing the front ends of the lower beams 31 of the baby carrier in place.</p>
    <p num="16">
      In assembly, referring to FIGS. 1, 6, and 7, the front ends of the lower beams 31 of the baby carrier 3 are extended through two outer arcuate grooves 611 of the lower plate 61 of the rear coupler.
      <br/>
      Lower ends of the elastic members 613 are mounted into the receptacles 612 of the lower plate 61.
      <br/>
      The upper plate 62 is assembled to the lower plate 61 with upper ends of the elastic members 613 received in the receptacles 622 of the upper plate 62 and with the arcuate grooves 621 accommodating the rear end of the rod 1 and the front ends of the lower beams 31, respectively.
      <br/>
      The fixing knobs 63 are mounted to securely connect the upper and lower plates 62 and 61 together and to securely hold the rear end of the rod 1 and the front ends of the lower beams 31 of the baby carrier 3, as mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Front ends of the lower beams 31 of the baby carrier are respectively mounted to two sides of the beam-fixing seat 7 and the pin 71 is extended through the front ends of the lower beams 31 and the beam-fixing seat 7.
      <br/>
      Thus, the front ends of the lower beams 31 are reliably positioned by the pin 71 and by the upper and lower plates 62 and 61.
      <br/>
      Next, the axle 321 of the front wheel 32 of the baby carrier 3 is inserted into the L-shape slot 53 of the wheel seat 5 (FIG. 5) and thus retained in place.
      <br/>
      Thus, the front wheel 32 can be carried along with the baby carrier 3.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Thereafter, the arcuate groove 411 of the main plate 41 of the front coupler 4 is attached to a side of the chain stay 2 and the movable plate 42 is engaged to the other side of the chain stay 2.
      <br/>
      The front end of the rod 1 is retained in the hollow cylinder 412 and positioned by pin 442.
      <br/>
      The fixing knob 43 is extended through the through-hole 425 of the movable plate 42 and the screw 432 of the fixing knob 43 is threadedly engaged with the nut 416.
      <br/>
      Upon manually tightening the fixing knob 43, the chain stay 2 is reliably held in place.
      <br/>
      Thus, reliable coupling between the chain stay 2 and the front end of the rod 1 is provided by the front coupler 4.
