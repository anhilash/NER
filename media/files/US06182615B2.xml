      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates generally to the production of hydroelectric power, and more particularly to a combustion-driven hydroelectric generating system wherein a combustible fuel mixture is introduced and ignited in one or more combustion cylinders containing a liquid and the force of the combustion acts on the surface of the liquid to transfer a slug of the liquid to a gas pressurized vessel and the pressurized liquid from the vessel is used to operate a hydroelectric generator and perform other useful work.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Brief Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Electrical generation companies normally operate on a power grid system, wherein numerous individual power plants of the fossil fuel type, nuclear type, or the like are joined together over common transmitting lines.
      <br/>
      The electricity is usually generated using rotating generating equipment.
      <br/>
      Most electrical power generating facilities in the United States, at the present time, utilize a gas turbine generator as a prime power source for generating electricity that operates on a combustible fuel, usually natural gas, but some employ gas obtained by coal gassification or liquid fuel in vapor form.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Another frequently employed means for generating electricity is a hydraulic turbine generator utilizing the energy of the head of an elevated supply of water.
      <br/>
      Commonly, the electrical generation and distribution industry also utilizes pump-back facilities which store energy in the form of water head, utilizing energy during the periods when it is most readily and economically available and when surplus generating capacity exists, and recovering the energy to meet peak load demands.
      <br/>
      Typically, these pumpback facilities use electrical power to drive a generator which, when energized, functions as an electric motor, to power the turbines which, when driven, function as a pump, to move water from a lower elevation through a penstock to an upper elevation, usually an elevated lake.
      <br/>
      When the flow of water is reversed, the turbine drives the generator to recover the energy.
      <br/>
      A substantial amount of energy is required to move the water to the upper location and thus the recovered energy is always less than the amount of energy required to move the water to the upper elevation.
    </p>
    <p num="6">The present invention produces and stores energy in the form of pressurized water that is used as a head of water to operate a hydroelectric power generating apparatus without having to move the water to an upper location and is not dependent upon being located near a lake or reservoir.</p>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention is distinguished over the prior art by a combustion-driven hydroelectric generating system that utilizes one or more combustion cylinders that contain a liquid (such as water) and receive a combustible fuel/oxidizer mixture that is ignited and the explosive force of the combustion acts on the surface of the liquid to transfer a metered slug of the liquid to a pressurized vessel containing a pressurized gas (preferably an inert gas).
      <br/>
      The pressurized liquid from the pressurized vessel serves as a "head of water" that can be used to operate a water wheel (Pelton wheel) or hydroelectric generator and perform other useful work.
      <br/>
      The transferred liquid is replaced in the combustion cylinder, another charge of the fuel/oxidizer is introduced and ignited and the process is repeated.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="20">
      In a basic form, the combustion-driven hydroelectric generating system comprises one or more combustion cylinders that contain a liquid (such as water) and receive a combustible fuel/oxidizer mixture that is ignited and the explosive force of the combustion acts on the surface of the liquid to transfer a metered slug of the liquid to a pressurized vessel containing a pressurized gas (preferably an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon).
      <br/>
      The products of combustion in the combustion cylinders are vented to the atmosphere either directly or via thermal and/or pressure scavengers.
      <br/>
      The pressurized liquid from the pressurized vessel serves as a "head of water" that can be used to operate a water wheel (Pelton wheel) or hydroelectric generator and perform other useful work.
      <br/>
      The transferred liquid is replaced in the combustion cylinder, another charge of the fuel/oxidizer is introduced and ignited and the process is repeated.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Referring to the drawings by numerals of reference, there is shown schematically in FIG. 1, a preferred combustion-driven hydroelectric generating system 10.
      <br/>
      A pressure vessel 11 is connected to one or more combustion cylinders 12 by a liquid supply line 13 that conducts a high-pressure liquid from the combustion cylinder 12 to the vessel 11 though a series connected check valve 14 and shut-off valve 15.
      <br/>
      There may be any number of combustion cylinders 12 feeding the vessel 11, such as via a plenum or manifold so that one may be filling while another is firing.
      <br/>
      For safety, a maximum temperature may be assigned to each combustion cylinder 12.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Each combustion cylinder 12 has an upper section 16 that holds a combustible charge of a fuel/oxidizer mixture and is equipped with a firing apparatus 17, such as a spark plug, glow plug, or other suitable igniter.
      <br/>
      A battery and contacter or other suitable source (not shown) may accomplish ignition of the firing apparatus 17.
      <br/>
      An intermediate section 18 of the combustion cylinder 12 holds a volume of liquid that is to be passed to the vessel 11 under pressure exceeding the pressure in the vessel during combustion.
      <br/>
      The lower section 19 holds the liquid that is remaining after the shot or combustion.
      <br/>
      Replacement liquid is introduced into the lower end of the combustion cylinder 12 via line 20 and check valve 21, as described hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A suitable fuel, such as a combustible gas (preferably natural gas), and a suitable oxidizer, such as air may be introduced separately into the combustion cylinder 12 via fuel line 22 and check valve 23, and oxidizer line 24 and check valve 25, respectively, and mixed inside the cylinder.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the fuel and oxidizer may be mixed outside the cylinder and introduced as a mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      A liquid level sensor 26 senses the liquid level in the upper section 16 and, at a different cycle time, the liquid level in lower section 19, or there may be separate sensors for each level.
      <br/>
      By use of a computer or microcontroller, these level signals maintain the maximum slug of high-pressure liquid and prevent transferring products of combustion to the upper section of the pressurized vessel 11.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The products of combustion, after firing, are released from the combustion cylinder 12 through exhaust line 27 and exhaust valve 28.
      <br/>
      Additional apparatus such as thermal and/or pressure scavengers may be connected with the exhaust line 27 to recover excess heat and pressure.
      <br/>
      Since some fuel, air or products of combustion may dissolve in the high pressure liquid slug and become transferred to the vessel 11, a processing loop may be used to remove those gases.
      <br/>
      A suitable membrane may also be disposed in the combustion cylinder 12 at the interface between the fuel/oxidizer mixture and the liquid to prevent products of combustion from becoming mixed with the liquid.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The pressurized vessel 11 contains a volume of the liquid in a lower section 29, and a compressed gas, preferably an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon, is contained in an upper section 30 above the liquid.
      <br/>
      If the liquid is devoid of products of combustion, compressed air may be used.
      <br/>
      The interface between the gas and liquid is sensed by a liquid level transducer 31, and is maintained between maximum and minimum levels by computer control (not shown).
      <br/>
      The pressure in the vessel 11 is sensed by a pressure transducer 32, which is used to maintain a constant pressure in the vessel, for example 150 PSI.
      <br/>
      The inert gas is introduced into the vessel 11 through a manifold 33 equipped with a manual gas filling valve 34, a pressure gauge 35, and a safety relief valve 36.
      <br/>
      The liquid level transducer 31 may also be connected with the manifold 33.
      <br/>
      A suitable membrane may be disposed in the pressurized vessel 11 at the interface between the gas and the liquid to prevent gases from becoming mixed with the liquid.
    </p>
    <p num="27">The liquid from the pressurized vessel 11 is conducted via a working line 37 equipped with a shut-off valve 38 and a throttle valve 39 which conducts the high-pressure liquid to a hydroelectric water wheel 40 (Pelton wheel) and generator 41.</p>
    <p num="28">
      Replacement liquid after passing over the water wheel 40 is collected in a catchment trough 42 and conducted via replacement liquid line 20 through a filter 43 and is pumped by pump 44 into the lower section of the combustion cylinder 12 through check valve 21.
      <br/>
      Optionally, flow and pressure transducers (not shown) may monitor the replacement liquid.
      <br/>
      A liquid make-up apparatus may be used at the catchment trough 42 to off-set the normal loss of liquid to the atmosphere if the system is operated as a closed liquid cycle but not a closed air cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In a preferred embodiment, a computer or microcontroller (not shown) is used to control the timing of firing cycles, the volume of, and pressure applied to, each liquid slug, the fuel mixture/liquid interface levels in the combustion cylinders 12 and the pressurized gas/liquid interface levels in the pressurized vessel 11 such that the electric generator or other end use of the liquid's energy is maintained at predetermined speed and power levels.
      <br/>
      This function is also facilitated by the throttle valve 39.
      <br/>
      The computer or microcontroller also meters the appropriate combustion mixture and make-up (replacement) liquid.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The firing cycle of the combustion cylinder 12 is as follows.
      <br/>
      The combustion cylinder 12 is loaded with a metered liquid charge, as described above, at one atmosphere.
      <br/>
      A metered amount of the combustible fuel/oxidizer mixture at the appropriate pressures is introduced into the upper section 16 of the combustion cylinder 12.
      <br/>
      The igniter 17 is fired, and the pressure in the combustion cylinder 12 rises rapidly to a peak, as does the temperature.
      <br/>
      Then both drop less rapidly to the pressure and equilibrium temperature of the pressurized vessel 11.
      <br/>
      Finally, the remaining combustion cylinder pressure drops below the pressure of the pressurized vessel 11 due to further cooling of the remaining products of combustion.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The explosive force in the combustion cylinder 12 during combustion acts on the surface of the liquid to transfer a metered slug of the liquid to the pressurized vessel 11 containing the pressurized gas.
      <br/>
      The products of combustion in the combustion cylinder 12 are vented to the atmosphere.
      <br/>
      The pressurized liquid from the pressurized vessel 11 is used as a "head of water" that can operate a water wheel (Pelton wheel) and/or hydroelectric generator to perform useful work.
      <br/>
      The transferred liquid is replaced in the combustion cylinder 12, another charge of the fuel/oxidizer mixture is introduced and ignited and the process is repeated.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 2 shows a free or coupled piston cylinder 45 that can be used to perform a number of optional services when there are multiple combustion cylinders 12.
      <br/>
      For example, left and right chambers A and B divided by a moving piston 46, in turn, can be filled through computer controlled valves 47 and 48 with the metered liquid slug at a slow pace between firings, then pushed rapidly into the appropriate combustion cylinder to decrease the cycle time.
      <br/>
      Motive force for the operation of the piston 46 may be supplied directly from a take-off shaft connected with the water wheel 40 or by utilizing the exhaust pressure of a prior cycle.
      <br/>
