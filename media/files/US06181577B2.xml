    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
    <p num="1">This application is related to U.S. Pat. No. 6,061,260 entitled "A Board Mounted Power Supply Having an Auxiliary Output," to Chen, et al, filed on Aug. 19, 1998, which is commonly assigned with the present invention and incorporated herein by reference as if reproduced herein in its entirety.</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention is directed, in general, to power supplies and, more specifically, to an auxiliary bias circuit for a power supply and a method of operation thereof.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The electronics industry continues to develop smaller and more powerful equipment that performs many functions which, in turn, require more power.
      <br/>
      In many cases, auxiliary devices that perform one or more additional functions are associated with such equipment.
      <br/>
      The auxiliary devices also draw power to perform their intended functions and may require a different voltage than the equipment with which they are associated.
      <br/>
      Consequently, to provide the power to the main and auxiliary components (sometimes with two or more voltage ranges), two separate power supplies are often employed.
      <br/>
      More specifically, a main power supply powers the main components and an auxiliary power supply powers the auxiliary components.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      While the auxiliary power supply provides a viable solution to power auxiliary devices associated with electronic equipment, there are several drawbacks to such an approach.
      <br/>
      An additional power supply adds complexity to the electronic equipment in connection with, for instance, the added wiring and circuitry.
      <br/>
      Of course, any time an additional component is added to electronic equipment, provision must be made to accommodate the larger volume of space associated with the additional component and the increased component cost.
      <br/>
      In addition, the excess heat generated by the additional power supply can reduce the overall efficiency and reliability of the electronic equipment.
      <br/>
      In short, adding an auxiliary power supply to electronic equipment generally runs afoul of the industry goal of producing smaller and more efficient electronic systems.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The telecommunications industry is but one environment whereby the power requirements for electronic equipment, such as voice processors and switching equipment, are becoming more demanding.
      <br/>
      The electronic system frequently consists of several circuit boards housed in a common cabinet.
      <br/>
      A single board mounted power module (BMPM) often is employed to power all of the equipment in the cabinet.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      As a general rule, a smaller BMPM is desirable to use less cabinet space and to allow for a more compact and smaller power supply.
      <br/>
      Although a smaller BMPM is desirable, more powerful BMPMs are also necessary to supply power to a large number of components.
      <br/>
      BMPM performance is generally evaluated according to its power density, which is the ratio of the total power output to the total volume of the BMPM.
      <br/>
      The highest power density (i.e., the smallest volume with the largest possible power output) attainable is the goal.
      <br/>
      As a practical matter, however, the power density is limited because, as the power output increases additional heat is generated thereby detracting from the efficiency of the power supply.
      <br/>
      The excess heat also reduces the reliability of the power supply caused by premature component failures.
      <br/>
      For instance, for every 10 (degree)  C. increase in operating temperature for the power supply, the mean time between failures generally decreases by a factor of two.
      <br/>
      With the use of more powerful BMPMs, a concurrent need exists to remove the additional heat generated therefrom.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Presently, finned heat sinks are used with the power supplies to dissipate the heat generated by the BMPMs.
      <br/>
      Conventional finned heat sinks with external air flow, however, cannot remove enough heat to allow a significant increase in the power density of the BMPMs.
      <br/>
      To achieve additional heat dissipation, a larger heat sink may be employed, but the larger heat sink effectively lowers the power density of the BMPMs.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In many computer applications, a heat sink and fan assembly are employed to significantly increase heat dissipation capability associated with the power supply.
      <br/>
      Other active cooling or heat dissipation methods are also available, but provisions must be made to accommodate the additional power to operate the active cooling equipment.
      <br/>
      The active cooling or heat dissipation equipment is particularly attractive in the telecommunications industry, if the costs and complexity associated with such designs can be managed.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Accordingly, what are needed in the art is a system and method of providing power to auxiliary components, such as active cooling devices, without appreciably adding to the overall complexity of the electronic equipment.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      To address the above-discussed deficiencies of the prior art, the present invention provides for use in a power supply having a bias circuit with a bias transformer, an auxiliary bias circuit and a method of providing power via the auxiliary bias circuit to an auxiliary load.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the auxiliary bias circuit includes a blocking device coupled to the bias transformer.
      <br/>
      The auxiliary bias circuit also includes a storage device, coupled to the blocking device and across the bias transformer, that provides a voltage to drive the auxiliary load without requiring a separate power supply.
      <br/>
      The present invention, in one aspect, introduces the concept of modifying and boosting the bias circuitry of a power supply (e.g., a board mounted power module) to provide an additional bias circuit to power an auxiliary load.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the bias circuit further includes a switch.
      <br/>
      The switch is adapted to provide a self-pulsed gate-drive signal to the bias transformer.
      <br/>
      While the switch enhances the operation of the bias circuit, it is not necessary to practice the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the blocking device is a diode.
      <br/>
      In a related, but alternative embodiment, the storage device is a capacitor.
      <br/>
      Of course, other blocking or storage devices are well within the broad scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the auxiliary load includes an active cooling device for a heat sink assembly.
      <br/>
      In related, but alternative embodiments, the active cooling device includes a fan or a liquid cooling pump.
      <br/>
      The auxiliary bias circuit can, therefore, be advantageously used to power any one of a number of cooling or other devices associated with a power supply.
    </p>
    <p num="14">

      The power supply includes (1) a main switch coupled to the input, (2) a transformer coupled to the main switch, (3) a rectifier coupled to the transformer, and (4) a bias circuit.

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="16">
      For a more complete understanding of the present invention, reference is now made to the following descriptions taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 illustrates a schematic diagram of a bias circuit including an auxiliary bias circuit constructed according to the principles of the present invention;
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 illustrates a schematic diagram of a power supply constructed according to the principles of the present invention; and

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      Referring initially to FIG. 1, illustrated is a schematic diagram of a bias circuit 100 including an auxiliary bias circuit constructed according to the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The bias circuit 100 is coupled to an input voltage Vin and includes a bias transformer 110.
      <br/>
      A primary winding of the bias transformer 110 is coupled to a switch 120 that is driven by a self-pulsed gate-drive signal to a gate 121 of the switch 120.
      <br/>
      A secondary winding of the bias transformer 110 is preferably enhanced to augment the power delivery capability therefrom.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The bias circuit 100 also includes a first blocking device (e.g., a diode) 130 and first storage device (e.g., a capacitor) 135 coupled to the secondary winding of the bias transformer 110.
      <br/>
      The first blocking device 130 blocks the first storage device 135 from discharging back through the secondary winding of the bias transformer 110 thereby assuring that a bias voltage Vbias is delivered to a bias output 136.
      <br/>
      The bias output 136 furnishes power to operate, for instance, internal control, sense, feedback and other housekeeping circuitry.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The bias circuit 100 further includes the auxiliary bias circuit, coupled to the bias transformer 110, to power an auxiliary load.
      <br/>
      The auxiliary bias circuit includes a second blocking device (e.g., a diode) 140, coupled to the bias transformer 110, and a second storage device (e.g., a capacitor) 145, coupled to the second blocking device 140 and across the bias transformer 110.
      <br/>
      Of course, other blocking devices, such as a field-effect transistor, and storage devices, such as a battery, are well within the broad scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      An auxiliary bias output 146 of the auxiliary bias circuit is used to power an auxiliary load (e.g., an active cooling device) without requiring a separate power supply.
      <br/>
      Analogous to the first blocking device 130, the second blocking device 140 in the auxiliary bias circuit blocks the second storage device 145 from discharging back through the secondary winding of the transformer 110.
      <br/>
      The second blocking device 140 also isolates noise emanating from the circuitry powered by the bias voltage Vbias.
      <br/>
      The auxiliary bias circuit, as described herein, is provided by circuitry integral to the power supply (e.g., a board mounted power module) and can be used to power an auxiliary device without requiring an additional power supply.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Turning now to FIG. 2, illustrated is a schematic diagram of a power supply (e.g., board mounted power module) 200 constructed according to the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The power supply 200 includes a power train with an input 205 couplable to a source of power (e.g., DC source) and an output (e.g., DC output) 250 couplable to an electrical load.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A main switch 225, coupled to the input 205, controls the electrical input to a power transformer 220.
      <br/>
      A rectifier 230, coupled to the secondary side of the power transformer 220, provides a DC voltage at the output 250.
      <br/>
      The power supply 200 also includes a bias circuit 210 having an auxiliary bias circuit analogous to the bias circuit 100 illustrated and described with respect to FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      A bias output 215 of the bias circuit 210 provides bias voltage to the main control circuit 216 (including, for instance, a pulse-width modulator, internal feedback circuitry and protection circuitry) for the power supply 200.
      <br/>
      An auxiliary bias output 40 provides an auxiliary voltage to drive an auxiliary load without requiring a separate power supply.
      <br/>
      In order to provide an electrical connection for an auxiliary device powered by the auxiliary bias circuit, the power supply 200 may have pins or receptacles thereon to provide electrical connectivity to the auxiliary device.
      <br/>
      A person having ordinary skill in the art is familiar with the components and operation of power supplies and, as such, a detailed description thereof will not hereinafter be submitted.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the auxiliary bias circuit provides voltage to drive an active cooling device for a heat sink assembly.
      <br/>
      Such an assembly can be top-mounted on the power supply (such as a board mounted power module) 200 to cool the power supply 200.
      <br/>
      An active cooling device is illustrated and described in Chen, et al.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Turning now to FIG. 3, illustrated is an isometric view of a board mounted power module 310 with active cooling device 320 constructed according to the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      An assembly 300 includes the board mounted power module 310 with a top-mounted active cooling device 320.
      <br/>
      The illustrated top-mounted active cooling device 320 includes a heat sink 325 with two active devices, namely, a fan 330 and circulating system for a liquid coolant.
      <br/>
      The liquid cooling system has a pump 345 that circulates liquid through pipes that run through a cold plate 340 mounted between the power module 310 and the heat sink 325.
      <br/>
      As the liquid circulates through the cold plate 340, it picks up heat from the power module 310 and then dissipates the heat into ambient air as it circulates through pipes 341 that run over the top of the heat sink 325 like a radiator.
      <br/>
      The active cooling device 320 also includes cooling fins 326 that transfer heat from the power module 310 to the ambient air.
      <br/>
      Of course, other active cooling devices such as a thermoelectric device and a fan, a stand alone liquid circulating pump with a nozzle, and an electrochemical pump with a heat sink are well within the broad scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The illustrated fan 330 and liquid cooling system significantly improve the transfer of heat from the power module 310 thereby allowing the power module 310 to carry a significantly heavier electrical load (e.g., a 30% increase in capacity in some applications).
      <br/>
      In conjunction therewith, the active cooling device 320 significantly decreases the power module temperature (e.g., 20 (degree)  C.) for a given output level for the power module 310.
      <br/>
      By employing the principles of the present invention, the power density, efficiency and reliability of the power module 310 can be enhanced without increasing the complexity of the circuit.
      <br/>
      The present invention permits auxiliary loads such as active heat transfer devices to operate from power supplied by an auxiliary bias circuit contained within the power module 310 without requiring an additional power source to furnish power to such devices.
