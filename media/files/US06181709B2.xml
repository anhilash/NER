      A process and device in which (a) data transmission is done so that coded data specific to ISDN is converted into binary code on both a network side and a receiver side using a code converter, (b) the entering data of B channels being prepared in segments of equal length for B1 and B2 channel data in a memory unit and subsequently fed to a transmission device and sent to the receiver side.
      <br/>

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The invention relates to a method and apparatus for the enlargement of the range of the transmission channel between functional groups of the ISDN-user interface with reference to an ISDN interface as it is standardized, for example, according to CCITT I.400--ISDN User Network Interface and I.430--Basic User Network Interface.
      <br/>
      This invention enables the varied ISDN services to be transmitted over long distances with a minimized bandwidth.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), which allows, in addition to speech transmission, the rapid transmission of data, texts, and pictures also enables NT and TE apparatus as well as other distribution nets to be connected at its interfaces.
      <br/>
      Irrespective of a net-side interconnection of ISDN terminal equipment (TE) or network terminations (NT), the enlargement of the range of the transmission channel between functional groups of the ISDN-user interface with reference to an ISDN interface is of advantage for the transmission of the information of the net over a longer distance.
      <br/>
      However, the range achievable with traditional means is significantly limited due to the electrical features of the ISDN interfaces and connection ways.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      From DE 44 07 214 C1, a technical solution is known which in spite of the restrictions of the physical state existing at the interface of an ISDN-user interface, allows to enlarge the range of the transmission channel between functional groups of the ISDN-user interface.
      <br/>
      In this solution, the ISDN-specific coded data incoming or, respectively, being required at the ISDN interfaces are converted into binary-coded data on the net (or network; as used herein, net refers to network) side as well as on the terminal side.
      <br/>
      The binary-coded data are grouped into blocks and directed to a transmission means to be corresponded on the net- or terminal-side, respectively.
      <br/>
      Due to the standardized structure of, for example, an ISDN basic terminal with 2 * 64 kbit/s of the B-channels or 1 * 16 kbit/s of the D-channel and the necessary signaling and control information the transmission means transmits, according to DE 44 07 214 C1, information with a bandwidth of 160 kbit/s, which is a considerable and expensive bandwidth of the data transmission via, for example, a satellite channel.
      <br/>
      Data transmission, particularly via satellite channels, considerably demands reduced bandwidths or, respectively, exactly defined bandwidths of, for example, 64 or 128 kbit/s.
      <br/>
      A number of satellite services run terminals with 64 kbit/s channels.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Therefore, it is the object of the invention to create a method and apparatus which allow the range of the transmission channel between functional groups of the ISDN-user interface in relation to an ISDN interface to be extended under the condition of a minimized bandwidth.
      <br/>
      This is achieved maintaining all ISDN-specific features, such as
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      maintenance of the network timing
      <br/>
      multiple access to the interface bus
      <br/>
      activation and deactivation of the interface.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">According to the invention, the problem of the enlargement of the range of the transmission channel between functional groups of the ISDN-user interface in relation to an ISDN interface with a minimized bandwidth is solved by a method in which</p>
    <p num="7">a) the data transmission on the net side is performed in such a way that the ISDN-specific coded data incoming at an ISDN interface are converted by means of a code converter into binary-coded data separatedly for B- and D-channel information,</p>
    <p num="8">b) the data of the B-channels are separated for B1- and B2-channel data, sections of equal length for the B1- and the B2-channel data are provided in a buffer device, and are then fed with a bit timing derived from the ISDN network timing with the B1- and B2-channel data alternating, to the receiver side in which process the data coming from the buffer device are checked for data identity and are compressed,</p>
    <p num="9">c) blocks are formed from the incoming data of the D-channel and are fed to the transmission means to transmit them to the receiver side instead of the B-channel data preferably with the bit timing derived from the ISDN network timing,</p>
    <p num="10">d) the ISDN-specific timings required for the communication of the transmitter and receiver are regained on the terminal side be means of a timing recovery device from the time sequence of the transmitted data bits,</p>
    <p num="11">e) the received data are analysed, identified D-channel blocks are resolved and directly fed to a code converter, and identified B-channel data are decompressed and buffered separatedly for B1- and B2-channel data and are fed to the code converter in accordance with the regained timing, and the binary-coded data are converted into ISDN-specific data,</p>
    <p num="12">f) on the terminal side, the data transmission is performed similarly to the process steps a) to c) with a timing of the process steps b) and c) equal to the timing regained in process step d), and</p>
    <p num="13">g) on the network side, the received data are analysed, identified D-channel blocks are resolved and directly fed to a code converter, and identified B-channel data are decompressed and buffered separatedly for B1- and B2-channel data and are fed to the code converter in accordance with the ISDN network timing, and the binary-coded data are converted into ISDN-specific data.</p>
    <p num="14">The compression or decompression, respectively, of the B-channel data according to the process step b) is preferably performed such that during compression, identical characters are provided with a repetition counter and a flag, and during decompression character sequences marked that way are resolved.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Advantageously, in those periods of time in which no B1- and/or B2-channel is used for the transmission, no B-channel data are fed to the transmission means.
      <br/>
      If, for example, only one B-channel is active, only the B-channel data of the active B-channel are processed.
      <br/>
      Hence, the data rate required in the transmission means is reduced to the data rate of the active B-channel.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The natural variations of the required data rate for the transmission of the B- and D-channel information and the compression information are leveled out during data transmission by intermediately buffering the transmitted binary-coded data in a FIFO-structured buffer device of suitable depth on the terminal- or network side.
      <br/>
      By the process according to this invention, the bandwidth required for the data transmission can advantageously be reduced to the net data rate of the B-channels to be transmitted.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      To carry out the compression the character repetitions occurring in the B1-channel and B2-channel data stream are utilized.
      <br/>
      If such character repetitions are identified, an accordingly labeled compression block is formed for the appropriate channel, which block contains an information about the number of the identical data within the output stream.
      <br/>
      A compression block is formed also in case the data stream would not be reduced by the compression.
      <br/>
      This block ensures the byte boundary synchronization of the B-channel data stream.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, on process step b) B-channel sections of fixed length are formed and transmitted with a minimum length of the D-channel blocks and B-channel compression blocks is one quarter of the B-channel sections and the D-channel blocks can have a multiple of the minimum length.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      If D-channel blocks and B-channel compression blocks are formed, the transmission of the B-channel sections is interrupted, and instead of the B-channel sections these blocks are fed to the transmission means to be transmitted to the receiver side with the transmission of the D-channel blocks being preferred.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, the transmission of the B-channel sections is interrupted at a place divisible by 4.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The formed B-channel sections are transmitted to the receiver side having a timing derived from the ISDN network timing, by means of known transmission means via satellite or other transmission channels.
      <br/>
      This bit timing is regained on the terminal side from the bit transmission timing by means of a PLL circuit (phase locked loop) to be available for the ISDN interface.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      On the receiver side, the received data are analysed, identified D-channel blocks are resolved, and the D-channel data are directly fed to the code converter.
      <br/>
      For the identified B-channel data the B-channel compression blocks are resolved, stored in the buffer device separatedly for B1- and B2-channel data, and fed to the code converter according to the timing regained, and the binary-coded data are converted into ISDN-specific coded data.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Both the terminal-side and net-side conversion of the ISDN-specific coded data into binary-coded data is performed by known methods with the help of a code converter, preferably an ISDN subscriber access controller.</p>
    <p num="22">If the transmission means uses several channels to carry out the transmission, segmenting and allocation may be done on the net and terminal sides according to the B-channels to be transmitted.</p>
    <p num="23">
      Advantageously, the process according to the invention may also be conducted such that in periods of time with the ISDN interface not being active, the transmission of serial digital data is carried out without code conversion.
      <br/>
      This is particularly possible if several channels are provided by the transmission means.
      <br/>
      Then the connections to, at least, one transmission channel are used as the interface for the exchange of the serial digital data, and the other transmission channels to transmit these data.
    </p>
    <p num="24">According to this invention, the process of the enlargement of the range of the transmission channel between functional groups of the ISDN-user interface is realized through an arrangement which comprises a facility for protocol conversion and a transmission channel on both the terminal and net sides.</p>
    <p num="25">
      The transmission channel comprises transmission equipment actually known and the means used for the transmission, for example a satellite channel with the appropriate transmission and receiving equipment and the modems required.
      <br/>
      The transmission channel may advantageously include several single channels.
      <br/>
      If the transmission channel includes several channels, the connections to, at least, one transmission channel can advantageously be used as the interface for the exchange of the serial digital data.
      <br/>
      Thus, the transmission of serial digital data is made possible through the other transmission channels in those periods of time in which the ISDN interface is not active.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The facilities for protocol conversion communicate with one another through the transmission channel.
      <br/>
      The facilities for protocol conversion are preferably structured identical, and can function in the master mode as well as in the slave mode with the protocol conversion facility connected net-side functioning in master mode and the protocol conversion facility connected terminal-side functioning in slave mode, and vice versa.

      The ISDN interface module (1) is composed of an ISDN interface and a circuit for the conversion of the ISDN-specific coded data into binary-coded data, for example an ISDN subscriber access controller (ISAC circuit).

      <br/>
      When the ISDN interface is active, the timing signal of 512 kHz is derived synchronously from the bit timing of the ISDN interface.

      The 512 kHz timing signal of the ISAC circuit of the ISDN interface is used in the timing generation module (3) controlled by the processor in the micro computer (6) to generate corresponding to an additional switch position in the mode switch (5) the transmission timing for the interface modules (2).

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="62">FIG. 1 shows, in block diagram representation, an apparatus for protocol conversion.</p>
    <p num="63">
      The micro computer (6) comprises a microprocessor realized as Am 188 (tm)  EM, a ROM for the storage of the program code, a RAM as the main memory, and a bus.
      <br/>
      Through its bus the microcomputer is connected to a SIO module designed as SAB 82532 in two interface modules (2) and to the ISAC circuit designed as PEB 2086 in the interface modules (1).
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The processor in the micro computer (6) controls the function of the components PEB 2086 and SAB 82532 by setting the corresponding registers in these components.
      <br/>
      Also through registers of these components, the processor interrogates the state of these components and exchanges data.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      The activation/deactivation of the ISDN interface is carried out by the PEB 2086 in the interface module (1).
      <br/>
      The state of the ISDN interface can be read from the registers of the PEB 2086.
      <br/>
      The processor in the micro computer (6) periodically interrogates the registers of the PEB 2086, which show the state of the ISDN interface.
      <br/>
      On the net side, the arrangement according to FIG. 1 operates in the master mode, as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="66">In the interface module (1), in the ISDN interface the signal levels are reciprocally converted from the ISDN interface into the signal levels required by the component PEB 2086.</p>
    <p num="67">
      With the mode switch (5) the component PEB 2086 is switched in the interface module (1) into the TE mode (terminal mode).
      <br/>
      In this mode, the PEB 2086 generates a timing signal of 512 kHz at the output DCL.
      <br/>
      When the ISDN interface is active, the timing signal of 512 kHz is synchronously derived from the bit timing signal of the ISDN interface.
      <br/>
      The timing signal of 512 kHz of the interface module is led to the timing generation module (3).
      <br/>
      The timing signal of 512 kHz from the PEB 2086 of the ISDN interface is, controlled by the processor, used in the timing generation module (3) to generate, by division, the given transmission timing signal of 64 kbit/s for the appropriate SIO.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The PEB 2086 in the interface module (1) converts the ternary-coded B- and D-channel signals from the ISDN interface into binary-coded signals and stores them, byte by byte, in its registers.
      <br/>
      Conversely, the component converts the binary-coded B- and D-channel bytes into ternary-coded signals and transmits these data to the interface of the interface module (1) for the transmission to the ISDN interface.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The PEB 2086 signals by means of a register that it is prepared to accept a new B1- and B2-channel byte each and, simultaneously, a complete B1- and B2-channel byte each is ready to be accepted by the processor.
