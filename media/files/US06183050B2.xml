    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates in general to a vehicle brake systems and in particular to a brake system having a pilot-operated boost valve located remotely from a master cylinder.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Vehicles are commonly slowed and stopped with hydraulic brake systems.
      <br/>
      These systems vary in complexity but a base brake system typically includes a brake pedal, a tandem master cylinder, fluid conduits arranged in two similar but separate brake circuits, and wheel brakes in each circuit.
      <br/>
      The driver of the vehicle operates a brake pedal which is connected to the master cylinder.
      <br/>
      When the brake pedal is depressed, the master cylinder generates hydraulic forces in both brake circuits by pressurizing brake fluid.
      <br/>
      The pressurized fluid travels through the fluid conduit in both circuits to actuate brake cylinders at the wheels to slow the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Base brake systems typically use a brake booster which act during braking to provide a force to the master cylinder which assists the pedal force created by the driver.
      <br/>
      The booster can be vacuum or hydraulically operated.
      <br/>
      A typical hydraulic booster senses the movement of the brake pedal and generates pressurized fluid which is introduced into the master cylinder.
      <br/>
      The fluid from the booster assists the pedal force acting on the pistons of the master cylinder which generate pressurized fluid in the conduit in fluid communication with the wheel brakes.
      <br/>
      Thus, the pressures generated by the master cylinder are increased.
      <br/>
      Hydraulic boosters are commonly located adjacent the master cylinder piston and use a boost valve to control the pressurized fluid applied to the booster.
      <br/>
      Typically the boost valve is connected with the booster in the master cylinder assembly and mechanically coupled to the brake pedal for proper operation.
      <br/>
      Although this placement of the booster adjacent the master cylinder has been satisfactory in the past, it would be desirable to locate the booster remotely from the master cylinder because the tighter packaging constraints in the engine compartment of modem vehicles.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Braking a vehicle in a controlled manner under adverse conditions requires precise application of the brakes by the driver.
      <br/>
      Under these conditions, a driver can easily apply excessive braking pressure thus causing one or more wheels to lock, resulting in excessive slippage between the wheel and road surface.
      <br/>
      Such wheel lock-up conditions can lead to greater stopping distances and possible loss of directional control.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Advances in braking technology have led to the introduction of Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS).
      <br/>
      An ABS system monitors wheel rotational behavior and selectively applies and relieves brake pressure in the corresponding wheel brakes in order to maintain the wheel speed within a selected slip range to achieve maximum braking force.
      <br/>
      While such systems are typically adapted to control the braking of each, braked wheel of the vehicle, some systems have been developed for controlling the braking of only a portion of the plurality of braked wheels.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Electronically controlled ABS valves, comprising apply valves and dump valves, are located between the master cylinder and the wheel brakes.
      <br/>
      The ABS valves regulate the pressure between the master cylinder and the wheel brakes.
      <br/>
      Typically, when activated, these ABS valves operate in three pressure control modes: pressure apply, pressure dump and pressure hold.
      <br/>
      The apply valves allow pressurized brake fluid into respective ones of the wheel brakes to increase pressure during the apply mode, and the dump valves relieve brake fluid from their associated wheel brakes during the dump mode.
      <br/>
      Wheel brake pressure is held constant during the hold mode by closing both the apply valves and the dump valves.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      To achieve maximum braking forces while maintaining vehicle stability, it is desirable to achieve optimum slip levels at the wheels of both the front and rear axles.
      <br/>
      During vehicle deceleration different braking forces are required at the front and rear axles to reach the desired slip levels.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the brake pressures should be proportioned between the front and rear brakes to achieve the highest braking forces at each axle.
      <br/>
      ABS systems with such ability, known as Dynamic Rear Proportioning (DRP) systems, use the ABS valves to separately control the braking pressures on the front and rear wheels to dynamically achieve optimum braking performance at the front and rear axles under the then current conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A further development in braking technology has led to the introduction of Traction Control (TC) systems.
      <br/>
      Typically, valves have been added to existing ABS systems to provide a brake system which controls wheel speed during acceleration.
      <br/>
      Excessive wheel speed during vehicle acceleration leads to wheel slippage and a loss of traction.
      <br/>
      An electronic control system senses this condition and automatically applies braking pressure to the wheel cylinders of the slipping wheel to reduce the slippage and increase the traction available.
      <br/>
      In order to achieve optimal vehicle acceleration, pressurized brake fluid is made available to the wheel cylinders even if the master cylinder is not actuated by the driver.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      During vehicle motion such as cornering, dynamic forces are generated which can reduce vehicle stability.
      <br/>
      A Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) brake system improves the stability of the vehicle by counteracting these forces through selective brake actuation.
      <br/>
      These forces and other vehicle parameters are detected by sensors which signal an electronic control unit.
      <br/>
      The electronic control unit automatically operates pressure control devices to regulate the amount of hydraulic pressure applied to specific individual wheel brakes.
      <br/>
      In order to achieve optimal vehicle stability, braking pressures greater than the master cylinder pressure must quickly be available at all times.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      This invention relates to an improved vehicle braking system.
      <br/>
      The vehicle braking system includes a master cylinder for generating pressurized fluid.
      <br/>
      A wheel brake is in fluid communication with the master cylinder.
      <br/>
      The brake system further includes a first valve for regulating the flow of fluid between the master cylinder and the wheel brake.
      <br/>
      The brake system also includes a pedal travel simulator including a housing having a bore formed therein.
      <br/>
      A piston is slidably disposed in the bore.
      <br/>
      The piston and the housing generally defining a fluid chamber which is in fluid communication with the master cylinder.
      <br/>
      The pedal travel simulator further includes a spring which biases the piston in a direction so as to contract the fluid chamber.
      <br/>
      The brake system further includes a source of pressurized fluid, such as a pump and high pressure accumulator.
      <br/>
      A boost valve can be located remotely from the master cylinder.
      <br/>
      The boost valve is in fluid communication with the source of pressurized fluid and the wheel brake.
      <br/>
      The boost valve is preferably mechanically actuated by the spring of the pedal travel simulator to supply pressurized fluid from the source of pressurized fluid to the wheel brake at a pressure ratio greater than fluid pressure generated by the master cylinder.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In a specific embodiment of a boost valve, in accordance with the present invention, the boost valve includes a valve body having first and second valve chambers.
      <br/>
      A sleeve member is fixed relative to the valve body.
      <br/>
      The sleeve member has a first end having a bore formed therein.
      <br/>
      A poppet valve assembly is movable relative to the sleeve member between a first position and a second position.
      <br/>
      The poppet valve has first and second ends.
      <br/>
      The boost valve further include a first valve member defined by the first end of the poppet valve assembly and the cooperation of the second end of a reaction spool engaged with a spring of a pedal travel simulator.
      <br/>
      A second valve member is defined by the cooperation of the first end of the sleeve member and the second end of the poppet valve assembly.
      <br/>
      When the poppet valve assembly is in its first position, the first valve member allows the flow of fluid between the bore of the reaction spool and the first valve chamber, and the second valve member restricts the flow of fluid between the second valve chamber and the source of pressurized fluid.
      <br/>
      When the poppet valve assembly is in its second position, the first valve member restricts the flow of fluid between the bore of the reaction spool and the first valve chamber, and the second valve member allows the flow of fluid between the second valve chamber and the source of pressurized fluid.

    <p num="16">
      Referring now to the drawings, there is illustrated in FIG. 1 a hydraulic schematic of a first embodiment of a vehicle brake system, indicated generally at 10, in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The brake system 10 includes a master cylinder, such as a tandem master cylinder 12, which is operatively connected to a brake pedal 14.
      <br/>
      A reservoir 16 is in fluid communication with the master cylinder 12 and holds a supply of brake fluid generally at atmospheric pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Throughout this specification and claims, the term "in fluid communication with" refers to a hydraulic connection between two or more components in which hydraulic pressure is transmittable from one component to another through a fluid medium.
      <br/>
      The fluid medium may or may not contain a valve regulating the flow of fluid between the components.
      <br/>
      The components can be in direct fluid communication, wherein hydraulic fluid can directly flow between the components.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the components can be indirectly in fluid communication, wherein fluid cannot flow directly between the components, but fluid pressure is transmittable between the components.
      <br/>
      For example, a fluid conduit extending between two components may include a movable piston slidably disposed therein such that the pressure of the fluid acting on one end of the piston causes the piston to move, thereby transmitting the pressure to the fluid acting on the other end of the piston.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      A switch 17 may be connected to the reservoir 16 for sensing the fluid level within the reservoir 16.
      <br/>
      When the master cylinder 12 is actuated by the depression of the brake pedal 14, the pressurized brake fluid produced by the master cylinder 12 enters the brake system 10 from the master cylinder 12 via a pair of conduits 18 and 20.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The brake system 10 further includes a source of pressurized fluid or fluid pressure generator circuit, indicated by a phantom line 22.
      <br/>
      The fluid pressure generator circuit 22 provides pressurized fluid to the rest of the brake system 10 via a supply conduit 24 during normal boosted braking to achieve brake boost, as will be explained in detail below.
      <br/>
      The fluid pressure generator circuit 22 also provides pressurized fluid for brake operation during ABS, TC, and VSC modes.
      <br/>
      As will be explained in detail below, the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 is in fluid communication with the master cylinder 12 via the conduits 18 and 20.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The fluid pressure generator circuit 22 and various solenoid valves of the brake system 10 (further described below) are controlled by an electronic control unit 23 (ECU) using information from various sensors (not all shown).
      <br/>
      Preferably, the brake system 10 includes a pressure transducer 25 in fluid communication with the conduit 18 for transmitting pressure information to the ECU 23.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the pressure transducer 25 may be located in the conduit 20.
      <br/>
      The brake system 10 may also include a brake switch 27 connected to the brake pedal 14 to provide a signal that the driver of the vehicle is depressing the brake pedal 14.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The brake system 10 includes a first wheel brake 26 which is in fluid communication with the master cylinder 12 via the conduit 20.
      <br/>
      A first base brake valve 28 is located in the conduit 20, between the first wheel brake 26 and the master cylinder 12.
      <br/>
      The first base brake valve 28 is movable between a normally open position 28a and a closed position 28b.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the first base brake valve 28 is a normally open, pilot operated 2-position, 2-way valve.
      <br/>
      The positioning of the first base brake valve 28 is regulated by the pressure differential between the conduit 20 and the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      The first base brake valve 28 provides for a "manual push through" to the first wheel brake 26, that is, pressurized fluid from the master cylinder is 12 can be sent to the first wheel brake 26 when the first base brake valve 28 is in the open position 28a.
      <br/>
      However, under normal boosted braking conditions, the first base brake valve 28 is in the closed position 28b and the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 delivers pressurized fluid through the supply conduit 24 to actuate the first wheel brake 26, as will be discussed in detail below.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The brake system 10 further includes a second wheel brake 30 which is in fluid communication with the master cylinder 12 via the conduit 18.
      <br/>
      A second base brake valve 32 is located in the conduit 18, between the second wheel brake 30 and the master cylinder 12.
      <br/>
      The second base brake valve 32 is movable between a normally open position 32a and a closed position 32b.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the second base brake valve 32 is a normally open, pilot operated 2-position, 2-way valve, the operation of which is regulated by the pressure differential between the conduit 18 the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      The second base brake valve 32 provides for a "manual push through" to the wheel brake 30, that is, pressurized fluid from the master cylinder 12 can be sent to the second wheel brake 30 when the second base brake valve 32 is in the open position 32a.
      <br/>
      Under normal boosted braking conditions, the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 delivers pressurized fluid through the supply conduit 24 to actuate the second wheel brake 30, as will be discussed in detail below.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The brake system 10 further includes a fluid conduit 34 which branches off from the conduit 20 adjacent the first wheel brake 26 and is in fluid communication with the first wheel brake 26 and a first fluid separator assembly 36.
      <br/>
      The first fluid separator assembly 36 includes a spring-biased piston 38 having a pair of seals 40 and 42 disposed thereabout.
      <br/>
      The seals 40 and 42 engage a cylindrical wall 44 to sealingly separate first and second chambers 46 and 48, respectively.
      <br/>
      The second chamber 48 is in fluid communication with the first wheel brake 26 via the conduit 34.
      <br/>
      An annular space 50 is defined between the seals 40 and 42, the piston 38, and the cylindrical wall 44.
      <br/>
      The annular space 50 is in fluid communication with the reservoir 16 via a return conduit 52.
      <br/>
      If desired, the brake system 10 can include a sensor (not shown) for sensing a fluid leak across one or both of the seals 40 and 42.
      <br/>
      The first fluid separator 36 isolates the fluid in the master cylinder 12 and the first wheel brake 26 from the fluid in the fluid pressure generator circuit 22.
      <br/>
      The fluid pressure generator circuit 22 provides pressurized fluid to the first chamber 46 via a conduit 54 which is selectively in fluid communication with the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      The first fluid separator 36 includes a spring 57 which urges the piston 38 in a direction to minimize the size of the first chamber 46.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      A conduit 56 branches off from the conduit 18 adjacent the second wheel brake 30 and provides fluid communication between the second wheel brake 30 and a second fluid separator assembly 58.
      <br/>
      The second fluid separator assembly 58 is similar in structure and function as the first fluid separator assembly 36.
      <br/>
      The second fluid separator assembly 58 includes a spring-biased piston 60 having a pair of seals 62 and 64 disposed thereabout.
      <br/>
      The seals 62 and 64 engage a cylindrical wall 66 to sealingly separate first and second chambers 68 and 70, respectively.
      <br/>
      The second chamber 70 is in fluid communication with the second wheel brake 30 via the conduit 56.
      <br/>
      An annular space 72 is defined between the seals 62 and 64, the piston 60, and the cylindrical wall 66.
      <br/>
      The annular space 72 is in fluid communication with the reservoir 16 via the return conduit 52.
      <br/>
      The second fluid separator 58 isolates the fluid in the master cylinder 12 and the second wheel brake 30 from the fluid in the fluid pressure generator circuit 22.
      <br/>
      The fluid pressure generator circuit 22 provides pressurized fluid to the first chamber 68 of the second fluid separator assembly via a conduit 74 which branches from the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      The second fluid separator 58 includes a spring 75 which urges the piston 60 in a direction to minimize the size of the chamber 68.

      A first isolation valve 76 is located in the conduit 54 between the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 and the first chamber 46 of the first fluid separator assembly 36.

      A second isolation valve 78 is located in the conduit 74 between the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 and the first chamber 68 of the second fluid separator assembly 58.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the first and second isolation valves 76 and 78 are normally open 2-position, 2-way solenoid operated valves having first, normally open positions 76a and 78a, respectively, and second, one-way positions 76b and 78b, respectively.
      <br/>
      The one-way positions 76b and 78b restrict fluid from flowing from the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 via the supply conduit 24 to the first and second fluid separator assemblies 36 and 58, respectively, but may permit fluid to flow in the opposite direction.

    <p num="30">
      Although the brake system 10 is shown having independent circuits for the wheel brakes 90 and 92, the brake system 10 could be adapted to include a single isolation valve and a single dump valve for the wheel brakes 90 and 92, such as for example, if the wheel brakes 90 and 92 are rear wheel brakes on a front wheel driven vehicle.

      <br/>
      The pump 104 operates to draw fluid from the reservoir 16 and supply the fluid at an increase pressure to the conduit 110.

      A check valve 112 is provided at the outlet 104b to help prevent the flow of fluid from the conduit 110 into the outlet 104b of the pump 104.

      As will be described in detail below, the boost valve 116 is preferably mechanically actuated by a pedal travel simulator, indicated generally at 118.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the boost valve 116 is a 3-position, 3-way valve.
      <br/>
      The boost valve 116 can have any suitable valve arrangement, such as a poppet or spool valve.

      The boost valve 116 is generally located between the pump output 104b and the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      The boost valve 116 is also in fluid communication with the master cylinder 12, but it is mechanically decoupled from it.
      <br/>
      That is, the boost valve 116 is not mechanically connected to the master cylinder 12 or brake pedal 14.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the boost valve 116 can be located remotely from the master cylinder 12, providing flexibility in positioning the boost valve 116 within the vehicle.

      The boost valve 116 is connected at a first port 116a to the outlet of the pump 104b via the conduit 110.

      The pedal travel simulator 118 is an accumulator which receives brake fluid from the master cylinder 12, as will be explained in detail below.
      <br/>
      The pedal travel simulator 118 can be designed to provide the driver with a pedal feel that is similar to typical hydraulic braking systems using conventional boosters or any other desirable pedal feel.
      <br/>
      The pedal travel simulator 118 includes a bore 124 having first and second pistons 126 and 128 slidably disposed therein.
      <br/>
      The first and second pistons 126 and 128 divide the bore 124 into first, second, and third chambers 130, 132, and 134, respectively.

      The first chamber 130 is selectively in fluid communication with the master cylinder 12 via a conduit 136 and the conduit 20.

      <br/>
      The pedal travel simulator 118 further includes a spring 139 which actuates the boost valve 116, as will be discussed in detail below.

    <p num="36">
      Located in the conduit 136 between the master cylinder 12 and the first chamber 130 of the pedal travel simulator 118 is a first pedal travel simulator valve 140.

      Preferably, the first pedal travel simulator valve 140 is a normally closed 2-position, 2-way pilot operated valve, however, any suitable valve can be used, such as a solenoid actuated valve.
      <br/>
      The first pedal travel simulator valve 140 preferably has a first position 140a having a one-way check valve 142 which may allow fluid to flow in a direction from the first chamber 130 of the pedal travel simulator 118 into the conduit 20, but restricts the flow of fluid in the opposite direction.
      <br/>
      The first pedal travel simulator valve 140 also has a second position 140b which is open.
      <br/>
      The first pedal travel simulator valve 140 is biased to the first position 140a by a spring 143.
      <br/>
      The pilot operated first pedal travel simulator valve 140 senses the pressure differential between the chamber 130 of the pedal travel simulator 118 from the master cylinder 12 and the conduit 110 from the high pressure accumulator 108.
      <br/>
      The first pedal travel simulator valve 140 moves to the second open position 140b when the fluid pressure in the conduit 110 from the high pressure accumulator 108 overcomes the pressure in the first chamber 130 and the force of the spring 143 biasing the first pedal travel simulator valve 140 to the first position 140a.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the spring 143 biases the first pedal travel simulator valve 140 to the first position 140a when the pressure within the conduit 110 is less than about 650 p.s.i. relative to the pressure within the first chamber 130.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the first pedal travel simulator valve 140 is in the first position 140a, fluid flowing from the master cylinder 12 is blocked so that the pressurized fluid from the master cylinder 12 will flow into the wheel brake 26.

      The second pedal travel simulator valve 144 also has a second position 144b which is open.
      <br/>
      The second pedal travel simulator valve 144 is biased to the first position 144a by a spring 147.
      <br/>
      The pilot operated second pedal travel simulator valve 144 senses the pressure differential between the second chamber 132 of the pedal travel simulator 118 from the master cylinder 12 and the conduit 110 from the high pressure accumulator 108.
      <br/>
      The second pedal travel simulator valve 144 moves to the second open position 144b when the fluid pressure in the conduit 110 from the high pressure accumulator 108 overcomes the pressure in the second chamber 132 and the force of the spring 147 biasing the second pedal travel simulator valve 144 to the first position 144a.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the spring 147 biases the second pedal travel simulator valve 144 to the first position 144a when the pressure within the conduit 110 is less than about 650 p.s.i. relative to the pressure within the second chamber 132.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the second pedal travel simulator valve 144 in the first position 144a, fluid flowing into the second chamber 132 from the master cylinder 12 is blocked so that the pressurized fluid from the master cylinder 12 will flow into the wheel brake 30.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The first and second pedal travel simulator valves 140 and 144 are provided for certain conditions in which there is generally not enough fluid pressure from the high pressure accumulator 108 for proper operation of the boost valve 116.
      <br/>
      In this condition, the first and second pedal travel simulator valves 140 and 144 will close off fluid communication between the master cylinder 12 and the pedal travel simulator 118, and the first and second base brake valves 28 and 32 will provide for manual push through to the first and second wheel brakes 26 and 30.

      Preferably, the brake system 10 further includes a compliance accumulator 148 having a spring biased piston 150 pressurizing a chamber 152.
      <br/>
      The chamber 152 is in fluid communication with the third port 116c of the boost valve 116.
      <br/>
      The compliance accumulator 148 generally supplies initial instantaneous flow to the supply conduit 24 until the boost valve 116 can respond with sufficient flow.
      <br/>
      For example, if the boost valve 116 is designed with an internal dampening system for a valve, such as a poppet valve, to help stabilize the valve, the compliance accumulator can provide sufficient flow to the brake system 10.
      <br/>
      If desired, the compliance accumulator 148 can be omitted from the brake system 10.

    <p num="40">
      The brake system 10 further includes an override isolation valve 154 which is located between the third port 116c of the boost valve 116 and the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the override isolation valve 154 is a normally open 2-position, 2-way solenoid operated valve.
      <br/>
      The override isolation valve 154 has a first, normally open position 154a, and a second, one-way position 154b which restricts the flow of fluid in a direction from the supply conduit 24 to the third port 116c of the boost valve 116, but may allow fluid to flow in the opposite direction.
      <br/>
      The brake system 10 also includes an override dump valve 156 which is located in the conduit 110 between the high pressure accumulator 108 and the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the override dump valve 156 is a normally closed 2-position, 2-way solenoid operated valve.
      <br/>
      The override dump valve 156 has a first closed position 156a, and a second open position 156b.
      <br/>
      As will be explained in detail below, the override isolation valve 154 and the override dump valve 156 can be actuated to regulate the flow of pressurized fluid flowing from the conduit 110 into the supply conduit 24 even when the master cylinder 12 is not actuated by the brake pedal 14, such as for example, during a TC event or during various VSC events.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The operation of the brake system 10 shall now be described.
      <br/>
      During normal boosted braking operation, the driver of the vehicle in which the brake system 10 is installed, will depress the brake pedal 14 to actuate the wheel brake 26, 30, 90 and 92.
      <br/>
      The term "normal boosted braking" refers to the operation of the brake system 10, wherein the ignition system of the vehicle is on and the brake system 10 has not entered into an ABS, TC, or VSC operation.
      <br/>
      Movement of the brake pedal 14 moves pistons (not shown) within the master cylinder 12, thereby pressurizing the fluid within the conduits 18 and 20.
      <br/>
      During operation of the vehicle and based on information from the pressure switch 113, the pump 104 is actuated to supply relatively high fluid pressure to the accumulator 108 and the conduit 110 within a selected pressure range, such as between 2000 and 3000 p.s.i. Generally, the fluid pressure within the conduit 110 will be greater than the fluid pressure within the conduits 18 and 20 even when the master cylinder 12 is actuated.
      <br/>
      The differential across the first and second pedal travel simulator valves 140 and 144 causes the first and second pedal travel simulator valves 140 and 144 to move to the open positions 140b and 144b, respectively.
      <br/>
      Thus, the pressurized fluid within the conduits 18 and 20 from the master cylinder flows through the conduits 138 and 136, respectively, to the pedal travel simulator 118.
      <br/>
      The pressurized fluid from the conduit 138 expands the second chamber 132, thereby advancing the second piston 128 leftward, away from the first piston 126.
      <br/>
      The movement of the second piston 128 acts to compress the spring 139 against a portion of the boost valve 116, thereby actuating the boost valve 116 to the third position 122c.
      <br/>
      The pedal travel simulator 118 can be designed to provide the driver with a pedal feel, or a reactionary force acting on the brake pedal 12, which is similar to typical brake systems, or the pedal travel simulator 118 can be designed so as to create any suitable desirable reactionary force.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      If the pressures within the conduits 136 and 138 are approximately equal, the first piston 126 may remain relatively stationary.
      <br/>
      However, during certain conditions, such as a rapid spike apply of the master cylinder 12 or a failed condition of the master cylinder 12, the first piston 126 can move leftward moving the second piston 128 therewith.
      <br/>
      If desired, the pedal travel simulator 118 and the master cylinder 12 could be designed such that both the first and second pistons 126 and 128 are advanced during a brake apply.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the pedal travel simulator 118 could be of a single piston design being in fluid communication with either the conduit 18 or the conduit 20 or both.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      In the third position 122c, the boost valve 116 generally allows pressurized fluid from the pump 104 and the high pressure accumulator 108 to flow from the conduit 110 into the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      The fluid pressure generator circuit 22 operates to supply fluid pressure to the supply conduit 24, referred herein as "boost pressure", at a predetermined "boost ratio" in relation to the pressure generated from the master cylinder 12, sensed via the spring 139 of the pedal travel simulator 118.
      <br/>
      The boost pressure is generally greater than the pressure within the conduits 18 and 20 by a predetermined multiple, which multiple is termed the "boost ratio".
      <br/>
      For example, if the pressure within the conduits 18 and 20 are at 100 p.s.i.g. and the boost ratio is 6, the boost valve 116 will supply fluid at about 600 p.s.i.g. to the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      The boost valve 116 will shuttle to the second position 122b to close the fluid communication between the conduit 110 and the supply conduit 24 when the pressure of the fluid in the supply conduit 24 is approximately equal to the pressure supplied by the master cylinder 12 multiplied by the boost ratio.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Since the pressure within the conduits 18 and 20 will generally be lower than the pressure within the supply conduit 24, the pilot operated first and second base brake valves 28 and 32 are shuttled to their respective closed positions 28b and 32b, thereby closing direct fluid communication between the conduits 20 and 18 and the wheel brakes 2630, respectively.
      <br/>
      With the first and second base brake valves 28 and 32 closed, the fluid pressures at the wheel brakes 26 and 30 can exceed the fluid pressure generated by the master cylinder 12 within the conduits 18 and 20.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      During normal boosted braking, the isolation valves 94 and 96 are in their open positions 94a and 96a to permit the flow of fluid from the supply conduit 24 to the wheel brakes 90 and 92.
      <br/>
      The dump valves 98 and 100 are also typically in their closed position 98a and 102a during normal boosted braking to prevent fluid from entering the return conduit 52 to the reservoir 16.
      <br/>
      The pressurized fluid in the supply conduit 24 also flows through the open isolation valves 76 and 78 during normal boosted braking and into the first chambers 46 and 68 of the first and second fluid separator assemblies 36 and 58, respectively.
      <br/>
      The pressurized fluid moves the pistons 38 and 60 in the first and second fluid separator assemblies 36 and 58, respectively, towards the second chambers 48 and 70, thereby pressurizing the fluid therein.
      <br/>
      The pressurized fluid flows from the second chambers 48 and 70 into the wheel brakes 26 and 30 via the conduits 34 and 56 to brake the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Note that during normal boosted braking, the dump valves 80 and 84 are typically in their respective closed positions 80a and 84a to prevent fluid from entering the return conduit 52 to the reservoir 16.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Based on information from the pressure switch 113, the ECU 23 may actuate the motor 106 of the pump 104 during normal boosted braking to supply relatively high pressure to the conduit 110 and the high pressure accumulator 108 within a selected pressure range.
      <br/>
      The boost valve 116 will shuttle between its positions 122a, 122b, and 122c to maintain the pressure in the supply conduit 24 at a pressure which is generally equal to the pressure within the conduits 18 and 20 generated by the master cylinder 12 multiplied by the boost ratio.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      When the driver releases the brake pedal 14, the fluid within the second chamber 132 of the pedal travel simulator 118 returns to the master cylinder 12 through the check valve 146 of the second pedal travel simulator valve 144.
      <br/>
      The boost valve 116 is shuttled to the first position 122a which allows fluid communication between the supply conduit 24 and the conduit 120 to the reservoir 16.
      <br/>
      The pressurized fluid in the first chambers 46 and 68 of the first and second fluid separator assemblies 36 and 58, respectively, returns to the reservoir 16 by flowing through the conduits 54 and 74, respectively, and then through the supply conduit 24, the boost valve 116, and the conduit 120.
      <br/>
      As the fluid separator assembly pistons 38 and 60 move towards the first chambers 46 and 68, the fluid pressure in the wheel brakes 26 and 30, respectively, is reduced and the fluid therein returns to the second chambers 48 and 70, respectively.
      <br/>
      The first and second base brake valves 28 and 32 are shuttled to the open positions 28a and 32a, respectively, as the pressure in the supply conduit 24 generally drops below the pressure supplied by the master cylinder 12.
      <br/>
      Any residual pressurized fluid in the wheel brakes 26 and 30 flows back to the master cylinder 12 via conduits 20 and 18, respectively.
      <br/>
      The pressure within the wheel brakes 90 and 92 is reduced, and the fluid therein returns to the reservoir 16 via the conduits 86 and 88, respectively, and then through the supply conduit 24, the boost valve 116, and the conduit 120.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      During an ABS event, the brake system 10 admits pressurized fluid into the supply conduit 24 in a similar manner as during normal boosted braking.
      <br/>
      However, during an ABS braking operation, the ECU 23 controls the isolation valves 76, 78, 94, and 96 and the dump valves 80, 84, 98, and 102 to regulate the pressure to the wheel brakes 26, 30, 90, and 92.
      <br/>
      For example, if the ECU 23 detects that the wheel corresponding to the wheel brake 26 begins to slip appreciably during braking, an ABS dump mode may be entered into.
      <br/>
      The pressure at the wheel brake 26 is reduced to allow the wheel to spin back up to vehicle speed.
      <br/>
      To reduce the pressure at the wheel brake 26, the isolation valve 76 is shuttled to the second, one-way position 76b, such as by actuating the solenoid of the isolation valve 76.
      <br/>
      When the isolation valve is in the one-way position 76b, fluid in the supply conduit 24 is prevented from reaching the fluid separator assembly 36.
      <br/>
      The dump valve 80 is shuttled to the open position 80b by actuating the solenoid thereof, thereby allowing the pressurized fluid in the first chamber 46 of the first fluid separator assembly 36 to flow back to the reservoir 16 via the return conduit 52.
      <br/>
      The brake system 10 may enter into an ABS hold mode to give the wheel time to spin back up to speed.
      <br/>
      During the ABS hold mode, the pressure at the wheel brake 26 is generally held constant by keeping the isolation valve 76 shuttled to its one-way position 76b and keeping the dump valve 80 in its one-way position 80a.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      When the ECU 23 detects that the wheel associated with the wheel brake 26 spins back up to near vehicle speed, an ABS apply mode may be entered into in which pressure is increased at the wheel brake 26.
      <br/>
      The isolation valve 76 is shuttled to the open position 76a and the dump valve 80 is shuttled (or remaining in) its one-way position 80a.
      <br/>
      This allows the pressurized fluid in the supply conduit 24 to expand the first chamber 46 of the fluid separator assembly 36.
      <br/>
      The expansion of the first chamber 41 causes the piston 38 to move to pressurize the fluid in the second chamber 48, thereby supplying pressurized fluid to the wheel brake 26.
      <br/>
      The brake system 10 may enter the dump, hold, and apply modes several times during a single ABS event.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      When a driven wheel begins to slip during acceleration, the brake system 10 may enter into a traction control (TC) mode.
      <br/>
      The slipping wheel is braked to slow the wheel and regain traction for maximum vehicle acceleration.
      <br/>
      During a TC mode, the ECU 23 actuates the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 to provide pressurized fluid to the supply conduit 24 and controls the operation of the override isolation valve 154 and the override dump valve 156.
      <br/>
      The ECU 23 actuates the override isolation valve 154 to its one-way position 154b, thereby preventing flow from the supply conduit 24 to the boost valve 116.
      <br/>
      The ECU 23 also actuates the override dump valve 156 to its open position 156b, thereby allowing high pressure fluid from the conduit 110 to enter the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      Various ones of the isolation valves 76, 78, 94, and/or 96 and the dump valves 80, 84, 98, and/or 102 are controlled to brake the slipping wheel to regain traction.
      <br/>
      For example, if the wheel corresponding to the first wheel brake 26 is a driven wheel and slippage is detected, the isolation valves 78, 94, and 96 corresponding to the other wheels are actuated to their one-way closed positions, 78b, 94b, and 96b, respectively, thereby blocking fluid communication from the supply conduit 24 thereto.
      <br/>
      The isolation valve 76 is pulsed from the one-way position 76b to the open position 76a.
      <br/>
      The pressurized fluid in the supply conduit 24 expands the first chamber 46 of the first fluid separator assembly 36.
      <br/>
      The expansion of the first chamber 46 moves the piston 38, thereby pressurizing the fluid in the second chamber 48 to provide pressurized fluid to the first wheel brake 26.
      <br/>
      A traction control hold mode may be entered to keep the pressure constant at the first wheel brake 26.
      <br/>
      During traction control hold mode, the isolation valve 76 is shuttled to its one-way position 76b.
      <br/>
      When the speed of the driven wheel associated with the wheel brake 76 has been reduced to near the vehicle speed, a traction control dump mode may be entered into to reduce the brake pressure at the first wheel brake 26.
      <br/>
      During a traction control dump mode, the isolation valve 76 is shuttled to (or remains in) the one-way position 76b.
      <br/>
      The dump valve 80 is then shuttled to its open position 80b.
      <br/>
      The pressurized fluid in the first chamber 46 can flow out through the dump valve 80 and back to the reservoir 16 via the return conduit 52.
      <br/>
      After the traction control event has ended, the override dump valve 156 is moved to its closed position 156a and the override isolation valve 154 is moved to its open position 154a allowing the fluid in the supply conduit 24 to return to the reservoir 16 via the conduit 120 and the return conduit 52.

      During a VSC event, braking may be required on one or more wheels to improve cornering stability of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The driver may or may not be braking at that time, and the braking pressures required may exceed the pressure generated by the master cylinder 12.
      <br/>
      The brake system 10 is actuated and controls the operation of the override isolation valve 154 and the override dump valve 156 in a similar manner as during a TC event, as described above.
      <br/>
      The isolation and dump valves corresponding to the wheel brakes which are to be actuated control the wheel brake pressure to achieve the desired braking effect.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment of the brake system 10 as described above, each wheel brake 26, 30, 90, and 92 can be independently modulated from the others.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The brake system 10 may also be used to provide Dynamic Rear Proportioning (DRP).
      <br/>
      When the brake system 10 enters into a DRP mode, the braking pressures on the front and rear brakes are separately controlled to achieve greater braking performance at the front and rear axles.
      <br/>
      For example, the brake system 10 can be configured such that the wheel brakes 26 and 30 are associated with the front wheels, and the wheel brakes 90 and 92 are associated with the rear wheels.
      <br/>
      The respective isolation and dump valves are regulated to increase or decrease the braking pressure at the wheels of the rear brakes at a different pressure from the front brakes, as required to achieve maximum braking effort with minim wheel slippage.
      <br/>
      Of course, since the brake system 10 can modulate pressure at any wheel individually, as described with respect to VSC operation above, it is anticipated that a DRP operation can be accomplished in a diagonally split system also.

      The fourth chamber 328 is in fluid communication with a boost output port, such as the supply conduit 24 of the brake system 10 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Generally, the valve assembly 300 is submersed within the fourth chamber 328.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The operation of the boost valve 200 and the pedal travel simulator 202 shall now be described as being adapted for use in the brake system 10 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      A stated earlier, the embodiment of the pedal travel simulator 202 can be adapted to be of a dual piston design, such as the pedal travel simulator 118 of the brake system 10 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      For the purposes of explanation, the first fluid chamber 220 of the pedal travel simulator 202 will be described as being connected to the brake system 10, in a similar manner as the second chamber 132 of the pedal travel simulator 118 is in fluid communication with the conduit 138.
      <br/>
      Normally, when the driver of the vehicle has depressed the brake pedal 14 and the brake system 10 has not entered into an ABS, TC, DRP, or VSC brake operation, the boost valve 200 is in the position as illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3, which is similar to the first position 122a such that the conduit 120 is in fluid communication with the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      In this position, the ball 306 is unseated from the valve seat 244 of the reaction spool 236, thereby allowing fluid communication between the second fluid chamber 246 to the fourth fluid chamber 328 via the bore 238 of the reaction spool 236.
      <br/>
      The ball 308 is seated on the valve seat 281 of the sleeve 260, thereby closing fluid communication between the third and fourth fluid chambers 292 and 328.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      When the driver depresses the brake pedal 14 for normal boosted braking, the master cylinder 12 pressurizes the brake fluid in the conduit 18 which flows into the first fluid chamber 220.
      <br/>
      The first fluid chamber 220 expands, thereby causing the piston 208 to move leftward, as viewing FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The movement of the piston 208 exerts a force on the spring 224 and the wave spring 226 which is transmitted through the first spring retainer 228 to the reaction spool 236.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the wave spring 226 has a non-linear variable spring rate so that as the wave spring 226 compresses, its spring rate increases until it matches the generally constant spring rate of the spring 224.
      <br/>
      The compression of the wave spring 226 and the spring 224 can provide for a smooth brake pedal feel or response similar to a typical hydraulic braking system having a conventional booster.
      <br/>
      The force acting on the reaction spool 236 causes the reaction spool 236 to move leftward, as viewing FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The movement of the reaction spool 236 causes the cylindrical plate 250 to move left-ward, as viewing FIGS. 2 and 3, against the bias of the spring 258.
      <br/>
      As the cylindrical plate 250 moves leftward, the damping chamber 259 expands.
      <br/>
      Fluid enters the damping chamber 259 via the annular gap 261.
      <br/>
      The annular gap 261 and the damping chamber 259 cooperate to assist in dampening hydraulic pulses traveling through the fluid within the boost valve 200.
      <br/>
      The movement of the reaction spool 236 causes the ball 306 to seat on the valve seat 244, thereby closing fluid communication between the second fluid chamber 246 and the fourth fluid chamber 328.
      <br/>
      Further movement of the reaction spool 236 pushes against the valve assembly 300 causing the valve assembly to move leftward, as viewing FIGS. 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      Movement of the valve assembly 300 causes the ball 308 to unseat from the valve seat 281 formed on the sleeve 206.
      <br/>
      The boost valve 200 is now in a position similar to the third position 122c of the boost valve 116 of the FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Thus, the pressurized fluid from the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 is allowed to flow into the fourth fluid chamber 328 via the conduit 294, the third fluid chamber 292, the radial bore 282, and the central bore 280.
      <br/>
      The pressurized fluid flows around the valve assembly 300 through the radial openings 284 of the sleeve 260 and out through the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      The valve assembly 300 is moved back to the right when the pressure within the fourth fluid chamber 328 rises above the pressure from the master cylinder 12 multiplied by the predetermined boost ratio.
      <br/>
      The boost ratio is determined by the relative swept areas of the first and second diameter portions 212 and 240 of the stepped bore 206 of the valve body 204.
      <br/>
      Typically, the boost valve 200 will eventually reach an equilibrium, wherein the balls 306 and 308 are seated on the valve seats 244 and 282, respectively, and will stay in a position similar to the second position 122b of the boost valve 116 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      When the pressure generated from the master cylinder 12, such as by changing the position of the brake pedal 14, the boost valve 200 will operate as described above to maintain a pressure in the supply conduit 24 at a factor above the pressure generated by the master cylinder 12 as determined by the boost ratio.
      <br/>
      When the driver releases the brake pedal 14, the piston 208 will move rightward until stopped by the end plug 216.
      <br/>
      The boost valve 200 will then return to the position, as illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3.

      The orifices 476 and 478 and the second and third fluid chambers 472 and 474 cooperate to provide for dampening of hydraulic pulses to stabilize the spool valve 450.
      <br/>
      The passageways 476 and 478 are in fluid communication with a reservoir port, such as the conduit 120 of the brake system 10 of FIG. 1.

      An end 496 of the lever 492 engages an end of a second pin 498.

      The operation of the boost valve 450 and the pedal travel simulator 452 shall now be described as being adapted for use in the brake system 10 of FIG. 1.

      However, it should be understood that the boost valve 450 and the pedal travel simulator 452 can be used in any suitable brake system.
      <br/>
      When the driver of the vehicle depresses the brake pedal 14, the master cylinder 12 pressurizes the brake fluid in the conduit 138, thereby expanding the first fluid chamber 460.
      <br/>
      The expansion of the first fluid chamber 460 causes the piston 458 to move leftward, as viewing FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      The piston 458 exerts a force on the spring 462 which is transmitted through the wave spring assemblies 464 to the spring retainer 470.
      <br/>
      The movement of the spring retainer 470 causes the first pin 488 to move leftward causing a rotation of the lever 492 in a counter-clockwise direction, as viewing FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      The rotation of the lever 492 imparts leftward longitudinal movement on the second pin 498.
      <br/>
      Movement of the second pin 498 actuates the spool of the boost valve 450 which operates in a similar manner as the boost valve 400 illustrated in FIG. 8.
    </p>
    <p num="79">The boost ratio of the boost valve 450 is determined by the relative areas of the spool of the boost valve 450, the relative area of the piston 458, and the mechanical advantage created by the leverage of the interaction of the first pin 488, the lever 492, and the second pin 498.</p>

      <br/>
      For the purposes of explanation, the first fluid chamber 572 of the pedal travel simulator 552 will be described as being connected to the brake system 10 similar to the second chamber 132 of the pedal travel simulator 118.
      <br/>
      Normally, when the master cylinder 12 is not generating pressurized fluid, the boost valve 550 is in the position illustrated in FIGS. 10 and 11 which is similar to the first position 122a, wherein the conduit 120 is in fluid communication with the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      The ball 630 is unseated from the valve seat 632 of the reaction spool 604, thereby allowing fluid communication between the second fluid chamber 612 to the fourth fluid chamber 666 via the bore 605 of the reaction spool 604.
      <br/>
      The ball 646 is seated on the valve seat 642 of the first sleeve 594, thereby closing fluid communication between the third and fourth fluid chambers 662 and 666.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      When the driver depresses the brake pedal 14, the master cylinder 12 pressurizes the brake fluid in the conduit 18 which flows into the first fluid chamber 572.
      <br/>
      The first fluid chamber 572 expands, thereby causing the piston 560 to move leftward, as viewing FIG. 10. The movement of the piston 560 exerts a force on the spring 576 which is transmitted through the first and second spring retainers 578 and 588 to the cap 606 and the reaction spool 604.
      <br/>
      The force acting on the reaction spool 604 causes the reaction spool 604 to move leftward, as viewing FIGS. 10 and 11.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      The movement of the reaction spool 604 moves the collar 614.
      <br/>
      As the collar 614 moves leftward, the damping chamber 622 expands.
      <br/>
      Fluid enters the damping chamber 622 via the orifices 620.
      <br/>
      The orifices 620 and the damping chamber 622 cooperate to assist in damping the motion of the reaction spool 604 to prevent the formation of undesirable hydraulic pulses which travel through the fluid within the boost valve 550.
      <br/>
      The movement of the reaction spool 604 also causes the ball 630 to seat on the valve seat 632, thereby closing fluid communication between the second fluid chamber 612 and the fourth fluid chamber 666.
      <br/>
      Further movement of the reaction spool 604 pushes against the valve assembly 624 causing the valve assembly 624 to move leftward, as viewing FIGS. 10 and 11. Movement of the valve assembly 624 causes the ball 646 to unseat from the valve seat 642 formed on the first sleeve 594.
      <br/>
      The boost valve 550 is now in a position similar to the third position 122c of the boost valve 116 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Thus, the pressurized fluid from the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 is allowed to flow into the fourth fluid chamber 666 via the conduit 110, the radial bore 644, and the central bore 640.
      <br/>
      The pressurized fluid flows around the valve assembly 624 around the second disc 628 and out through the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      The valve assembly 624 is moved back to the right when the pressure within the fourth fluid chamber 666 rises above the pressure from the master cylinder 12 multiplied by the predetermined boost ratio.
      <br/>
      The boost valve 550 will eventually reach an equilibrium wherein the balls 630 and 646 are seated on the valve seats 632 and 642, respectively, and will stay in a position similar to the second position 122b of the boost valve 116 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      When the driver changes the pressure generated from the master cylinder 12 by changing the position of the brake pedal 14, the boost valve 550 will operate as described above, thereby maintaining a pressure in the supply conduit 24 at a factor above the pressure generated by the master cylinder 12 as determined by the boost ratio.
      <br/>
      When the driver releases the brake pedal 14, the piston 560 will return to its at rest position.
      <br/>
      The boost valve 550 will then return to the position as that illustrated in FIGS. 10 and 11.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      During a hard brake apply, the pressurized fluid from the master cylinder 12 may expand the first fluid chamber 572 so that the first portion 560a of the piston 560 compresses the plurality of Belleville washers 526.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the spring rate of the Belleville washers 526 is greater than the spring rate of the spring 575.
      <br/>
      The Belleville washers 526 provide for a pedal feel which is similar to conventional boosted brake system, which may produce a desirable pedal feel for the driver of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The Belleville washers 526 also provide protection for the components of the boost valve 550, such as the balls 584, 608, 630, and 648, from a sharp impact caused by the sudden advancement of the piston 560.

      A first chamber 702 is generally defined by the right-hand end of the plunger 678, a viewing FIG. 20, and the wall of the closed end of the bore 676 of the housing 674.

      The first chamber 702 is in fluid communication of a high pressure source, such as the conduit 110 of the brake system 10 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      A second chamber 704 is generally defined by wall of the bore 676, the plunger 678, and the end plug 682.
      <br/>
      The second chamber 704 is in fluid communication with a fluid chamber of a pedal travel simulator, such as the chamber 130 of the pedal travel simulator 118 of the brake system 10 of FIG. 1, via a conduit 705.
      <br/>
      A third chamber 706 is generally defined by the wall of the bore 676 of the housing 674, the bore 684 of the end plug 682, and walls of radial passageways 708 formed in the end plug 682.
      <br/>
      The third chamber 706 is in fluid communication with a conduit 708, such the conduit 136 to the master cylinder 12 of the brake system 10 of FIG. 1.

    <p num="103">
      The operation of the pedal travel simulator valve 670 will now be described in cooperation with the brake system 10 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The valve 670 as illustrated in FIG. 12, is in a position corresponding to the position 140a of the pedal travel simulator valve 140 of the brake system 10.
      <br/>
      At this position, the ball 696 is seated on the valve seat 686.
      <br/>
      As fluid enters the first chamber 702 via the conduit 110 from the fluid pressure generator circuit 22, the plunger 678 is advanced leftward, as viewing FIG. 12. Continued movement of the plunger 678 causes the pin 680 to lift the ball 696 from the from the valve seat 686, thereby allowing fluid to flow between the second and third chambers 704 and 706 via the slots 689 and the passageways 708.
      <br/>
      The valve 670 is then in a position corresponding to the position 140b of the pedal travel simulator valve 140.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      Note that fluid can flow in a direction from the second chamber 704 to the third chamber 706 if the pressure within the second chamber 704 is sufficient to lift the ball 696 from the valve seat 686 against the force of the spring 698.
      <br/>
      This arrangement corresponds to the check valve 142 schematically illustrated in the pedal travel simulator valve 140.

      There is illustrated in FIG. 13 an alternate embodiment of a compliance accumulator, indicated generally at 710, which can be used for example, as the compliance accumulator 148 of the brake system 10 illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The compliance accumulator 710 includes a cup shaped housing 712 having a bore 714 formed therein.
      <br/>
      An end plug 716 is fastened to the housing 712 to close off the bore 714.
      <br/>
      The end plug 716 has a bore 718 and a passageway 720 formed therein.
      <br/>
      A piston 722 is slidably disposed within the bore 718 of the end plug 716.
      <br/>
      The piston 722 has a bore 724 formed therein which ends into a conical shaped surface 726.
      <br/>
      The compliance accumulator 710 further includes a cylindrical pin 728 preferably having rounded ends 730 and 732.
      <br/>
      The pin 728 is disposed within the bore 724 of the piston 722.
      <br/>
      The end 730 of the pin 728 contacts the conical surface 726 of the piston 722.
      <br/>
      The end 732 of the pin 728 contacts a conical surface 734 of a spring retainer 736.
      <br/>
      A spring 738 biases the spring retainer 736, the pin 728, and the piston 722 downward, as viewing FIG. 13. The rounded ends 730 and 732 of the pin 728 cooperate with the conical surfaces 726 and 734 to help reduce radial misalignment forces of the piston 722 within the bore 718.
      <br/>
      A fluid chamber 740 is generally defined by wall of the bore 718 of the end plug 716 and the piston 722.
      <br/>
      The fluid chamber 740 is in fluid communication with the passageway 720.
      <br/>
      An air chamber 742 is generally defined by the closed end of the bore 714 of the housing 712, the end plug 716, and the piston 722.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the air chamber 742 is vented to atmosphere, such as by an elastomeric cover 744 fitted over a port 746 formed in the housing 712.

      The operation of the compliance accumulator 710 will now be described in cooperation with the brake system 10 of FIG. 1.

      The force of the spring 738 is transmitted to the piston 722 via the spring retainer 736 and the pin 728 to pressurize fluid which is in the fluid chamber 740.
      <br/>
      Typically, pressurized fluid is stored in the fluid chamber 740 to provide relatively instantaneous flow to the supply conduit 24 until the boost valve 116 can respond with sufficient flow to the supply conduit 24.

    <p num="107">
      There is illustrated in FIG. 14 an alternate embodiment of a fluid separator assembly, indicated generally at 750, which can be used for example, as the fluid separator assemblies 36 and 58 of the brake system 10 illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The fluid separator assembly 750 includes a housing 752 having a bore 754 formed therein.
      <br/>
      A piston 756 is slidably disposed therein, and sealingly engaged with the wall of the bore 754 by a pair of lip seals 758 and 760.
      <br/>
      The piston 756 is biased in a direction towards the closed end of the bore 754 by a spring 762 retained by a plug 764 attached to the housing 752.
      <br/>
      The housing 752 has first, second, and third conduits 766, 768, and 770 formed therein which are in fluid communication with the bore 754.
      <br/>
      The conduits 766, 768, and 770 correspond to the conduits 54, 52, and 34, respectively, for the fluid separator assembly 36 of the brake system 10 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      An annular space 772 is generally defined between the seals 758 and 760 and is in fluid communication with the conduit 768 which is preferably in fluid communication with a fluid reservoir.
      <br/>
      The conduit 768 provides means for sensing a fluid leak across one or both of the seals 758 and 760 if a sensor (not shown) is used to detect an abnormal pressure reading.
      <br/>
      For example, if the seal 758 were to fail, the driver may experience a reduction in the deceleration of the vehicle due to the associated wheel brake losing pressurized fluid while in a boosted braking operation or might experience a pedal drop during an unboosted braking operation.
      <br/>
      In another example, if the seal 760 were to fail, the motor and pump might be abnormally actuated to compensate for the loss in fluid pressure from the associated wheel brake.
      <br/>
      A sensor and indicator may be used to warn the driver of the condition.

    <p num="108">
      Referring now to FIG. 15, there is illustrated a second embodiment of a brake system, indicated generally at 800.
      <br/>
      The brake system 800 is similar to the brake system 10 of FIG. 1, and similar components used in both brake systems 10 and 800 will have similar reference numerals and only the differences or additional components shall be described.
      <br/>
      The brake system 800 is preferably used as a vertical split system, such that the master cylinder 12 is a tandem master cylinder which pressurizes fluid into two conduits 802 and 804.
      <br/>
      The conduit 802 is selectively in fluid communication with the wheel brakes 90 and 92, and the conduit 804 is selectively in fluid communication with the wheel brakes 26 and 30.
      <br/>
      For example, the wheel brakes 26 and 30 can be front wheel brakes, while the wheel brakes 90 and 92 can be the rear wheel brakes.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      One of the differences between the brake systems 10 and 800 is that the brake system 800 has a pedal travel simulator 806 which is of a single piston design.
      <br/>
      Note also that the brake system 800 has a single pedal travel simulator valve 808 in fluid communication between the conduit 802 and the pedal travel simulator 806.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      Another difference between the brake systems 10 and 800 is that the brake system 800 has a shuttle valve 810 in fluid communication with the supply conduit 24 from the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 and a conduit 812 generally in fluid communication with the wheel brakes 90 and 92.
      <br/>
      The shuttle valve 810 includes a bore 814 having a piston 816 slidably disposed therein.
      <br/>
      The piston 816 divides the bore 814 into first and second chambers 818 and 820.
      <br/>
      The piston 816 is biased rightward, as viewing FIG. 15, by a spring 822.
      <br/>
      A spring biased pin 824 is slidably disposed with a bore 826 formed in the piston 816.
      <br/>
      The pin 824 has an end 828 which cooperates with a valve seat 830 to close off fluid communication between the supply conduit 24 and the conduit 812 when the end 828 of the pin 824 is seated against the valve seat 830.
      <br/>
      The first chamber 818 is in fluid communication with the conduit 802.
      <br/>
      The second chamber 820 is generally always in fluid communication with the conduit 812.
      <br/>
      The second chamber 820 is in fluid communication with the supply conduit 24 when the pin 824 is unseated from the valve seat 830.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      The operation of the shuttle valve 810 shall now be discussed.
      <br/>
      When the master cylinder 12 is actuated, pressurized fluid is sent to the conduit 802.
      <br/>
      During boosted braking, the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 pressurizes the fluid within the supply conduit 24 at a pressure which is normally higher than pressure within the conduit 802.
      <br/>
      Thus, the fluid within the second chamber 820 is at a higher pressure than the fluid within the first chamber 818.
      <br/>
      This pressure difference moves the piston 816 rightward, as shown in FIG. 15. When the piston 816 is in this position, the end 828 of the pin 824 is lifted from the valve seat 830, thereby permitting fluid to flow from the supply conduit 24 to flow into the conduit 812 to energize the wheel brakes 90 and 92.
      <br/>
      In case the pressure of the fluid within the supply conduit 24 falls below a predetermined amount below the pressure within the conduit 802, such as for example, during failure of the boost valve 116, the piston 816 moves leftward by the expansion of the first chamber 818.
      <br/>
      The movement of the piston 816 causes the end 828 of the pin 824 to seat against the valve seat 830, thereby closing off fluid communication between the supply conduit 24 and the conduit 812.
      <br/>
      The shuttle valve 810 then operates similarly to a fluid separator assembly with a manual push through from the master cylinder 12 to the wheel brakes 90 and 92.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      Another difference between the brake system 10 of FIG. 1 and the brake system 800 of FIG. 15 is the addition of a back-up fluid pressure generator circuit, indicated generally at 840.
      <br/>
      The back-up fluid pressure generator circuit 840 generally provides pressurized fluid to the wheel brakes 26 and 30 during certain failure conditions, as will be explained in detail below.
      <br/>
      The back-up fluid pressure generator circuit 840 includes a pump 842 which is driven by a motor 844.
      <br/>
      The pump 842 has an inlet 842a in fluid communication with the conduit 804, and an outlet 842b in fluid communication with the first and second base brake valves 28 and 32 via a conduit 846.
      <br/>
      The pump 842 operates to draw fluid from the reservoir 16 and supply the fluid at an increase pressure to the conduit 846.
      <br/>
      A normally open 2-position, 2-way pilot operated pressure regulator valve 848 regulates the flow of fluid between the master cylinder 12 and the first and second base brake valves 28 and 32.
      <br/>
      The pressure regulator valve 848 has a first open position 848a, and a second position 848b which allows fluid to flow in a direction from the master cylinder 12 to the first and second base brake valves 28 and 32 but not in the opposite direction.
      <br/>
      The pressure regulator valve 848 senses the pressure differential between the pressure within the conduit 804 and with the pressure within the conduit 846 and the return conduit 52.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the brake system 800 includes a pressure switch 850 (or pressure transducer) in fluid communication with the conduit 804 and the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      The pressure switch 850 senses the difference in pressure between the master cylinder 12 via the conduit 804 and the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 via the supply conduit 24.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      If the pressure from the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 falls below a predetermined ratio value compared to the pressure generated by the master cylinder 12, the back-up fluid pressure generator circuit 840 may be actuated to provide pressurized fluid to the wheel brakes 26 and 30.
      <br/>
      Thus, the brake system 800 is especially suited for relatively heavy vehicles, such as medium or heavy duty vehicles, which could require relatively large pedal forces to decelerate the vehicle in case of a failure of the fluid pressure generator circuit 22.
      <br/>
      The pressure switch 850 senses the difference in pressure generated from the master cylinder 12 and the pressure generated by the fluid pressure generator circuit 22.
      <br/>
      If the pressure from the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 falls below the predetermined ratio value, the ECU 23 actuates the motor 844 of the pump 842, thereby supplying pressurized fluid to the conduit 846.
      <br/>
      The pressurized fluid within the conduit 846 causes the first and second base brake valves 28 and 32 to shuttle to their open positions, as illustrated in FIG. 15, thereby supplying pressurized fluid to the wheel brakes 26 and 30.
      <br/>
      Note that the fluid pressure from the outlet 842a of the pump 842 will typically be greater than the fluid pressure generated by the master cylinder 12, thereby causing the pressure regulator valve 848 to shuttle to its position 848b.
      <br/>
      When the pressure within the conduit 846 from the pump 842 reaches a predetermined boost ratio in relation to the pressure generated from the master cylinder 12, the pressure regulator valve 848 shuttles to its open position, as illustrated in FIG. 15, to create a return loop path for the pump 842.
      <br/>
      The pressure regulator valve 848 will preferably shuttle between the positions 848a and 848b to maintain the pressure within the conduit 848 at a pressure level approximately equal to the pressure from the master cylinder 12 multiplied by the predetermined boost ratio.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      Yet another difference between the brake system 10 of FIG. 1 and the brake system 800 of FIG. 15 is a compliance accumulator 854 which functions similarly to the compliance accumulator 148 of the brake system 10 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Unlike the brake system 10, however, the compliance accumulator 854 is not in fluid communication with the supply conduit 24 at a location between the boost valve 116 and the override isolation valve 154, but rather is in fluid communication with the conduit 24 downstream from the override isolation valve 154, as shown in FIG. 15. When the compliance accumulator 854 is located in the position as shown in FIG. 15, the override dump valve 156 can be configured with a relatively small orifice within a valve seat arrangement (not shown).
      <br/>
      Generally, the smaller the orifice, the less force it takes to close a valve seat.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the size of the solenoid for the dump valve 156 can be smaller and, therefore, generally less expensive.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      Referring now to FIG. 16, there is illustrated a third embodiment of a brake system, indicated generally at 860, in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The brake system 860 is similar to the brake system 10 of FIG. 1, and similar components used in both brake systems 10 and 860 will have similar reference numerals and only the differences or additional components shall be described.
      <br/>
      The brake system 860 has pressure transducers 862 and 864 instead of pressure switches.
      <br/>
      Pressure transducers provide for a more detailed monitoring of the brake system 860, such as for regulating the brake system 860 during a VSC brake operation, as described above with respect to the brake system 10 of FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      The brake system 860 preferably has a tandem master cylinder 12 which pressurizes fluid into a pair of conduits 866 and 868.
      <br/>
      The conduit 866 is selectively in fluid communication with the wheel brakes 90 and 92.
      <br/>
      The conduit 868 is selectively in fluid communication with the wheel brakes 24 and 30.
      <br/>
      The brake system 860 can be configured, for example, so that the wheel brakes 24 and 30 are associated with the front wheel brakes, while the wheel brakes 90 and 92 are associated with the rear wheel brakes.
      <br/>
      Note that the brake system 860 includes a single isolation valve 870 and a single dump valve 872 for simultaneously regulating the pressure for the wheels brakes 90 and 92, which can be associated with the rear wheels, for example.
      <br/>
      The isolation valve 870 functions similarly as the third and fourth isolation valves 94 and 96 of the brake system 10 of FIG. 1 as described above.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the dump valve 872 functions similarly as the third and fourth dump valves 98 and 102 of the brake system 10 of FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      A difference between the brake system 800 illustrated in FIG. 15 and the brake system 860 illustrated in FIG. 16 is that the brake system 860 includes an alternate embodiment of a shuttle valve 874 in place of the shuttle valve 810 of the brake system 800.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 16, the shuttle valve 874 schematically includes a single ball 876 movable between a pair of valve seats 878 and 880.
      <br/>
      Generally, the shuttle valve 874 performs the same function as the shuttle valve 810 of the brake system 800.
      <br/>
      When the brake system 860 is operating under a boosted braking condition, the ball 876 seats on the valve seat 878, thereby restricting the flow of fluid between the master cylinder 12 and the wheel brakes 90 and 92, but permitting the flow of fluid between the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 and the wheel brakes 90 and 92 via the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      When the pressure from the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 falls below a predetermined amount of pressure, such as during failure of the boost valve 116, the ball 668 seats on the valve seat 880 to restrict the flow of fluid from the boost system to the wheel brakes 90 and 92, while permitting the flow of fluid from the master cylinder 12 to the wheel brakes 90 and 92.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      There is illustrated in FIG. 17 an alternate embodiment of a shuttle valve, indicated generally at 900, which can be used for example, as the shuttle valve 874 of the brake system 860 illustrated in FIG. 16. The shuttle valve 900 includes a housing 902 having a bore 904 formed therein.
      <br/>
      A main body 906 is disposed in the bore 904 of the housing 902.
      <br/>
      The body 906 is retained in the bore 904 by the cooperation of a retaining ring 908 and a wave spring 910.
      <br/>
      The body 906 has a stepped axial bore 912 formed therein.
      <br/>
      A pair of radial passageways 914 and 916 are formed through the body 906 and are in fluid communication with the bore 912.
      <br/>
      Preferably, press fit into the bore 912 is a block 918 having a restrictive orifice 920 formed therein.
      <br/>
      A ball 922 is movably disposed in a first portion 924 of the bore 912 of the body 906.
      <br/>
      A pair of valve seats 926 and 928 are formed in the body 906 adjacent the ends of the first portion 924.
      <br/>
      The diameter of the first portion 924 of the bore 912 is preferably slightly larger than the diameter of the ball 922.
      <br/>
      Thus, the ball 922 can travel through the first portion 924 of the bore 912 between the valve seats 926 and 928.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the shuttle valve 900 is oriented so that the weight of the ball 922 biases the ball 922 downward against the valve seat 928, as illustrated in FIG. 17.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      The operation of the shuttle valve 900 will now be described in cooperation with the brake system 860 of FIG. 16. The housing 902 has first, second, and third conduits 930, 932, and 934 formed therein which are in fluid communication with the bore 904.
      <br/>
      The first conduit 930 is in fluid communication with the closed end of the bore 904 and the master cylinder 12.
      <br/>
      The second conduit 932 is in fluid communication with the wheel brakes 90 and 92.
      <br/>
      The third conduit 934 is in fluid communication with the supply conduit 24 from the boost valve 116.
      <br/>
      When the brake system 860 is not operating under a boosted braking condition, the ball 922 seats on the valve seat 928, thereby permitting the flow of fluid from the first conduit 930 (master cylinder 12) to the second conduit 932 (wheel brakes 90 and 92).
      <br/>
      When the brake system 860 is operating under normal boosted braking condition, the fluid flow and the pressure from the third conduit 934 (boost valve 116) cause the ball 922 to rise upward against the valve seat 926.
      <br/>
      Fluid is then free to flow from the third conduit 934 to the second conduit 932.
      <br/>
      However, when the pressure from the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 or boost valve 116 falls below the pressure generated by the master cylinder 12, such as during failure of the boost valve 116, the ball 922 seats on the valve seat 928 to permit the flow of fluid from the first conduit 930 (master cylinder 12) to the second conduit 932 (wheel brakes 90 and 92).

    <p num="120">
      Under certain circumstances, it may be desirable to provide improved and refined pressure regulation during braking operations, such as TC and VSC braking operations.
      <br/>
      The brake systems of the present invention, such as the brake system 10 of FIG. 1, can include an override isolation valve, such as the override isolation valve 154 of the brake system 10, having a proportionally controlled solenoid.
      <br/>
      Likewise, an override dump valve, such as the override dump valve 156 of the brake system 10, having a proportionally controlled solenoid.
      <br/>
      Besides providing improved and refined pressure regulation, the proportionally controlled valves can provide gradual and even braking pressure to the wheel brakes of the brake system instead of pulsing or cyclically applying braking pressure.
      <br/>
      This gradual and even braking pressure may be suited for other types of brake operations, such as autonomous cruise control braking.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the brake system has pressure transducers in place of pressure switches.

      Referring now to FIG. 18, there is illustrated a fourth embodiment of a brake system, indicated generally at 940, in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The brake system 940 is similar to the brake system 10 of FIG. 1, and similar components used in both brake systems 10 and 940 will have similar reference numerals and only the differences or additional components shall be described.
      <br/>
      The brake system 940 includes a valve 942 and a proportionally controlled valve 944, the combination of which can replace a single proportionally controlled dump valve 156 of the brake system 10.
      <br/>
      Due to the structure of fluid valves, it may be more economical to use the pair of valves 942 and 944 rather than the single proportionally controlled valve.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the brake system 940 may include an isolation valve 946 and a proportionally controlled isolation valve 948, the combination of which can replace a single normally open proportionally controlled override isolation valve 154 of the brake system 10, such as for example, economical reasons due to the structure of the various valves.
      <br/>
      Generally, a single proportionally controlled override isolation valve 154 will need a larger orifice, and therefore a larger solenoid, compared to the isolation valve 948 to operate properly.

      Referring now to FIG. 19, there is illustrated a fifth embodiment of a brake system, indicated generally at 950, in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The brake system 950 is similar to the brake system 10 of FIG. 1, and similar components used in both brake systems 10 and 950 will have similar reference numerals and only the differences or additional components shall be described.
      <br/>
      In the brake system 10, the first and second pedal travel simulator valves 140 and 144 provide for manual push through to the wheel brakes 26 and 30 during circumstances such as during a failure of the boost valve 116, a failure of the fluid pressure generator circuit 22, or loss of power to the brake system 10, such as when the ignition system is turned off.
      <br/>
      The master cylinder 12 is preferably sized to provide adequate braking during these circumstances and accounting for fluid volume displaced by the pedal travel simulator 118.
      <br/>
      Contrary, the brake system 950 does not include a pedal travel simulator valve, but rather the brake system 950 is designed to provide power to the motor 106 of the pump 104 even when an ignition switch 952 of the vehicle is turned off.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the brake system 950 includes a separate low cost, low speed, low current draw microprocessor 954 for monitoring the state of the ignition switch 952, the brake switch 27, and the pressure switch 113.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the microprocessor 954 is powered up at all times, even when the ignition switch 952 is turned off.
      <br/>
      The microprocessor 954 can be configured to actuate the motor 106 when the pressure switch 113 indicates that the pressure within the conduit 110 falls below a predetermined pressure level, when the ignition switch 952 is off, and when the brake switch 27 is triggered indicating that the driver is depressing the brake pedal 14.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      Preferably, the brake system 950 includes a pressure transducer 956 in fluid communication with the conduit 20 to monitor the pressure in the conduit 20 to detect if the master cylinder 12 is properly providing pressure to the conduit 20, during brake apply.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the boost valve 116 of the brake system 950 is a poppet valve which can function as a high pressure by-pass, thus eliminating the need for a pressure relief valve, such as the pressure relief valve 114 of the brake system 10.
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      The brake system 950 of FIG. 19 may further include a back-up fluid pressure generator circuit, indicated generally at 958.
      <br/>
      The back-up fluid pressure generator circuit 958 is similar in function to the back-up fluid pressure generator circuit 840 of the brake system 800 of FIG. 15. The back-up fluid pressure generator circuit 958 generally provides pressurized fluid to the wheel brakes 26 and 30 during certain failure conditions.
      <br/>
      The back-up fluid pressure generator circuit 958 includes a pump 960 which is driven by a motor 962.
      <br/>
      The pump 960 has an inlet 960a in fluid communication with the reservoir 16, and an outlet 960b in fluid communication with the first and second base brake valves 28 and 32 via a conduit 964.
      <br/>
      The pump 960 operates to draw fluid from the reservoir 16 and supply the fluid at an increased pressure to the conduit 964.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the back-up fluid pressure generator circuit 958 includes a pressure switch 966 (or a pressure transducer) in fluid communication with the supply conduit 24.
      <br/>
      If the pressure from the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 falls below a predetermined ratio value compared to the pressure generated by the master cylinder 12, the back-up fluid pressure generator circuit 958 may be actuated to provide pressurized fluid to the wheel brakes 26 and 30.
      <br/>
      Thus, the brake system 950 is especially suited for relatively heavy vehicles, such as medium or heavy duty vehicles, which could require relatively large pedal forces to decelerate the vehicle in case of a failure of the fluid pressure generator circuit 22.
      <br/>
      If the pressure from the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 falls below the predetermined ratio value, as sensed by the pressure switch 966, the ECU 23 actuates the motor 962 of the pump 960, thereby supplying pressurized fluid to the conduit 964.
      <br/>
      The pressurized fluid within the conduit 964 causes the first and second base brake valves 28 and 32 to shuttle to their open positions, as illustrated in FIG. 19, thereby supplying pressurized fluid to the wheel brakes 26 and 30.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      Preferably, the back-up fluid pressure generator circuit 958 includes an orifice 968 in the conduit 964.
      <br/>
      The orifice 968 provides a means for self-testing the operation of the pump 960 and the motor 962.
      <br/>
      For example, preferably when the brake pedal 14 is not depressed, the ECU 23 can actuate the motor 962 for the pump 960 and monitor the pressure within the conduit 964 via the pressure transducer 956 to detect a pressure drop across the orifice 968.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      It may be desirable to configure the brake system 950 (or any other brake system embodiments in accordance with the present invention) so that the fluid communication between the master cylinder 12 and the brake circuits 18 and 20 are reversed.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown in FIG. 19, the conduit 18 is in fluid communication with a primary chamber 12a of the master cylinder 12, and the conduit 20 is in fluid communication with a secondary chamber 12b of the master cylinder 12.
      <br/>
      It may be desirable to have the conduit 20 be in fluid communication with the primary chamber 12a, and the conduit 18 to be in fluid communication with the secondary chamber 12b.
      <br/>
      The reversal of the conduits 18 and 20 may be desirable certain for failure conditions of various components of the brake system 950.

    <p num="127">
      Referring now to FIG. 20, there is illustrated a sixth embodiment of a brake system, indicated generally at 970, in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The brake system 970 is similar to the brake system 10 of FIG. 1 and the brake system 950 of FIG. 19, and similar components used in the brake systems 10, 950, and 970 will have similar reference numerals and only the differences or additional components shall be described.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the brake system 970 is configured such that the wheel brake 26 is associated with the left front wheel of the vehicle, the wheel brake 30 is associated with the right front wheel, the wheel brake 90 is associated with the left rear wheel, and the wheel brake 92 is associated with the right rear wheel.
      <br/>
      The brake system 970 includes a first override dump valve 972 and a first override isolation valve 974 for regulating the flow of pressurized fluid from the conduit 110 of the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 to the wheel brakes 26 and 30, such as for example, during a TC or VSC brake operation.
      <br/>
      The brake system 970 further includes a second override dump valve 976 and a second override isolation valve 978 for regulating the flow of pressurized fluid from the conduit 110 of the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 to the wheel brakes 90 and 92, such as for example, during a TC or VSC brake operation.
      <br/>
      Note that the supply conduit 24 branches off into a first supply conduit 24a for supplying fluid to the wheel brakes 26 and 30, and a second supply conduit 24b for supplying fluid to the wheel brakes 90 and 92.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      By providing two pairs of override dump and isolation valves, the brake system 970 can subject one of the pairs of wheel brakes to the high pressure in the conduit 110 by actuating the associated override dump and isolation valves, while the other pair of wheel brakes can simultaneously be controlled by the boost valve 116.
      <br/>
      Contrary, during a VSC brake operation of the brake system 10 of FIG. 1, the wheel brakes not associated with VSC operation are isolated from the boost valve 116 by their respective isolation valves 76, 78, 94, or 96.
      <br/>
      For example, referring to the brake system 970 illustrated in FIG. 20, if slippage of the wheel corresponding to the first wheel brake 26 is detected, the first override dump valve 972 is actuated to an open position 972a to allow fluid from the conduit 110 to enter the first supply conduit 24a.
      <br/>
      Also, the first override isolation valve 974 is actuated to a one-way position to prevent the flow of fluid from entering the boost valve 116 via the first supply conduit 24a.
      <br/>
      The second override dump and isolation valves 976 and 978 are actuated (or remain in their current positions) as shown in FIG. 20, thereby providing a fluid path from the boost valve 116 to the wheel brakes 90 and 92, such as during normal boosted braking.
      <br/>
      The isolation valve 78 is actuated to its one-way closed position 78b, thereby blocking fluid communication from the first supply conduit 24 to the wheel brake 30.
      <br/>
      The isolation valve 76 and the dump valve 80 can then be pulsed from the one-way position 76b to the open position 76a as needed.

      Referring now to FIG. 21, there is illustrated a seventh embodiment of a brake system, indicated generally at 980, in accordance with the present invention.

      The brake system 980 is similar to the brake system 10 of FIG. 1 and the brake system 970 of FIG. 20, and similar components used in the brake systems 10, 970, and 980 will have similar reference numerals and only the differences or additional components shall be described.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the brake system 980 is configured such that the wheel brake 26 is associated with the left front wheel of the vehicle, the wheel brake 30 is associated with the right front wheel, the wheel brake 90 is associated with the right rear wheel, and the wheel brake 92 is associated with the left rear wheel.
      <br/>
      The brake system 980 includes a first override dump valve 982 and a first override isolation valve 984 for regulating the flow of pressurized fluid from the conduit 110 of the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 to the wheel brakes 26 and 90, such as for example, during a TC or VSC brake operation.
      <br/>
      The brake system 980 further includes a second override dump valve 986 and a second override isolation valve 988 for regulating the flow of pressurized fluid from the conduit 110 of the fluid pressure generator circuit 22 to the wheel brakes 30 and 92, such as for example, during a TC or VSC brake operation.
      <br/>
      Note that the supply conduit 24 branches off into a first supply conduit 24a for supplying fluid to the wheel brakes 26 and 90, and a second supply conduit 24b for supplying fluid to the wheel brakes 30 and 92.

    <p num="130">
      The brake system 980 is similar to the brake system 970 of FIG. 20 in that the brake system 980 provides two pairs of override dump and isolation valves for subjecting one of the pairs of wheel brakes to the high pressure in the conduit 110 by actuating the associated override dump and isolation valves, while the other pair of wheel brakes can simultaneously be controlled by the boost valve 116.
      <br/>
      However, the brake system 980 is preferably configured so that the wheel brakes 26 and 90 are grouped together, while the wheel brakes 30 and 92 are grouped together.

      Referring now to FIG. 22, there is illustrated an eighth embodiment of a brake system, indicated generally at 990, in accordance with the present invention.

      The brake system 990 is similar to the brake system 10 of FIG. 1 and the brake system 980 of FIG. 21, and similar components used in the brake systems 10, 980, and 990 will have similar reference numerals and only the differences or additional components shall be described.

      Preferably, the brake system 990 is configured such that the wheel brake 26 is associated with the left front wheel of the vehicle, the wheel brake 30 is associated with the right front wheel, the wheel brake 90 is associated with the right rear wheel, and the wheel brake 92 is associated with the left rear wheel.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      The brake system 990 includes a secondary source of pressurized fluid or a secondary fluid supply circuit, indicated generally at 992, for providing a relatively large volume of fluid to be used during various failure conditions of the brake system 990.
      <br/>
      The secondary fluid supply circuit 992 includes an intensifier, indicated generally at 994.
      <br/>
      The intensifier 994 includes a stepped piston 996 having a small diameter portion 996a and a large diameter portion 996b.
      <br/>
      The piston 996 is slidably disposed in a stepped bore 998 formed in a housing 1000.
      <br/>
      The small diameter portion 996a sealingly engages a wall of a small diameter portion 998a of the bore 998 by a first seal 1002.
      <br/>
      The large diameter portion 996b sealingly engages a wall of a large diameter portion 998b of the bore 998 by a second seal 1004.
      <br/>
      The intensifier 994 has a first chamber 1006 which is generally defined by the small diameter portion 998a of the bore 998, the first seal 1002, and the small diameter portion 996a of the piston 996.
      <br/>
      A second chamber 1008 is generally defined by the large diameter portion 998b of the bore 998, the second seal 1004, and the large diameter portion 996b of the piston 996.
      <br/>
      An intermediate chamber 1010 is generally defined by the bore 998, the piston 996, and the first and second seals 1002 and 1004.
      <br/>
      The piston 996 is biased toward the first chamber 1006 by a spring 1012 disposed in the second chamber 1008.
      <br/>
      A passageway 1014 is formed through the piston 996 and is in fluid communication with the intermediate chamber 1010 and the second chamber 1008.
      <br/>
      A check valve 1016 is located in the passageway 1014.
      <br/>
      The check valve 1016 may permit the flow of fluid in a direction from the intermediate chamber 1010 to the second chamber 1008, but restricts the flow of fluid in the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      The first chamber 1006 is selectively in fluid communication with the conduit 20 from the master cylinder 12 via a conduit 1018.
      <br/>
      The intermediate chamber 1010 is in fluid communication with the reservoir 16 via a conduit 1020.
      <br/>
      A check valve 1022 is located in the conduit 1020 which may allow fluid to flow in a direction from the reservoir 16 to the intermediate chamber 1010, but not in the opposite direction.
      <br/>
      The second chamber 1008 is in fluid communication with the conduit 20 via a conduit 1024.
      <br/>
      Located in the conduit 20 between the conduits 1018 and 1024 is a valve 1026.
      <br/>
      The valve 1026 is movable between a first open position 1026a and a second closed position 1026b.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the valve 1026 is a normally closed pilot operated, 2 position valve, the operation of which is regulated by the pressure differential between the conduit 20 and the conduit 1020.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the valve 1026 is configured such that the valve 1026 shuttles to its open position at a relatively high pressure level with the conduit 20.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      Under normal boosted braking conditions, the piston 996 of the intensifier generally does not move.
      <br/>
      The valve 1026 is shuttled to its open position due to the pressure differential between the conduit 1020 from the reservoir 16 and the conduit 20 from the master cylinder 12.
      <br/>
      The first and second base brake valves 28 and 32 are also shuttled to their closed positions 28b and 32b, respectively, thereby preventing the flow of fluid into the wheel brakes 26 and 30 directly from the conduit 20.
      <br/>
      However, upon a failure, such as a pressure drop in the conduit 18, the brake system 990 may provide for manual push through to the wheel brakes 26 and 30.
      <br/>
      For a vehicle installed with wheel brakes 26 and 30 having relatively large fluid displacement, the secondary fluid supply circuit 992 may provide a large volume of fluid for the wheel brakes 26 and 30 to compensate for a loss of fluid caused by failure in the conduit 18, such as a rupture in the conduit 18.
      <br/>
      For example, during a failed condition in which there is a loss of fluid from a rupture in the conduit 18 prior to a brake apply, the valve 1026 will typically shuttle (or remain) in its closed position 1026b during an initial brake apply.
      <br/>
      The first and second base brake valves 28 and 32 will shuttle to their open positions 28a and 32a, respectively, to permit the flow of fluid from the conduit 20 into the wheel brakes 26 and 30.
      <br/>
      The fluid from the conduit 20 will flow into the first chamber 1006 of the intensifier, causing the piston to advance towards the second chamber 1008.
      <br/>
      Movement of the piston 996 will cause the fluid from the second chamber 1008 to flow into the conduit 20 and into the wheel brakes 26 and 30.
      <br/>
      Due to the differences in the swept areas between the small diameter portion 996a and the large diameter portion 996b of the piston 996, the volume of fluid exiting the second chamber will be greater than the volume of fluid entering the first chamber 998a from the master cylinder 12.
      <br/>
      If the driver of the vehicle applies a relatively large force on the brake pedal 14, the pressure within the conduit 20 may cause the valve 1026 to shuttle to its open position 1026a, thereby allowing the pressurized fluid to enter the wheel brakes 26 and 30 via the conduit 20.
      <br/>
      In another example, if during a relatively hard brake apply operation such that the valve 1026 is shuttled to its open position 1026a and subsequently a rupture in the conduit 18 occurs, the valve 1026 may shuttle to its closed position 1026b due to a pressure drop across the orifice 1028.
      <br/>
      Fluid will then flow into the first chamber 1006 of the intensifier 994, as described above.
      <br/>
      The valve 1026 may then subsequently shuttle to its open position 1026a.
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      The check valves 1016 and 1022 permit the flow of fluid into the intermediate chamber 1010 and allow the piston 996 to retract, i.e., move in a direction towards the first chamber 1006, when the valve 1026 is in its open position 1026a.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the secondary fluid supply circuit 992 includes an orifice 1028 located in the conduit 20 which is sized accordingly with the first and second base brake valves 28 and 32 so that a sudden spike apply of the master cylinder 12 does not by-pass the secondary fluid supply circuit 992.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the secondary fluid supply circuit 992 includes a check valve 1030 in a parallel fluid communication with the conduit 20 across the valve 1026.
      <br/>
      The check valve 1030 permits the flow of fluid in a direction from the wheel brakes 26 and 30 to the master cylinder, such as during a brake release wherein the piston 996 is fully retracted into the first chamber 1006.

      Referring now to FIG. 23, there is illustrated a ninth embodiment of a brake system, indicated generally at 1040, in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The brake system 1040 is similar to the brake system 10 of FIG. 1 and the brake system 980 of FIG. 21, and similar components used in the brake systems 10, 980, and 990 will have similar reference numerals and only the differences or additional components shall be described.
      <br/>
      The brake system 1040 includes first, second, third, and fourth isolation valves 76, 78, 94, and 96, respectively, which are proportionally controlled.
      <br/>
      Proportional valves generally provide for improved and refined pressure regulation, compared to the pulsing of binary valves having only an open and a closed position.
      <br/>
      Due to the fact that the first, second, third, and fourth isolation valves 76, 78, 94, and 96, respectively, are proportionally controlled, the brake system 1040 does not have a compliance accumulator, such as the compliance accumulator 148 of the brake systems 10 and 980.
      <br/>
      As stated above, the compliance accumulator 148 can provide initial instantaneous flow to the supply conduit 24 until the boost valve 116 can respond with sufficient flow.
      <br/>
      For example, if the boost valve 116 is designed with an internal dampening system for a valve, such as a poppet valve, to help stabilize the valve, the proportional valve can be controlled to compensate for any lag caused by the internal dampening.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the brake system 1040 includes a pressure transducer 1042, as opposed to a pressure switch, in fluid communication with the high pressure accumulator 108 to provide better feedback for controlling the proportionally controlled valves 76, 78, 94, and 96.
      <br/>
      Also, the pressure transducer 1042 provides means for detecting whether or not the fluid in the conduit 20 is leaking.
      <br/>
      For example, if a fluid leak is present in the conduit 20, the pressure transducer 1042 in cooperation with the brake switch 27, will detect the pressure in the conduit 110 for determining that the motor 104 is actuated to compensate for a leak in the conduit 20, rather that to supply pressurized fluid during a brake apply.

    <p num="137">
      In certain circumstances it may be desirable to alter the pedal effort required by the operator of the above described brakes systems so that the boost ratio changes rather than remaining generally constant throughout the travel length of the brake pedal.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished by using a boost valve having a non-linear boost gain, wherein the boost ratio changes according to the travel length of the brake pedal or the force applied to the brake pedal.
      <br/>
      For example, it may be desirable to have low pedal effort and a relatively high boost gain at low decelerations, and a higher pedal effort and lower boost gain at higher decelerations.
      <br/>
      Having high boost gain at low decelerations, such as initial braking, can assist the force required to overcome the force of the pedal return springs (such as the springs 224, 226, and 258 of the brake system 10 of FIG. 1) and internal seal friction of the components of the brake system which occur during initial braking.
      <br/>
      However, having high boost gain at high decelerations may be overly sensitive.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      To illustrate the above example, there is shown in FIG. 24, a plot 1100 representing the pedal effort exerted by the operator of the brake system on the brake pedal as a function of the travel length of the brake pedal.
      <br/>
      Note that the relatively steep initial slope results from the preload of the springs and the internal seal friction of the master cylinder, the pedal travel simulator, and the boost valve of the brake system.
      <br/>
      A plot 1102 is an example of a desired boosted pressure curve having a nonlinear gain.
      <br/>
      A plot 1104 illustrates an example of a boosted pressure curve having a linear gain which has a desirable characteristic at lower pedal travels, but rapidly departs from the desired curve at higher pedal travel lengths.
      <br/>
      A plot 1106 illustrates another example of a boosted pressure curve having a linear gain which has a desirable characteristic at higher pedal travels, but not at lower pedal travels.
