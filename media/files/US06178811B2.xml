      A viscometer having a fluid volume-displacer or driver, such as a speaker membrane, and a pressure sensor or detector, such as a microphone membrane, forming the inside surfaces of a cavity that is sealed from the ambient environment of the viscometer except for a controlled leak such as a capillary tube.
      <br/>
      An electrical signal from the sensor or detector is processed to indicate viscosity of the fluid in the cavity.
      <br/>
      Additionally determined from the viscosity are heating value, oxygen demand and other thermophysical properties of the fluid.
      <br/>
      Also, absolute pressure is derived after viscosity is determined.

    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention pertains to viscosity detectors and particularly to delta-pressure-based sensors.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention pertains to viscosity sensors for determining the oxygen demand (for complete combustion) of a gaseous or liquid fuel for combustion purposes.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Existing and recently proposed quasi-static viscometers are either fluid (i.e., gas or liquid) density and pressure-dependent and costly (such as vibrating wire or quartz crystal-based viscometers).
      <br/>
      Other viscometers suffer from additional fluid property dependencies (e.g., those involving thermally-driven capillary flow), are prone to drift due to deteriorating and leaky valves (as in viscometers dependent on capillary flow driven by periodic refill from a source of pressurized gas, valve closure and decay observation), or depend on their orientation (as with the falling ball viscometer).
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The proposed sensor measures a known property of fluids, viscosity.
      <br/>
      When applied to a combustion control system, it enables feed-forward operation and sensing in the mild pre-combustion environment; it is low-cost because the property can be simply proportional to the measured signal (in one preferred measurement approach) and it relates also simply to Wobbe number, oxygen demand or heating value of the fuel, so that the sensing error makes a relatively small contribution to the total combustion control error.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      This invention involves the use or application of a known property, viscosity, to combustion control.
      <br/>
      It is also about using a preferred approach to viscosity measurement to that application.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Viscosity,  ETA , may be known best for its linear relation to laminar volumetric flow (dV/dt) and pressure drop,  DELTA p, in a capillary (of radius, rc, and length, Lc), as shown in equation (1).
      <br/>
      dV/dt= PI  DELTA prc4 /(8Lc ETA )  (1)
    </p>
    <p num="6">One first notes the potential of viscosity as an individual property for combustion control when searching for low-cost means to compensate for variabilities in natural gas composition, and for a way to determine heating value without combustion, which includes analytical determination via correlations involving k(T1), k(T2) and  ETA , i.e., in conjunction with other properties.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Here, the viscosity of the fuel, and, previously, the stack O2 concentration were for indicating predicted or actual changes in the fuel's oxygen demand, DO2.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows graphically a comparison between  ETA , curve 23, and other fuel gas thermophysical (Qi) properties, i.e.,  RHO , density, curve 26; k, thermal conductivity, curve 24; cp, specific heat curve 25; and Cv, thermal anemometer correction factor, curve 27; and how well they correlate individually with oxygen demand of fuel, DO2.  ETA  exhibits a most advantageous, monotonic decrease as DO2 increases, although cp appears promising as well.
      <br/>
      The cp value of noncombustible CO2 (8.83 cal/(mol * K); 8.60 for H2 O) lies between that of CH4 and C2 H6 (8.50 and 12.42), but all  ETA -values of noncombustible gases O2, N2, CO2 (except H2 O) lie above that of CH4.

      By including two or more fuel properties into a correlation with heating value or DO2, the achievable accuracy increases significantly (note cited art below), but at the penalty of significant cost increases as well, because of the need for digital processing for determination of cp.
      <br/>
      The above is based on the assumption that control of emissions and efficiency are prime goals of any combustion control; this is most closely achieved by operating under constant stack-O2 or excess air, which in turn is met by maintaining a constant air flow and adjusting fuel flow in response to its composition variations, which change DO2 and m*. Half of its density variation is taken care of by the factor m*, as it affects all orifice- or venturi-controlled flow control situations.
      <br/>
      The aim of adjusting fuel flow to counter variabilities in Wb, Wobb number, is similar but less correct (if one aims at conserving the A/F (air-to-fuel ratio) and emissions) and goes back to the definition of the Wobbe number, Wb= DELTA H/m*, with  DELTA H=heating value rather than O2 demand and m*=(Mgas /Mair)0.5. M is moles, Wb is closely aligned with Bn (Bonne number=DO2 /m*), as long as non-hydrocarbon fuel constituents such as H2 and CO are absent.
      <br/>
      A correlation of DO2 or Bn with viscosity may be determined with a formula DO2 =A+B ETA C or Bn=A'+B' ETA 0.5, respectively.
      <br/>
      A and B are correlation coefficients and C is a correlation exponent.
      <br/>
      A' and B' are similarly correlation coefficients.
      <br/>
      The correlation is like that of natural law.

      To illustrate the significance of the proposed, viscometer-based combustion control system, Table 1 compares some parameters relevant to the quality of a combustion control system based on thermal conductivity versus viscosity sensors.

      The latter parameter was included to quantify the merits of direct measurement of thermo-physical properties of the fuel+air mixtures; as shown, measurement of viscosity or thermal conductivity in a premixed fuel+air mixture makes the pressure, temperature and humidity effects much larger than the sought fuel property effects.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      The viscometer disclosed here does not rely on the availability of pressurized gas, a microsensor or on thermal drivers, and its output is independent of absolute pressure (to the extent that viscosity is).

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="15">
      A viscometer 10 of FIG. 2 makes use of a linear relationship between laminar volumetric flow (dV/dt) through a controlled leak, for which we shall choose at first a capillary 11, (of radius, rc, and length, Lc, of capillary tube 11) and viscosity,  ETA , for a pressure difference,  DELTA p. In FIG. 2, a diameter of capillary 11, 2rc, is shown for clarity of the drawing.
      <br/>
      The mathematical relationship of these parameters is shown in equation (2).
      <br/>
      dV/dt= PI  DELTA prc4 /(8Lc ETA )  (2)
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Instead of using a thermal source, a valve or a mechanical flow is used to induce a repeatable but time-dependent flow and enable the observation of a pressure drop (or rise),  DELTA p, time constant,  TAU , or phase lag,  DELTA .
      <br/>
      Viscometer 10 disclosed here is designed to induce a repeatable but time-independent flow to enable the observation of a steady  DELTA p when the rate of volumetric displacement by an actuator 12 and the actual leakage flow become equal for a few milliseconds (ms).
      <br/>
      This is sketched out and represented in FIGS. 3 and 4.
      <br/>
      The  DELTA p signals for three gases, Ar, N2 and C3 H8, are marked as curves 13, 14 and 15, respectively, and the volume change  DELTA Vc, in percent, of cavity 16, shown by saw-tooth curve 17, represents the volumetric change induced by actuator or driver 12.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      If it can be assumed that the displacement of a sufficiently strong actuator is independent of the type of gas, actuator 12 can be driven in a "saw tooth" mode and at constant frequency, f, and the above equation (1) indeed establishes itself; then all types of gases will eventually reach their own  DELTA p in the chamber, but at the same capillary 11 flow rate, thus enabling the determination of each fluid's viscosity via measurement of  DELTA p and use of equation (2).
      <br/>
      If one designs viscometer 10 to meet the first two above-noted assumptions, the remaining question is whether there will be enough time in one half-cycle to establish the above equality.
      <br/>
      If the capillary radius rc is too small, the  DELTA p(t) will also be a saw-tooth-like function (one may neglect adiabatic heating effects for small  DELTA Vc); but if capillary 11 is large enough, its flow and  DELTA p will only increase until dV/dt= DELTA Vc f/2, regardless of the viscosity of the gas in the viscometer 10, and then remain at that value until the end of the saw-tooth 17 period.
      <br/>
      The viscosity then results from equation (3).
      <br/>
      ETA = PI  DELTA prc4 /(4 DELTA Vc fLc)  (3)
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      This relationship is illustrated by the results of calculations with a numerical model in FIGS. 3 and 4, whereby for a given rc, Lc and f, the cavity volume would be incremented by a small amount corresponding to a time step,  DELTA z=0.1 ms, which would change the cavity pressure by an amount corresponding to PV=nRT, which in turn would start the flow through the capillary and remove some of the pressure change during  DELTA z, until a balance between dV/dt=dVc /dt= DELTA Vc f/2 and  DELTA p is reached.
      <br/>
      These figures show that: (1) steady  DELTA p values can be achieved towards the end of the saw-tooth periods; (2) the values of such steady  DELTA p periods are proportional to the viscosities of the indicated gases C3 H8, N2 and Ar (83, 178 and 224  MU P at 20 (degree)  C. and 1 atm, respectively); (3) the RV = DELTA Vc /Vc, rc and Lc values need to be and can be chosen to both achieve a steady  DELTA p period and laminar flow (Re&lt;2300) in the capillary, as indicated by the Reynolds Number, Re=2rv RHO / ETA , for the frequencies of 124 and. 324 Hz, and the lowest  ETA / RHO -gas, which was propane in FIGS. 3 and 4; the 324 Hz frequency was chosen to be away about equally from higher harmonics of 50 and 60 Hz; and (4) the time constants to reach the steady  DELTA p-period are longer for higher viscosity fluids and lower pressure gases.
      <br/>
      The time constant results are illustrated in FIG. 5.

      FIG. 3 is a graph of  DELTA p, pressure amplitude in cm water column (WC) versus z or time in ms.
      <br/>
      This graph shows an oscillatory volume 17 and  DELTA p of a leaky cavity 16 for three gases Ar, N2 and C3 H8, as represented by curves 13, 14 and 15, respectively.
      <br/>
      The oscillatory volume 17 of cavity 16 is the result of electrical input to actuator 12.
      <br/>
      The pressure sensor changes, as indicated by curves 13, 14 and 15, are detected by sensor 20.
      <br/>
      These plots were taken at 22 (degree)  C. and a pressure of 0.7 bar. The frequency, f, is 132 Hz.
      <br/>
      Rv is one percent.
      <br/>
      The pressure equilibration times to 63% of the final  DELTA p,  TAU , are 0.40, 0.23 and 0.153 ms for the three gases, respectively.
      <br/>
      The cavity volume at rest, Vco, is 0.15 cm3, and capillary length Lc and radius rc are at 0.3 cm and 0.17 cm, respectively.
      <br/>
      The maximum Reynolds number, Remax, is 752.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 4 is a graph of  DELTA p, pressure amplitude in cm WC versus time in ms, z. This graph shows an oscillatory volume 17 and  DELTA p of leaky cavity 16 for three gases Ar, N2 and C3 H8, as represented by curves 13, 14 and 15.
      <br/>
      These plots were taken at 22 (degree)  C. and a pressure of 0.7 bar. Frequency f is 323 Hz, which is about 2.447 times faster than f for FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Rv is 0.5%,  DELTA z is 0.05 ms and the linear excitation,  TAU , is 0.18 ms. Vco and Lc are the same as for FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The capillary radius, rc, is larger at 0.2 mm. The maximum Reynolds number is 785.
      <br/>
      Note that the amplitudes of corresponding curves 13, 14 and 15 are about half of those for the curves in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      However, the amplitude differences between curves 13, 14 and 15 appear to be more distinguishable in FIG. 4 than FIG. 3.

      FIG. 5 is a graph of  DELTA p, pressure amplitude in cm WC versus z, time in ms.

      This graph shows an oscillatory volume 17 and  DELTA p of leaky cavity 16 for N2 at three different absolute pressures, pa.
      <br/>
      Curve 14 is for N2 at 0.7 bar, curve 18 is for N2 at 1.0 bar and curve 19 is for N2 at 1.5 bar. This data was taken from device 10 at 22 (degree)  C. and a frequency of 122 Hz, and Rv is equal to 1%.
      <br/>
      Vco is 0.15 cm3, Lc is 0.3 cm, rc is 0.14 mm and Remax is at 846.
      <br/>
      These curves in FIG. 5 show that the  DELTA p-equilibria reached are independent of absolute pressure.
      <br/>
      But they also show that the time constants to reach equilibrium,  TAU , are pressure dependent: time constants of about 0.29, 0.23 and 0.194 ms were derived for the pressures of 0.7, 1.0 and 1.5 bar, respectively, which may also serve to determine absolute pressure after viscosity has been determined: pa TAU 2.apprxeq.constant.

    <p num="22">
      To implement viscometer 10, one needs to consider volumetric drivers 12, pressure sensors 20 and possible system limitations.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 6 and 7 show additional embodiments 21 and 22, respectively, featuring interfaces or coupling devices 28 and 29 that may be baffles or at least partial barriers between drivers 12 and sensors 20.
      <br/>
      Barrier 28 or 29 is for preventing transport from driver 12 to sensor or detector 20 any physical energy (i.e., mechanical, electrical, and/or thermal) which may hinder, delay or inhibit the transfer of  DELTA p information from driver 12 to detector 20.
      <br/>
      Baffle 28 or 29 may prevent such possible distortion or dilapidation by effecting diffusion, attenuation or other appropriately affecting function.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Viscometer 21 has a baffle 28 situated in cavity 16 between actuator 12 and sensor 20.
      <br/>
      Baffle or diffuser plate 28 has apertures or holes 32 so that driver 12 can affect sensor 20 via the tested gas and apertures 32.
      <br/>
      The gas enters cavity 16 via capillary 11.
      <br/>
      A front view of diffuser plate 28 is shown in FIG. 6a, taken along reference line A--A in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Referring, now, to FIGS. 7, 7a, and 7b, viscometer 22 has a baffle, bar or damping channel 29 situated in cavity 16 between actuator 12 and sensor 20.
      <br/>
      A passage or hole 30 provides for passage of the tested gas so that driver 12 can affect sensor 20, for viscosity determination of the gas.

      The controlled cavity leak is though capillary opening 11.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Actuators may be of several kinds.
      <br/>
      To generate constant rate of volumetric expansion or contraction, one can consider a bulk (piezoelectric) PZT expansion, PZT bimorph actuators as used in tweeters and electromagnetic speakers as drivers 12.
      <br/>
      Volumetric expansion of piezoelectric transducers is attractive because of the large forces involved, which would not be affected by changes in gas density, although the displacements would be very small.
      <br/>
      Both PZT expansion and PZT bimorph actuators would need to be temperature-compensated, which would not be required in the instance of electromagnetic speakers.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Measured center deflections were made of a bimorph actuator (PZT/brass lamination by Mallory Sonalert of Indianapolis, Ind., at $0.55/each at a 25-99 quantity) consisting of a 15 mm OD/0.11 mm-thick brass support+ a 10 mm OD/0.11 mm-thick PZT+9 mm OD/0.02 mm-thick Ag electrode film.
      <br/>
      Under the rated voltage of  &lt;= 25 V, the center deflection was about 0.8  MU m/VRMS.
      <br/>
      Center deflection measurements were also made of an electromagnetic speaker (BRT1209P-01, from Int'l.
      <br/>
      Components Co. of Melville, N.Y., at a price for a quantity of 25-99 at $0.60/each) and rated at a maximum input of 1-2 VDC and 10 mA maximum.
      <br/>
      The center displacement of this 50  MU m-thick speaker disc was found to be fairly linear with input voltage (see curve 31 of FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      The displacement amounted to about 7.5  MU m/volt from -6 to +6 VDC.
      <br/>
      This displacement per volt (V) is thus about 10 times greater than the one from a PZT bimorph.
      <br/>
      Support of the speaker membrane 33 merits some careful consideration (note membrane 33 of designs 10 and 21 of FIGS. 2 and 6, respectively).
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Referring to FIG. 6, if chamber or cavity 16 is sealed to eliminate leaks across speaker membrane 33, then the side opposite to its Vc side needs to be opened to an ambient/external fluid to avoid anomalous effects when the ambient pressure or temperature changes.
      <br/>
      If the volume on the membrane 33 side opposite of the cavity 16 side is not sealed leak-tight from cavity 16 (as in BRT1206P-01), then it competes with capillary 11 and/or the leak functions as an orifice.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Sensors may be of several kinds.
      <br/>
      Another function needed for viscometer 10 is the  DELTA p sensor 20 between ambient and Vc.
      <br/>
      Microphones may be the lowest-cost choice to meet that need.
      <br/>
      The ideal sensor 20 would be a rigid microphone, i.e., lack of influence on Vc via deformation, with a frequency-independent output.
      <br/>
      An electret microphone (by Panasonic of Secaucus, N.J., or Gentex of Carbondale, Pa., with a deformable membrane) was used in phase lag measurements.
      <br/>
      It provided an unamplified output of 200 mV for about 50-60 Hz pressure variations of  &lt;= 1.2 cm of WC. The noise level was at 2 mV, which is equivalent to (1.2/1000) (2/200) * 106 =12 ppm of pressure change in cavity 16, or 0.012 cm of H2 O.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      An electromagnetic speaker (BRT1209P-01 by Int'l.
      <br/>
      Components Co.), was tested as a sensor 20, back-to-back to a similar unit serving as a driver 12.
      <br/>
      However, their magnetic fields interfered, and thus shielding would be needed for good results.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      A MICRO SWITCH 24PC pressure sensor chip, from Honeywell Inc. of Freeport, Ill., mounted and sealed on a TO5 header (over a center hole to avoid any back-pressure build-up) served well as a sensor 20, in operation with one of the BRT1206P-01 speakers serving as an actuator 12.
      <br/>
      It was verified that the sensor 20 output followed the shape of the driver 12 excitation (sine, square or saw-tooth shape) with capillary 11 plugged.
      <br/>
      After unplugging the capillary, a balance between rate of cavity 16 volume change and capillary 11 flow was achieved, demonstrating the invention.
      <br/>
      During this dynamic balance, the established  DELTA p was representative of the fluid viscosity.
      <br/>
      The length to diameter ratio of the capillary 11 tube should be greater than four.
      <br/>
      The capillary 11 inlet should be smooth internally and at the edges to minimize turbulence.

      This viscosity sensor consisted of simply epoxying an available $0.60 driver 12 and $0.55 sensor 20 back-to-back, and being operated at 60 Hz.
      <br/>
      In summary, very low-cost, off-the-shelf components show that fabrication of the present viscometer 10, 21 or 22 can be very cost-effective.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Viscometer 10 may have several limitations.
      <br/>
      First, one possible limitation is head pressure due to flow reversal.
      <br/>
      As the frequency of a flow driver increases, the inertial pressure generated at each reciprocating flow reversal increases.
      <br/>
      In order to stay away from such effects, one may calculate the frequency at which the capillary 11 pressure drop,  DELTA pc, would equal the inertial pressure drop,  DELTA pi, as shown by equation (4).
      <br/>
      DELTA pc =( DELTA Vc f/2) * 8 ETA Lc /( PI rc4) and  DELTA pi =2 RHO v2 /2= PI ( DELTA Vc f/(2 RHO rc2))2  (4)
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      With the assumption that the steady volume flow in each direction,  DELTA V * f/2, generates an average velocity, v= DELTA Vc f/(2 PI rc2), and an inertial pressure pulse upon reversal of 2 RHO v2 /2, then for  DELTA pc = DELTA pi, one gets
      <br/>
      8 ETA Lc = RHO  DELTA Vc f/(2 PI ) and f=16 PI  ETA Lc /( RHO  DELTA Vc).  (5)
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      For  ETA =0.000178 g/(cm * s) or .nu.= ETA / RHO 0.153 cm2 /s for N2 at 20 (degree)  C. and 1 bar, Lc =1 cm and Vc =0.0001 cm3, one gets f=77 kHz.
      <br/>
      For most applications, one will therefore be able to neglect this effect because it is generally small at low frequencies and it only occurs at each flow reversal.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Second, the appearance of turbulence in a capillary 11 tube needs to be avoided.
      <br/>
      For the above example, with r=0.008 cm, one gets Re=2rc v/.nu.=1909 for N2 (but 6935 for propane).
      <br/>
      However, appropriately combined changes in rc,  DELTA Vc and f, provide a laminar range that is wide indeed.
      <br/>
      To minimize the onset of turbulence, the edges at the ends of capillary 11 should be made smooth.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Third, The stability of the actuator,  DELTA p, sensor and controlled leak (no plugging with time) are clearly critical to long-term, reliable service.
      <br/>
      The way to maintain stable displacement via circuitry, stable leak via a multiplicity of leaks in porous plate, and self-checking the sensor for proper operation and accuracy are recommended to overcome stability limitations.
    </p>
    <p num="36">The components of the quasi-static viscometer 10 and their costs, include a saw-tooth generator at $0.4, a speaker (10-15 mm diameter) at $0.22-0.25 (from DAI Ltd.), a microphone (6-10 mm diameter) at $0.22-0.25, a microphone amplifier and an analog-to-digital converter (A/D) for a digital output, at about $2.00, one or more 0.2-0.4 mm holes/capillaries of 3-6 mm in length, or equivalent controlled leaks made of porous materials, at $0.10, plus assembly, calibration and miscellaneous materials at about $3.00. Thus, the total cost of the sensor may be less than $6.00, so that its use and business potential is great.</p>
    <p num="37">
      Referring to FIG. 9, features of the invention involve the combination of capillary 11 flow (known to be proportional to viscosity) to or from a cavity 16, an electromechanical fluid displacer/actuator 12 and a saw-tooth electronic drive 34 to enable the  DELTA p in cavity 16 to stabilize during at least one of the two periods of each AC actuation cycle.
      <br/>
      The measurement of the established  DELTA p at the end of (at least one or) each saw-tooth period is an indication of the desired viscosity.
      <br/>
      It is the  DELTA p (but not  DELTA p/pa) which is largely independent of absolute pressure, pa.  DELTA p is sensed by sensor 20, which provides an output to an analog-to-digital converter 35, as shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      The digital output goes to processor 36 for processing.
      <br/>
      Processor 36 has a digital or analog output that may be provided to some apparatus such as a combustion control or regulator.
      <br/>
      Also, an output is provided to indicator 37 that may provide readable information about the directly measured viscosity, as well as correlated properties such as oxygen demand or other parameters of the tested gas.
      <br/>
      The output of sensor 20, instead, may go directly to an anatlog indicator, processor or interface.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      An embodiment may have an actuator 12 that is a low-voltage, electromagnetic earphone speaker, rather than a piezo-electric tweeter or electro-static speaker, and in which the  DELTA p sensor 20 is a microphone based on either piezo-electric (preferred), piezo-resistive, electro-magnetic, electret, carbon-contact or capacitance effects.
      <br/>
      The present invention may sense not only viscosity but also absolute pressure by further processing the determined viscosity and the initial time constant or phase lag between actuator 12 input and sensor 20 output, as shown in FIGS. 3-5.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Viscometers 10, 21, and 22, of FIGS. 2, 6, and 7, respectively, have advantages over related art viscometers based on vibrating wires and quartz crystal oscillators, having pressure decay&lt;or phase lags, because they have no dependence on absolute pressure.
      <br/>
      Viscometers 10, 21 and 22 also have advantages over viscometers based on thermal excitation, because they has no dependence on thermal conductivity or specific heat of the fluid being measured.
      <br/>
      They also has advantages over traditional viscometers based on capillary flow driven by a constant source of pressurized fluid, or based on timing of the fall of an object, in that there is no need for a costly source of constant pressure fluid, constant gravity magnitude and direction, or equipment for providing and measuring the falling object.
      <br/>
      The present viscometer are not sensitive to their mounting orientations.
      <br/>
      As noted above, besides viscosity, the present devices can also be used to sense absolute pressure by using the initial time constant or phase lag between actuator input and sensor output, which is a feature not available from related art viscometers.
