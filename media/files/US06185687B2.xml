      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates to a signal recording apparatus, a signal record (recording , recordable or recorded) medium and a signal reproducing apparatus for prohibiting copying or unauthorized use.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Recently, with increased capacity and coming into widespread use of digital recording media, such as optical discs, prohibition of duplication or unauthorized use thereof has become crucial for protecting the copyright of recorded signals.
      <br/>
      That is, digital audio data or digital video data can be duplicated by copying or dubbing without deterioration, while computer data can be duplicated to give data which are the same as the original data, thus giving rise to troubles, such as copyright infringement, due to unauthorized copying.
    </p>
    <p num="6">With this in view, a pre-set ID bit for preventing unauthorized copying is occasionally recorded on an original signal record medium for prohibiting unauthorized copying in so-called digital dubbing in which data is reproduced from a digital record medium and re-recorded on another digital record medium.</p>
    <p num="7">For example, in a system for prohibiting the unauthorized copying in a digital audio data recording/reproducing apparatus termed a rotary head digital audio tape recorder (R-DAT), an inhibiting code for inhibiting digital copying or generation-serial copying, that is for copying generation limitation (inhibiting code of a standard of the serial copying management system or SCMS) is recorded in a main data area for digital audio signals recorded on a digital audio tape as a signal record medium, so that, when the inhibiting code is detected by the digital audio signal recording apparatus, copying recording of the digital audio signals on a new digital audio tape is inhibited.</p>
    <p num="8">Meanwhile, in digital dubbing of video signals, in which digital video signals, for example, recorded on a digital record medium, such as a digital disc or a digital tape, are reproduced and re-recorded on another record medium, a pre-set ID bit, that is the inhibiting code of a standard of the serial copying management system (SCMS), may be recorded in the original digital record medium.</p>
    <p num="9">
      In case of a recording system of recording the pre-set ID bit for prohibiting the unauthorized copying on the original digital record medium, the function of preventing unauthorized copying in the above-described digital dubbing operates satisfactorily.
      <br/>
      However, in case the digital video signals recorded on an original digital record medium are reproduced and D/A converted for analogically recording the converted analog video signals, or in case the analog video signals are again A/D converted for recording in the digital form, the function of preventing unauthorized copying fails to operates satisfactorily, so that recording can be made directly.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      That is, if the digital video signals recorded on the digital record medium is reproduced and D/A converted and the resulting analog video signals are directly recorded analogically or restored by A/D conversion to digital video signals for digital recording, the video signals resulting from dubbing are deteriorated in signal quality to an extremely small extent.
      <br/>
      This means that copyright protection ia not assured sufficiently, and hence a system is required which positively prohibits such unauthorized copying.
      <br/>
      In particular, large-capacity disc-shaped recording media have recently become popular, such that a demand has been raised for suitable measures against unauthorized copying of digital video signals recorded on the disc-shaped record medium.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      On the other hand, if the pre-set ID bit provided for prohibiting unauthorized copying is skipped in reading, unauthorized copying can be achieved easily.
      <br/>
      Therefore, suitable measures for prohibiting unauthorized copying by skipping in reading have also been desired.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a signal reproducing method and apparatus, a signal recording method and apparatus, a signal transmitting method and apparatus and a signal record(recording, recordable or recorded) medium whereby it is possible to prevent unauthorized copying by skipping in reading and it is also possible to inhibit unauthorized copying of analog signal converted from digital data digitally or analogically as well as to inhibit generation-serial copying.</p>
    <p num="13">With the method and apparatus for reproducing a signal according to the present invention, digital data or an analog signal D/A converted from the digital data are converted in a pre-set manner based on the recording control information arrayed in a playback mode control signal area and/or each sector header of a signal record medium.</p>
    <p num="14">With the method and apparatus for recording a signal according to the present invention, a signal is ciphered using at least a portion of the recording control information designed for controlling the recording on a signal record medium as the key information, or by the key information specified by at least a portion of the recording control information, with this recording control information being arrayed at a pre-set position of a playback mode control signal area of the signal record medium and/or at a pre-set position of each signal recording unit on the signal record medium and being recorded along with the ciphered signal on the signal record medium.</p>
    <p num="15">With the method and apparatus for transmitting a signal according to the present invention, digital data or an analog signal D/A converted from the digital data are converted in a pre-set manner based on the recording control information ancillary to transmitted digital data.</p>
    <p num="16">With the method and apparatus for transmitting a signal according to the present invention, the signal is ciphered using at least a portion of the transmission management information designed to supervise signal transmission as the key information, or by the key information specified by at least a portion of the recording control information and the transmission management information is transmitted along with the ciphered signal.</p>
    <p num="17">
      With the signal record medium of the present invention, the recording control information for supervising the signal recording on the signal record medium is recorded at a pre-set position in a playback mode control signal area and/or at a pre-set position in each signal recording unit.
      <br/>
      At least a portion of the recording control information is used as the key information for ciphering the recording signal.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      That is, with the present invention, both digital data and the analog signal are converted in a pre-set manner based on the recording control information or the transmission control information.
      <br/>
      The pre-set conversion may be ciphering or scrambling, for example, for digital data and for analog signals, respectively, whereby both the unauthorized digital copying and unauthorized analog copying may be prohibited from occurring.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention, since the signal is ciphered based on the recording control information or the transmission control information, deciphering is not feasible if the reading of the recording control information or the transmission control information is skipped, thus enabling prevention of unauthorized copying.
    </p>

      With the video signal reproducing apparatus and method of the present invention, a digital signal is reproduced from a digital disc medium having recorded thereon the video recording control code arrayed in a playback mode control signal recording area provided at a beginning end of a spirally extending recording track and/or in each header of the digital video signal divided into sectors, along with the digital video signal, for ultimately producing at least the analog video signal output.
      <br/>
      The state of the video recording control code is detected, and the video recording scrambling signal of the mode of the analog video signal and/or the recording inhibiting signal is generated on the basis of the detection output.

      That is, according to the present invention, a video recording scrambling signal of the analog signal mode and/or the video recording inhibiting signal is annexed to the analog video signal, D/A converted from the digital video signal read out from the digital disc medium when outputting the analog video signal.

      The analog video signal, to which is annexed the video recording scrambling signal and/or the video recording inhibiting signal, is analogically or digitally recorded on the record medium.

      The pre-set conversion includes ciphering for the digital data and scrambling for the analog data.
      <br/>
      It becomes possible in this manner to inhibit unauthorized analog or digital copying of analog signals temporarily converted from digital data as well as serial generation copying, while it becomes possible to combat unauthorized copying of both the analog and digital data.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the signal is ciphered based on the recording control information or the transmission control information, deciphering becomes impossible if the recording control information or the transmission control information is skipped in reading, thus enabling inhibition of unauthorized copying.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="27">Referring to the drawings, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail.</p>
    <p num="28">An optical disc is used as the digital record(recording, recordable or recorded) medium of the present invention, and the process flow until completion of the optical disc is explained by referring to FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="29">
      First, in a mastering step 30 of fabricating a master disc MD, digital video data converted from a motion picture film, digital data sent directly from a digital camera, or digital video data from a digital VTR for a broadcasting station, are supplied to a terminal 1.
      <br/>
      The digital video data, for example, supplied via the terminal 1, is sent to a compression encoding circuit 2, where it is encoded in accordance with the so-called MPEG2 standard formulated by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), at the same time as it is formed into sectors in terms of a pre-set data volume, such as 2048 bytes, as a unit.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The data encoded for compression and formed into sectors by the encoding circuit 2 is sent to a scrambling circuit 9.
      <br/>
      The scrambling circuit 9 is also supplied with the copy management information for prohibiting unauthorized copying, as later explained, which is generated by a copy management information generating circuit 3.
      <br/>
      Output data of the encoding circuit 2 is scrambled, as later explained, using the copy management information.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The data scrambled by the scrambling circuit 9 is sent to a copying management information appending circuit.
      <br/>
      The copying management information generated by the copying management information generating circuit 3 is also supplied to the copying management information appending circuit, where the copying management information is appended to output data of the scrambling circuit 9.
    </p>
    <p num="32">If a recording scrambling signal and/or a recording inhibiting signal in an analog signal format is added to the analog video signal, the scrambling circuit 9 may be omitted, in which case data from the encoding circuit 2 may be directly sent to the copying management information appending circuit.</p>
    <p num="33">
      The copying management information is inserted in one or both of the lead-in area provided at a beginning end of a spirally extending track of an optical disc at the innermost or outermost rim of the optical disc and within the header of the data sector in the program area.
      <br/>
      In the following description, the copying management information is appended in one or both of the TOC area and the header of the data sector.
      <br/>
      Thus the copying management information appending circuit has an appendage circuit 4 for appending the copying management information within the TOC and an appendage circuit 5 for appending the copying management information in the data sector header.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The copying management information is made up of one or both of the information specifying the effect that both analog and digital copying or only digital copying inhibition be inhibited, and the information specifying the effect that limitation be placed on the copying generation.
      <br/>
      In the following, it is assumed that both information be included in the copying management information.
      <br/>
      It is possible that the charging information be included in the copying management information.
      <br/>
      By including the charging information in the copying management information, it becomes possible to make only the picture reproduction be charge-free and to permit copying only on payment of a charged fee, that it to inhibit charge-free copying.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The copying management information for this case may be made up of eight bits b7 to b0 as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Of these eight bits, the upper two bits b7 and b6 are allocated as a bit CMC instructing generation limitation, while the three lower bits b2, b1 and b0 are allocated as bits CMM instructing copying inhibition of both digital and analog data or only of digital data.
      <br/>
      For example, the CMM bits (b2, b1, b0) of (1, 1, 1) and (0, 1, 1) mean inhibition of both digital and analog copying and inhibition of digital copying, respectively.
      <br/>
      The bit CMC allocated to generation limitation in the above copying management information in the fabrication process of the master disc MD specifies that the disc is an original disc.
    </p>
    <p num="36">It may be contemplated to allocate only the bit b2 as a bit CMM specifying that the copying be inhibited or not inhibited.</p>
    <p num="37">
      The purpose of inserting the copying management information on the sector basis is to array the information in a segmented state in a disc instead of on the overall disc surface in order to cope with different categories of the video signals, that is in order to accommodate the situation in which plural sorts of video signals of different categories are contained in a disc and are not designed to be managed monistically, as in the case of the CD-ROM.
      <br/>
      The copying management information may also be appended on the block basis instead of on the sector basis.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The data to which the copying management information has been appended by the copying management information appending circuit is sent to an encoder/modulation circuit 6.
      <br/>
      The encoder/modulation circuit 6 performs data delaying and parity calculations, as error correction encoding operations, on the supplied data, and modulates 8-bit data, for example, on the supplied data to form 16-channel bit modulated data in accordance with a pre-set modulation system.
      <br/>
      The encoder/modulation circuit 6 also appends synchronization signals of a so-called out-of-rule pattern violating the modulation rule of the above pre-set modulation system every pre-set data amount and sends the resulting data to an optical head unit 7.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The optical head device 7 radiates a laser beam driven based on data supplied from the encoder/modulation circuit 6 to a master disc MD rotated by a rotation servo controlled spindle motor 8 for effecting optical recording.
      <br/>
      This completes fabrication of a master disc MD having data recorded thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="40">The scrambling circuit 9 is arranged as shown for example in FIG. 3.</p>
    <p num="41">
      Referring to FIG. 3, a so-called parallel block synchronization type scrambler, employing a 15-bit shift register, may be used as the scrambling circuit 9.
      <br/>
      To a data input terminal 45 of the scrambler, there is entered data comprised of 2048 byte data of a data portion of FIG. 5 or TOC data portion of FIG. 6, from the compression encoding circuit 2, and 4-byte error detection code (EDC), appended thereto, in a sequence in which the least significant bit (LSB) comes first, that is in an LSB first sequence.
      <br/>
      The scrambling circuit 14 includes a 15-bit shift register 41 for scrambling for which feedback is applied in accordance with a generating polynominal x15 +x+1, using an exclusive OR (ExOR) circuit 42.
      <br/>
      In the 15-bit shift register 41, pre-set values or initial values are variably set in accordance with bits b2, b1, b0 (1,1,1 or 0,1,1) of the bits CMM of the copying management information as shown in FIG. 2 so that the pre-set values or initial values will be switched on the sector basis.
      <br/>
      The pre-set values may also be variably set by both the bits CMM and CMC instead of being variably set solely by the bit CMM.
      <br/>
      Output data of the shift register 41 and input data from the terminal 45 are Ex-ORed by the ExOR circuit 43 so as to be taken out as scrambled data at a terminal 44 and thence supplied to the copy management information appending circuit shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="42">In a replication step 40, plural optical discs D are prepared by press working from the master disc MD produced in a manner as described above.</p>
    <p num="43">
      An disc D, duplicated from the master disc MD by the replication step 40, has a center aperture 102.
      <br/>
      Looking from the inner rim towards the outer rim of the disc-shaped record medium D, there are formed a lead-in area 103, as a program management region or TOC region, a program area 104 having program data recorded therein, and a program end area, or a so-called lead-out area 105.
      <br/>
      In an optical disc for reproducing audio or video signals, the audio or video signals, encoded for compression as described above, are recorded in the program area 104, while the time information or the like for the audio or video data is managed by the lead-ion area 103.
      <br/>
      The above-mentioned copying management information is recorded in the TOC sector of the lead-in area 103 and/or in the data sector header in the program area 104.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The structure of a data sector in the program area 104 is made up of a 4-byte data sync portion DS, a 16-byte header portion DH, a 2048-byte data portion DD and a 4-byte error detection code (EDC) portion, with each byte being made up of 8 bits, as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The 1-byte copying management information TP is arrayed in a TOC data portion TD.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Of course, the copying management information TP may be provided with the file-based copying management information (paired data comprised of the file position and size and the copying management information) by being combined with the addresses for files.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the number of bytes or bits may be increased in order to have the copying management information more specific than the above-mentioned copying management information DP.
    </p>
    <p num="46">The above-mentioned original optical discs D may be reproduced by the user, such as at home.</p>
    <p num="47">
      That is, returning to FIG. 1, a reproducing apparatus 50 for the optical disc D for household use reads out signals (RF signals) by an optical head unit 10 from the optical disc D run in rotation by a spindle motor 10 servo-controlled for rotation by a servo circuit 13.
      <br/>
      The RF signals read out from the optical disc D by the optical head device 10 are sent to an RF amplifier 12.
      <br/>
      The RF amplifier 12 converts the RF signals into bi-level signals when taking out signals recorded on the optical disc D and sends the bi-level signals to a demodulating circuit 14.
      <br/>
      The RF amplifier 12 also separates synchronization signals from the RF signals, while taking out the tracking error signals and the focusing error signals to send the signals to the servo circuit 13.
      <br/>
      The servo circuit 13 performs rotation control of the spindle motor 11 and the tracking and focusing servo for the optical head unit 10.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The demodulation circuit 14 performs demodulation, which is the reverse of the above-mentioned modulation, for converting 16 channel bit data into 8 bit data.
      <br/>
      The digital data from the demodulation circuit 14 is sent to an error correction circuit 15 for performing an operation which is the reverse of the above-mentioned error correction encoding.
      <br/>
      Output digital video data of the error correction circuit 15 is resolved into sectors by a sector resolution circuit 16 and is sent via a copying management information readout circuit as later explained and a descrambling circuit 31 in this order to an expansion decoding circuit 21.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The expansion decoding circuit 21 performs expansion decoding on data encoded for compression in accordance with the above-mentioned rule for MPEG2.
      <br/>
      The expanded and decoded digital data is converted by a D/A conversion circuit 23 into analog video signals which are sent via a mixing circuit 24 as later explained to an NTSC encoder 25 for conversion into analog video signals of the so-called NTSC system of the standard television broadcasting system.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the digital data is outputted via the mixing circuit 24 at an analog output terminal 29 as an analog video signal.
    </p>
    <p num="50">In addition, the digital data from the expansion decoding circuit 21 is sent via a digital scrambling circuit 31 as later explained and a digital interfacing circuit 26 so as to be outputted as digital video data at a digital output terminal 27.</p>
    <p num="51">
      The copying management information readout circuit includes a read-out circuit 18 for reading out the appended copying management information from the header of the data sector and a read-out circuit 17 for reading out the appended copying management information from the TOC data area of the TOC sector, and sends the copying management information read out from the data of the sector resolution circuit 16 to a copying information management circuit 19.
      <br/>
      If the copying management information is appended to only one of the TOC and the data sector header, only one corresponding circuit of the two read-out circuits 17, 18 is employed.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The copying information management circuit 19 judges which of inhibition of analog and digital copy inhibition and inhibition of only of digital copying is specified by the bit CMM, of FIG. 2, and which generation number of the copying inhibition is specified by the bit CMC , and outputs a decision signal responsive to the results of decision.
      <br/>
      The decision signals are sent to a protect signal generation circuit 20.
      <br/>
      The copying information management circuit 19 sends the copying management information to the descrambling circuit 31.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The descrambling circuit 31 has a structure similar to that of the scrambling circuit 9 of FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In this descrambling circuit 31, pre-set values or initial values, derived from the copying management information from the copying information management circuit 19, are variably set.
      <br/>
      This allows the descrambling circuit 31 to perform descrambling, that is deciphering, which is a reverse operation of the scrambling operation performed by the scrambling circuit 9.
      <br/>
      Stated differently, the descrambling circuit 31 cannot perform descrambling if there is no copying management information read out by the copying management information readout circuit from the data sector header or from the TOC data area of the TOC sector and supplied via the copying information management circuit 19.
      <br/>
      The data descrambled by the descrambling circuit 31 is sent to the expansion decoding circuit 21.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, the pre-set value or the initial value of the descrambling circuit 321 can also be set on the basis of the key information specified by the copying management information.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Similarly to the scrambling circuit 9, a digital descrambling circuit 32, fed with digital data from the expansion decoding circuit 21, performs digital descrambling on digital video data from the expansion decoding circuit 21 based on the copying management information.
      <br/>
      This outputs descrambled digital video data from the digital descrambling circuit 32 at the digital interfacing circuit 26.
      <br/>
      It is also possible with the digital descrambling circuit 32 to perform descrambling based on the key information specified by the copying management information.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      In connection with digital dubbing, in which digital data reproduced from a signal recorded on an optical disc, that is a digital record medium, is recorded as digital data in another digital record medium, there is known a technique of recording a pre-set ID bit, such as that discussed in relation with the prior art, on an optical disc as the copying management information, with a view to prohibiting unauthorized copying.
      <br/>
      However, unauthorized copying can be easily realized if the copying management information is skipped in reading.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      If, in the embodiment of the present invention, the copying management information is skipped in reading the copying management information from the data sector header or TOC data area, with a view to unauthorized copying, the digital data recorded on the optical disc has been scrambled based on the copying management information and hence cannot be descrambled, thus prohibiting such unauthorized copying.
      <br/>
      In addition, with the embodiment of the present invention, since the digital scrambling is performed by the digital scrambling circuit 32 on the basis of the copying management information, the digital scrambled digital data is copied by digital dubbing.
      <br/>
      However, the above copying management information is required for descrambling.
      <br/>
      This again is effective to prohibit unauthorized copying.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      In the above-described embodiment, the digital scrambling circuit 32 is provided upstream of the digital interfacing circuit 26.
      <br/>
      However, a switch 33 may also be provided in place of the scrambling circuit 32.
      <br/>
      If, in such case, the contents of the copying management information indicate copying prohibition, and the switch 33 is controlled to be turned off, digital video data is not outputted by the digital interfacing circuit 26, thus enabling the prohibition of unauthorized copying in the case of digital copying.
      <br/>
      If such switch 33 is used, the signal sent from the copying information management circuit 19 to the switch 33 is a switch setting control signal corresponding to the contents of the copying management information.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      If, in the digital dubbing, the bit CMC of the copying management information for copying generation limitation permits copying of the current generation, digital data may directly be outputted without the digital scrambling circuit 32 performing the digital scrambling operation, that is, with the switch 33 being turned on, if such switch 33 is provided.
      <br/>
      However, in the embodiment of FIG. 2, since the bit CMM in any case is of a value inhibiting digital copying, the switch 33 is not turned on in the embodiment of FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="59">FIG. 7 shows an embodiment in which the copying is inhibited by the switch 22, without performing scrambling or descrambling such as one described above.</p>
    <p num="60">
      In the embodiment of FIG. 7, data compressed in volume and formed into sectors by the compression encoding circuit 2 in the mastering step 30 is directly sent to a copying management information appendage circuit, that is an appendage circuit 4 for appending the copying management information in a TOC and an appendage circuit 5 for appending the copying management information in the data sector header.
      <br/>
      In the reproducing device 50, digital video data resolved into sectors by the sector resolution circuit 16 is directly sent to the expansion decoding circuit 21 via a copying management information readout circuit, that is read-out circuits 17 and 18 for reading out the copying management information from the TOC data area and the data sector header, respectively.
      <br/>
      The digital data from the expansion decoding circuit 21 is sent via the switch 22 to the digital interfacing circuit 26.
      <br/>
      A decision signal from the copying information management circuit 19 is sent to the protect signal generating circuit 20, while being sent as a switching control signal to the switch 22.
      <br/>
      The present embodiment is otherwise similar in structure to the embodiment of FIG. 1, so that corresponding portions are denoted by the same reference numerals and the corresponding description is not made for clarity.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      If, in the embodiment of FIG. 7, the above result of decision indicates copying inhibition, the switch 22 is turned off by a switching control signal corresponding to the result of decision.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, if the generation limitation bit CMC of the copying management information specifies that the disc is not an original disc and is of a generation specifying copying inhibition, a switching control signal which turns off the switch 22 is outputted by the copying information management circuit 19.
      <br/>
      This inhibits outputting of digital video data from the digital interfacing circuit 26, so that it becomes possible to prohibit unauthorized copying in digital dubbing in which digital data reproduced from a signal recorded on an optical disc D (digital disc medium) is directly recorded as digital data on a separate digital disc medium.

    <p num="64">In the following description, it is assumed that the generation limitation bit CMC of the copying management information allows only for one-generation copying, that is, it does not permit reproduction of copied data as from the second and following generations, as counted from the original.</p>

      In the reproducing apparatus 50 for an optical disc D shown in FIG. 9, the copying information management circuit 19 decides whether the bit CMM of the copying management information specifies inhibition copying of both analog and digital data or only digital data, and also which generation the bit CMC specifies as copying generation limitation.

    <p num="66">If the bit CMM of the copying management information does not specify inhibition of analog copying, and the generation limitation bit CMC specifies that the disc is an original disc, a protect code signal generating circuit 74 within the protect signal generation circuit 20 generates and outputs a protect code signal PCS specifying that effect by plural coded bits.</p>
    <p num="67">
      This protect code signal PCS is sent to the mixing circuit 24 which then mixes the protect code signal PCS in a pre-set horizontal period within a vertical blanking period of an analog video signal, as shown in FIG. 8.

      Meanwhile, the protect code signal PCS is inserted at the 20Hth horizontal period and at the 283Hth horizontal period, where H denotes horizontal period, for an odd field and for an even field, respectively.
      <br/>
      The protect code signal PCS, mixed into the analog video signal, is made up of, for example, 14-bit data and 6-bit error detection correction code (CRCC), wherein the 8 bits following the 4-bit header in the 14-bit data are allocated in the similar manner to the copying management information described previously.
      <br/>
      The analog video signal, having the analog protect code signal appended thereto, is outputted at an analog output terminal 29.

    <p num="68">
      The analog output terminal 29 of the reproducing apparatus 50 is connected to an analog input terminal 81 of an optical disc recording/reproducing apparatus 80, employing a recordable optical disc RD as a record medium, as an example of a video signal reproducing apparatus.
      <br/>
      The analog video signal with the appended protect code signal, outputted by the output terminal 29 of the reproducing apparatus, is A/D converted by the disc recording/reproducing apparatus 80 into digital video data which is digitally recorded on the optical disc DD.

      <br/>
      The data encoded for compression in the compression encoding circuit 83 and formed into sectors is sent to a scrambling circuit 85.

      <br/>
      The protect code signal supplied at this time to the protect code signal detection circuit 88 specifies that the disc is copied from the original disc and is permitted for the first generation copying as counted from the original disc.

      The encoder/modulation circuit 89 appends synchronization signals of a so-called out-of-rule pattern violating the modulation rule of the pre-set modulation system, in terms of a pre-set data amount as a unit, and sends the resulting data to an optical head device 90.

      For recording on the optical disc RD, so-called magneto-optical recording may be used, in which case a magnetic head is provided facing the optical head device 90 with the optical disc RD in-between and the laser beam of a power high enough to heat a magnetic film formed on the optical disc RD to a temperature higher than the Curie temperature ia radiated on the optical disc RD, while the magnetic head is driven based on the signal from the encoder/modulation circuit 89.
      <br/>
      In this manner, digital video data, corresponding to the digital video data from the original disc processed through the analog interface, is copied on the optical disc RD.

      <br/>
      That is, if the disc RD, on which the first generation copying has been performed, is again loaded on the reproducing apparatus 50 of FIG. 9 for reproduction, and the analog video signal resulting from the reproduction is again copied by the optical disc recording/reproducing apparatus 80 shown in FIG. 9, the following measures are used.

      At this time, the copying management information decision circuit 19 of the digital reproducing circuit 92 is designed not to output the copying management information to the descrambling circuit 31, or to output the non-scramblable copying management information.

    <p num="89">Thus the data sent to the expansion decoding circuit 21 in the digital reproducing circuit 92 is the non-descrambled data, so that, if the data is expanded and decoded by the expansion decoding circuit 21, regular digital video data cannot be produced.</p>

      With the above-described arrangement, in such a case wherein digital video data recorded on the original digital record medium is reproduced and temporarily D/A converted into analog video signals, which are again A/D converted into digital video data for digital recording, generation limitation becomes possible to prevent unauthorized copying.

      In the above case, the second generation data copying can be done on the optical disc RD.

      If, in the case of digital copying via the analog interface, the copying management information is skipped in reading during reproduction of the optical disc RD by the reproducing apparatus 50 with a view to unauthorized copying as described above, since the digital data recorded on the optical disc RD is scrambled on the basis of the copying management information, the descrambling circuit 31 cannot descramble the data, while a protect code generation circuit 74 cannot generate the protect code signal based on the copying management information, thus enabling prohibition of unauthorized copying.
      <br/>
      That is, since the optical disc recording/reproducing apparatus 80 cannot generate the copying management information based on the protect code signal, the scrambling circuit 85 cannot descramble data, thus enabling prevention of unauthorized copying.
      <br/>
      It may be envisaged to mask the protect code signal instead of skipping the reading of the copying management information with a view to unauthorized copying.

    </p>
    <p num="95">Referring to FIGS. 10 and 11, prevention of unauthorized copying is explained for a case in which digital video data recorded on an original digital record medium is reproduced and transiently D/A converted into analog video signals which are then analogically recorded on a conventional analog video tape recorder (analog VTR).</p>
    <p num="96">
      It is assumed in such case that, with the reproducing apparatus 50 for the optical disc D shown in FIG. 11, the bit CMM of the copying management information indicates inhibition of copying, and the decision signal from the decision circuit 19 indicates inhibition of analogical copying.
      <br/>
      It is also assumed that an analog protect pulse APP, which is a white peak signal, is generated by a protect pulse generating circuit 72 in the protect signal generating circuit 20.
      <br/>
      This analog protect pulse APP is mixed by the mixing circuit 24 in a pre-set period of the vertical blanking period of the analog video signal, as shown in FIG. 11. The protect pulse generating circuit 72 also generates the analog protect pulse APP if the copying management information is not supplied.
      <br/>
      A decision signal corresponding to the inhibition of analog copying is outputted by the copying management information decision circuit 19 even if the generation limitation bit CMC denoted by the copying management information specifies inhibition of analog copying of the current generation.
      <br/>
      The system of inhibiting analog copying is termed the analog protection system (APC).
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      An output signal of the mixing circuit 24 is such a signal in which plural pairs of positive pulses and pseudo synchronization pulses of a pre-set sequence are appended to the video signal in the vertical blanking period of the analog video signal next to the synchronization pulse.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative case of FIG. 10, plural pulse pairs of a pseudo synchronization pulse P12 and a positive pulse, such as a white peak pulse, are inserted next to two equalizing pulses P10 in a horizontal line (horizontal period).
      <br/>
      The technique of using a combination signal of these plural pseudo synchronization pulses and plural white peak signals as a recording scrambling signal is disclosed in JP Patent Kokai Publication JP A-61-288582 (1986).

      The analog protection system (APS) employing this pseudo-sync pulse (PSP) is termed the PSP system.

    <p num="98">The reason the normal picture recording becomes impossible on a usual video tape recorder (VTR) is now briefly explained.</p>
    <p num="99">It is assumed that the analog output terminal 29 of the reproducing apparatus 50 is connected to the analog input terminal 61 of the analog VTR 60, and the analog video signals, having appended thereto the above recording scrambling signal outputted by the analog output terminal 29 of the reproducing apparatus 50, are recorded on the video tape TP by an analog VTR 60.</p>
    <p num="100">
      Usually, the analog VTR 60 has an automatic gain control (AGC) circuit 62, as automatic amplitude adjustment means or automatic gain adjustment means, and is configured for automatically adjusting the amplitude of the analog video signal entering the analog input terminal 61.
      <br/>
      If the analog video signal shown in FIG. 10 is supplied to the analog VTR 60 provided with such AGC circuit 62, the AGC circuit 62 responds to the white peak signal added in the vertical blanking period, thus narrowing the inherent video signal amplitude.
      <br/>
      That is, the AGC circuit 62 of a usual video tape recorder cannot distinguish the equalizing pulse P10 from the pseudo synchronization pulse P12 and hence samples the level of the appended positive pulse P14 such that it recognizes the positive pulse level as being several times as large in amplitude as the input signal level and manages control to lower the gain.
      <br/>
      If the analog video signal, automatically adjusted in amplitude by the AGC circuit 62, is recorded via the analog recording circuit 65 on the video tape TP, and subsequently reproduced by an analog reproducing circuit 67 in the television receiver 70 via an analog output terminal 68, an extremely ill-looking picture is produced due to unusual lightness level in the reproduced picture.

    <p num="101">In this manner, inhibition of unauthorized copying, inclusive of generation limitation, becomes possible for a case in which digital video data recorded on an original digital record medium is reproduced and transiently D/A converted into analog video signals which are then analogically recorded on a conventional analog VTR.</p>

      If, in such analog copying via analog interface, the copying management information is skipped in reading during reproduction of the optical disc RD in the reproducing apparatus 50 with a view to unauthorized copying in a manner as described above, the digital data recorded on the optical disc RD is scrambled based on the copying management information, and hence cannot be descrambled by the descrambling circuit 31.
      <br/>
      In addition, the protect code generating circuit 74 is designed to generate the protect pulse even if the copying management information is not supplied, thus enabling unauthorized copying.

      <br/>
      The remaining two bits b2 to b0 are undefined.
      <br/>
      If the bits (b7, b6) of the APS trigger bits CMT are (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1) or (0, 1), these specify copy free, one generation copying possible, copy not permitted and unused, respectively.
      <br/>
      If the bits (b5, b4) of the APS trigger bits CMT are (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) or (1, 1), these specify off state, turning the pseudo-sync pulse and a split burst or color stripe as later explained on and off, respectively, turning the PSP and the 2-line split burst on, and turning the PSP and the 4-line split burst on, respectively.
      <br/>
      If the bit b3 of CMA is 1 or 0, it specifies an analog package medium and otherwise, respectively.

    <p num="115">
      The contents of the APS trigger bit turning the PSP on means that the analog protect pulse APP shown in FIGS. 10 and 12 be inserted in a pre-set period of the vertical blanking period, such as a period between 12 H and 19 H. The split burst being on means that the color burst inserted on the trailing side of the horizontal blanking pulse in the horizontal blanking period be partially reversed, while the two-line split burst on means reversing color burst two lines on end every 17 lines.
      <br/>
      The four-line split burst on means reversing color burst four lines on end every 21 lines.

      The color burst reversion is an operation of reversing a portion, for example, a forward half portion, of the color burst signal, or changing its phase.
      <br/>
      Such reversed split color burst produces color interference, such as generation of color stripes, in the copied color video signals.

      In a line in which the color burst is reversed, part of the color burst CB, as a reference signal of the color sub-carrier arrayed on the trailing side of the horizontal synchronization pulse HD, such as a hatched portion in FIG. 15, is reversed in phase.
      <br/>
      That is, the color burst period CN in the standard NTSC system is 9 cycles.

      To the front side of the standard period CN of the color burst is connected a burst signal of, for example, two cycles, as a pre-period CP, to provide a sum total of 11 cycles.

      The two cycles of the pre-period CP and 3.5 cycles of the front period CF of the former half portion in the color burst standard period CN, totalling at 5.5 cycles, are reversed in burst phase, while 5.5 cycles of the latter back portion CB in the color burst standard period CN remain intact.
    </p>
    <p num="117">The color burst signal, partially reversed in phase, is generated in, for example, the protect pulse generating circuit 72 of FIGS. 11 or 12 and sent to the mixing circuit 24, where the phase reversed color burst signal is mixed two lines on end every 17 lines for two line split burst on, while being mixed four lines on end every 21 lines for four line split burst on.</p>
    <p num="118">
      As for the split burst operation, part of the color burst is reversed in phase, that is by 180 (degree) . However, the color burst phase may also be changed by 90 (degree)  or 270 (degree)  or by an optional angle.
      <br/>
      The period of phase change can be set optionally without being limited to 5.5 cycles.

      FIG. 16 shows another illustrative example of a scrambling circuit which may be used in place of the above-described scrambling circuit shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative example of FIG. 16, the 15-bit shift register 41 for scrambling is similar to the illustrative example shown in FIG. 3 except that feedback conforming to the generating polynominal x15 +x4 +1 is employed, using an exclusive-OR (ExOR) gate 42.
      <br/>
      Thus the common portions are denoted by the same reference numerals and the corresponding description is omitted for simplicity.
    </p>
    <p num="120">In place of the illustrative example of the sector format shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, a sector format shown in FIG. 17 may be used.</p>
    <p num="121">
      In the embodiment of FIG. 17, each sector is made up of 12 rows, each row being made up of 172 bytes, thus totalling at 2064 bytes, of which 2048 bytes represent main data.
      <br/>
      At the leading position of the first of 12 rows, 4-byte ID (identification data), 2-byte IED (ID error detection code) and a 6-byte RSV (spare) are arrayed in this order.
      <br/>
      A 4-byte error detection code (EDC) is arrayed at the terminal position of the last row.
    </p>
    <p num="122">Of the 4 bytes of ID (identification data), the first MSB side byte (bits b31 to b24) represent the sector information, with the remaining three bytes (bits b23 to b0) represent the sector numbers, as shown in FIG. 18. The sector information is made up of a 1-bit sector format type, a 1 bit of the tracking method, a 1 bit of reflectance, a 1 bit spare, 2 bits of area types and 2 bits of the layer number, looking from the MSB side.</p>
    <p num="123">
      The copying management information may be provided at a pre-set position in the sector format.
      <br/>
      For example, in a sector format of the data area, a byte of the 6 bytes of RSV may be used, whereas, in a sector format in the TOC area, several bytes or several tens of bytes of the main data portion may be collected and used as an area for the copying management information.
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      The above description has been made in connection with recording/reproduction on or from an optical disc or a video tape.
      <br/>
      For example, if digital data, in which part of the transmission control information similar to the copying management information is transmitted as the key information, is scrambled or ciphered, and the transmission control information is transmitted by being annexed to the ciphered digital data, unauthorized copying can be prevented from occurring.
      <br/>
      The signal transmission apparatus corresponding to the signal transmission method of the present invention may be similar to the arrangements shown in FIGS. 1, 9, 11 and 13 if the encoder/modulation circuit is changed to a unit performing encoding or modulation conforming to the transmission system and the optical head device or the interfacing means for recording/reproduction is changed to data transmission or data reception means.
    </p>
    <p num="125">In addition, although the ciphering is done solely by scrambling/descrambling in the above-described embodiment, it can also be done by other conversion operations.</p>
    <p num="126">
      On the other hand, although the conversion on the recording side of FIG. 1 is performed by the scrambling circuit 9, it may also be performed in the compression encoding circuit 2 or in the encoder/modulation circuit 6.
      <br/>
      In such case, the conversion operation on the reproducing side is similarly performed by one of the demodulation circuit 14, error correction circuit 15, sector resolution circuit 16 and the expansion decoding circuit 21, in place of by the descrambling circuit 31.
      <br/>
      If the conversion operation is performed by one of the demodulation circuit 14, error correction circuit 15, sector resolution circuit 16 and the expansion decoding circuit 21, it is necessary to acquire the information necessary in making decision in the copying management information decision circuit 19 in advance.
      <br/>
      Since the TOC information is acquired first, the information derived from the TOC information may be employed.
    </p>
    <p num="127">With the above-described arrangement of the present invention, it becomes possible to combat unauthorized copying for the analog copying and digital copying simultaneously.</p>
    <p num="128">
      Although the optical disci and the video tape are used as the signal record medium in the above description, it is also possible to use magnetic recording media, such as so-called IC cards, hard discs or flexible discs, while it is possible to use an optical disc of the type in which recording is done by pits.
      <br/>
      In addition, a phase change type optical disc, an organic dye type optical disc, an optical disc recorded by UV laser light or optical discs having multi-layer recording films, may be used, in addition to the magneto-optical discs.
      <br/>
      A variety of tape-shaped recording media, such as video tapes, may also be employed.
