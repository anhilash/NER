    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to containers and hangers for poolside containment and organizing of swimming pool items.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Increasing use of residential swimming pools has created a need for organized containment of items used frequently for swimming, playing and relaxing in and around them.
      <br/>
      There are known containers that could be used to contain items at a poolside, but none having the quick assembly, convenience, and organizational advantages specifically for poolside items in a manner made possible with this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="3">Examples of the most closely related but different known organizers are described in the following patent documents. U.S. Pat. No. 5,833,334, issued to Harper on Nov. 10, 1998, described a home-entertainment organizer for TV-related items that would not be suitable for poolside items. U.S. Pat. No. 5,765,699, issued to Griffin on Jun. 16, 1998, described a holder of swimming-pool maintenance equipment in a garage or other building. U.S. Pat. No. 5,626,307, issued to Smith on May 6, 1997, described mobile holder of swimming-pool maintenance equipment. U.S. Pat. No. 5,249,857, issued to Suzuki on Oct, 5, 1993, described build-up furniture for homes. U.S. Pat. No. 3,887,103, issued to Spooner on Jun. 3, 1975, described a hand-tool box for carrying pool-maintenance tools.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">Objects of patentable novelty and utility taught by this invention are to provide a poolside organizer which:</p>
    <p num="5">
      holds such poolside items as floats, fins, snorkels, lotion, bathing suits, towels, toys, boogie boards, swim rings, sun glasses and hats with convenient organization and easy accessibility;
      <br/>
      can be packaged compactly unassembled for marketing;
      <br/>
      can be assembled quickly and easily;
      <br/>
      is sturdy for withstanding poolside uses and movement; and
      <br/>
      can be structured and designed attractively.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      This invention accomplishes these and other objectives with a poolside organizer having (a) a base with storage dividers and quick-assembly joints for upright structure, (b) a front wall supporting a plurality of hangers and one or more optional boxlike containers, (c) a rear wall supporting a plurality of hangers and one or more optional boxlike containers, (d) a left upright supporting a plurality of hangers and one or more optional boxlike containers, (e) a right upright supporting a plurality of hangers and one or more optional boxlike containers, and (f) one or more bottom end enclosures for containing items loose or in baskets.
      <br/>
      Quick-assemble and quick-disassemble fastener joints are provided for build-up structure.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention should become even more readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings wherein there is shown and described illustrative embodiments of the invention.
