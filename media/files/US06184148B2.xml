      An interconnection pattern made of aluminum alloy, such as Al-Cu, on a semiconductor IC, is dry etched in an etching gas containing a chlorine component.
      <br/>
      Residual chlorine components on the substrate are difficult to remove, thus causing corrosion problems with respect to the patterned aluminum alloy layer.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, to prevent such corrosion, a photo resist stripping process is carried out at a location down stream of the etching process using a conventional stripping gas, such as CF4+O2, at room temperature.
      <br/>
      Next, and before the resist-stripped substrate is exposed to open air, the substrate is heated in a vacuum to a temperature above 100° C., to thus remove residual chlorine components.
      <br/>
      In an alternative method, the heating process is carried out concurrently with the resist stripping process.

      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates to a method for stripping a photo resist from a layer made of an aluminum alloy, such as aluminum-copper, formed on a semiconductor substrate.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Aluminum or aluminum-silicon alloy containing several percent of silicon have been generally used as interconnection layers on semiconductor devices.
      <br/>
      However, it is also well known that such interconnection layers may be broken down by electro migration particularly in semiconductor devices where a very fine interconnection is required, such as 4  MU m for a high speed ECL (Emitter Coupled Logic) or 1  MU m for MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor), to achieve a greater density of integration and accordingly higher density flow of current therethrough is required.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent such electro migration of interconnection layers, aluminum-copper alloys containing 2 to 4% copper have come to be used, particularly where high current-density is involved, such as in bipolar devices or a high-speed logic circuits.
      <br/>
      However, aluminum-copper alloys present the problem the presence therein of residual chlorine components
    </p>
    <p num="6">When an aluminum or aluminum alloy layer is plasma dry-etched using chlorinated gases, such as gaseous mixtures containing chlorine (referred to hereinafter as Cl2), silicon tetrachloride (referred to hereinafter as SiCl4) or boron tri-chloride (BCl3), the mechanism of the undesirable reaction resulting from residual chlorine is as follows.</p>
    <p num="7">Al+Cl* --&gt; AlCl3.Arrow-up bold., Al2 Cl6.Arrow-up bold.</p>
    <p num="8">
      where Cl* denotes a chlorine radical produced in the plasma, and .Arrow-up bold. denotes sublimation.
      <br/>
      Aluminum (Al) reacts with Cl* to produce AlCl3 or Al2 Cl6, which then sublimes, and the aluminum continues to be etched in this manner as long as residual chlorine is present.
      <br/>
      When the etch-processed substrate is brought out into open air, the AlCl3, etc. which has sublimed and then has again deposited on a surface of the side wall of the aluminum layer or on the photo resist reacts with the water content in the open air, because the AlC3 is deliquescent.
      <br/>
      So, hydrochloric acid (HCl) is produced from the AlCl3, etc., according to the following formula:
      <br/>
      AlCl3 +3 H2 O --&gt; 3 HCl+Al(OH)3
    </p>
    <p num="9">Then, the HCl reacts with the Al to produce AlC3 again, as follows.</p>
    <p num="10">Al+3 HCl --&gt; AlCl3 +1/2H2 O</p>
    <p num="11">
      Thus, the reactions are continued repeatedly.
      <br/>
      In other words, the corrosion of the aluminum layer continues indefinitely.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent this corrosion, one or a combination of the below-described procedures are carried out for aluminum, aluminum-titanium (Al-Ti) alloys or aluminum-silicon (Al-Si) alloys, after the dry etching process.
    </p>
    <p num="12">(1) Stripping the photo resist without exposing the substrate to open air so as to prevent the chlorine deposition on the substrate from reacting with the water content of the open air.</p>
    <p num="13">(2) Drying the substrate with a hot nitrogen gas flow at a temperature as high as 100 to 200 (degree)  C., and then washing the substrate with water so as to remove the residual chlorine.</p>
    <p num="14">(3) Washing the substrate with water, and then baking the substrate in an oxygen atmosphere at a temperature of approximately 350 (degree)  C. so as to remove the residual chlorine.</p>
    <p num="15">
      (4) Plasma-processing the substrate in a fluorinated gas, such as CF4, SF6 or CHF3, so as to replace the residual chlorine atoms with fluorine atoms produced in the plasma.
      <br/>
      Thus a firm aluminum fluoride (AlF or AlF3) layer is formed over the aluminum surface to prevent the chlorine component from reacting with water content in the air.
    </p>
    <p num="16">(5) Plasma-processing the substrate in hydrogen gas, which reacts with the residual chlorine component to produce hydrogen chloride.</p>
    <p num="17">
      By the application of the above-mentioned procedures, residual chlorine component on substrates made of aluminum or aluminum alloys can be removed, and accordingly corrosion can be prevented.
      <br/>
      However, when etching aluminum alloys such as aluminum-copper (Al-Cu) or aluminum-copper-silicon (Al-Cu-Si), the residual chlorine component is in the form of Cux Cly or a mixture of Cu, Cl, Al and carbon from the photo resist, and such materials, having much higher sublimation temperatures than aluminum chloride, are difficult to remove.
      <br/>
      Therefore, such residual chlorine containing components may cause corrosion even when the above-described chlorine-removal procedures are employed.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Therefore, procedures for more effectively removing chlorine residuals have been sought to overcome the above-mentioned problems.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">It is an object of the invention to provide a method for forming a pattern of an aluminum-copper alloy on a semiconductor substrate without encountering the corrosion problem caused by chlorine residual on the substrate.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The method according to the invention includes thus steps of: forming a layer made of aluminum-copper alloy on a semiconductor substrate; forming a resist pattern on said alloy layer; etching said alloy layer by the use of said resist pattern in a chlorinated gas plasma so as to form an alloy pattern; down stream stripping said resist pattern in an atmosphere containing a reactive species; and heating the thus-processed substrate in a vacuum at a temperature higher than 100 (degree)  C., whereby the residual chlorine component removed.
      <br/>
      The stripping process and the heating process may be combined; that is to say, they may be carried out concurrently.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The above-mentioned features and advantages of the present invention, together with other objects and advantages, which will become apparent, will be more fully described hereinafter, with reference being made to the accompanying drawings form a part hereof, wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="22">
      FIG. 1(a) through FIG. 1(d) schematically illustrate the main part of a semiconductor device at respective steps of the fabrication process according to the method of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 schematically illustrates a dry processing apparatus using microwave power for the stripping step of the present invention.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="23">
      Referring now to FIGS. 1(a)-1(d), the fabrication steps of the method of the present invention are shown.
      <br/>
      By general fabrication processings not shown in the figures, the semiconductor substrate 1 has already been fabricated with IC devices therein and the entire surface 1a of the substrate 1 is then coated with an insulation film 4 having a first surface 4a formed on the substrate surface 1a, and a second, opposite surface 4b the same has then been made of PSG (phospho silicate glass), for example as shown in FIG. 1(a).
      <br/>
      A layer 2 made of an aluminum-copper alloy, Al-Cu(4%) for example, is formed to have a thickness of as much as approximately 8000  Angstrom  over the entire insulated film surface 4b on the semiconductor substrate 1 using a known method such surface 1 using as sputtering.
      <br/>
      In this regard, a lower surface 2a of the layer 2 is formed on the second surface 4b of the insulation film 4.
      <br/>
      A patterned photo resist film 3 is formed on alloy layer 2 as shown in FIG. 1(b) using general lithography technique.
      <br/>
      The exposed portion of layer 2 namely the portion which is not masked by the photo resist pattern 3, is removed using known general dry etching methods.
      <br/>
      The dry etching may be accomplished by reactive ion etching method using an etching gas, such as a gaseous mixture of chlorine (Cl2) (24 sccm (standard cubic centimeter per minutes)) and silicon tetra-chloride (SiCl4) (40 sccm), as an etching agent.
      <br/>
      The gas pressure is reduced to approximately 0.02 Torr, and a radio frequency power of 13.56 MHz, for example, and 250 W, for example, is applied thereto for 5 minutes, for example, using well known methods.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The etching gas is dissociated in a glow discharge driven by the applied radio frequency power and the thus produced chlorine atoms are active for reaction with the aluminum as well as the copper of the alloy.
      <br/>
      The aluminum chloride thus produced sublimes in the manner explained above in the description of the art, copper chloride is sputtered by the energetic ion bombardment, and the exposed portion of the alloy is thus etched and removed leaving the patterned layer 2', with the resist layer 3 thereon, as shown in FIG. 1(c).
      <br/>
      Next, the substrate 1 is transferred to a dry processing apparatus for stripping the patterned photo resist 3.
      <br/>
      During such transfer the substrate 1 is passed through a vacuum system or a system purged with an inert gas, in order to avoid exposure to open air.
      <br/>
      If the substrate is exposed to the open air, the residual chlorine component on the substrate will react with water contained in the air and the alloy will be corroded as explained above.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Then, the patterned photo resist 3 on the patterned alloy layer 2' is stripped using known down-stream etching methods.
      <br/>
      A stripping apparatus using microwave power is preferably employed for such stripping step, and the procedure is referred to as down-stream ashing or after-glow ashing.
      <br/>
      Such methodology will be described hereinafter.
      <br/>
      A gaseous mixture of CF4 (100 sccm) and oxygen (O2) (1500 sccm), for example, is used as the stripping gas at a pressure of approximately 1 Torr, and microwave power of 2.45 GHz and 1 KW is applied thereto for 2 minutes, for example, while the temperature of the substrate is kept at room temperature, for example, about 30 (degree)  C. After finishing this stripping process, and with reference to FIG. 2, the substrate is heated by an electric heater 31 in stage 25 to approximately 300 (degree)  C. and such temperature is maintained for 2 minutes, for example, while the apparatus is evacuated to 0.2-0.3 Torr, so that the residual chlorine component is baked out.
      <br/>
      After the substrate is sufficiently cooled, the substrate is removed from the apparatus, and the processes of the invention are completed.
      <br/>
      The method just described shall be referred to as method I. It is also possible to heat the substrate at a heating stage that is separate from the stripping stage 25 in the vacuum chamber in order to avoid the cycle time necessary for heating/cooling the massive stripping stage apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The baking process of method I may be combined with the stripping process.
      <br/>
      In other words, these two processes may be carried out concurrently.
      <br/>
      In such case, the stripping process is carried out while the substrate 1 is being heated from 200 to 300 (degree)  C, by the electric heater 31 mounted in stage 25.
      <br/>
      Such alternate method shall be referred to as method II.
    </p>
    <p num="27">When the stripping and baking processes are combined as in method II, the stripping gas may be a gaseous mixture of nitrogen (N2) (100 sccm) and oxygen (O2) (1500 sccm) at approximately 1 Torr, and the substrate may be heated to 200 to 300 (degree)  C. This method shall be referred to as method III.</p>
    <p num="28">In these methods just described, the combination of the heating and the down-stream stripping steps is essential, because with heating alone, the residual chlorine components cannot be removed at temperatures under 400 (degree)  C. Moreover, conventional plasma stripping causes a particle problem due to Al2 O3 formation.</p>
    <p num="29">
      In order to confirm the effect of the above-described methods of the present invention, the processed substrate is exposed to an open air for 2 days.
      <br/>
      The alloy pattern is then optically observed to check for the existence of corrosion.
      <br/>
      Moreover residual chlorine atoms are measured by fluorescent X-ray spectroscopy.
      <br/>
      The results are as follows.
      <br/>
      In the table, line (a) shows the temperature of the substrate during the heating step, line (b) shows the results of the check for the existence of corrosion by optical observation using a micro scope of magnification 1000, and line (c) shows the amount of residual chlorine atoms determined by spectroscopy, in units of cps (count per second), where 10-cps corresponds to 1.64  * 104 atoms per cm2.

    <p num="31">
      As seen in the table, when the substrate is heated to temperatures higher than 100 (degree)  C., the residual chlorine is evidently reduced and no corrosion is observed.
      <br/>
      The amount of the residual chlorine is reduced as the heating temperature id increased, however, on the other hand, when the temperature exceeds 300 (degree)  C., the aluminum is affected, for example hillocks are formed on the surface of the aluminum.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the temperature must be lower than 400 (degree)  C., and preferably should be between 250 and 300 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Details of an example of the dry etching apparatus for stripping the photo resist are hereinafter described, referring to FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The apparatus employs microwave power for producing reactive species of stripping agents.
      <br/>
      The chlorine etched substrate 1 with pattern thereon is loaded on the stage 25 in a reaction chamber 30.
      <br/>
      In the stage 25, an electric heater 31 and a thermometer (not shown in the figure) are mounted to heat the substrate when required.
      <br/>
      The chamber 30 is evacuated through gas outlets 26 by conventional evacuation equipment, which is not shown in the figure.
      <br/>
      Into the chamber 30, an etching or stripping gas is introduced through the gas inlet, 27.
      <br/>
      By balancing gas evacuation and gas introduction, the gas pressure internally of the chamber 30 is controlled to obtain the required gas pressure.
      <br/>
      A microwave-passing window 23 made of an insulating material, such as quartz or alumina, is installed to extend perpendicularly of the electric field in waveguide 21 and in sealing relationship to chamber 30 to maintain the vacuum in the latter.
      <br/>
      A metal shield plate 28 having many small holes therein shields reaction chamber 30 from the microwaves, and thus a plasma generation room 29 is formed between the microwave-passing window 23 and the shield plate 28.
      <br/>
      Microwave 22 power is fed through the waveguide 21 and through the microwave-passing window 23 and into the plasma generation room 29.
      <br/>
      In the plasma generation room 29, the etching gas is made into a plasma by excitation by the microwave power.
      <br/>
      Reactive species, such as oxygen atoms, produced in the plasma exit from room 29 through the holes of the shield plate 28 and flow directly onto substrate 1, i.e. efficiently, because the shield plate 28 is located close to the substrate 1.
      <br/>
      The reactive species are very reactive with regard to the photo resist on the substrate, but do not harm the substrate by ionic bombardment such as occurs during plasma etching because the species passing through the holes of the shield plate 28 are not ionic and no ionic gas are involved.
      <br/>
      Therefore, this type of apparatus is advantageously employed for stripping the photo resist.
    </p>
    <p num="33">Although aluminum-copper alloy is referred to in the above-described embodiment as the material to be processed, the present invention is also effective for other alloys such as AlCuSi and AlSiTiCu.</p>
    <p num="34">Although a mixture of Cl2 and SiCl4 is referred to as the etching gas for etching the alloy in the above-described embodiment, other chlorine gases, such as BCl3, CCl4 and CHCl3, can also be used, as is known.</p>
    <p num="35">Although a radio frequency of 13.56 MHz is employed in the above-described embodiment for etching the alloy, other radio frequencies, such as a radio frequency of 400 KHz, can also be used, as is also well known.</p>
    <p num="36">
      Although a mixture of CF4, N2 and O2 is referred to as the etching gas for stripping the photo resist in the above-described embodiments, other fluorinated gases, such as CHF3, C2 F6, SF6, NF3 or CBrF3, can also be used singly or as mixtures in place of CF4.
      <br/>
      Also, other nitrogen-containing gas, such as N2 O or NO2, can be used in place of N2, again as is well known.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Although a microwave frequency of 2.45 GHz has been employed in the above-described embodiment for stripping the photo resist, other radiation frequencies, such as, for example, a radio frequency of 13.56 MHz, might also be used, as is well known.</p>
