      Industrial Field for Utilization
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to production processes and intermediates of tetrazole compounds.
      <br/>
      More particularly, it relates to 2-(tetrazol-5-yl)-4-oxo-4H-benzopyran derivatives which are known to be pharmacologically useful from the viewpoint of their antagonistic action to leukotrienes such as leukotrienes C and D, and it also relates to 2-(tetrazol-5-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl derivatives which are known to be pharmacologically useful from the viewpoint of their antagonistic action to angiotensin II.
      <br/>
      Further, it relates to processes for producing 5-phenyltetrazole derivatives which are useful as intermediates of the biphenyl derivatives, and it also relates to intermediates which are useful in their production.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">As the process for producing tetrazole compounds such as 2-(tetrazol-5-yl)-4-oxo-4H-benzopyran derivatives, 2-(tetrazol-5-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl derivative and 5-phenyl-tetrazole derivatives, there has been known a process with an azide such as sodium azide, trialkyl tin azide or trimethylsilyl azide.</p>
    <p num="6">
      However, since azides are reacted with water or acids to produce hydrogen azide having toxic and explosive properties, the concentration of hydrogen azide in the gas phase in the upper part of a reactor should be strictly controlled during the reaction.
      <br/>
      It has been known that azides are liable to form an explosive salt with heavy metals.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the application of such a process with an azide on an industrial scale is disadvantageous from the viewpoint of its safety.
      <br/>
      Further, tin reagents such as trialkyl tin azide have drawbacks that they require a complicated procedure for the isolation of a product because of its lipophilicity and that tin-containing waste matters are formed in large quantities.
    </p>
    <p num="7">As the process for producing 2-(tetrazol-5-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl derivatives or 5-phenyltetrazole derivatives, another process is described in J. Org. Chem., 1991, 56, pp. 2395-2400, in which process biphenylcarboxylic acids or phenylcarboxylic acids are converted into their amides with cyanoethylamine, followed by chlorination with phosphorous pentachloride, and reaction with hydrazine and then with dinitrogen tetroxide gas.</p>
    <p num="8">This process, however, has disadvantages that the yield of a desired product is not satisfactory, that the step of deprotecting a cyanoethyl group used as a protecting group is needed, and that the production on an industrial scale finds difficulty in using phosphorous pentachloride.</p>
    <heading>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing tetrazole compounds with safety in an industrially favorable manner.</p>
    <p num="10">It is another object of the present invention to provide intermediates useful for the production of the tetrazole compounds.</p>
    <p num="11">These and other objects and excellent advantages will be understood from the following description.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The present inventors have intensively studied on a process for producing tetrazole compounds.
      <br/>
      As a result, they have found that the above problems can be solved and the desired products can be obtained with safety in an industrially favorable manner by a process through amidrazone compounds with nitrile compounds as the starting materials, and they have made further studies, thereby completing the present invention.

    <p num="51">The tetrazole compound (1) can also be produced by reacting nitrile (2) with hydrogen sulfide, followed by reaction with alkyl halide (4), with hydrazine or a salt thereof, and then with nitrous acid compound (3).</p>
    <p num="52">The reaction of nitrile (2) with hydrogen sulfide can be effected as follows.</p>
    <p num="53">
      The reaction of nitrile (2) with hydrogen sulfide makes it possible to obtain a thioamide of general formula (7):

      The amount of hydrogen sulfide to be used is usually from 1 to 100 moles, preferably from 1 to 50 moles, and more preferably 1 to 10 moles, relative to nitrile (2).
      <br/>
      The above reaction may be effected with the addition of a base as a catalyst, typical examples of which are alkylamines such as triethylamine, tributylamine and dimethylamine.
      <br/>
      The amount thereof is usually from 1 to 20 moles, relative to nitrile (2).

      As the solvent to be used, there can be mentioned hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and hexane; halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane and chlorobenzene; nitrated hydrocarbons such as nitrobenzene and nitromethane; ethers such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran; amides such as dimethylformamide; and alcohols such as methanol and ethanol.
      <br/>
      These can be used alone or as a mixture of two or more kinds of solvents.
      <br/>
      The amount of solvent to be used, although it can be appropriately determined, is usually from 1 to 100 times as much as the weight of nitrile (2).

      The reaction temperature is usually from-78 (degree)  to +150 (degree)  C., preferably from -50 (degree)  to +100 (degree)  C. The completion of the reaction can be monitored by an analytical method such as liquid chromatography.
      <br/>
      Usually, the disappearance of isothioamide (8) can be considered as the end point of the reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="77">After completion of the reaction, a hydrogen halide salt of amidrazone (6) can be isolated, for example, by an ordinary procedure such as extraction or filtration.</p>
    <p num="78">In general, amidrazone (6) is often unstable in free form, and therefore, when isolated, amidrazone (6) is preferably converted into its salt with hydrogen halide or the like.</p>
    <p num="79">The amidrazone (6) or a salt thereof can also be obtained by reacting thioamide (7) with hydrazine or a salt thereof.</p>
    <p num="80">This reaction can be effected similarly to the above reaction of a hydrogen halide salt of isothioamide (8) with hydrazine or a salt thereof.</p>
    <p num="81">The reaction of a hydrogen halide salt of amidrazone (6) with nitrous acid compound (3) can be effected as follows.</p>
    <p num="82">The reaction of a hydrogen halide salt of amidrazone (6) with a nitrous acid compound makes it possible to produce tetrazole compound (1).</p>
    <p num="83">This reaction can be effected similarly to the above reaction of amidrazone (6) with nitrous acid compound (3).</p>
    <p num="84">
      Thus, according to the present invention, it is possible to produce tetrazole compounds in a simple and industrially favorable manner without using any azide or any tin compound which is not desirable from the viewpoint of safety and waste matters treatment.
      <br/>
      The amide (5), which is the compound of the present invention, is useful as an intermediate for the production of tetrazole compounds.

    <p num="140">The filtrate was concentrated to remove the solvent, followed by the same work up as described in Example 32, (2) to give 4.75 g (93.1% purity) of 5-(2-bromophenyl)tetrazole.</p>
