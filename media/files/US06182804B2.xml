    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to a high performance two-ply fibrous base material.
      <br/>
      The fibrous base has a primary layer and a secondary layer which are joined together during a wet paper making process.
      <br/>
      The two-ply fibrous base material is useful in friction material applications.

      The two-ply friction material of the present invention has increased mechanical strength, thermal conductivity, dynamic friction, and wear resistant characteristics.

    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="4">
      New and advanced transmission systems and braking systems are being developed by the automotive industry.
      <br/>
      These new systems often involve high energy requirements.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the friction materials technology must be also developed to meet the increasing energy requirements of these advanced systems.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In particular, a new high energy type friction material is needed.
      <br/>
      The new high energy friction material must be able to withstand high speeds wherein surface speeds are up to about 65 m/second.
      <br/>
      Also, the friction material must be able to withstand high facing lining pressures up to about 1500 psi.
      <br/>
      It is also important that the friction material be useful under limited lubrication conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The friction material must be durable and have high heat resistance in order to be useful in the advanced transmission and braking systems.
      <br/>
      Not only must the friction material remain stable at high temperatures, it must have excellent thermal conductivity, that is, the friction material also be able to rapidly dissipate the high heat that is being generated during operating conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The high speeds generated during engagement and disengagement of the new transmission and braking systems mean that a friction material must be able to maintain a relatively constant friction throughout the engagement.
      <br/>
      It is important that the frictional engagement be relatively constant over a wide range of speeds and temperatures in order to minimize "shuddering" of materials during braking or the transmission system during power shift from one gear to another.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Previously, asbestos fibers were included in the friction material for temperature stability.
      <br/>
      For example, the Arledter et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3,270,846 patent describes phenolic and phenolic-modified resins used with asbestos.
      <br/>
      Now, however, due to health and environmental problems, asbestos is no longer being used.
      <br/>
      More recent friction materials have attempted to overcome the absence of the asbestos in the friction material by modifying the impregnating paper or fiber materials with phenolic or phenolic-modified resins.
      <br/>
      These friction materials, however, do not rapidly dissipate the high heat generated, and do not have the necessary heat resistance and satisfactory high coefficient of friction performance now needed for use in the high speed systems currently being developed.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Friction materials are often used in "wet" applications where the friction material is "wetted" or impregnated with a liquid such as brake fluid or automatic transmission fluid during use.
      <br/>
      During use of the "wet" friction material, the fluid is ultimately squeezed from or is impregnating the friction material.
      <br/>
      Wet friction materials differ greatly, both in their compositions and physical characteristics from "dry" friction materials.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In order for friction materials to be useful in "wet" applications, the friction material must have a wide variety of acceptable characteristics.
      <br/>
      The friction material must be resilient or elastic yet resistant to compression set, abrasion and stress; have high heat resistance and be able to dissipate heat quickly; and, have long lasting, stable and consistent frictional performance.
      <br/>
      If any of these characteristics are not met, optimum performance of the friction material is not met.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Thus, it is also important that a suitable friction lining or fibrous base material be used to form a high energy application friction material.
      <br/>
      The friction material must have good shear strength both when saturated with the wet resin during impregnation and when saturated with brake fluid or transmission oil during use.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      It is also important, under certain applications, that the friction material have high porosity such that there is a high fluid permeation capacity during use.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is important that the friction material not only be porous, it must also be compressible.
      <br/>
      The fluids permeated into the friction material must be capable of being squeezed or released from the friction material quickly under the pressures applied during operation of the brake or transmission, yet the lining material must not collapse.
      <br/>
      It is also important that the friction material have high thermal conductivity to also help rapidly dissipate the heat generated during operation of the brake or transmission.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Friction materials which met these demanding characteristics often include a fibrous base material having aramid-type fibers.
      <br/>
      However, these fibers and other ingredients used in the fibrous base material are expensive which increases the cost of the friction material.
    </p>
    <p num="14">As far as is known, there is no disclosure of a friction material for use in transmission systems which includes two-plies or layers of fibrous base materials which have sufficient strength to be useful in high energy applications.</p>
    <p num="15">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved friction material with reliable and improved properties compared to those of the prior art.</p>
    <p num="16">A further object of this invention is to provide friction materials with high thermal conductivity, porosity and strength.</p>
    <p num="17">As a result of extensive research in view of the need for a better friction material, a friction material with improved characteristics has now been developed.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="18">
      In order to achieve the requirements discussed above, many materials were evaluated for friction and heat resistant characteristics under conditions similar to those encountered during operation.
      <br/>
      Both commercially available brake linings and transmission materials were investigated and proved not to be suitable for use in high energy applications.
      <br/>
      The present invention is especially useful in brakes and in clutch applications.
      <br/>
      In one aspect, the present invention provides a fibrous base material comprising two-plies or layers of material.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The two-ply fibrous base material comprises a primary or bottom layer and a secondary or top layer adjacent the first layer.
      <br/>
      The secondary layer has a high temperature, high energy and low compression set formulation.
      <br/>
      The secondary layer comprises high temperature resistant and high strength fibers and friction paper-forming materials such as, for example, aramid fibers, carbon fibers, cotton or other cellulose fibers, fillers and/or phenolic or novoloid fibers and in certain embodiments, carbon particles and/or graphite particles.
      <br/>
      The first layer is more elastic and more oil absorbent that the second layer.
      <br/>
      The primary layer is highly porous, non-linearly elastic and has a low compression set.
      <br/>
      The primary layer comprises non-linearly elastic fibers such as aramid pulp and/or fibers, cotton fibers, and fillers, and in certain embodiments carbon particles and/or graphite particles.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Another aspect of the present invention relates to the two-ply fibrous base material impregnated with at least one suitable resin for forming a friction material.
      <br/>
      The two-ply friction material is especially useful for friction materials for clutch friction plates, bands, synchronizer rings and related transmission friction products.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The fibrous base material can be impregnated using different resin systems.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, it is useful to impregnate the fibrous based material with a phenolic resin or a modified phenolic-based resin.
      <br/>
      It has now been discovered that, in certain embodiments, when a silicone resin is blended or mixed with a phenolic resin in compatible solvents and that silicone-phenolic resin blend is used to impregnate a fibrous base material of the present invention, a high energy friction material is formed.
      <br/>
      Such high energy friction material has high friction stability and high heat resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The friction material of the present invention prevents uneven lining wear and therefore the formation of separator plate "hot spots" from developing during the useful life of the friction material.
      <br/>
      When there is little uneven wear on the friction material, there is more likelihood to maintain "steady state" of the clutch or brake components and therefore, more consistent performance of the clutch and brake.
      <br/>
      Further, the friction material of the present invention shows good shear strength such that the friction material resists delamination during use.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The layers of the two-ply fibrous base material are joined together during a wet paper making process.
      <br/>
      The primary or bottom layer of friction material is formed by mixing together fibers, fillers and/or friction particles to form a first layer or ply.
      <br/>
      The secondary or top layer of friction material is formed by mixing together fibers, fillers and/or friction particles and by depositing this mixture on top of the primary layer.
      <br/>
      The fibers in the primary layer interlock with the fibers in the secondary layer to provide optimum interface strength between the two plies of the fibrous base material.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, the secondary layer can comprise up from about 2% to about 50% of the total combined two-ply fibrous base material thickness.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments the secondary layer can have a composition where the phenolic or novoloid fibers provide bond strength between the carbon fibers and the phenolic or modified phenolic resin which is used to impregnate the two-ply fibrous base material.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      According to the present invention, the secondary layer contains ingredients chosen to achieve the performance requirements of a particular end-use application.
      <br/>
      The primary layer ingredients are selected such that they compliment the performance of the top layer.
      <br/>
      Proper selection of the combined secondary and primary layer ingredients influences characteristics of the friction material.
      <br/>
      Such performance characteristics as durability, friction wear, lubricity, permeability, elasticity and other related performance characteristics are enhanced using the two-ply material of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The two-ply friction material of the present invention possesses physical characteristics that are unattainable from a single-ply friction material.
      <br/>
      The two-ply friction material of the present invention is then saturated with a resin chosen to enhance the friction characteristics of the two-ply material.
      <br/>
      The two-ply material of the present invention has increased durability and high friction performance compared to single-ply friction materials.

    <heading>BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="27">
      In one aspect of the present invention provides a two-ply fibrous base material.
      <br/>
      The fibrous base material has a primary layer of one composition and a secondary layer bonded to the primary layer having a different composition.
      <br/>
      The thickness and composition of each layer can vary as the end use application needs change.
      <br/>
      The two-ply fibrous base material contains ingredients which provide optimum results for the end use friction applications.
      <br/>
      The secondary layer is adjacent the area of contact in a clutch or friction lining application.
      <br/>
      The use of the various ingredients in the secondary layer provides a cost efficient friction material and allows the optimum use of such ingredients that may have otherwise been eliminated from formulations because of high costs.
      <br/>
      Further, the secondary layer provides a structure that is especially useful in high energy applications.
      <br/>
      It is further surprisingly found that the two-ply friction material has increased friction characteristics and decreased wear.
      <br/>
      Further, the two-ply friction material is more durable than conventional friction materials.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In various embodiments of the present invention, the primary or bottom layer comprises a composition comprising, for example, at least one type of non-linearly elastic fiber such as high strength less fibrillated aramid fiber, cotton fibers, at least one type of filler material such as diatomaceous earth (celite), and in certain embodiments carbon particles and/or graphite particles.
      <br/>
      The secondary or upper layer has a composition which differs from the primary layer.
      <br/>
      The secondary layer comprises, for example, high temperature resistance and high strength fibers such as fibrillated aramid fibers and carbon fibers; phenolic or novoloid fibers; fillers and, in certain embodiments, carbon particles and/or graphite particles and optionally cotton fibers.
      <br/>
      The ingredients in the secondary layer provide optimum performance characteristics to the friction material while lowering the costs of manufacturing the friction material.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In other embodiments of the present invention, the primary layer and secondary layer can comprise the same or different compositions, and have different basis weights and/or densities.
      <br/>
      In especially preferred embodiments, the primary layer has a low density, while the secondary layer has a high density.
      <br/>
      In such embodiments, the primary and secondary layers can both comprise one or more types of fibers, fillers and friction particles.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Various types of fibrous or raw pulp materials are useful in the primary and/or secondary layers in the present invention.
      <br/>
      Partially useful fibrous materials can comprise cotton fibers, glass fibers, carbon fibers and/or aramid polyamide fibers such as aramid floc pulp and/or fibers which are generally designated as aromatic polycarbonamide materials.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      It is to be understood that various paper formulations are useful in the present invention and that other fibrous materials can be present in the fibrous base material formulations.
      <br/>
      For example, cotton burns at a relatively low temperature of approximately 350 (degree)  C. Therefore, a friction material has a range of expected thermal stability based on the ingredients used in the fibrous base material during the paper forming process.
      <br/>
      The fibrous base materials which comprise relatively high percentages of cotton fibers would be less thermally stable than fibrous base materials containing more thermally stable ingredients such as aramid pulps.
      <br/>
      The range and percentages of such ingredients are dependent upon the end use of the friction material and whether such friction material is to be subjected to moderate energy requirements or high energy requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Carbon fibers are useful in the secondary layer.
      <br/>
      The carbon fibers provide temperature resistance to the friction material matrix.
      <br/>
      The carbon fibers increase wear resistance and lining compression resistance.
      <br/>
      The carbon fibers also provide delamination resistance and noise or Squeal resistance.
      <br/>
      When a friction lining material is exhibiting these two characteristics, there is an improvement in fluid capillary flow through the friction material.
      <br/>
      The increase in compression resistance prevents or decreases the friction material's chance of collapsing such that the capillary flow is maintained and sometimes improved.
      <br/>
      In various embodiments, the carbon fibers can be present at a range of about 5% to about 30%, and preferably about 20%.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      It has surprisingly been found that when non-linearly elastic fibers such as less fibrillated aramid fibers having about a 525-650 CSF, preferably about 625 CSF, on the Canadian Standard Freeness index are included in the primary layer, there is an improvement in the strength of the fibrous base material.
      <br/>
      The less fibrillated aramid fibers also provide the primary or bottom layer with an increased porosity such that the friction material readily absorbs and desorbs the oil or other fluid.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      It has also been surprisingly found that when more fibrillated aramid fibers having about a 250-525 CSF, preferably about 300 on the Canadian Standard Freeness index are included in the secondary or top layer, the top layer is less porous than the primary or bottom layer.
      <br/>
      The more fibrillated aramid fibers generally have many fibrils attached to a core fiber material.
      <br/>
      The length of the fibrillated fiber ranges from about 0.5 to about 6 mm.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, it is preferred to have fibers having a Canadian Standard Freeness ranging from about 150 to about 450 and most preferably about 200-300.
      <br/>
      The "Canadian Standard Freeness" (T227 om-85) means that the degree of fibrillation of fibers can be described as the measurement of freeness of the fibers.
      <br/>
      The Canadian Standard Freeness test is an empirical procedure which gives an arbitrary measure of the rate at which suspension of three grams of fibers in one liter of water may be drained.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the fibrillated aramid fibers have a lower freeness or a lower rate of drainage than other less fibrillated aramid fibers or pulp.
    </p>
    <p num="35">The more fibrillated aramid fibers in the fibrous base material act to hold or retain the filler material onto the surface of the fibrous base material.</p>
    <p num="36">
      The damping effect of the filler material which is held onto the surface of the fibrous base material by the fibrillated aramid fibers also causes the friction material to have better elastic properties.
      <br/>
      If vibration does occur, especially at low speeds, the friction material is elastic enough to absorb or dampen the vibrations and prevent shuddering.
      <br/>
      The size of the filler material is preferred to be in the range of about 6 to about 38 microns in diameter and most preferably having a mean diameter size of about 10 to about 15 microns and in certain embodiments, about 12 microns.
      <br/>
      It has been discovered that if the size is too large, the surface of the friction material is too rough.
      <br/>
      If the filler particle size is too small, then the filler material become too densely packed in the fibrous base material and the resulting friction material is not sufficiently porous to quickly absorb the automatic transmission fluid and effectively to dissipate heat.

      The less fibrillated aramid fibers generally have few fibrils attached to a core fiber.
      <br/>
      The use of the less fibrillated aramid fibers provides a friction material having a more porous structure; i.e., there are more and larger pores than if a typical fibrillated aramid fiber is used.
      <br/>
      The porous structure is generally defined by the pore size and liquid permeability.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the fibrous base material defines pores ranging in mean average size from about 2.0 to about 15 microns in diameter.
      <br/>
      The length of the less fibrillated fiber ranges from about 0.5 to about 6 mm and has a Canadian Standard Freeness (CSF) of greater than about 450 and in certain embodiments, about 500 to about 550 and in other certain embodiments, about 580-640 and most preferably about 620-640.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Therefore, the less fibrillated aramid fibers have higher freeness or higher rate of drainage of fluid from the friction material than other aramid fibers or pulp.
      <br/>
      Friction materials comprising the aramid fibers having a CSF ranging from about 530-650, preferably about 580-640, and most preferably about 620-640, provide superior friction performance and have better material properties than friction materials containing conventionally more fibrillated aramid fibers.
      <br/>
      It has surprisingly been found that primary layers comprising less fibrillated aramid fibers having the longer fiber length, together with the high Canadian freeness, provide a friction material with high strength, high porosity and good wear resistance.
      <br/>
      High energy tests conducted with materials containing, for example, the less fibrillated aramid fibers (CSF about 580-640), have good long-term durability and stable coefficients of friction.

      The more porous the structure of the friction material, the more efficient is the heat dissipation.

      The secondary or top layer also includes novoloid fibers which comprise a cross-linked phenol-formaldehyde polymer.

      In certain embodiments, it has been found that a combination of novoloid fibers wherein one fiber type has a relatively shorter length with an average length of about 0.2 mm and another fiber type has a relatively longer length with an average length of about 3 mm is especially useful.
      <br/>
      While not wishing to be held to any one theory, it is believed that the relatively shorter fibers act more like particles than like fibers and therefore act like a binder type material in the friction material.
      <br/>
      The shorter particle-like novoloid fibers provide an improved strength to the friction paper.
      <br/>
      The relatively longer fibers, provides strength and structure to the friction material by preventing collapse of the friction material when the friction material is under pressure.
      <br/>
      While not wishing to be held to any particular theory, it is believed that the novoloid fibers, which are chemically similar to the phenolic resins which are present in the friction material, bond to the phenolic resin material to help provide both mechanical and chemical strength to the friction material.

      The use of graphite in the primary and/or secondary layers of the fibrous base material provides an oriented or three-dimensional structure to the fibrous base material.
      <br/>
      Graphite has a high thermal conductivity due to its three-dimensional structure, which, in turn, provides the friction material with the ability to dissipate heat rapidly.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      In various embodiments, various types of suitable graphite are contemplated as being useful with the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, graphite can be made by graphitization of a raw stock material such as petroleum coke and a coal tar pitch binder.
      <br/>
      The raw materials are mixed and heated to temperatures of about 2800 to about 3000 (degree)  C. and special graphitizing furnaces which convert the baked carbon body into a polycrystalene graphite article.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, it is preferred that the size and geometry of the graphite be in the range of about 20 to about 50 m. In certain embodiments, it has been discovered that if the graphite particle is too large or too small, there is not the optimum three-dimensional structure and consequently the heat resistant is not as optimum.

    <p num="43">
      The primary and/or secondary layers of the fibrous base material can include carbon particles which have high thermal conductivity.

      The carbon particles also provides the friction material with good friction characteristics such as a good or smooth "feel" in shift and essentially noise or "squawk" free operation of the brakes and clutches.

      The carbon particles are less structured and more randomly structured than graphite particles and are typically made by processing various substrates at relatively lower temperatures (e.g., 1000 (degree)  C.).

      It is to be understood that various fillers are useful in both the primary and secondary layers of the two-ply fibrous base material of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In particular, silica fillers such as diatomaceous earth (celite) and/or silica are especially useful.
      <br/>
      The celite is an inexpensive organic filler which bonds strongly to the fibrous materials.
      <br/>
      The strong bonds provide high mechanical strength to the friction material.
      <br/>
      The celite also provides high coefficients of friction to the friction material.
      <br/>
      The celite also provides the friction material with a smooth friction surface and provides a good "shift feel" and friction characteristics to the friction material.

      In certain embodiments, processing aids such as latex type materials, silicon nitride and other friction particles can be included in the primary and/or secondary layers.
      <br/>
      When silicon nitride powder is incorporated into the fibrous base material formulation, there is an improvement in the dynamic coefficient of friction characteristics in the resulting friction material.
      <br/>
      This is especially surprising since fibers of silicon nitride are not suitable for inclusion in friction materials due to their abrasiveness of the silicon nitride fibers to the clutch or brake parts.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, the silicon nitride particles have an average diameter of size from about 0.5 to about 1.5 microns.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, it has been found that silicon nitride particles having an average diameter size of about 1 micron work exceptionally well.
      <br/>
      One type of silicon nitride particles is available as Si3 N4.
      <br/>
      The silicone nitride particles increase the dynamic coefficient of friction when used at low levels of about 3% to about 15%.
      <br/>
      In various preferred embodiments, the silicone nitride composition can comprise from about 4% to about 6%.

      The present invention provides a two-ply friction material having a high initial coefficient of friction.
      <br/>
      Further, when the dynamic coefficient of friction is close to the static coefficient of friction, there is a smooth transfer from one gear to another in a clutch operation.

      The degree of toughness that a resin exhibits may be reflected by the friction material being able to maintain its integrity when tested.

      A friction material impregnated with a brittle resin may crack under a heavy load which acts to collapse the open porous structure of the friction material matrix.

      On the other hand, a friction material impregnated with an elastomeric resin would provide desired coefficient and torque, but may lack the wear resistance and strength required to hold the friction material matrix intact.

      In contrast, the powder particles of silicone resins and phenolic resins are partially cured.

      <br/>
      The presence of a silicone resin, when blended with a phenolic resin and used to impregnate a fibrous base material, causes the resulting friction materials to be more elastic than fibrous base materials impregnated only with a phenolic resin.
      <br/>
      When pressures are applied to the silicone-phenolic resin blended impregnated friction material of the present invention, there is a more even distribution of pressure which, in turn, reduces the likelihood of uneven lining wear.

      After the fibrous base material has been impregnated with the resin, the impregnated fibrous base material is heated to a desired temperature for a predetermined length of time to form the friction material.
      <br/>
      The heating cures the phenolic resin at a temperature of about 300 (degree) -350 (degree)  F. When other resins are present, such as a silicone resin, the heating cures the silicone resin at a temperature of about 400 (degree)  F.

    <p num="128">
      Ply adhesion of a two-ply paper is defined as the resistance of layers to splitting when a force is applied at right angles to the faces of the sheet.
      <br/>
      This parameter is specifically useful for the ranking of raw friction materials.
      <br/>
      Ply adhesion can be increased through saturating a sheet with almost any polymeric material.
      <br/>
      Three factors can effect the ply adhesion of latex saturated papers: (1) the quantity and kind of polymer in the sheet, (2) the adhesion of the polymer to the fibers, and (3) the arrangement of the fibers in the sheet.
      <br/>
      The latex can provide additional ply adhesion to the two-ply material until the phenolic resin has been cured.

      More exotic and expensive materials can be used in the secondary layer which, in preferred embodiments, can be relatively thin.

      Materials with a high energy capacity are required in some clutch applications.

      Typically, high friction coefficient is not as important as a high thermal resistance from such material.

      The energy capacity of the friction materials can be increased by utilizing an elastomeric particle in the formulations.

      Assemblies made with Compar. 7 material at a higher 45% pick-up level, were able to successfully complete the 528C type test.
      <br/>
      This material, which includes the nitrile type elastomeric friction particle, had a final dynamic friction of 0.123 and only 4.0 mils pack loss.
      <br/>
      The Compar. 7 material tested with a 8.1% dynamic friction fade.
      <br/>
      Abrasion and glazing were ranked "2", while breakout was "1", and delamination a "0".
      <br/>
      In comparison, the one-ply material (Compar. 3) with a 44% phenolic resin pick-up was stopped after 550 cycles.
      <br/>
      There is essentially no improvement when resin pick-up goes from 35% to 44% with one-ply material.
      <br/>
      Exchanging the isoprene elastomeric friction particle with the nitrile elastomeric friction particle in the formulation -1A, and increasing resin pick-up, gives the material additional energy capacity.
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      The Compar. 7 material was saturated with silicone resin at a 47% pick-up level.
      <br/>
      This material had a final dynamic friction coefficient of 0.151, with 16.1% dynamic friction fade.
      <br/>
      The pack loss was 0.0 mils.
      <br/>
      Surface appearance was excellent after testing.
      <br/>
      The abrasion, breakout, and delamination were all ranked "0", while the glazing was "1".
      <br/>
      Using silicone resin in conjunction with nitrile elastomeric friction particle in the formulation -1A increases lining wear resistance, friction coefficient, and improves assembly surface appearance rankings.

    <p num="145">
      Single-ply material (Compar. 3) at 135 lb. basis weight was unable to successfully complete the 528C test with 40% or 35% phenolic resin pick-up, as seen Table 13 above.

      These tests were stopped after roughly 600 cycles.
    </p>
    <p num="146">However, the two-ply material with formulation -1 as the top layer (Ex. I), and 41% phenolic resin pickup, was able to successfully complete the test with a final dynamic friction coefficient of 0.131, 5.8% friction fade, and 9.0 mils of pack loss, as seen Table 13 above.</p>
    <p num="147">
      When the single-ply material (Compar. 3) is saturated with silicone resin at 45% pick-up, the final dynamic friction increases to 0.155 with a 10.4% friction fade, and 0 mils pack loss, as seen Table 13 above.
      <br/>
      Assembly surface glazing was ranked "1" and abrasion, breakout, and delamination all ranked "0".
      <br/>
      The use of the silicone resin has improved the friction and wear performance of one-ply friction material under these test conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      The two-ply material (Ex. I) which has Formulation -1 on the top was saturated with a silicone resin at 43% and 56% pick-up levels.

      Both tests had a final dynamic friction level of roughly 0.174 with about 5.5 mils of pack loss and 8.2% friction fade.
      <br/>
      Surface condition of the lining was excellent after testing.
      <br/>
      Only glazing was ranked "1", abrasion, breakout, and delamination were all ranked "0." The two-ply material resulted in high friction than the single-ply material.
      <br/>
      Again, the Formulation -1 material with the silicone performed with higher friction than the phenolic resin saturated material.

    <p num="149">FIG. 5 shows the number of cycles versus friction curves for formulation material with the alterations made for increasing durability and friction for the Compar. 3 and Ex. I.

    <heading>EXAMPLE IV</heading>
    <p num="150">
      A variation in friction material density influences the friction and wear performance of an assembly.
      <br/>
      The single-ply material and two-ply materials with different density combinations have been evaluated.
      <br/>
      Two-ply material density combinations evaluated were primary and secondary layers having the same density (Ex. J), primary layer having a high density and secondary layer having a low density (Ex. K), and primary layer having a low density and secondary layer having a high density (Ex. L), as seen in Table 15 below.
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      The same material formulation was used for both the primary (bottom) and secondary (top) layers of the two-ply friction material.
      <br/>
      However, the examples which comprise high density layers contain more "mechanically" refined cotton material.
      <br/>
      The refining of the cotton fibers increases the fibrillation of the fibers and lowers the Canadian Standard Freeness Number (CFN).
      <br/>
      The CFN (as tested by the T227om-94 Test Method approved by the TAPPI) becomes low as the amount of refining or fibrillation of the fiber material increases.
      <br/>
      The density increases as the amount of fibrillation increases (i.e., as the CFN decreases).
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that "normal" or standard cotton fibers have an average CFN of about 550, while extra "refined" cotton fibers have an average CFN of about 450.
      <br/>
      Thus, the standard cotton fibers (about 550 CFN) produce relatively low density sheets or layers of fibrous base material while the refined cotton fibers (about 450 CFN) produce relatively high density sheets or layers of fibrous base material.

      This material had only 0.8 mils pack loss and 9% fiction fade.
      <br/>
      However, the same material cured at 400 (degree)  F. tested with 21.0 mils of pack wear and 13% friction fade.
      <br/>
      Thus, when silicone resin was used there was better pack loss performance and friction performance, which reflects the proper curing of the resin.
