    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>

      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device manufacturing method, a manufacturing apparatus, a simulation method and a simulator and, more particularly, to a semiconductor device manufacturing method capable of proceeding semiconductor device manufacturing processes according to predetermined schedules or while correcting them by expanding limited quantity or quality contents of "in situ" measured values at their maximum in a sheet type or clustered semiconductor device manufacturing apparatus without using testpieces, a manufacturing apparatus, a simulation method and a simulator.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventionally, semiconductor device manufacturing apparatuses have come to the present circumstance after following changes.
      <br/>
      If such manufacturing apparatus are considered along a series of respective generations, then a chip cost in the DRAM generation and respective generations is varied, as shown in FIG. 128, as capacity is increased from a 64K device to a 256 M device.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 128, the ordinate is represented by setting a chip cost in a 1 M device as 1.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 128, plotted points indicate chip cost and the abscissa denotes DRAM generations.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      As shown in FIG. 128, from the 64K device to the 256K device, the number of steps is relatively stable and also the chip cost is stable.
      <br/>
      However, as generations are updated from a 4M device, the number of steps is increased and also the chip cost is increased correspondingly.
      <br/>
      In order to reduce increase in the cost due to the increase in the number of steps as much as possible, as shown in FIG. 128, reduction in cost has been intended by anticipating various countermeasures, e.g., 1) exclusion of waste, 2) standardization of operation, 3) reduction in chip size, 4) promotion of miniaturization, 5) improvement of productivity, 6) promotion of FA, 7) large bore size, etc. in the 64 M device, for instance.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the 256 M device, by making use of application of new material, introduction of the dielectric substance with high dielectric constant, application of new structure, employment of the solid structure, etc., design has been made along a bi-rule.
      <br/>
      However, situation is changed completely in the 1G class device and it becomes unclear whether or not design can be made along the bi-rule.
      <br/>
      According to the conventional approach which pursues high performance of respective manufacturing apparatuses fabricating up to the conventional 256 class device to the limit, it becomes difficult to seek a solution to the enterprise yet.
      <br/>
      To pursue high performance of respective manufacturing apparatuses to the limit brings about directly high cost.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      As shown in FIG. 129, high performance apparatus is used for every step in the sequence of steps A-B-C-D-E-F, for example.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is evident that increase in equipment area and increase in cost are brought: about.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In addition, one more condition to be kept: in mind is that various precise controls due to physical necessity are indispensable in respective steps to more than 1G class device.
      <br/>
      For example, there are cut-off of contamination, elimination of natural oxide film, pursuit of planarization at atomic level, etc.
      <br/>
      At present, a clustered manufacturing apparatus as shown in FIG. 130, though yet at a study stage, has been proposed as a new concept, with considering these circumstances.
      <br/>
      The clustered manufacturing apparatus (clustered tool) may be made up as a batch type one, but mainly as a sheet type one.
      <br/>
      As can be seen from FIG. 130, for example, a carrying system is installed in the middle and respective steps are advanced sequentially as shown by an arrow like A-B-C-D.
      <br/>
      At this time, in many cases the chamber is held at high vacuum at respective steps and in respective steps, so that deposition of natural oxide film can be decreased.
      <br/>
      In addition, cut-off of contamination and surface control at atomic level are enabled.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In the meanwhile, as for the field effect MIS device formed on the semiconductor, a ferroelectric substance is of necessity directed toward thin film in the course of recent technical development for the high speed and high integration density device.
      <br/>
      If the ferroelectric substance is formed as a thin film, then a threshold voltage is of course reduced small.
      <br/>
      As a result, main operation speed is accelerated correspondingly so that especially an AC characteristic can thus be remarkably improved.
      <br/>
      If EEPROM, etc. are considered, then working condition of the device becomes very severe with the progress of miniaturization.
      <br/>
      In such case, according to the ferroelectric film formed by the conventional ordinary manufacturing method, sufficient reliability cannot be achieved yet.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      However, under such circumstance that, even if the MIS device is miniaturized, characteristic improving measures of the ferroelectric substance per se are not so regarded and as a result power supply voltage is not so reduced, high electric field would be applied to the gate ferroelectric film particularly upon main operation.
      <br/>
      Still further, electrons and holes generated from the channel region by impact ions are injected into the ferroelectric film according to boundary conditions such as polarity of gate electrodes, drain voltage, etc.
      <br/>
      These carriers are trapped by the ferroelectric film, so that not only long term reliability is lowered but also reduction in breakdown voltage, eta are caused.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Further, the device will be examined at atomic level.
      <br/>
      In a thermal ferroelectric film, if high electric field is applied to a silicon ferroelectric film, for example, then Si--O bonds constituting a network interact with high electric field which is applied externally.
      <br/>
      Then, the bonds are cut off and then trapping centers to trap electrons and holes are formed.
      <br/>
      Then, electrons and holes being passed subsequently are trapped by the trapping centers.
      <br/>
      Then, intensity distribution of electric field in the film thickness direction is increased locally rather than an average electric field.
      <br/>
      In the end, dielectric breakdown is brought out.
      <br/>
      In recent years, ideas to form the ferroelectric film as single crystal, although still yet at an academic society level, are begun to be proposed to improve such circumstance.
      <br/>
      For purposes of example, it has been reported in J. Appl. Phys., Vol.69(12), p.8313 (1991) that cerium oxide (CeO2) is grown as a single crystal on a silicon (111) face.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, it has been reported in Japan, J. Appl. Phys. Suppl., Vol.21-1, p.187 (1982) that calcium fluoride (CaF2) is grown as a single crystal on the silicon single crystal.
      <br/>
      These are merely several examples.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In addition, they still remain only in an idea stage and there are some doubts about calculation methods providing the base of guide.
      <br/>
      In the case that the ferroelectric film is taken as one example, a single crystal per se of the ferroelectric film is not sufficiently recognized.
      <br/>
      A report concerning the structure of this single crystal ferroelectric film will be checked.
      <br/>
      There is A. Miyamoto, K. Takeichi, T. Hattori, M. Kubo, and T. Inui, "Mechanism of Layer-Layer Homoopitaxial Growth of SrTiO.about.(100) as Investigated by Molecular Dynamics and Computer Graphics", Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. Vol.31, (1992) 4463-4464.
      <br/>
      In this paper, when a perovskite as a single crystal ferroelectric film is adhered to an underlying Si substrate, a stable structure is calculated.
      <br/>
      However, initial alignment of angle and distance between Si--O--Ti or Ti--Si--Sr is used incorrectly.
      <br/>
      Since the structure of the single crystal ferromagnetic film is simplified in these papers, the guide is not always correct.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      As understood from the above, it is the existent status that how to design the single crystal ferromagnetic film is scarcely correctly discussed.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, as for the ferromagnetic film itself, improvement of the characteristic yet remains in refinement of the forming process.
      <br/>
      For example, preparation of as clean surface as possible previously sputter temperature and sputter atmosphere to form the film, and the like are discussed all the time.
      <br/>
      We cannot but say that recognition as for the structures of the single crystal ferroelectric film and the ferroelectric film is yet at an extremely low level in these papers.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since reason for occurrence of spontaneous polarization in the ferroelectric substance and relationship between the spontaneous polarization and the crystal structure have not been analyzed in these papers, their discussions are concluded as mere phenomenal analyses.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      However, the most significant difficulty confronted at present in the above new clustered tools is a circumstance observing approach.
      <br/>
      That is, in the case of the apparatus executing a single step, wafers each of which is called testpieces are first introduced into respective steps.
      <br/>
      Then, it is tested by measuring film thickness, refractive index, etc. with the use of such testpieces whether or not processes are advanced along predetermined conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In monitoring conditions in respective clustered tools with the use of such testpieces, there are problems on quantitative and qualitative understanding.
      <br/>
      By way of example, usually an XPS equipment and an FT-IR equipment are used in film forming step or growth step of the oxide film.
      <br/>
      Even if such steps are monitored on an in-situ basis, meaning of such data is not sufficiently investigated at present.
      <br/>
      Judging from the location of peak wave number at best, it only can be determined whether or not predetermined substance is generated.
      <br/>
      Under such circumstance, most parts of determination rely upon judgement of the research worker.
      <br/>
      Still further, quantitative response cannot be taken and also quick response cannot be taken.
      <br/>
      If a new unknown substance which does not rely upon experience of the research worker is present, then no effective judgement can be done.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      On the contrary, use of molecular dynamics simulator has been proposed.
      <br/>
      However, in the molecular dynamics simulator, it has been pointed out that in general 1) calculation speed is very slow, and 2) execution range of object material is very small compared to process variation calculation program.
      <br/>
      Therefore, combination of the molecular dynamics simulator with the process variation calculation program has in no way been thought out up to now.
      <br/>
      More particularly, since the molecular dynamics simulator executes calculation very slowly, an overall calculation speed of the combination is restricted by such slow calculation speed after all even if the molecular dynamics simulator is combined with the process variation calculation program.
      <br/>
      Consequently, such combination is believed not to be suitable for practical use.
      <br/>
      Further, in the molecular dynamics simulator, a calculation range is extremely small, e.g., about several tens Angstrom at best.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it has been believed that, since a range on the order of several microns is calculated in the process variation calculation program, direct combination of the molecular dynamics simulator with the process variation calculation program is impossible from the viewpoint of deviation of the calculation range.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The inventors of the present invention have taken notice of free energy of overall system including the interface as installation condition of the single crystal ferroelectric film.
      <br/>
      Locations have been determined so as to minimize such free energy under applied condition, so that MIS devices with high reliability have been fabricated and levels have not been formed on the interface.
      <br/>
      In particular, upon calculating overall energy of the system, it is needed to reproduce firmly the structure of the single crystal ferroelectric film and to grasp strictly and precisely how respective atoms constituting the structure do move.
      <br/>
      The inventors of the present invention have completed ab initio molecular dynamics and have established an original potential integration method in the molecular dynamics to permit these calculations for the first time.
      <br/>
      In addition, in respect of ensuring sufficiently improvement of electric properties, etc., the inventors of the present invention have made clear up to the degree of quality of the single crystal ferroelectric film using this method.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      By way of example, if a high electric field is applied to a tunneling insulating film, then it interacts with bonds constituting a basic structure of the tunneling insulating film (e.g., Si--O bonds in the case of the silicon ferroelectric film) to cut off the bonds.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, electrons and holes passing through the tunneling insulating film are trapped by the cut-off bonds and therefore the electric field exceeds an average electric field locally according to charge distribution in the insulating film to thus accelerate degradation of the insulating film.
      <br/>
      It has been found by the inventors of the present invention that cut-off of the bonds (e.g., Si--O bonds) in the insulating film because of this electric field should be suppressed to suppress the progress of degradation.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Interaction between the electric field and the bonds in the insulating film depends on the direction of the electric field and the direction of the bonds in the insulating film.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in order to reduce interaction, the bonds in the insulating film which are directed to enhance such interaction must be reduced as much as possible.
      <br/>
      If the direction of the bonds are set completely at random like in amorphous films, then a part bonds in the insulating film is inevitably directed to enhance the interaction between the bonds and, the electric field.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="20">An object of the present invention is to control the direction of bonds in ferroelectric insulating film and suppress interaction between the film and an electric field and suppress degradation in dielectric property caused by the electric field.</p>
    <p num="21">
      This is concerned with the technology of forming a reliability dielectric film.
      <br/>
      Such technology is produced by the inventors of the present invention based on calculation results obtained by a new ab initio molecular dynamics system and original experimental data.
      <br/>
      If the single crystal ferroelectric film is utilized as ferroelectric film, etc., then the performance becomes poor rather than the amorphous ferroelectric film unless positional relationship between the substrate and substrate electrodes are optimized as well as selection of material per se.
      <br/>
      At this time, criteria of material and crystal orientation would be provided by the inventors.
      <br/>
      As new guides given by the inventors, we would dare to say one word, i.e., "Crystal location has to be selected so as to minimize free energy of the system under the main applied electric field".
      <br/>
      Still further, as a matter of practice, "In addition to location permitting free energy of the system to minimize under the main applied electric field, a tolerance limit of unevenness of free energy distribution to suppress deterioration in trigger, if viewed locally" is also mentioned.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Considering the single crystal ferroelectric film only, the structure is very complicated such that the tetrasymmetric perovskite has a very complicated structure and characteristics are significantly different according to combination of the substrate and the junction surface.
      <br/>
      However, the inventors of the present invention intend to derive "advantage" under the main operating voltage although "disadvantage" is caused in respect of crystallography.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Another object of the present invention is to overcome the problems of monitoring function caused in clustering, and to provide a semiconductor device manufacturing method capable of proceeding semiconductor device manufacturing processes according to predetermined schedules or while correcting them by expanding limited quantity or quality contents of "in situ" measured values at their maximum in a sheet type or clustered semiconductor device manufacturing apparatus without using testpieces, a manufacturing apparatus, a simulation method and a simulator.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The inventors of the present invention have developed a new variation calculation method using ab initio molecular dynamics and have also developed a simulation system which makes it possible to i) diagnose a superposition phenomenon of fluctuation of respective process factors and deviation of respective factors, ii) check whether or not processes are executed along predetermined sequences, and iii) find variation factors.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, characterizing features of this system are iv) to enable variation in processes to be dealt with mathematically and statistically with good efficiency, v) to equip the present system with a new inference engine, and vi) to equip the present system with a new reciprocal system.

    <p num="43">
      In the meanwhile, the inventors of the present invention can overcome the problems, in the molecular dynamics simulator, that a calculation speed is very slow as described above and that an executable range of object materials is very small, by introducing new ideas into the simulator, then provide a new approach to combine the molecular dynamics simulator with the process variation calculation program, and then derive new functions which being never achieved until now by using such combination.
      <br/>
      Such matters will be explained in sequence hereinbelow
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      At first, the problem of calculation speed will be discussed in detail.
      <br/>
      In the molecular dynamics, an equation of motion for each atom is set up in compliance with Newtonian mechanics, so to speak, and then simultaneous equations of motion for all atoms, e.g., one hundred or one thousand atoms to be considered are solved.
      <br/>
      Calculation of force as the basis of equation of motion is most complicated.
      <br/>
      This is because the calculation speed was slow in the prior art calculation method.
      <br/>
      Each atom receives force from its surrounding atoms.
      <br/>
      Each atom receives force from near atoms and distant atoms.
      <br/>
      This fact should be considered.
      <br/>
      In general, potential energy Vij derived in compliance with Tersoff's equation is calculated and then force is calculated based on this energy.
      <br/>
      However, in the prior art, such an approach has in general been taken, upon calculating potential, that tables of force applied to respective atoms have been prepared in advance based on distance, direction, etc. in each direction.
      <br/>
      In this approach, as for the above one hundred or one thousand atoms, the magnitudes of potential are calculated with reference to the tables every time.
      <br/>
      This procedure requires an extraordinary amount of time.
      <br/>
      Force cannot be derived from potential itself, but a gradient of the magnitude of potential relative to each direction provides force (see FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is, understood that an extreme amount of calculation time is required.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      It is the reason why numerical tables are prepared in this manner that equations representing potential profiles are extremely complicated.
      <br/>
      As described above, upon calculating potential V, mutual angles  THETA , distances r, etc. between surrounding atoms are entangled complicatedly to calculate locations of the surrounding atoms.
      <br/>
      Hence, it is very difficult to prepare a function by differentiating them mathematically.
      <br/>
      For example, though the angle  THETA  is a function of r, it becomes again a function of r after all.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In the event that calculations are in general very complicated in this manner and that factors in the equation representing potential are circulated as described above, the inventors of the present invention have prepared new higher order cyclic partial differential equations in the fields wherein partial differentiation has not been tried in the prior art.
      <br/>
      Thereby, though transformation of the equations per se becomes very complicated apparently, calculation of the equations can be executed very quickly.
      <br/>
      Hence, unlike the prior case, reference of the tables described above are not required.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Next, a most basic concept of the higher order cyclic partial differential equations will be discussed as follows.
      <br/>
      Under the assumption that three atoms are utilized, this concept will be discussed.
      <br/>
      In other words, if this concept can be described generally for three atoms, then this approach may be spread out to more generic cases.
      <br/>
      If there are three atoms, distances between atoms, angles between atoms to be concerned, etc. may be calculated.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, potential can be calculated uniquely, and thus "gradient" of the potential can be calculated readily based on such potential in any direction.
      <br/>
      By forming all partial differentiation equations as with variations cyclicly used and then solving simultaneous equations of such variations, the inventors of the present invention have confirmed that differentiation equations are properly prepared.

      An outline of a system according to the present invention will be explained particularly hereinbelow.

      To begin with, actual application of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIG. 1.

      In other words, a process device V is a part of a semiconductor manufacturing system which being actually operated.

    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The optical absorption spectrum observed by the spectral meter VI is stored as a file 4 once and then sent to a scheduler VII.
      <br/>
      Prediction values according to the present invention, described later, are also input into the scheduler VII.
      <br/>
      The observed values and the prediction values are compared by a comparison diagnosing/verifying portion IV.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      If the compared results obtained in the comparison diagnosing/verifying portion IV exceed a tolerance, then the results are removed from the line as the matters which do not satisfy the specification.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, if they satisfy the specification, their variations are sent to a process variation calculation unit 1 serving as an inference engine.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The process variation calculation unit I basically calculates macro quality without regard to atomic level and then stores the calculated results in a file 2.
      <br/>
      As the contents of the file 2, interatomic position vectors and bond angles are calculated by the molecular dynamics simulator II.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Then, interatomic position vectors and bond angles calculated by the molecular dynamics simulator II are input into a film characteristic calculation unit III, and basic film characteristics are calculated in the unit III and then sent back to a file 3.

      The basic film characteristics calculated by the film characteristic calculation unit III are also sent back to the process variation calculation unit I to use a part of parameters.

    <p num="54">
      In actuality, the contents of the molecular dynamics simulator II is especially important.
      <br/>
      In particular, as shown in a block diagram in FIG. 7, the molecular dynamics simulator II consists of two parts.
      <br/>
      The first part II1 utilizes the higher order cyclic partial differential method introduced by the inventors of the present invention, while the second part II2 executes analysis with regard to higher order term more than third order term.

      An overall configuration of a new simulation developed by the inventors of the present invention is shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      A new approach in which a molecular dynamics (MD) method is combined with a density functional theory (DFT) method will be proposed.
      <br/>
      First, proper use of the molecular dynamics method and the density functional theory method will be discussed with reference to FIG. 8 hereinbelow.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      As shown in FIG. 8, a molecular dynamics (MD) portion occupies the lower half of a flowchart while a density functional theory (DFT) portion occupies the upper half of the flowchart.
      <br/>
      The molecular dynamics (MD) method will deal with a slightly large system at a non-zero K temperature, i.e., finite temperature and such potential derived from the first principle in advance may be used as interatomic (inter-ion) potential.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the density functional theory (DFT) method will be used when a normal state of a small system is to be detected.
      <br/>
      The DFT portion is, of course, set at a zero K temperature.
      <br/>
      Potentials are detected from normal states of an electron system.
      <br/>
      In particular, wave function (KS (Kohn-Sham) equation) is solved and a local density functional theory is used together.

    <p num="63">

      In the right side of Eq.(1201), Vz (r) in the first term is external field such as Coulomb field in kernel and the second term is Coulomb interaction energy between electrons.

      The kinetic energy is given by  (Equation image '2' not included in text)

      <br/>
      Since n(r) is included in Eq.(1212), n(r),  PHI (r) and Veff (r) must be solved on a self-consistent basis.  (Equation image '4' not included in text)

      A profile of energy  EPSILON xc (n) has been proposed variously by Wigber's equation and others.

      In addition, if only valence electrons are considered without regard for inner-shell electrons, then Coulomb field in kernel is not used as Vz (r) in Eq.(1212) as it is, but is replaced by norm-conservation pseudopotential in which singularity in kernel is removed.
      <br/>
      The number of components in Fourier expansion has been able to be suppressed by treating in this manner.

      Temperature T of kinetic energy in Eq.(1222) corresponds.

      Since each degree of freedom has its temperature according to equipartition law of energy in the classical statistical mechanics, the temperature is not virtual one but real one if it is considered in connection with  SIGMA 1/2M1 R12.

      In general, in the molecular dynamics, interatomic potential is the most important quantity.
      <br/>
      In present status, considerably number of the molecular dynamics have simply discussed interatomic potential between only two atoms.
      <br/>
      This is because calculation in the molecular dynamics takes a great deal of time and therefore simple potential is utilized to save time.
      <br/>
      In this manner, if potential is simplified, calculation can be made quickly but actual potential cannot be reflected.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      As described above, important interatomic potential may generally be described as three-body problem.
      <br/>
      This meaning is as follows.
      <br/>
      That is, a third atom k affects an action between a first atom i and a second atom J via the second atom J. This is shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, r is a distance between particles, and  THETA  is particle angle.
      <br/>
      Dependent relations between these various physical properties are shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      Especially, as shown in FIG. 5, they are very complicated.
      <br/>
      Differentiation of potential can in general provide force, but calculation becomes very complicated.
      <br/>
      A relationship between the conventional calculation approach and the present invention is shown in FIG. 6.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      The inventors have newly developed a higher order cyclic partial differentiation method to thus enable calculation at high speed and with high precision.
      <br/>
      It will be described below how fast the method developed by the inventors of the present invention is, with reference to actual compariaon example.
      <br/>
      First, simple two-body potential calculation shown in FIG. 6 is not mentioned here.
      <br/>
      This is because precision which is available to describe physical phenomenon in a semiconductor LSI is seldom achieved by such calculation.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, as the conventional method, the inventors have formed the program for the table referring method by virtue of potential acting as three-body problem.
      <br/>
      According to such program, a table is prepared for rij,  THETA ijk, and rjk.
      <br/>
      Actually, they are stored as block data in an alignment.
      <br/>
      To prepare the case where they are excluded from reference items, the supplement program has also prepared.
      <br/>
      Cubic spline method is used to supplement.
      <br/>
      The program by which the table can be referred to certain values, i.e., rij,  THETA ijk, and rjk has been formed.
      <br/>
      However, to which matrix in the alignment predetermined conditions (rij,  THETA ijk, and rjk) belong must be searched.
      <br/>
      The inventors have formed the program while paying attention to operate at as high speed as possible, but there needed some parts to classify according to the magnitude of the figures and therefore "if then else" sentences are used therein.
      <br/>
      In this manner, it can be executed to find a certain frame of table into which desired conditions (rij,  THETA ijk, and rjk) are put and also to supplement the contents therein.
      <br/>
      Thus, first potential under the desired conditions (rij,  THETA ijk, and rjk) could be calculated, but actually force on this point is desired and must be calculated.
      <br/>
      The inventors have calculated potential on another point which is slightly deviated from the certain point according to similar procedures, and then force has been calculated from difference between them by making use of average rate of change, i.e., by differentiation.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      As evident from this, a plenty of "if then else" procedures have been used.
      <br/>
      The computer is relatively weak in executing such "if then else" procedures and its operation speed is slow.
      <br/>
      Actually, in the event that the referring type program developed by the inventors is employed, only a force calculating portion has been examined in detail.
      <br/>
      As a result, it takes about 350 times as long by the referring type program under the conditions that the single crystal substrate consists of 1600 Si atoms, absolute temperature is 300 K, and external pressure is 1 atm.
      <br/>
      As may be appreciated from the above, the higher order cyclic partial differentiation method proposed by the inventors is advantageous.
      <br/>
      Also, in the referring type program, different data table must be prepared every time when different atoms are to be calculated.
    </p>

      Usually, various evaluation techniques are used in the LSI process.

      There are physical property evaluation method of film by infrared absorption, stress evaluation method in film by Raman spectroscopy, structure analysis of film by X-ray, and others.
      <br/>
      Such evaluation techniques are not restricted to optical ones, but electric evaluation techniques such as dielectric constant of film may be used.

    <p num="115">
      The inventors have decomposed eagerly and theoretically the principles of respective evaluation approaches up to motion of individual atoms once to pursue in detail.
      <br/>
      Then, using the molecular dynamics developed by the inventors, motion of individual atoms are pursued and thus evaluation amount may be calculated theoretically for the first time.
      <br/>
      Hence, they can be directly displayed in a spectrum fashion, for example.
      <br/>
      Thereby, remarkable technical progress not yet achieved in the prior art, e.g., quantitative comparison with the measured values, has been achieved.

      Though several kinds of concept being present, basic concepts derived by the inventors are as follows.
      <br/>
      That is, moment of the atoms to be noted is calculated.
      <br/>
      Then, such moment is accumulated within the time window to be noted and thereafter is Fourier-transformed to obtain natural spectrum.

      These are the main essentials.

      Next, taking an example from Si, it will be discussed herein below how empirical potential is transformed to force by the inventors of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This discussion is only an example.
      <br/>
      Like the case of the problem of Si, higher order cyclic partial differentiation described herein may still be applied to potential of oxide film, for example, as three body problem unless effect generated by ionic bond is considered.

      Charge calculation is largely influenced by the value of JAB.
      <br/>
      Therefore, setting of the Slater orbit and the valence orbit index  ZETA  used in calculating J is important.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the inventors have investigated the value of J when Si--O and Si--Si are dealt with.
      <br/>
      Although Rappe et al. have assumed that "polarized charge is on the ns orbit", it is not clear that which orbits are optimal to be considered with respect to various elements.
      <br/>
      Since the major quantum number n of Si is 3, calculations are executed and the results are compared with each other in both cases where charges of Si are on 3s and they are on 2s.
      <br/>
      At this time, analytic expression of J at n=3 is prepared separately by the inventors in compliance with the Roothern's method.
      <br/>
      For instance,  (Equation image '57' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="204">is employed for Si--Si.</p>
    <p num="205">
      FIG. 21 shows calculation results of Coulomb interaction J between Si--Si.
      <br/>
      In this event, it is understood that the value of J is seldom varied if either of 2s and 3s is used.
      <br/>
      However, Coulomb interaction J between Si--O is largely varied according to 2s or 3s.
      <br/>
      Calculation results of JAB is shown in FIG. 22 in case a model is supposed wherein 0 charge is put on 2s and Si is located on 2s or 3s.
      <br/>
      If charge of Si is put on 3s only, then a minimal value of the value J appears near r=1.6 because 3s orbit is spread very widely.
      <br/>
      Since the Si--O bond distance Just locates there, J is estimated very small.
      <br/>
      As a result, it has been detected that either charge of Si and O has been underestimated extremely.
      <br/>
      It is true of Si--H, similarly.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if the 3s orbit is assumed boldly as the charge model of Si, then estimation of J has lost precision completely.
      <br/>
      According to the above, it has been confirmed that Slator orbit may be used only to consider spread of the charge and the Slator orbit of 1s or 2s may be used optimally as the model.
      <br/>
      It also has been found that this may be similarly applied to elements having atomic number succeeding to Si, and that Coulomb force at near interatomic distance may be calculated with very poor precision if the spread orbit after 3s is used as the model.

      The inventors have tried to use TTAM potential which has been developed by Tuneyuki et al. at first, but have found that Si--O asymmetrical stretching oscillations are expressed on the very low frequency side.
      <br/>
      Hence, the inventors have used BSK potential which has been developed by Van Beest et al.
      <br/>
      Although, in their potential, peaks appear on the higher frequency side rather than TTAM potential, stretching peaks are observed in lower wave number than the measured values.

      Although charge distribution can be calculated by a molecular orbit method in ideal case, it is impossible at present in practical case to calculate charge distribution as for the structure including several hundreds atoms.

      Calculations of a step induction stress in a wide region of several-micron level are performed in (2) or (3) according to input data on the side of a general-purpose three-dimensional process simulator (10), and these resultants are once transferred to a molecular dynamics simulator 11 via a file (22) or a file (32) or again returned to a general-purpose simulator (10), or this flow is repeated, whereby it is possible to use more precise and much more functions.

      As for a calculation procedure, for example, the resultants of the step induction stress calculation in a wide region to some degree which are acquired in a process tolerance calculation unit at a certain time are once transferred to the molecular dynamics simulator 11, and a correction amount of a physical constant is calculated therein, while movements of atoms are considered all over again and the corrected physical constant is again supplied to the general-purpose simulator, which advances the resultants of the step induction stress calculation etc. in a wide region.

      As for the point defect, a hollow lattice in a Si substrate and an inter-lattice Si are treated.

      In an ion implantation calculation portion (4), a great amount of hollow lattices and the inter-lattice Si due to implantation damages are, of course, generated.

      These are redistributed in a thermal step, but at that time, these have an interaction with impurities so that the interaction must be reflected to the calculation of impurity distribution.

      Further, a segregation constant of impurities on the interface is not made clear so much.

      In such cases, first entering a step (8), the resultants are immediately once transferred to the molecular dynamics simulator 11 as shown in (84) and potential etc. required for elements is calculated therein and the molecular dynamics portion is activated on the basis of the resultants to calculate a physical constant.

      The following steps are very similar to the portion described above and these physical constants are stored in a file from (83).

      On the other hand, one of the inventors has before proposed a process simulator system using a derivative of a process tolerance.
      <br/>
      Namely, the inventor has proposed in Japanese Patent Application No. SHO63-174331 and Japanese Patent Application No. HEI3-164904.
      <br/>
      In these proposals, respective steps such as oxidation and diffusion, ion implantation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), etching and lithography can be handled by fluidal handling.
      <br/>
      For example, in a diffusion step by a fluid model, a gross amount of impurity is distinguished from an amount of electrical activated impurity, while electrical effects are introduced to acquire a redistribution of impurity.
    </p>
    <p num="255">A schematic chart of the simulation system as shown in Japanese Patent Application No. SHO63-174331 and Japanese Patent Application No. HEI3-164904 will be explained with reference to FIGS. 25 to 33. These proposals handle the process tolerance as follows: When, for example, the steps of the oxidation, the ion implantation and the lithography are described as an example, there are provided an averaged temperature (T) and the allowable variation ( DELTA T), an averaged time (t) and the allowable variation ( DELTA t), an averaged pressure (P) and the allowable variation ( DELTA P), further an averaged mask dimension (L) and the allowable variation ( DELTA L), and an averaged dose (D) and the allowable variation ( DELTA D) etc. as input values.</p>
    <p num="256">
      As shown in FIG. 25, the process simulator is provided with a portion for calculating a dispersion deviation in each subroutine such as ion implantation, oxidation and diffusion, lithography or the like.
      <br/>
      As for a calculation procedure, there is adopted such a system that the calculation on these central values is advanced, while the derivative is performed.
    </p>
    <p num="257">
      This derivative will slightly be described.
      <br/>
      First, a temperature derivation in the diffusion step.
      <br/>
      In the diffusion step, when diffusion coefficients are denoted as D, an internal electric field due to an impurity distribution e and a number of electric activated impurity N, an equation based on the Fick's second rule is solved to acquire an impurity concentration distribution C. A procedure of the derivative is shown using FIG. 26. Incidentally, the left side in FIG. 26 is a normal process.
    </p>
    <p num="258">A nonlinear diffusion equation can be represented by the following formula (1071).</p>
    <p num="259">P(Ck+1 (T),T)=B(Ck (T))  (1071)</p>
    <p num="260">
      Incidentally, k+1 is a time and impurity concentration Ck+1 at the time of time k+1 is an unknown quantity.
      <br/>
      B on the right side is derived from the second member of the following formula (1072).
      <br/>
      .differential.C/.differential.t --&gt; (Ck+1 -Ck)/t  (1072)
    </p>
    <p num="261">
      As an implicit solution is used in the present invention, all coefficient matrices expressed in the above formulae are expressed using D, an averaged temperature T or the like.
      <br/>
      In the case of the normal process, a specific diffusion time is appropriately divided until the (tn+1)th time and solutions are successively acquired from time t1 to time tn+1.
      <br/>
      Therein, these are linearized by using a Newton system in respective times t1, t2, . . . , tn+1 to advance the calculation.
    </p>
    <p num="262">
      Next, a process deviated will be explained.
      <br/>
      This indicates the case where a deviation  DELTA T generates in the diffusion temperature.
      <br/>
      When the derivation in the above formula is taken and a change amount  DELTA CK of concentration in time k is detected, a derivation  DELTA Ck+1 at the time of time k+1 is represented by the following formula (1081):  (Equation image '77' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="263">
      Namely, values D, PSI , N, C and the like at the time of convergence in the normal process at time k+1 are stored and F' is prepared using these values, and also the change amount for the temperature T is prepared to acquire  DELTA Ck+ 1.
      <br/>
      Next, a part of matrix elements for preparing F' is shown in FIG. 26. For the derivation of the diffusion coefficients, an electron hole model is basically used.
      <br/>
      In this case, a fermi level is changed by a temperature change, whereby concentration of an electric charge electron hole is changed and the diffusion coefficients are changed.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, for a real carrier concentration ni being a basic element, the derivation is first represented by the following formula (4):
      <br/>
      bij =(1+ BETA n ZETA ijn)&lt;1/2n  (4)
    </p>
    <p num="264">
      Furthermore, the change due to a temperature of the internal electric field of impurity can also be expressed using the above.
      <br/>
      Further, we take into consideration a derivation of an enhanced effect of diffusion coefficients in an oxidation atmosphere.
      <br/>
      We take into consideration a linear oxidation rate constant and a parabolic oxidation rate constant because they change in the oxidation step.
      <br/>
      The prior F' is prepared using the above.
    </p>
    <p num="265">
      Next, we pick up a certain typical diffusion step and indicate the situation of convergence in one diffusion period in FIG. 27. The axis of abscissas of FIG. 27 shows a number of repetition and the axis of ordinates thereof shows a remaining difference.
      <br/>
      FIG. 27 shows convergence conditions in the normal process.
      <br/>
      It is understood that the convergence occurs in thrice circulated Newton loop in the normal process.
      <br/>
      The prior indicated derivation matrix F' is prepared using D,  PSI , N etc. at the time of this convergence in order to calculate the temperature derivation.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 27, it is understood that the convergence occurs in about 50 times and the calculation is ended in a calculation amount of 1/10 of the entire amount.
    </p>
    <p num="266">
      Furthermore, FIGS. 28, 29 and 30 show precision of the derivation.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 28, an impurity distribution at the time of 1000 (degree)  C. is expressed ranging over a two-dimensional lattice as the normal process.
      <br/>
      FIG. 29 is the process deviated and shows the resultants of calculation based on FIG. 28 in the case of  DELTA T=1 (degree)  C. On the other hand, in FIG. 30, 1001 (degree)  C. is set out as the normal process.
    </p>
    <p num="267">From these figures, it is understood that there is the relationship that a value of FIG. 30 is equal to a value of FIG. 28 and a value of FIG. 29. Further, when the value of FIG. 30 is anew ploted, it is as shown in FIG. 31, and it is understood that, when it is slipped toward a high temperature, impurity concentration decreases on the side of high concentration as a tendency and the impurity concentration increases on the side of low concentration as a tendency.</p>
    <p num="268">
      When a semiconductor element is made, there are a great amount of processes and a plurality of parameters in each of the processes.
      <br/>
      For example, the processes in a CMOS step mainly comprises (i) ion implantation into an N-well region; (ii) ion implantation into a P-well region; (iii) patterning of SiaN4 for a LOCOS step; (iv) a LOCOS step; (v) n+ ion implantation; (vi) p+ ion implantation; and (vii) an annealing step.
      <br/>
      When considering a fluctuation of the processes, it is necessary to handle the deviation of the great amount of parameters and its provability (or sensitivity).

      In Japanese Patent Application No. SHO63-174331 and Japanese Patent Application No. HEI3-164904, we consider a combination of the provability of the derivation and the execution.

      For simplicity, it is considered that three steps of  ALPHA ,  BETA  and  TAU  are now picked up.
      <br/>
      In each step, a central value of process parameters is called C (center), a value derived positively U (Upper) and a value derived negatively L (Lower).

      Their probabilities are defined as shown in FIG. 32 from Japanese Patent Application No. SHO63-174331 and Japanese Patent Application No. HEI3-164904.

However, in Japanese Patent Application No. SHO63-174331 and Japanese Patent Application No. HEI3-164904,these are not all handled, and in the case of L, a calculation is started from U, taking into consideration symmetry of U and L.

      In the present invention, for example, PZT system perovskite is picked up as an example as the single crystal ferroelectric film and also a Si surface is set to be (100) surface, for example.
      <br/>
      This substrate surface may be, for example, Cu of a FCC structure as a metal electrode.
      <br/>
      The most material problems are replaced by the problems how the crystal position relationship between the single crystal ferroelectric film PZT system perovskite and the Si (100) surface is established.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the entire energy of the system is picked up as the evaluation function being the essential part in the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="298">
      Further, a Si/PZT interface is picked up as this system.
      <br/>
      The inventors etc. have beforehand prepared energy expressing equations as the strict evaluation function and have found out that, by using these equations, the position relationship between the perovskite as PZT and the Si (100) under applying conditions is optimized in the following manner.
      <br/>
      Namely, we have found out that a median line of an angle made by an axis a1 and an axis a2 of a C4v structure expression of the perovskite is aligned with a �110� axial direction on the Si (100) surface, and that an axis c is inclined and a first Si position and a third Si position coincide with Si on the Si (100) surface, so that the optimum value can be obtained.
      <br/>
      Further, at this time, it is simultaneously indicated that an allowable range of an oxygen loss is within 0.01% in the PZT.
      <br/>
      FIG. 34 shows a conceptional view proposed by the present invention invented in this manner.
    </p>
    <p num="299">
      A description on FIG. 34 will be in detail made.
      <br/>
      An upper half of FIG. 34a shows a plane view of a single lattice on the Si side.
      <br/>
      A lower half thereof is a perspective view of a PZT surface.
      <br/>
      Further, in FIG. 34b, it is pointed out that lines coupling with perovskite toward a �110� Si direction are arranged in parallel, most preferably.
      <br/>
      At this time, the detail will be described later, and it is necessary that an axis C of perovskite is inclined in order to make a straight line coupling with silicon in parallel to the �110� Si.
      <br/>
      Thereby, according to the calculation of the inventors etc., we have found out that the entire energy is reduced by more 10%, as compared with the case where the lines coupling perovskite with Si are simply arranged in parallel and the axis C is not inclined.
      <br/>
      Besides, we further considered that this embodiment is actually used for an element, and we have found out that, if the oxygen loss is within 0.01% in the PZT, original characteristics of the single crystal perovskite are sufficiently indicated.

    <p num="300">
      The problems of interface energy designated in the present invention influence considerably the element characteristics, as described below.
      <br/>
      The energy due to mismatching generated on the interface formed with the ferroelectric film and the substrate is easy to form negative atoms, so that this accelerates a formation of an interface level.
      <br/>
      A prevention of a conductive phenomenon and a reduction in reliability are led by this interface level.
      <br/>
      Further, defects such as an abnormal bond or the like are generated even in the film, so that this has possibility of causing a level.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, an allowable range of these defects is initially indicated.

      The MIS characteristics prepared in the present invention are compared with the prior art.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, a CD method was used as means capable of evaluating effectively the interface level in particular.
      <br/>
      In the characteristics in the present invention, variations of data were precisely indicated.
      <br/>
      In the case of the present invention, it is understood that values of the interface level are reduced to be about 1/10 of the prior art.
      <br/>
      Further, it is seen that mobility of the MIS element in the present invention is also enhanced by about 12% when it is evaluated under the same electric field conditions.
      <br/>
      Further, the reliability was also enhanced.

      FIG. 35 is a constitutional view of an entirely novel strict ab initio and molecular dynamics simulator prepared by the inventors etc.
      <br/>
      An upper portion of FIG. 36 is a portion of the ab initio and a lower portion thereof is a portion of the molecular dynamics simulator.
      <br/>
      The inventors have for the first time indicated employing this simulator what, for example, a structure of perovskite is like.
      <br/>
      FIG. 37 is a perspective view of perovskite that the inventors etc. could indicate the strict structure for the first time.
      <br/>
      A big ball in FIG. 37 denotes oxygen and a small ball denotes Pb.
      <br/>
      An axis Z shows an axis C of perovskite, and as is apparent from FIG. 37, as the surfaces of perovskite and Si are uneven as shown in FIG. 37, it is well-understood that it is extremely difficult to presume whether or not a certain surface of perovskite is aptly connected with the corresponding surface of Si.
    </p>
    <p num="303">
      Furthermore, we aimed at an oxide film for precision check of the above-mentioned molecular dynamics simulator and carried forward comparison works of spectrum data.
      <br/>
      Namely, we read out a locking mode, a streching mode, or the like of O--Si--O mode or Si--O--Si mode from locations etc. of Si atoms or oxygen atoms moment by moment to acquire peculiar frequency from these numerical values.
      <br/>
      When comparing these with actual detected values, we obtained 490 cm-1 for 440 cm-1 and 1111 cm-1 for 1100 cm-1, respectively, which are within a proper range.
      <br/>
      Further, when pressure is applied, it is understood that a fact that the strength of O--Si--O mode increases coincides finely with the actual detected value.
    </p>
    <p num="304">
      The inventors carried forward these verification works, while we also calculated the case where a very large compression stress is applied to the PZT.

    <p num="305">
      A region etc. used for the calculation will slightly be discussed in detail.
      <br/>
      In the calculation, on the Si substrate side, a several-ten atomic layer is assumed in a vertical direction, further a several-ten atomic layer is assumed in a longitudinal direction on the surface and further a several-ten atomic layer is assumed in a right and left direction, to set a calculation area.
      <br/>
      Further, in perovskite, a several-ten atomic layer is assumed with respect to the lengths, widths and heights, respectively.

      We found out the new position relationship by the unknown approach by which we went through.
      <br/>
      The inventors developed a strict integrating equation of a strict ion coupling potential with respect to a region containing the ferroelectric film and the Si single crystal.
      <br/>
      The conventional approach lacks strictness and in particular cannot accurately acquire energy of the system.
      <br/>
      The inventors will succeedingly make clear the conventional defects and unclear places in the specification.
    </p>
    <p num="307">The inventors will be able to explain as follows: The inventors established a new simulator which has never been seen, and for one example, calculated the single crystal of the ferroelectric film, specifically the perovskite.</p>

      <br/>
      Three kinds of potential between O and O, between O and O and between Si and Si must strictly be expressed.
      <br/>
      Actually, it is extremely difficult to express the total potential between Si and O, between O and O and between Si and Si, and an integrating amount on the three kinds infinitely gives forth by a member of a distance r. Further, as a coulombic part potential afar trails the skirt, the calculation itself cannot be brought to an end, and in a little bit strict calculation, an Ewald's system was used in the conventional approach.
      <br/>
      However, as described later, the calculation lacks the strictness.

      As investigated in this manner, we further considered real process and investigated to what extent defect density is allowable.
      <br/>
      Namely, for example, 3200 pieces of Si and 3200 pieces of Ti are now prepared, and 0 to 100 pieces of oxygen defect was made therein.
      <br/>
      From a position etc. of the Si atoms and the oxygen atoms moment by moment in this case, the following matter came to appear.
      <br/>
      First, we investigated the connection between dynamic demeanor and PZT structure factors of the oxygen atoms and the Ti atoms.
    </p>
    <p num="372">
      When the oxygen defects exist in the single crystal PZT, disturbance is apparently exerted on even distant Ti and oxygen of several atoms-ahead as compared with the case of non-defects, and moreover mobility of point defects is considerably high.
      <br/>
      When these dynamic demeanor is compared with the case of the single crystal Si, it was understood that influences and ranges in the case of the PZT are extremely higher than Si.
      <br/>
      It is possibly considered that the active movements described above occur because ion coupling components are fairly contained in the PZT and the PZT has properties easy to polarize, accordingly a local loss works as a trigger and communicates with a potential change.
      <br/>
      The inventors etc. investigated in detail according to such procedure and found out that, if below 0.01%, it is sufficiently possible to lead out advantages on the single crystal ferroelectric film.
    </p>
    <p num="373">
      An atomic level calculation of a ferroelectric material by the inventors will hereinafter be described.
      <br/>
      The inventors etc. advanced a structure grasp at atomic levels of PTO, PZO or PZT, or a grasp calculation of the structure and the film characteristics.
      <br/>
      We report the resultants of calculation.
      <br/>
      As for an objective structure used in the atomic level calculation, there are (1) a substance that oxygen and Ti are respectively placed in a high symmetrical position in perfect crystal of PTO; (2) a substance that oxygen is slipped by 0.3  Angstrom  in perfect crystal of PTO; (3) a substance that one oxygen defect enters a portion along an axis c in (2) described above (FIG. 37); (4) a substance that one oxygen defect enters a portion along an axis a in (2) described above (FIG. 43); (5) a substance that T of PTO is replaced by Zr, and the like.
      <br/>
      In particular, in (5), a substance that Zr is replaced artificially by a layered form was executed.
      <br/>
      It was initially understood that operations of oxygen or Pb differed in the PTO, PZO or the like.
      <br/>
      We grasped an opportunity of "self-forming polarization" of the ferroelectric film therefrom.
      <br/>
      Further, we grasped the connection between an atomic arrangement of the ferroelectric film, a strain, a defect structure or the like and fundamental film characteristics etc.
    </p>
    <p num="374">
      A calculation at the atomic level of a most fundamental PbTiO3 film will initially be shown.
      <br/>
      Concerning the case where a pulling strain is exerted; the case where a Pb position is slipped from a balance point as a trial (FIGS. 44 and 45); the case where the oxygen defects are generated or the like, we investigated whether or not an electric charge distribution being most fundamental is so acquired when acquiring the film characteristics.
      <br/>
      FIG. 44 shows a view of a unit cell of PbTiO3 and further the case where Pb is slightly slipped from a central position.
      <br/>
      This acquires an equal returnability view of the electric charge distribution at this time.
      <br/>
      Further, FIG. 45 also shows a view of a unit cell and the case where a portion of Ti-oxygen coupling is strained.
      <br/>
      We came to understand the following points from these resultants.
    </p>
    <p num="375">
      (i) The entire has fairly many ion coupling components.
      <br/>
      Further, (ii) it was understood that almost most of electric charges is attracted to oxygen strong in the electronegative degree and next the electric charge exists about Ti.
      <br/>
      Further, (iii) as an electric charge distribution is symmetrical, the self-forming polarization does not occur as it is, but taking into consideration the oxygen "defect" or a position deviation of Ti, it is easily understood that local electrical neutrality is destroyed.
      <br/>
      Further, it was confirmed that a dielectric constant decreases by pulling.

      A calculation result of finding an ideal stable structure of a PbTiO3 film composed of a point group C4v at 25 (degree)  C. without thermal agitation will be explained.
      <br/>
      We found that the original point group C4v of stable energy is restored even if oxygen is shifted very slightly.
      <br/>
      It is generally understood that there will be a more stable equilibrium point if an oxygen position is shifted by 0.3  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      We examined about this and found a stable position slightly away from the 0.3  Angstrom  position.
      <br/>
      An area around this position is the generally admitted position, to cause spontaneous polarization.
      <br/>
      We found for the first time that there are at least two stable points, one is at a simple cubic crystal and the other is slightly away from there.

      An origin of polarization is an atomic position where the neutrality of charge is broken.
      <br/>
      This position is stable in terms of free energy.

      The above calculations show that oxygen plays an important role.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, oxygen deficiency may trigger polarization in terms of crystallography and electronics.

      An actual measurement system according to the present invention will be explained.
      <br/>
      FIG. 47 shows a Sawyer-Tauwa circuit.
      <br/>
      The circuit involves a high-voltage transformer T, a known fixed capacitance Co, and a cathode ray oscilloscope CRO.
      <br/>
      If the capacitance Co is sufficiently larger than the capacitance of a ferroelectric sample, a secondary voltage of the transformer T is mostly applied to the sample.
      <br/>
      The secondary voltage is divided by a resistor Rd and is applied to an abscissa of the oscilloscope CRO.
      <br/>
      An oscillation on the abscissa is proportional to an electric field E in the sample.
      <br/>
      An oscillation on an ordinate of the oscilloscope CRO represents a terminal voltage, which is equal to DS/Co.
      <br/>
      Namely, a graph on the oscilloscope CRO indicates a D-E curve, and the absolute values of D and E are easily obtained from the oscillation on the ordinate.
      <br/>
      A spontaneous displacement Ds is obtained as D when a saturated part is extrapolated according to E=0.
      <br/>
      Spontaneous polarization Ps is equal to Ds.
      <br/>
      If this circuit is used to observe a paraelectric sample having no loss, it will show a straight line passing through an origin.
      <br/>
      A paraelectric sample having a loss cr a ferroelectric sample shows a hysteresis.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 48, a continuous line is a D-E curve according to the present invention, and a dotted line is a D-E curve according to the conventional PZT.
      <br/>
      As is apparent in the figure, the present invention provides a very large dielectric constant.
    </p>
    <p num="385">
      When a voltage is applied to an interface between a ferroelectric film and a substrate, non-conformity at the interface may produce energy.
      <br/>
      This energy must be minimized while keeping a practical quality allowance.
      <br/>
      Reducing the interface energy results in preventing a level that may interfere with conductivity and in improving reliability.
      <br/>
      The present invention estimates a preferable structure with the use of a new ab-initio/molecular dynamics simulator.
      <br/>
      This simulator employs no empirical models, and therefore, is able to completely estimate natural phenomena.

      The simulator is useful not only to estimate every energy to be produced in a system when a voltage is applied thereto but also to design a system that provides a required dielectric constant or a system that has required durability.

On the other hand, a process simulator SUPREM4 achieved on CRAY with a memory of 200 megabytes or more takes an execution time of one day because it considers viscoelasticity.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="400">Various embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings hereinbelow.</p>
    <p num="401">Embodiment 1</p>
    <p num="402">A first embodiment is directed to optical spectrum direct predict function which is one of significant features of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="403">
      To begin with, technology of high reliability oxide film design, its evaluation associated technology, and the like will be briefly discussed from the viewpoint of conventional technical level.
      <br/>
      As a publicly known publication, there is "The Physics and Technology of Amorphous SiO2 " Plenum Publishing Corporation, ISBN 0-306-42929-2, for example.
      <br/>
      In this publication, IR's results and Raman's results are set forth as optically measured results of various oxide films.
    </p>
    <p num="404">
      On page 63 of this publication, how Raman signals of the amorphous oxide film would be changed according to steps is discussed by Paul McMillan.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 71 and 72 show the results measured by Paul McMillan.
      <br/>
      For instance, in FIG. 71, a curve a indicates Raman's measured results of usual oxide film while a curve b indicates Raman's measured results of densified oxide film.
    </p>
    <p num="405">
      In the prior art, reason for this difference has been considered that moisture is removed by a densifying process to thus change spectrum in the latter, for example, when spectra in both results are compared with each other.
      <br/>
      Also FIG. 72 shows spectra before and after pressure is applied to a single crystal quartz.
      <br/>
      Changes in spectra can be seen especially at 610 and 500 1/cm.
      <br/>
      However, first it is apparent at a glance from the above that an amount of change in spectrum is very small, and as a result it needs considerable technique to determine to which range of the spectrum attention is to be paid and whether such change is difference in significance or not.
      <br/>
      In addition, further complicated experience is required to identify an amount of variation in material based on the amount of variation in spectrum.
    </p>
    <p num="406">Because of such circumstances, there are a lot of materials for which an identification table of spectrum is not prepared, so that interpretation of spectrum becomes a major bar to development of new materials which are required much more in future.</p>
    <p num="407">
      Moreover, as discussed on page 71 of the above publication, Kobayashi et al. have checked changes of Raman spectrum of the oxide fiber under high stress.
      <br/>
      A part of the results is shown in FIG. 73. The results are shown here in the event that no stress is applied to SiO2 fiber and 3.5% tensile strain is applied to the same.
      <br/>
      As seen from FIG. 73, if 3.5% tensile strain is applied, the change appears near 450 1/cm.
      <br/>
      However, as also seen in this case, an amount of change in spectrum is extremely small, and therefore technique would be required considerably to determine to which range of the spectrum attention is to be paid and whether such change is difference in significance or not.
      <br/>
      Still further, more experience is required to identify an amount of variation in material based on the amount of variation in spectrum.
    </p>
    <p num="408">
      In the above publication, Kobayashi has tried to interpret the spectrum with the use of FIG. 74. As understood from FIG. 74, he has mentioned that a tetrahedral portion in the SiO2 structure at 109.5 degree is distorted when the SiO2 is subjected to tensile strain.
      <br/>
      However, although he has put forward only a set of tetrahedral structures to argue, he has not discussed bonding state between the tetrahedral portion and an adjacent tetrahedral portion at all.
      <br/>
      In practice, angular distribution exist certainly since temperature is finite.
    </p>
    <p num="409">
      As described often in this specification by the inventors of the present invention, such discussion is quite far from spectrum analysis unless quantitative distribution can be grasped.
      <br/>
      With respect to FIG. 75, similar discussion has been developed by Kobayashi.
      <br/>
      FIG. 75(a) is a characteristic diagram showing wavelength in normal oscillation mode of a SiO4 tetrahedron as function of O--Si--O bond angle.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 75(b) and 75(c) are characteristic diagrams showing reduction in strength due to decoupling in V4 mode caused by stress.
    </p>
    <p num="410">
      FIG. 76(a) to 76(d) are views showing defect models in oxide film provided by W. B. Fowler, which are set forth on page 107 of the above publication.
      <br/>
      FIG. 76(a) shows a bond model of part of perfect  ALPHA  type quartz.
      <br/>
      L is long bond and S is short bond.
      <br/>
      FIG. 76(b) shows a model at E1' center, FIG. 76(c) shows an E4' model, and FIG. 76(d) shows an E2' model.
      <br/>
      Unpaired electrons in FIGS. 76(b) to 76(d) are represented by e-.
    </p>
    <p num="411">
      As is evident from FIGS. 76(a) to 76(d) in the above publication, the deficient structure has been discussed with the use of one or two tetrahedral structures at 109.5 degree.
      <br/>
      However, as described above, actually angular distribution would occur surely at a certain finite temperature.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, unless a large number of calculations in some kind have to be carried out, such discussion is quite far from spectral analysis.
    </p>
    <p num="412">
      FIG. 77 shows an example which is carried out by a new molecular dynamics simulator fabricated by the inventors of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Thirty-two of Si and sixty-four of oxygen have been used and five hundreds and twenty of reciprocal lattice point have been present.
      <br/>
      The ordinate shows rate of change while the abscissa shows time.
      <br/>
      It has been confirmed from FIG. 77 that the pressure reaches substantially equilibrium with external pressure after 1000 fs.
      <br/>
      For purposes of example, O--Si--O angle (degree), Si--O--Si angle (degree), and O--Si distance (Angstrom) at this time are shown in FIG. 24.
    </p>
    <p num="413">
      The inventors of the present invention have prepared several measures in computation approach.
      <br/>
      For instance, in Infrared absorption, oscillation modes to meet law of selection in infrared absorption are extracted from time series data of momentary oscillation motion c,f atoms and their probability may be calculated.
    </p>
    <p num="414">
      With the use of molecular dynamics system, time is set to zero when the system reaches sufficiently equilibrium and then a time period from zero to time t is set as a sampling time.
      <br/>
      Time correlation is calculated as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="415">F( OMEGA )=.intg.&lt;M(t) * M(0)&gt;e- OMEGA wt dt  (1361)</p>
    <p num="416">
      Where M(t) is dipole moment which is expressed by following Eq.(1362).
      <br/>
      Integrated value of the above Eq.(1361) is obtained by integrating over the range from - (infinity)  to + (infinity) .
    </p>
    <p num="417">M(t)= SIGMA ei * r(t)  (1362)</p>
    <p num="418">
      In addition, &lt;M(t) * M(0)&gt; denotes autocorrelation function of M. Where ei is the number of charge in that point, i is particle number, and r is vector.
      <br/>
      Especially there is no restriction on a starting point of measurement of r, but the starting point is preferred to be set at a corner of a computation cell.
    </p>
    <p num="419">In order to calculate time correlation, s(t1) * (t2) * s(t3) * s(t 4) * s(t5) * s(t6) * s(t 7) * s(t8) are to be calculated at respective times.</p>
    <p num="420">
      For instance, in the calculation results obtained by the molecular dynamics in which higher order terms are introduced, calculated values in momentary coordinate location over the overall sampling time, their kinetic energy, momentum, etc. are included with respect to all particles.
      <br/>
      Further, mutual distance between particles, their relation between angular locations, etc. are also calculated.
    </p>
    <p num="421">
      Several crystalline oxide films and amorphous oxide films are also calculated by the inventors.
      <br/>
      A part of the results is shown in FIG. 78. In other words, FIG. 78 shows calculated results of Si--O distance in a single crystal cristobalite as an example.
      <br/>

      The inventors of the present invention enable spectrum of the oxide film to predict if oxygen deficiency is caused, and then enable the film to be compared with the actual oxide film.

      No problem occurs when ab initio molecular dynamics is used.

      However, if oxygen deficiency is dealt with by the molecular dynamics using TTAT potential or BK potential, there is a problem that what is the best way how to set charge of respective atoms.
      <br/>
      This is because, if distortion is enhanced significantly, constant charge cannot be supposed because of expansion of bond or presence of Si--Si bond.
      <br/>
      For example, actually distribution of charge is varied due to expansion of Si--O bond so that polarization is accelerated.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is supposed that electrostatic energy of expansion oscillation is enlarged and peak frequency of IR is Increased.
    </p>
    <p num="428">Therefore, the inventors of the present invention perform such an approach that may apply to SiO2 for the first time a charge equilibration approach using both ionization potential and electric affinity which have been tried to alkali and hydrogen as object by Rapipe-Goddard, calculate electrostatic potential by incorporating amendment of charge, and detect motion and IR of individual atoms.</p>
    <p num="429">Such charge equilibration approach is that electrostatic energy of system is treated as functions of ionization energy of respective atoms, electric affinity of respective atomic pairs, and charge of respective atoms and that, in equilibrium state, simultaneous equations the number of which correspond to the number of atoms are solved from the condition that atomic chemical potentials of respective atoms are equal to thus calculate charges of respective atoms.</p>

      <br/>
      According to this approach, even in a-SiO2, structure and IR spectrum can be correlated with each other with higher precision, so that comparison of calculated value and the measured value can be effectively conducted.

      Optical spectrum prediction will be discussed in detail as a third embodiment hereinbelow.
      <br/>
      At first, an approach of forming a-SiO2 (amorphous SiO2) on the computer and then predicting its optical spectrum will be discussed.
    </p>
    <p num="435">
      The a-SiO2 is formed by melting a single crystal SiO2 on the computer and then quickly chilling it.
      <br/>
      FIG. 86 shows temperature set upon forming the a-SiO2.
      <br/>
      Melting may be carried out gradually, but the a-SiO2 has been quickly melted by quickly raising temperature here.
      <br/>
      Then, temperature is lowered at a similar rate.
      <br/>
      FIG. 87 shows change in pressure at that time.
      <br/>
      FIG. 88 shows change in volume of the computational region.
    </p>
    <p num="436">
      The inventors have found that, in both cases that empirical molecular dynamics method is used and ab initio molecular dynamics method is used, how to treat external pressure and volume in this process is very important when temperature rise and temperature fall is largely varied.
      <br/>
      For instance, in this embodiment, with keeping the volume substantially constant, external pressure is treated as function of temperature so as to cause phase modification such that pressure is increased with the temperature rise.
      <br/>
      This behavior is shown in FIGS. 87 and 88.
    </p>
    <p num="437">
      However, if external pressure is kept constant with taking no account of the volume, extreme expansion of the volume occurs as shown in FIG. 89. For this reason, SiO2 with extremely low density, which differs entirely from the actual SiO2 melted at high temperature, is formed.
      <br/>
      Further, even in cooling process, SiO2 with impossibly low density is formed in solid state.
      <br/>
      Of course, potential energy is very high and is therefore in unstable state.
      <br/>
      Thus this causes comparison with measured value to be difficult.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it has been found that to form a-SiO2 with having sufficient regard to external pressure is desired, and this finding has been carried out.
    </p>
    <p num="438">
      Variation in potential energy upon melting is shown in FIG. 90. Since external pressure is taken into account, potential energy is gradually increased while being oscillating.
      <br/>
      Similarly potential energy is decreased gradually upon quickly chilling.
      <br/>
      Variation of two sides on a plane perpendicular to a cell c axis in the computation range relative to time at this time is shown in FIG. 91. Since Parinello-Rahman approach is adopted to enable the profile to be changed according to phase modification, the cell is varied in melting process.
    </p>
    <p num="439">
      Because the quartz assumes a rhombus initially, an angle between two sides is 60 degrees.
      <br/>
      However, since crystal structure is destroyed when the quartz is melted and internal pressure is applied uniformly to respective sides, an angle between two sides becomes close to 90 degrees.
      <br/>
      The structure does not return to the quartz even if it is quickly chilled and a rectangular parallelepiped is held at about 90 degrees.
    </p>
    <p num="440">
      In addition, the inventors have found that there is another caution point upon forming a-SiO2.
      <br/>
      It relates to Si and O potential.
      <br/>
      In the ab initio molecular dynamics method and the empirical potential (TTAT potential or BKS potential) molecular dynamics method, potential energy is largely varied due to change in location of atoms if SiO2 system is dealt with.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in order to treat motion of atoms, there is necessity of calculating motion of atoms with higher precision than ordinary Velret's algorithm.
    </p>
    <p num="441">
      FIG. 92 shows variation in potential energy, variation in kinetic energy, and sum of potential energy and kinetic energy in case motion of atoms are calculated by ordinary Velret's algorithm.
      <br/>
      Total energy is kept constant if there is no energy exchange between atoms and external fields.
      <br/>
      However, since integration of equation of motion derived from Lagrangian cannot executed with sufficient precision by ordinary Velret's algorithm, conservation of such energy cannot be executed.
      <br/>
      Even if time interval serving as integral interval is set to be fine to improve integration precision, such circumstance is not improved substantially.
      <br/>
      It has been found that such circumstance is peculiar to the material in which potential of oxygen is very steep.
    </p>
    <p num="442">
      Accordingly, in order to treat oxygen precisely, Velret's algorithm is improved such that acceleration of momentary motion of individual atoms can be calculated up to higher order and velocity and location can be calculated by integrating such acceleration.
      <br/>
      As a result, as shown in FIG. 93, kinetic energy changes in opposite phase to potential phase so that total energy can be kept constant.
      <br/>
      Unless such precise treatment of energy is carried out, it has been found according to the results obtained by the inventors that structure is destroyed at random because of low calculation precision when motion of atoms is rapid at high temperature or when liquid SiO2 is used and therefore a-SiO2 cannot be formed.
      <br/>
      In addition, IR spectrum being totally different from the measured value has been obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="443">
      As stated above, the inventors make it possible to form a-SiO2 on the computer for the first time based on their original invention upon forming a-SiO2. A--SiO2 formed as above has Si--O bond length which is slightly longer than the quartz, and Si--O length is within the constant range.
      <br/>
      Many Si--O having smaller Si--O length rather than that in the quartz are included in melted SiO2, but such smaller Si--O length has been eliminated by cooling process so that only longer bond lengths rather than the quartz remain in SiO2.
      <br/>
      As for the coordination number, if first proximity is assumed as 2  Angstrom , then Si includes mostly four coordination number and three and five coordination numbers are mixed slightly.
      <br/>
      No other coordination number occurs.
      <br/>
      Oxygen includes mostly two coordination number.
    </p>
    <p num="444">
      Next, in order to predictively calculate change in the structure of a-SiO2 according to various stress fields by applying hydrostatic pressure or uniaxial stress to a-SiO2 temperature is kept at 900 (degree)  C. until potential energy reaches equilibrium and subsequently structure relaxation is applied to SiO2 for two nanoseconds.
      <br/>
      Various structures of a-SiO2 are transformed to numerical values of atomic location, velocity, acceleration, liner differential value, cell basic vectors, displacement velocity of cell basic vectors, etc. respectively, and then these numerical values are saved.
    </p>
    <p num="445">
      After various a-SiO2 structures are formed by aforementioned processes, IR spectrum is calculated for respective structures.
      <br/>
      IR spectrum is calculated from dipole moment which can be given by
      <br/>
      M= SIGMA qi * ri  (1461)
    </p>
    <p num="446">
      Where qi is charge of atom i and ri is location of the atom i. If a system is neutral (i.e.,  SIGMA  qi =0) when this location is to be detected, then dipole moment has the identical value wherever an origin r0 is set.
      <br/>
      This is because dipole moment is given as  (Equation image '110' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="447">
      If a system is not neutral, absolute value of dipole moment is changed according to the origin since terms in which r0 is multiplied remain.
      <br/>
      However, it should be understood that, if the dipole moment is translated by Fourier transformation, the frequency appears only at zero component and other portion is not affected.
      <br/>
      Upon calculating the dipole moment, the inventors are aware that one caution point has to be taken to set atomic location r.
    </p>
    <p num="448">That is, since periodic boundary condition is applied on applying the molecular dynamics method, such caution point is to eliminate discontinuous variation of the dipole moment owing to motion of atoms which go out to the -x direction of the cell and enter from the +x direction.</p>
    <p num="449">
      Taking into account that a-SiO2 is not so much diffused at temperature where IR is actually measured but is only thermally oscillated, the dipole moment can be calculated under the assumption that, without considering periodic boundary condition, r used on calculating the dipole moment is treated such that charge resides at the location out of the cell even if the charge go out from the cell in the -x direction.
      <br/>
      In other words, two atomic locations, i.e., atomic location with taking account of the periodic boundary condition and atomic location without taking account of the periodic boundary condition are dealt with on calculating motion of individual atoms.
      <br/>
      An example of time variation of dipole moment as calculated like the above is shown in FIG. 94. Since this is three-dimensional calculation, dipole moments have been able to be obtained in x, y, z directions.
    </p>
    <p num="450">
      In order to calculate IR spectrum, as the first step, the dipole moment is treated by Fourier transformation to thus calculate power spectrum which is IR line spectrum An example is shown in FIG. 95. Peak locations of IR spectrum can be predicted at this stage.
      <br/>
      That is, a large peak appears at about 1000 1/cm and a large peak also appears at about 500 1/cm.
      <br/>
      This result corresponds to IR measured value of a-SiO2.
    </p>
    <p num="451">
      In order to detect IR spectrum, following Eq.(1471) can be derived by multiplying line spectrum I( OMEGA ) by function of  OMEGA  and temperature T.
      <br/>
      ALPHA ( OMEGA )=(4 PI 2/3hcn) *  OMEGA  * (1-exp(-h OMEGA / kT) * I( OMEGA )  (1471)
    </p>
    <p num="452">
      Details (peak shift, peak shoulder, etc.) of stress fields, structure of a-SiO2, and IR spectrum can be correlated with each other by calculating IR of a-SiO2 in various stress fields.
      <br/>
      Thereby, it becomes feasible to compare calculation values with the measured values.

    <p num="453">
      IR spectrum which is calculated by applying the molecular dynamics simulator developed by the inventors at this time to a-SiO2 is shown in FIG. 96, while IR spectrum which is predicted by applying the molecular dynamics simulator developed newly by the inventors to a-SiO2 under application of the external pressure is shown in FIG. 97.

      By predicting the magnitude of stress induced during steps and its components and further grasping detailed relationship between stress and material properties with the use of a system according to the present invention, phenomena such as plastic deformation between the substrate and the interlayer film can be predicted.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, especially stress problem will be discussed as an example.
      <br/>
      How to predict stress induction and how to reduce it while considering the process variation width will be examined.
    </p>
    <p num="456">
      In the recent fine device process design, it is indispensable to take account of stress generated in the progress of process.
      <br/>
      As with the stress, following phenomena occur, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="457">
      (1) In a buried device isolation method (ST1), SiO2 is buried in trenches cut out in an SiO2 substrate.
      <br/>
      In this case, because of difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the Si substrate and SiO2, strain and stress remain and in some case crystal defect is caused according to thermal history.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a device structure and manufacturing process which can reduce residual stress as much as possible must be designed.
    </p>
    <p num="458">
      (2) For purposes of forming a high quality oxide film, the Si substrate in which interstitial oxygen density is low is employed frequently.
      <br/>
      Under such circumstance, strength of the Si substrate is lowered to cause plastic deformation readily.
    </p>
    <p num="459">(3) To maintain formation of shallow junction layers and well regions, thermal processes such as annealing process and oxidation process are employed, but such thermal processes become a burden on the substrate much more because of employment of RTP.</p>
    <p num="460">
      In such conditions, it is important that how generation of defect must be prevented and that, if such stress that is larger than a specified value or a variation prediction value is observed while monitoring the stress in the middle of process, cause must be instantly made clear and then future process must be corrected correspondingly.
      <br/>
      This is more important to the clustered tool.
    </p>
    <p num="461">
      Still further, kind of stress and identification thereof is extremely important.
      <br/>
      Though it is important to pursue main stress and principal face of maximum stress, it is also important to take notice of decomposition shear stress.
      <br/>
      For example, in the event of using an Si(100) substrate, a best priority glide plane is (111) face, as shown in FIG. 102. A �100� direction is a gliding direction on the (111) face, but such a case is regarded to be most dangerous that a shearing force acts in this direction.
    </p>
    <p num="462">
      A simulation system fabricated by the inventors can provide these identification outputs.
      <br/>
      In this manner, with paying attention to plastic deformation, first oxidation of trench of ST1 will be picked up and then oxidation profile and stress distribution as well as design guide to achieve a predetermined shape will be discussed.
      <br/>
      For instance, it is said that stress is contributed to "truncated" and "rounded" phenomena of the trench angle in oxidation, but mechanism of such phenomena has not been analyzed yet in the existing state.
    </p>
    <p num="463">
      Therefore, it is necessary at first that these phenomena have to be understood in detail and that proper process design which permits the "truncated" phenomenon to be suppressed and the "rounded" phenomenon to be accelerated is provided.
      <br/>
      In addition, profile of the oxide film cannot be grasped clearly unless induced stress can be grasped precisely.
      <br/>
      The stress problem is not only the problem on plastic deformation simply but also the item indispensable to profile analysis as well as impurity distribution analysis on the stress field.
      <br/>
      Further, prediction of thickness of the oxide film, and the like are especially susceptible to the stress in the progress of oxidation after the SOI substrate which will be used in the device following a future 1G device is subjected to the LOCOS step, unlike ordinary Si substrate.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, quantitative prediction thereof is more complicated problem.
    </p>
    <p num="464">
      In considering such background, instead of the conventional oxidation diffusion model, analysis must be extended up to grasp of behavior of oxidizing agent under the stress, understanding of oxidation phenomenon under the stress, and impurity rediffusion under the stress.
      <br/>
      In addition, computation must be carried out in a very short time and at high speed.
      <br/>
      The inventors can fabricate a new simulator which is capable of predicting generation of stress and its redistribution and also calculating two-dimensional diffusion of the point defect under the stress.
      <br/>
      The atomic level simulator is equipped with this new simulator.
      <br/>

      If Si is oxidized to become SiO2, then volumic expansion occurs.
      <br/>
      Although part of the stress may be relaxed at this time because of viscoelasticity of SiO2, the stress still remain in both Si and SiO2.
    </p>
    <p num="468">
      Taking the case of oxidation of trench corner as an example, such circumstance has been examined and is shown in FIG. 103. First, oxidizing agent of density C reaches SiO2 and enters into the SiO2 film.
      <br/>
      At this time, diffusion D' of the oxidizing agent is affected by stress  SIGMA  caused in the SiO2 film.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is also affected by accumulated residual stress in the substrate when the oxidizing agent reacts with Si on the Si/SiO2 interface.
    </p>
    <p num="469">
      As a concrete effect, if compressive stress  SIGMA  exists in the SiO2, for example, then an atomic distance in the network is narrowed to suppress diffusion of the oxidizing agent.
      <br/>
      Moreover, if compressive stress  SIGMA  is accumulated on a surface of the Si substrate, then an Si atomic distance is narrowed to suppress entrance of the oxidizing agent, as a result, to suppress oxidation speed.

      Assuming that a component of main stress S in the x direction is  SIGMA xx and a component of main stress S in the y direction is  SIGMA yy, following Eqs.(1531) to (1534) are concluded for the stress on the two-dimensional plane.
      <br/>
      Where  MU  is coefficient of viscosity, .nu. is Poisson's ratio, and u is displacement.  (Equation image '112' not included in text)

    <p num="471">
      Meanwhile, temperature dependency of coefficient of viscosity  MU  can in general be expressed by Eq.(1534).
      <br/>
      Where VISCO.O and VISCO.E denote proportional constant and activation energy respectively.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if temperature dependency of coefficient of viscosity  MU  is added to the above angular stress equation, then respective components of main stress are decreased with the increase of temperature.
      <br/>
      Similarly, when the oxidizing agent which comes to the Si/SiO2 interface reacts on the Si surface, reaction constant  KAPPA s' can be expressed as the above Eq.(1532).
      <br/>
      Where  KAPPA s is the value when no stress exists,  SIGMA n is  SIGMA n =-( SIGMA xx nx2 + SIGMA yy ny2 +2 SIGMA xy nx ny),  SIGMA  TAU =-( SIGMA xx ny2 + SIGMA yy nx2 -2 SIGMA xy nx ny), and VR is a parameter.
      <br/>
      It can be seen from this Eq.(1532) that oxidation reaction constant is decreased as compressive stress is increased.
      <br/>
      Influence of accumulated residual stress in the substrate when the oxidizing agent reacts with Si on the above Si/SiO2 interface corresponds to this event.
    </p>
    <p num="472">
      In addition, diffusion coefficient D' of the oxidizing agent In the oxide film can be expressed by the above Eq.(1531).
      <br/>
      Where p is p=-1/2( SIGMA xx + SIGMA yy), and D is diffusion coefficient in case no stress exists.
      <br/>
      Meaning of this Eq.(1531) can be interpreted as follows.
      <br/>
      That is, in stress  SIGMA xx and  SIGMA yy, tensile stress is set to positive and compressive stress is set to negative.
      <br/>
      Hence, if compressive stress is present in the film and material is in a dense state, then diffusion coefficient becomes small.
    </p>
    <p num="473">The above Eq.(1531) indicates this event.</p>
    <p num="474">
      Calculating procedures for this portion which are found by the inventors are shown in FIG. 104. First, density of the oxidizing agent at respective nodes on the Si/SiO2 interface is calculated.
      <br/>
      After this, temporary oxidation rate at respective nodes is calculated for the first time based on this density.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, a growth amount of the SiO2 film at respective nodes is calculated.
      <br/>
      Stress S is then calculated from the above Eq.(1533) using this u. Oxidation rate is calculated once more based on Eqs.(1532), (1531) and (1534) using this stress S. Again, a growth amount is calculated and stress is calculated.
      <br/>
      If stress has converged sufficiently, then new oxidation time starts to proceed over again.
      <br/>
      In other words, a Newton's method is employed.
    </p>
    <p num="475">
      However, as can seen from FIG. 104, if the Newton's method is used, then a very long calculation time is required for calculation of stress applied upon oxidation.

      A calculation time is checked by making use of EWS Sun4.

      The inventors introduce a variational principle into calculation by the Newton's method to conserve previous convergence condition, and then proceed convergence calculation by using its linear differential.
      <br/>
      According to a new method, a calculation time can be reduced less than 1/1000 of the conventional time in the range of 900 (degree)  C. and 1100 (degree)  C. Consequently, a present simulator may proceed rationalization of physical property values of material and high-speed operation in an arithmetic portion and go them to a level being usable as a real time tool.
      <br/>
      As basic precision of the simulator, the inventors have further examined the precision of time dependency of the oxide film thickness, profile reproducibility at corner portion of the trench, and others.

      FIGS. 105 to 107 are graphs showing the results of temperature of thickness of growth film, and time dependency examined by using the above simulator.

      The inventors have examined, though not shown herein, low pressure behavior when oxygen partial pressure is 10% and 1%.
      <br/>
      As a result, when oxidation rate is slow, oxidation advances while stress caused by expansion of the oxide film is sufficiently relaxed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, stress is not accumulated in the substrate so that uniform oxide film can be formed on the convex portion.
      <br/>
      As the result of careful examination by the inventors, it has been found that such an approach is effective that oxygen partial pressure is lowed at initial oxidation to make oxidation rate slow and thus to relax stress sufficiently and then oxygen partial pressure is increased gradually.

      This embodiment shows an example wherein the present invention is applied to stress problem in the silicon thermal oxide film.
      <br/>
      The stress problem is important to suppress generation of crystal defect and dislocation in the silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      But the stress problem is further important as a factor which affects film quality in various materials.
    </p>
    <p num="480">
      In the silicon thermal oxide film, there are caused oxidation stress due to volumic expansion when the silicon is oxidized and thermal stress caused by temperature rise and temperature fall.
      <br/>
      These affect quality of the oxide film.
      <br/>
      That is, stress affects the network structure in the silicon oxide film if it is mentioned at atomic level, and there is possibility that stress produces further effect on the tetrahedron structure acting as a unit structure of the SiO2 system.
      <br/>
      In turn, stress have effects on electric insulating properties.
      <br/>
      Therefore, while preparing findings as with IR spectrum in the silicon oxide film, structure at atomic level, and electric chracteristics, the inventors proceed oxidation step with controlling quality of the oxide film.
    </p>
    <p num="481">
      At first, the inventors have investigated IR spectrum in the silicon oxide film, structure at atomic level, and electric chracteristics as prestages.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 117, by preparing the substrate and executing device isolation step, the device regions which are isolated by the device isolation regions are formed.
      <br/>
      Next, the silicon substrate is introduced into the oxidizing equipment to thus form the gate thermal oxide film, as shown in FIG. 118 At this time, the oxidizing temperature is changed variously from 800 (degree)  C. to 1100 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="482">
      After the silicon oxide film of a predetermined thickness is formed, the substrate temperature is decreased.
      <br/>
      In this event, the substrate temperature is decreased at two stages, as shown in FIG. 119. The first stage is to decrease the substrate temperature up to 900 (degree)  C. and the substrate temperature quickly falls down.
      <br/>
      The second stage is to decrease the substrate temperature from 900 (degree)  C. to room temperature and the falling speed is not especially mentioned.
      <br/>
      If the oxidation temperature is set less than 900 (degree)  C., the substrate temperature is decreased by the second stage only.
    </p>
    <p num="483">
      Setting of the temperature falling conditions is determined separately based on analysis of viscosity relaxation behavior of the oxide film.
      <br/>
      In general, it has been said that the oxide film becomes soft at high temperature, so that stress can be readily relaxed due to viscous flow.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the inventors have examined stress relaxation behavior because of viscosity in detail.
      <br/>
      Examples to which variation in stress relaxation characteristics owing to falling speed of the temperature has been examined are shown in FIGS. 120 and 121.
      <br/>
      In present examples, the oxidation speed is set at 1000 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="484">
      FIG. 120 shows the results indicating the maximum value of the main stress in the direction along the surface if the substrate is kept at 1000 (degree)  C. respectively, if it is quickly chilled at 600 (degree)  C./min and, if it is gradually chilled at 6 (degree)  C./min after typical oxidation step is carried out.
      <br/>
      From the results shown in FIG. 120, stress can be relaxed within about one min. in both cases where the substrate is kept at 1000 (degree)  C. and it is gradually chilled.
      <br/>
      While, viscous relaxation is small and thermal stress is superposed on the stress in case the substrate is quickly chilled.
    </p>
    <p num="485">
      FIG. 121 is a view wherein the stress behavior during temperature falling process is plotted on the ordinate relative to temperature on the abscissa.
      <br/>
      It has been found that from FIG. 121 that, in the temperature range more than 950 (degree)  C., stress relaxation is remarkable and the oxide film exhibits behavior like viscosity or viscoelasticity, while stress relaxation is seldom caused in the temperature range less than 950 (degree)  C. and the oxide film exhibits behavior like elastic body.
    </p>
    <p num="486">
      As guessed from such calculation examples, using two stage temperature fall in the present embodiment, it becomes possible to suppress the viscosity relaxation by passing through the temperature range in which the viscosity relaxation is caused at as short time as possible.
      <br/>
      In addition, by changing the oxidation temperature variously, thermal stress caused by difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the silicon substrate and the oxide film can be set variously.
    </p>
    <p num="487">
      Using the sample formed as above, if tensile stress in the direction of the surface of the substrate directly beneath the silicon oxide film has been measured from the sectional face by microscopic Raman spectroscopic analysis, various thermal stresses induced in the silicon substrate have confirmed.
      <br/>
      The inventors have estimated stress values induced in the oxide film by comparing stress induced measured values in the substrate with calculation results exemplified in FIG. 122. Upon executing stress calculation, the inventors have employed the material and process prediction simulation system which includes from molecular level to general-purpose level constructed by the inventors.
      <br/>
      As a result, a relationship shown in.
      <br/>
      FIG. 123 can be derived between the oxidation temperature and compressive stress in the oxide film.
      <br/>
      It has been understood from FIG. 123 that the maximum value of compressive stress in the oxide film is increased linearly with the increase of the oxidation temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="488">
      As next preparation, IR spectrum of the oxide film in which compressive stress is caused has been measured.
      <br/>
      In contrast, if compressive stress is applied, computer-prediction of the oxide film structure and IR spectrum have been executed by classical molecular dynamics method.
      <br/>
      FIG. 124 shows variation in calculation IR spectrum according to presence or absence of application of compressive stress.
    </p>
    <p num="489">
      FIG. 125 is the results wherein wave number shift due to stress of Si--O--Si asymmetrical stretching peak is measured from the measured values of IR spectrum.
      <br/>
      To compare the measure values with the calculation values, such behavior can be derived from calculation IR spectrum that appearing wave number of the Si--O--Si asymmetrical stretching peak is shifted to the lower wave number side by applying the compressive stress rather than the case no stress is applied.
      <br/>
      It has been found that measured values coincide with the calculation values.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if various stresses are applied, the amorphous structure and IR spectrum are calculated and prepared.
    </p>
    <p num="490">
      As further preparation, relationship between stress and electric characteristics have been investigated.
      <br/>
      By using the oxide film in which various stresses are caused as the gate insulating film and depositing the gate electrode on the gate insulating film, Qbd has been measured.
      <br/>
      All steps for deposition of the gate electrodes, etc. have been executed at the temperature less than 900 (degree)  C. not to generate viscocity relaxation of the oxide film.
      <br/>
      Correlation between the oxide film structure predicted by the molecular dynamics calcultion and Qbd has been examined.
    </p>
    <p num="491">
      FIG. 126 is the results wherein correlation between frequency of occurrence of bond in which Si--O atomic interval of first proximity is more than 1.8  Angstrom , and Qbd has been calculated after a radial distribution function of Si--O atoms in the oxide film has been calculated in various stress fields.
      <br/>
      It has been found from FIG. 126 that, if frequency of occurrence of bond in which Si--O atomic interval is more than 1.8  Angstrom  exceeds 5%, Qbd is reduced remarkably so that Si--O atomic interval and the oxide film insulation breakdown are corelated with each other.
      <br/>
      A shift amount of IR spectrum is about 15 1/cm.
    </p>
    <p num="492">
      Variation in amorphous network structure if compressive stress is applied to the oxide film are supposed to two ways, i.e., (1) Si--O bond length is reduced because density of the oxide film is enhanced, and (2) Si--O--Si bond angle is reduced because of IR measurement in the thin film thermal oxide film and the central force model.
      <br/>
      However, the inventors have newly found by the originally developed simulator that increase in density of the oxide film does not linked with simple reduction in Si--O bond length, as shown in FIG. 127 rather, distribution of bond length is spread and rate of elongated bond is increased.
      <br/>
      In addition, correlation to Qbd has also been found.
    </p>
    <p num="493">
      Although the inventors have not analyzed physical reasons for correlation between Qbd and elongated Si--O bond yet in detail, one of such reasons may be guessed from the paper which is recently reported as follows.
      <br/>
      The paper is Kaneda, "Local Deformation in Oxide Film and Hole Trap by Impurity", Thin Film/Surface Physics Symposium Study Report, Formation/Evaluation/reliability of Ultra Thin Silicon Oxide Film, pp.101-104. According to Kaneda's calculation using the molecular orbit method program GAUSSIAN, it has been reported that "If elongated Si--O--Si exits, trapping of holes to central oxygen is induced.
      <br/>
      Since trapped holes are localized strongly to oxygen, they act as trapping centers for electrons.
      <br/>
      As a result, most of oxygens return to their original state by trapping electrons.
      <br/>
      However, a part of oxygens get energy of several eV emitted from recombinations of electrons and holes to cut off Si--O bond which being elongated and weaken, so that oxygens run out of the lattice.
      <br/>
      Therefore, for instance, two-dimensional defects such as oxygen deficiency may be generated."
    </p>
    <p num="494">
      According to the inventors, as shown in this report, since bonds which being elongated by application of stress are increased, oxygen deficient defects are supposed to be formed.
      <br/>
      In addition, it has been guessed that, although various structures of oxygen deficient defects can be considered, electron states are significantly varied in the structure wherein Si atoms on both sides of the oxygen deficient defects are largely separated, so that levels are formed in the band gap and electron distribution to enable electric conduction is varied.
    </p>
    <p num="495">By preparing as above, since IR spectrum of the oxide film can be predicted in the stress fields and also correlation between the structure at atomic level and electric properties can be obtained, the inventors have tried "to correct manufacturing processes".</p>
    <p num="496">
      The Si wafer processed in the predetermined processes is introduced into the oxide film forming equipment, and then the oxide film having a predetermined film thickness at dry O2 atmosphere including 5% hydrochloric acid at 1050 (degree)  C. After the oxide film has been formed, the wafer is quickly cooled to room temperature, and then IR spectrum of the oxide film has been measured.
      <br/>
      When Si--O asymmetrical stretching oscillation peak wave number in IR spectrum can be read from the measured values and an amount of shift from the wave number when no stress occurs is calculated, a shift of 17 1/cm can be measured.
    </p>
    <p num="497">
      It has been predicted from this shift amount that compressive stress of about 0.2 GPa is induced in the oxide film.
      <br/>
      This shift amount has been compared with a shift critical value 15 1/cm.
      <br/>
      Since it has been detected that the shift amount exceeds the critical value in this heating step, process is ceased.
      <br/>
      As correction of manufacturing process, stress relaxation has been carried out by high temperature annealing.
    </p>
    <p num="498">
      In addition, to compare effect of the present embodiment, high temperature is not applied to a part of the wafer which are passed through the step as they are Annealing time, annealing temperature, temperature rise and fall speed, etc. serving as parameters for stress correction high temperature annealing are calculated with regard to analysis of relaxation time detected viscosity relaxation, and rediffusion behavior of impurity diffudion layer formed already in the substrate.
      <br/>
      In this case, annealing is executed at 1000 (degree)  C. for 30 sec.
    </p>
    <p num="499">
      When, after annealing being completed, III spectrum is measured again to calculate a shift amount, it is below the critical value.
      <br/>
      Therefore, process is continued as it is.
      <br/>
      Qbd has been measured in both cases the process is corrected and not corrected.
      <br/>
      As a result, 45 C/cm2 if correction has been made while 5 C/cm2 if no correction has been made.
      <br/>
      This show advantage of process correction by the present invention clearly.
    </p>
    <p num="500">
      Moreover, in the wafer having another structure, a gate oxide film of a desired thickness has been formed at dry O2 atmosphere at 950 (degree)  C. When, after the oxide film being formed, the wafer is cooled quickly to room temperature, and IR spectrum of the oxide film has been measured, a peak shift amount is 16 1/cm.
      <br/>
      Since this amount exceeds the critical value, additional annealing is needed to relax stress.
      <br/>
      However, if rediffusion of impurity diffusion layer should be considered together, solution for appropriate annealing conditions does not exist.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it has been determined that it is impossible to continue this step to thus dispose the wafer.
    </p>
    <p num="501">
      As discussed above, the present invention may not only to overcome the problems in monitoring function upon clustering, but also proceed semiconductor device manufacturing processes according to predetermined schedules or while correcting them without testpieces, etc. by expanding limited quantity or quality contents of "in situ" measured values at their maximum in a semiconductor device manufacturing apparatus for MOSLSI, etc., especially a sheet type or clustered semiconductor device manufacturing apparatus.
      <br/>
      Further, according to the present invention, it becomes possible to i) diagnose a superposition phenomenon of fluctuation of respective process factors and deviation of respective factors, ii) check whether or not processes are executed along predetermined sequences, and iii) find variation factors.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, characterizing features of this system are iv) to enable variation in processes to be dealt with mathematically and statistically with good efficiency, v) to equip the system with a new inference engine, and vi) to equip the system with a new reciprocal system.
