      Novel reaction conditions for the cleavage of silyl ethers from silyl protected taxane precursors to afford paclitaxel and paclitaxel analogues in high yield and quality are described.
      <br/>
      Paclitaxel is prepared from a taxane precursor by treating the taxane precursor with a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid in a solvent such as aqueous acetic acid, such that the amount and number of side reactions and taxane impurities are significantly minimized.
      <br/>
      Also desribed are the crystallization methods for the isolation of paclitaxel in either of the two crystal forms A or B.
      <br/>
      Paclitaxel and paclitaxel analogues are anti-cancer agents.

    <p num="1">This application claims priority benefit under Title 35 .sctn. 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/134,469, filed May 17, 1999, and entitled NOVEL REACTION CONDITIONS FOR THE CLEAVAGE OF SILYL ETHERS IN THE PREPARATION OF PACLITAXEL (TAXOL.RTM.) AND PACLITAXEL ANALOGS.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention is directed to reaction conditions for the cleavage of silyl ethers from silyl protected taxane precursors to afford paclitaxel (Taxol.RTM.) and paclitaxel analogues.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the invention is directed to a process for the preparation of paclitaxel from a taxane precursor which comprises the steps of treating the taxane precursor with a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, in a weak aqueous acid, such as aqueous acetic acid, such that the amount and number of side reactions leading to undesirable taxane impurities are minimized, and isolating the product from a solvent that affords paclitaxel in either of the two crystal forms, Form A or Form B.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Taxanes are diterpene compounds that find utility in the pharmaceutical field.
      <br/>
      For example, taxanes containing aryl heterocyclic or cycloalkyl groups on the C-13 sidechain find utility as anti-cancer agents.
      <br/>
      Taxanes include pacltitaxel, cephalomannine, taxol c, 10-deacetylpaclitaxel, 10-deacetylcephalomannine, 7- BETA -xylosylpaclitaxel, baccatin-III, 10-deacetylbaccatin III, 7- BETA -xylosyl-10-deacetyl cephalomannine, 7- BETA -xylosyl-10-deacetylbaccatin III, 7- BETA -xylosylbaccatin III, and 10-deacetyl-taxol c.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Paclitaxel (Taxol.RTM.), a diterpene taxane compound, is a natural product extracted from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, Taxus Brevifolia.
      <br/>
      It has been shown to have excellent antitumor activity in in vivo animal models, and recent studies have elucidated its unique mode of action, which involves abnormal polymerization of tubulin and disruption of mitosis during the cell cycle.
      <br/>
      Taxol.RTM. has recently been approved for the treatment of refractory advanced ovarian cancer, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and most recently, AIDS-related Kaposi's Sarcoma.
      <br/>
      The results of paclitaxel clinical studies are replete in scientific periodicals and have been reviewed by numerous authors, such as Rowinsky and Donehower in "The Clinical Pharmacology and Use of Antimicrotubule Agents in Cancer Chemotherapeutics", Phamac.

      With reference to the numbering of the taxane, reference to a particular carbon on the taxane structure shall be indicated throughout this application by a "C-number", which signifies the carbon on the taxane according to the above numbering system.
      <br/>
      For example, "C-13" refers to the carbon at position 13 on the taxane ring as shown above, having a sidechain coupled thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Naturally occurring taxanes such as paclitaxel, 10-deacetylpaclitaxel and baccatin III can be extracted from the trunk bark of different species of Taxus (yew).
      <br/>
      Paclitaxel, in particular, may be extracted from the inner bark of Taxus brevifolia.
      <br/>
      Although T. brevifolia is a relatively common tree in the Pacific Northwest, it is a slow growing plant and is indigenous to the ecologically threatened old-growth forests of this area, and harvesting is thus increasingly restricted because of environmental concerns.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      As yields of paclitaxel extracted from T. brevifolia are generally low, of the order of 100 mg/kg, semisynthetic methods of producing paclitaxel from baccatin IlIl and 10-deacetylbaccatin have been developed.
      <br/>
      Baccatin III, 10-deacetylbaccatin, as well as other paclitaxel precursors may be isolated from the needles of the European yew, Taxus baccata in relatively larger quantities, e.g. approximately 300 mg/kg of 10-deacetylbaccatin may be obtained from yew leaves.
      <br/>
      Although yew needles generally provide an adequate supply of the necessary starting materials for synthesizing paclitaxel, the supply is not endless and other methods easing the supply dilemma and producing adequate amounts of paclitaxel has become a priority.
      <br/>
      The art has thus continued to search for synthetic, including semisynthetic routes for the preparation of naturally occurring taxanes such as paclitaxel, as well as the preparation of paclitaxel analogues and second and third generation paclitaxel-like compounds thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Using a semi-synthethic process, paclitaxel may be prepared from numerous paclitaxel precursors, some having protecting groups thereon, particularly at the C-7 postion on the taxane ring and at the 2' position on the sidechain which is connected at position C-13.
      <br/>
      Paclitaxel may be easily prepared by the deprotection of these paclitaxel precursors.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Several methods for cleaving the silyl ethers have been reported in the literature.
      <br/>
      However, when applied to silyl protected taxane precursors, most of these procedures generated side reactions and several impurities.
      <br/>
      In the case of paclitaxel, the most prominent impurity is 10-deacetyltaxol.
      <br/>
      Some of the other side-reactions known to occur are: opening of the oxetane ring, loss of the C-1 hydroxyl group followed by ring contraction to a 5-membered ring, and epimerization at C-7.

      With reference to paclitaxel, this compound exhibits polymorphism.
      <br/>
      Crystal Form A is predominantly obtained from non-aqueous solvent systems and crystal Form B is predominantly obtained from aqueous solvent systems.
      <br/>
      Paclitaxel Form A is the preferred crystal form and has been filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

    <p num="26">
      With reference to paclitaxel, crystal Form A is isolated by solvent exchanging the organic layer from step (h) into an alcohol, such as ethanol, isopropanol or the like, or into a ketone, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or the like, or into an ester, such as ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate or the like followed by the addition of a hydrocarbon solvent, such as hexane, heptane, cyclohexane or the like, preferably isopropanol followed by heptane.
      <br/>
      The crystal Form B is isolated by solvent exchanging the organic layer from step (h) into a water-miscible solvent, such as acetic acid, acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile or the like followed by the addition of water, preferably acetone or acetic acid followed by the addition of water.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      During the crystallization of paclitaxel Form A from isopropanol, the crystal slurry undergoes a phase change.
      <br/>
      Initially, the crystal slurry remains very thin for several hours, then it undergoes a phase change and it thickens.
      <br/>
      After 1-2 hours, the slurry thins out again.
      <br/>
      The yield of the product is low if the slurry is filtered during the early stages of thin phase and the crystal slurry is difficult to filter during the thick phase stage.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the crystal slurry is filtered only after it has undergone the complete phase transition.
      <br/>
      Addition of small amounts of water (i.e., up to about 3% (w/v)) has been found to accelerate the phase transition from the initial thin phase to the final thin phase.
      <br/>
      The addition of water also helps in improving the filtration characteristics of the crystal slurry and the overall yield of the product.
