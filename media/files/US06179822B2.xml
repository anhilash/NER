      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      This invention relates to a single use universal connector connectable to containers having fluid contents therein designed for delivery to a site of administration.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention relates to a single use universal connector connectable to one or more exit ports of collapsible bags and bottles such as intravenous (IV) bags.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Reported Developments</p>
    <p num="5">
      Parenteral fluids, such as therapeutic drugs, diagnostic contrast media and nutrients are conventionally administered to a patient from a container, such as a collapsible bag or bottle having a fluid exit port.
      <br/>
      The fluid exit port may include means, such as a tube, spike or cannula, the distal end of which is in communication with the fluid content of the container and the proximal end of which is connected to the desired site on the patient.
      <br/>
      Conventionally, the proximal end of said means includes a needle that can puncture the skin of a patient.
      <br/>
      The fluid exit port is sealed by a membrane which is punctured by inserting a spike into the exit port when fluid delivery is desired.
      <br/>
      The membrane can also be a resealable membrane which alter puncture reseals itself, due to its highly elastomeric properties, to prevent further fluid flow through the fluid exit port.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One approach used by the prior art to penetrate the membrane covering the fluid exit port comprises the use of syringes or spikes which carry the danger of accidental injuries caused by the sharp points of the needles and spikes.
      <br/>
      Such injuries accidentally inflicted on the health practitioner carry the further risk of getting infected with diseases such as AIDS.
      <br/>
      In order to reduce the danger of accidental injuries, spikes having relatively blunt tips were used.
      <br/>
      However, such pikes puncture a large area of the membrane and once the spikes are removed the membrane no longer seals the fluid exit port.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Another approach used by the prior art is the provision of a tubular member which is more blunt than a spike so that it is unlikely to penetrate the skin yet capable of penetrating the latex diaphragm type seals.</p>
    <p num="8">Still another approach used by the prior art is a valve positioned in the fluid exit port, the valve being operable by engagement with a spikeless or needleless IV component and contains a resilient valve disc positioned in the fluid passageway and blocks fluid flow when the disc is in the closed position, and allows fluid flow when the disc is in the open position.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Still another needleless connector of the prior art uses a resilient conical valve head in a housing.
      <br/>
      The conical valve head is positioned against the valve seat to form a seal.
      <br/>
      When the male fitting of a syringe, or some other device, is inserted into the inlet of the housing, it pushes the tip portion of the resilient valve head inwardly so that the valve head is deformed away from the valve seat thereby allowing fluid communication.
      <br/>
      In still other embodiments of the prior art, a needleless connector includes an elastomeric conical valve head biased against a conical valve seat by a helical spring to form a seal.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The above generally described devices have greatly reduced the risk of needle-stick associated injuries by use of syringes to withdraw medical fluids from collapsible bags and bottles.</p>
    <p num="11">
      However, there still exists the need to provide a universal connector which may be used with a wide variety of connection sites.
      <br/>
      A seal or diaphragm is a main component of the herein-described invention which does not require penetration by any sharp or even blunt object in order to establish fluid communication between the content of the container and the site of delivery.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      In accordance with the present invention there is provided a single use universal connector which can be used to access the fluid content of a container or to transfer a fluid into the container.
      <br/>
      The single universal connector can be used in collapsible and non-collapsible bags, bottles and vials made of glass or polymeric material which contain a fluid exit port into which the universal connector is inserted sealing the fluid exit port.
      <br/>
      The fluid contained in the container may be a therapeutic liquid, diagnostic media or a nutritional formula which can be sterilized in bulk and then aseptically transferred into the container or it can be sterilized in the container stoppered with the universal connector.
      <br/>
      The single use universal connector is made of rigid or semi-rigid polymeric materials such as polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene and polypropylene.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The fluid in a container stoppered by the single use universal connector can be accessed by means well-known in the art, such as syringes having sharp or blunt needle cannulas.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the access means comprises a luer connector in order to prevent accidental injuries to health care workers and patients caused by the use of syringes.
    </p>
    <p num="14">The single use universal connector comprises:</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="33">
      Referring to FIGS. 1, 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D, there is shown an intravenous bag 10 of conventional generally rectangular configuration made of inert, flexible, polymeric material, such as polyvinylchloride.
      <br/>
      The single use universal connector of the present invention will be described in reference to such flexible, polymeric bags, however, the single use universal connector can be used with other fluid containers such as bottles and vials of various configurations made of rigid or semi-rigid materials.
      <br/>
      Such containers will have fluid exit ports into which the universal connector can slideably be attached or it can be an integral part thereof.
      <br/>
      The IV bag 10 contains a medical fluid 12 therein, such as a therapeutic, diagnostic or nutritional preparation.
      <br/>
      The medical fluid 12 may be pre-sterilized in bulk prior to its transfer to the IV bag, or it may be sterilized in the IV bag using sterilizing equipment and techniques known in the art.
      <br/>
      The IV bag further comprises a fluid exit port or tube 14 the distal end 16 of which is in communication with medical fluid 12 and the proximal end 18 of which is to slideably receive distal end 32 of universal connector 30.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, universal connector 30 may be integral with fluid exit port or tube 14 of IV bag 10.
      <br/>
      In both cases, fluid exit port or tube 14 is sealed into IV bag 10 by bottom seam 20 of IV bag 10.
      <br/>
      On the proximal end 34 of single use universal connector 30, cap 60 is mounted having internal thread means thereon for enclosing said proximal end 34.

Access to the spike access port 420 or 420', using a plastic spike, is gained by severing crimp seal 426 or 426'.</p>
    <p num="88">Needle access port 400 or 400' and spike access port 420 or 420' are positioned in the proximity of the IV access port, which positioning in combination with the bottom portion of pouch 410 or 410', having angle A or A', minimizes fluid waste/fluid hold up.</p>
    <p num="89">
      The container of the present invention mav be used for delivering a single dose or multi-dose of parenteral solution.
      <br/>
      The needle and spike ports, along with the IV access port, allow access to the drug in the pouch by means that happen to be available under any circumstances.
    </p>
    <p num="90">In addition to providing multiple access ports, the present invention provides further improvement in flexible containers designed for delivering parenteral solutions, such as diagnostic contrast media and drug formulations.</p>
    <p num="91">
      It was discovered that if the inside wall of the first sheet or the second sheet forming the pouch 410 of FIG. 18 or pouch 410' of FIG. 19 is embossed, fluid hold up in the form of drops adhering to the inside walls can be reduced or eliminated and the walls, as the content of the pouch is being drained into the injection site, adhering together and further trapping drops of the fluid, can be prevented.
      <br/>
      In accordance with this discovery there are provided the following preferred embodiments of the invention.

    <p num="101">Materials of Construction</p>
    <p num="102">
      The flexible container of the various embodiments of the present invention is made of known polymeric materials having properties which make them suitable for sterile delivery of parenteral liquids.
      <br/>
      The sheets for forming the walls of the container are preferably multilayer sheets and characterized by heat resistance, gloss, strength, flexibility, and chemical inertness.
      <br/>
      Preferably the sheets are transparent or at least translucent enabling visual inspection of the contents at all times during delivery of content form the container to the patient.
      <br/>
      The container must be sterilizable, preferably by heat, along with its content.
      <br/>
      At least one layer of the sheet must be impervious to atmospheric gases and to steam.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the internal surface of the pouch in contact with the parenteral solution therein should be impervious to gas and steam.
      <br/>
      The interior layer in contact with the parenteral solution must not contain any toxic agents or even plasticizers which could leach out and contaminate the solution.
      <br/>
      The sheet may be made, for example, from polyvinylidene chloride sandwiched between two polyethylene or polyvinylacetate layers.
      <br/>
      The polyvinylidene chloride constitutes the impervious barrier.
      <br/>
      Further layers may be added to the face or back of the sheet, if desired, such as a polyolefin, preferably, polyethylene.
      <br/>
      Polyvinyl chloride is also suitable for the construction of the sheet and is well-accepted by the prior art for use in containers for medical fluid collection and delivery.
      <br/>
      Typical properties of polyvinyl chloride films include: a thickness of about 380 micron; a tensile strength of about 240 kg/cm2 ; a moisture vapor transmission rate of about 14-20(g/m2 /day at 38 (degree)  C., 100%RH); and an oxygen barrier of 650 (cc/m2 /day at 23 (degree)  C., 0% RH, bar.
      <br/>
      CRYOVAC.RTM. sterlizable medical films (W. R. Grace and Co.) are especially suitable to construct the sheets used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      The films comprise a polyethylene layer sandwiched between polyester outer layers sealed together by a modified propylene copolymer.
      <br/>
      Typical properties of the film include: a thickness of about 190 micron; a tensile strength of about 250kg/cm2 ; a moisture vapor transmission rate of 5 (g/m2 /day at 38 (degree)  C., 100%RH); and an oxygen barrier of about 1500 (cc/m2 /day at 23 (degree)  C., 0%RH, bar).
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      Other polymeric films or sheets for constructing the universal, flexible container of the present invention include: copolyester ether monolayer films, such as polycyclohexanedimethylcyclohexane, dicarboxylate elastomer made by Eastman Kodak Co.; and ethyl vinyl acetate made by Stedim, Inc.
      <br/>
      It is important that the fluid contacting layer of the multilayer sheet contain no plasticizer which may contaminate the fluid content of the container.
      <br/>
      Preferably, no plasticizer should be used at all on any of the multilayers to form the universal, flexible container of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      The sheets used in the present invention may be embossed with the described configuration by techniques known in the art.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the layer constituting the internal liquid contacting layer of the sheet may be embossed prior to forniing the multilayer sheets.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      Access ports used in the present invention may be made of polyvinyl chloride which are sold commercially for use in medical devices.
      <br/>
      Other port and tubing materials may also be used, such as CRYOVAC.RTM. Port Tubing (W. R. Grace &amp; Co.) which comprise three concentric layers of polymeric materials: a polyolefin layer is sandwiched between an outer layer of modified propylene copolymer and an inner layer of ethylene vinyl acetate or polyvinyl chloride.
    </p>
    <p num="106">Process of Making the Container</p>
    <p num="107">
      The flexible plastic container in the form of a bag, pouch or bottle is made of two rectangular sheets of polymeric materials one of which is embossed and flat welded together on four sides so as to define between the two sheets and the four welded sides a reservoir.
      <br/>
      The volume of the container is zero before it is filled and typically has an internal volume capacity of from about 50 to about 5,000 ml when it is filled with a medical fluid, such as a parenteral solution.
      <br/>
      Access ports 330 or 330', 402 or 402', and 422 or 422' are sealed by the same welding process used to seal the two superimposed layers of sheets together at the center C or C' of the container 310 or 310'. Upon completion of the welding process the container is suspended via holes 321 or 321', followed by filling the container through the IV access port with the desired medical fluid.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      In the process of delivering the medical fluid to a patient using the IV access port equipped with the single use universal connector, the container 310 or 310' is suspended via hole 317 or 137', cap 60 or 60' is removed and one way luer slip assembly is engaged with the single use universal connector.
      <br/>
      Vent 348 or 348' allows outside air to replace the drained medical fluid in the container so that fluid flow is steady and continuous.
      <br/>
      If fluid delivery is desired using the needle or spike access ports, the container is suspended via hole 317 or 317', crimp seal 406 or 406' or 426 or 426' is severed and needle or spike is inserted into the respective ports to enable delivery of the medical fluid to the desired site on the patient.
