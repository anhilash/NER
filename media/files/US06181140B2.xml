      <br/>
      A method and apparatus are used for locating cable breaks and resistive faults in cables, including fibre optic cables.
      <br/>
      The conductive shield or armour of the cable is divided into sections, usually at a splice.
      <br/>
      A step function voltage is applied to one end of the conductive shield.
      <br/>
      Remote sensors at the end of each section monitor the voltage and current as a function of time and at steady state.
      <br/>
      The measured data are encoded as current pulses and transmitted along the armour to the end of the cable.
      <br/>
      A computer at the cable end calculates from the measured voltages and currents the capacitance of each section of the shield.
      <br/>
      A broken section is identified by comparing the calculated and original capacitances of the sections and the distance along the broken section to the break is calculated from the calculated and original capacitances of the broken section.
      <br/>
      Resistive faults in the cable are located by calculating a fault resistance of each section of the shield from the measured steady state voltages and currents.
      <br/>
      A section containing a resistive fault is identified from the magnitude of the calculated fault resistance and the distance to the resistive fault is calculated from the measured steady state voltages and currents of the faulted section.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to the location of cable breaks and resistive faults in fiber optic cable.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In the past two decades the mass deployment of fiber optic cable has been instrumental in increasing the reliability of the world wide telecommunication network.
      <br/>
      This mass deployment has also resulted in the concentration of communication circuits into long lengths of physically small and mechanically vulnerable cables.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Fiber optic cables placed in the outside environment fall into one of three general categories, aerial, buried and underground.
      <br/>
      Aerial installation usually offers the lowest cost for new cable placement particularly when the pole route exists with support capacity available.
      <br/>
      Direct buried is favored on long haul routes when ploughing and trenching can be carried out in favorable right of way conditions.
      <br/>
      In new suburban areas buried cable construction is often a requirement to eliminate pole structures which compromise aesthetic appeal.
      <br/>
      Underground construction is generally defined as cable placement in pre-built duct structures buried under city streets.
      <br/>
      Due to the high initial construction costs of the duct structures, underground is the most expensive placement method but necessary to avoid tearing up city streets for the repair or addition of cable.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Each installation method has reliability and maintenance issues.
      <br/>
      The threat to the cable structures comes from two sources, man made problems and environmental conditions.
      <br/>
      Excluding craft error, man made failures include dig ups, collision, fire, and gunshot damage.
      <br/>
      Environmental threats include, rodents, lightning, floods, ice and power line failure.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Major outages are usually the result of a complete cut through of the cable structure.
      <br/>
      Unintentional cable dig ups are responsible for 50 percent or more of outages.
      <br/>
      Due to the high capacity of a fiber optic cable, a single cut cable can result in thousands of dollars a minute in lost revenue.
      <br/>
      It is therefore of critical importance that the location of the cable cut is determined quickly and a repair crew dispatched to the scene to restore the cable.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A well known method of locating a fiber cable break employs an Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR).
      <br/>
      In this method short pulses of light are launched into the severed fiber.
      <br/>
      A portion of the pulse is reflected back at the break and the time difference from the moment of launch to the return of the reflected light pulse is measured to estimate the distance to the break.
      <br/>
      For maximum benefit, an OTDR must be constantly measuring a test fiber in every cable selected for monitoring.
      <br/>
      The main drawback of this method is that OTDR instruments are costly and a fiber must be made available for the measurement.
      <br/>
      Deploying OTDR systems to actively monitor a large network of cables is therefore is costly and frequently involves complex interfacing to active optical fibers.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides an effective means to detect and locate a break in a fiber optic cable which does not employ OTDR techniques and does not require access to a test optical fiber.

      The metallic armour and surrounding insulating plastic jacket form a coaxial circuit when referenced to earth ground.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      FIG. 1 shows a low frequency model which can be used to electrically represent the coaxial circuit formed by the cable armour or shield 10 and the plastic insulating jacket with an earth return 12.
      <br/>
      The cable circuit is divided into n discrete sections which represent the individual cable lengths spliced together.
      <br/>
      Each section has a series resistance Rx and a shunt capacitance Cx, with the subscript x designating the section 1 to n.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Damage to the insulating jacket could result in faults to ground parallel to the shunt capacitances.
      <br/>
      Section fault to ground resistances Rfx are added to the electrical equivalent model as shown in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The method for determining the distance to a cable break including resistive faults for every cable section requires that the fault to ground resistance Rfx and shunt capacitance Cx be determined for every section.
      <br/>
      In simple terms, the method involves the application of a step function voltage to the circuit at the beginning of the cable under test and the measurement of the voltage and current as a function of time at the beginning and end of every section as illustrated in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The resistive and capacitive parameters Rfx and Cx are then calculated from the steady state and transient responses respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Detailed Mathematical Description</p>
    <p num="21">
      To determine the individual shunt capacitance Cx and fault resistance Rfx to ground for every section, a step input DC voltage is applied and the input and output current and voltage response measured for every cable section.
      <br/>
      The measured parameters are used to calculate the transient and steady state response of every section.
      <br/>
      The general response of the network at any point along the line is given by:
      <br/>
      v(t)=V0 +(Vf -V0) (1-e(-t/(rc)).  (1)
    </p>
    <p num="22">Where: V0 is the initial line voltage</p>
    <p num="23">
      - Vf is the final line voltage
      <br/>
      - rc is the circuit time constant
      <br/>
      and
      <br/>
      i(t)=I0 +(If -I0) (1-e(-t/(rc))  (2)
      <br/>
      Where: I0 is the initial line current
      <br/>
      - If is the final line current
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 4 shows the general voltage response and FIG. 5 shows the general current response of the nth section to a step voltage input.
      <br/>
      From the steady state conditions reached when the capacitive component of the line is charged, the nth section fault resistance is estimated by:
      <br/>
      Rfx =Vs /Is  (3)
      <br/>
      where
      <br/>
      Vs =(Vfx +Vfx+1)/2  (4)
      <br/>
      Is =Ifx -Ifx+1  (5)
      <br/>
      and Vfx is the steady state voltage at the beginning of the xth cable section
      <br/>
      Vfx+1 is the steady state voltage at the end of the xth cable section
      <br/>
      Ifx is the steady state current at the beginning of the xth cable section
      <br/>
      Ifx+1 is the steady state current at the end of the nth cable section
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The total capacitive charge for the xth cable section is calculated from the transient and steady state line currents as follows:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
      <br/>
      where Qx is the electrical charge of the xth cable section
      <br/>
      - ix (t) is the current into the xth cable section
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The capacitance for the xth cable section is calculated from the charge as follows:
      <br/>
      Cx =Qx /V  (7)
      <br/>
      where Cx is the capacitance of the xth section in farads
      <br/>
      - V is t he average voltage across the cable section
      <br/>
      and
      <br/>
      V=(Vn -Vn+1)/2  (8)
    </p>
    <p num="27">Equations (6) and (8) can be numerically evaluated by measuring the in put and output voltages and currents as functions of time for each cable section.</p>
    <p num="28">
      The fault resistance and capacitance for every cable section are thereby determined.
      <br/>
      In the event of a cable cut only ix (t), Vx (t), are reported from the last section.
      <br/>
      In this case all of the steady state current is fault current and all of the charge current is into the remaining cable section.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      As the capacitance per unit length is assumed to be constant the distance to the cut is estimated:
      <br/>
      D=L (Cf /Cx)  (9)
      <br/>
      where L is the original section length
      <br/>
      - Cf is the calculated capacitance after the cut
      <br/>
      - Cx is the original capacitance of the section before the cut
    </p>
    <p num="30">If the series resistance for a section is known, then referring to FIG. 6, the series resistance along the cable shield or armour to the location of a resistive fault to ground can be estimated from the steady state conditions by:</p>
    <p num="31">
      Ran=(Vx -Vx+1 -Ix+1 RI)/(Ix -Ix+1)  (10)
      <br/>
      where: RI is the total series resistance of the cable section (Ran+Rbn)
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The distance to the fault from the beginning of the section is calculated by:
      <br/>
      D=Dt Ran/RI  (11)
      <br/>
      where: D is the distance to the fault
      <br/>
      - Dt is the total length of the cable section
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In summary, by mathematically analyzing both the transient and steady state response of a cable section to a step input function, the distance to any cable open and the distance to a resistive fault can be determined accurately.
      <br/>
      Circuit Description
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The basic circuit for the measurement system including a remote sensor is shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      A computer controlled measurement system 14 is connected to the metal armor or shield 10 of the cable 16 under test.
      <br/>
      The armor is insulated from ground by an insulating plastic jacket 18.
      <br/>
      The measurement system has a digital voltmeter 20 and ammeter 22 to collect transmitted data from remote sensors 24 (one shown) which are often located at distances of 100 km or more away from the start of the cable.
      <br/>
      The data generated by the remote sensors is sent over the cable sheath as a series of current pulses.
      <br/>
      Encoded in the data are the charge and voltage readings from each remote location.
      <br/>
      A power supply 26 in the measurement system generates  +- 48 volts which is applied to the line to power the remote sensors and initiate the test sequence.
      <br/>
      Once the data is collected from all of the remote sensors, the computer calculates the line parameters using equations (7), (9), (10), and (11).
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The most convenient method of dividing the cable into measurement sections is to place remote sensing and measurement devices 24 at the cable splice locations.
      <br/>
      For fiber optic cables the typical cable section lengths range from 5 to 10 km.
      <br/>
      At the splice points the optical fibers 28 from one section are joined to the corresponding optical fiber in the next cable section.
      <br/>
      The entire spice arrangement is enclosed in a mechanical case which typically has sufficient space to allow placement of a small electronic device inside the case.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The circuit in FIG. 7 details the measurement system and one remote measurement device between cable sections 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      Resistor Rsense is in series with the cable armour 10 of the two sections and electrically completes the circuit through the splice.
      <br/>
      Rsense is a shunt resistor of a few ohms and converts the current passing from one section to the next into a proportional voltage.
      <br/>
      Two voltage dividers 30, consisting of resistors R1 and R2, and 32, consisting of resistors R3 and R4, are connected to opposite sides of resistor Rsense.
      <br/>
      The positive summing inputs of operational amplifiers U1 and U2 are connected across Rsense by the voltage dividers 30 and 32 and step down the line voltage and buffer the downstream analogue to digital (A/D) converters from the line.
      <br/>
      The output of U1 is applied through a voltage divider 34 consisting of resistors R5 and R6 to the positive input of an amplifier U3.
      <br/>
      The output of U2 is applied through a divider 36 consisting of resistors R7 and R8 to the negative input of U3.
      <br/>
      U3 forms a differential amplifier which scales the voltage drop across the current sense resistor Rsense.
      <br/>
      The output of U3 is applied to a current measurement input 38 of the A/D converter of a controller 40.
      <br/>
      The output of U2, which is proportional to the line to ground voltage, is applied to a voltage measurement input 42 of the A/D converter of the controller.
      <br/>
      The readings collected are processed by the controller and the data is transmitted over the cable sheath to the measurement system via current pulse modulation of a transistor Q1.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The timing diagram in FIG. 8 shows the sequence of line voltages to complete the line charge current and the steady state current and voltage readings.
      <br/>
      The line voltage between tests is -48V and when it switches to +48V all the sensors power up.
      <br/>
      The measurement system begins the test by toggling the line voltage.
      <br/>
      This charges and discharges the armour through all the sensors.
      <br/>
      The sensors approximately synchronize on the first pulse after the command and begin logging readings for several charge and discharge cycles.
      <br/>
      When the test is over the sensors send back the results specified by the power up command.
      <br/>
      Data is encoded by the controller as current pulses which are detected by the measurement system.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      To ensure that data sent by the remote sensors is not corrupted, only one sensor at a time may transmit.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished by assigning each remote sensor a unique code that represents a specific time slot during report phase of a test.
      <br/>
      The sensors are numbered so that the farthest from the start of the cable reports first.
      <br/>
      This order increases the speed of detecting opens.
      <br/>
      The capacitance of the open segment can be converted to a distance and reported first.
