    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to the fabrication of MOSFET devices that require an extremely reliable gate oxide process for control of the transistor, and specifically for deep submicron devices that require boron-doped gate polysilicon for the pMOS part of the CMOS flow.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Gate oxides that are incorporated into 0.25  MU m CMOS processes are extremely thin, on the order of 3.5 to 4.0 nm thick.
      <br/>
      Such oxides need to be a highly reliable insulator.
      <br/>
      Techniques to grow these thin oxide layers involve the use of one or more of the following gases: O2 (oxygen), H2 O (water vapor), N2 O (nitrous oxide), and NO (nitric oxide).
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In known prior art, the gate polysilicon is doped with phosphorous to form the N+ gate for both nMOS and pMOS devices.
      <br/>
      For smaller channel lengths, i.e., 0.25  MU m and below, it is necessary to form p+ doped polysilicon gates using boron for the pMOS devices to minimize short channel effects.
      <br/>
      The diffusion of boron through the gate oxide and into the channel region results in the shifting of threshold voltages and unpredictability in the performance of the ultimate circuit after fabrication, particularly as the device ages.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in devices where boron is present in the gate polysilicon it becomes necessary for the gate oxide to act as a barrier to the diffusion of boron atoms.

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>

    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="9">
      One technique for growing an oxide with boron barrier properties is to use the nitrogen containing oxidants N2 O or NO during the oxidation.
      <br/>
      The resulting oxide is better than a conventional pure O2 oxide or pyrogenic H2 O oxide, because it places nitrogen at the oxide-to-substrate silicon interface, which is known to block the boron from moving into the transistor channel region.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Referring now to FIG. 1, standard integrated circuit processing steps are implemented on a silicon wafer 10 to form a pSi substrate 12.
      <br/>
      An well 14 is formed in pSi substrate 12 by conventional means.
      <br/>
      Turning now to FIG. 2, a thin gate oxide layer 16, having a thickness of between 1.0 nm and 10 nm is grown on wafer 10.
      <br/>
      Any standard material and technique may be used to form this gate dielectric layer.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      For the step depicted in FIG. 3, wafer 10 is placed in a plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) process chamber 22, where a pure N2 plasma 18 is struck, and a mild pulse is applied to the wafer which causes nitrogen to be implanted into the gate dielectric near the top surface of oxide layer 16, and away from an SiO2 /Si interface 17. N+ and N2+ ions are implanted into oxide layer 16 at an energy of between 0.1 keV and 2.0 keV, at a dose of between 1 * 1013 cm-2 and 1 * 1016 cm-2, in the preferred embodiment.
      <br/>
      Implantation time varies between 10 seconds and 3 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      An anneal at a higher temperature follows, FIG. 4, which assists in the formation of stronger bonds within the gate insulator, and heals some of the damage created during the implant, creating an oxide layer having the desired concentration of nitrogen therein, 16+18.
      <br/>
      The annealing step is performed at a temperature of between 600 (degree)  C. and 1050 (degree)  C. for a period of 10 seconds to one hour.
      <br/>
      The gate polysilicon is deposited and is followed by the standard doping, annealing, and patterning steps required to complete the fabrication of the integrated circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      A schematic of the secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analysis, which probes the atomic nitrogen and oxygen concentrations with depth into the sample, is shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      Line "O" depicts the atomic percentage of oxygen vs. depth of oxide layer 16.
      <br/>
      Line "N") depicts the atomic percentage of nitrogen vs. depth of oxide layer 16.
      <br/>
      The conventional technique, the results of which are depicted in FIG. 5a, allows the nitrogen to exists at the bottom of the oxide layer, letting boron permeate the oxide itself, thereby reducing the reliability of the insulator.
      <br/>
      The nitrogen at the oxide-substrate interface also adversely affects the transistor drive current and device speed.
      <br/>
      The effective mobility, p, of carriers is decreased with more nitrogen at SiO2 /Si interface 17, as shown in the FIG. 6, in the case of NMOS transistors.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      A concentration profile for oxygen and nitrogen at interface 17 is depicted in FIG. 5b, which depicts secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) nitrogen concentration profiles, N, as a function of depth in a desired device.
      <br/>
      A method is needed to place nitrogen near the oxideto-polysilicon gate interface to inhibit diffusion of boron into the oxide without impacting carrier mobility.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Implantation of nitrogen, using conventional implantation techniques, into the gate polysilicon has been shown to improve the boron diffusion properties.
      <br/>
      Nitrogen that is placed within the polysilicon film itself will also inhibit boron diffusion.
      <br/>
      The problems with this technique, however, is that control of the implant energy is critical.
      <br/>
      Implantation at too high an energy may cause damage to the oxide, thereby reducing its reliability.
      <br/>
      Implantation at too low an energy will leave nitrogen in the polysilicon, which may increase its resistivity and lead to poly depletion effects.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      As previously stated, an object of the invention is to place nitrogen at the top surface of the oxide prior to deposition of the gate polysilicon.
      <br/>
      This will effectively block the diffusion of boron into the insulator layer and preserve its reliability, while maintaining the desired properties of the polysilicon layer.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The method of the invention results in the placement of nitrogen at the top surface of oxide layer 16 by plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII).
      <br/>
      Referring now to FIG. 7, a PIII apparatus is depicted generally at 20.
      <br/>
      PIII apparatus 20 includes a vacuum chamber 22.
      <br/>
      A plasma discharge 24, containing the material that is desired to be implanted, in this case N2+ and N+ ions, is created in vacuum chamber 22.
      <br/>
      A wafer 26 is placed on a chuck 28 that is biased with negative voltage pulses of very short duration and high amplitudes of less than 3kV but at a high repetition rate, as shown in the inset graph, G. The negative pulse on chuck 28 attracts positive charged species towards the substrate of wafer 26.
      <br/>
      By adjusting the power of the plasma discharge and the voltage amplitude, pulse width, and repetition rate, the ionized species is embedded into gate oxide layer 16 either towards the lower interface, the bulk oxide, or the top surface.
      <br/>
      The variables are adjusted, in practicing the method of the invention, to embed nitrogen ion near the upper surface of oxide layer 16.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Experiments, using a variety of techniques, and varying parameters, were performed to investigate the viability of the method of the invention, and resulted in the nitrogen profiles shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 depicts the resulting SIMS profile of oxygen and nitrogen in N2 plasma implantation into a 120  Angstrom  gate oxide.
      <br/>
      The oxygen concentration of conventional techniques is depicted by trace 30.
      <br/>
      Exposure to the N2 plasma only, trace 32, with no implanting pulses, incorporates a small amount of nitrogen into the film and interface, which is well above the detection limit.
      <br/>
      The implantation pulses turned on for two minutes, trace 34, resulted in an order of magnitude more nitrogen in the bulk of the oxide for an oxide layer thickness of 10 nm.
      <br/>
      Even though there is some nitrogen at the interface, it is approximately 0.1 atomic percent which will result in only a 5% degradation in carrier mobility, from FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      A longer implantation time (5minutes), trace 36, results in even more nitrogen in the bulk and interface which illustrates the dose control possible with implant time, for an oxide layer thickness of 1.0 nm to 10 nm.
      <br/>
      Optimization of the implant conditions needs to be performed for each gate oxide thickness using the parameters set forth herein.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Thus, a method of fabricating MOSFET devices which require a reliable gate oxide process for control of the transistor, and specifically for deep submicron devices that require boron-doped gate polysilicon for the pMOS part of the CMOS flow for threshold voltage control and insensitivity to device size has been disclosed.
      <br/>
      Although a preferred embodiment of the invention has been disclosed, it will be appreciated that further modifications and variations may be made thereto without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
