    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a package having a closure disposed thereon.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention relates to a package with an extended top panel for pronounced positioning of a closure on the top panel, and a blank therefor.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      A preferred package for milk and juice is the gable-top package.
      <br/>
      The gable-top package is usually composed of a paperboard material coated on its exterior and interior surfaces with a thermoplastic material such as polyethylene.
      <br/>
      The package is formed from a blank that has a plurality of crease lines for proper folding of the blank into the desired package shape.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The unconstructed form, or blank has a plurality of side panels (usually four) and corresponding top panels and bottom panels.
      <br/>
      The four side panels define the front, rear and side walls of the package while the top panels form the well-known gable-top.
      <br/>
      Known gable-top packages have two equal and opposite top panels meeting at the top fin of the gable-top.
      <br/>
      The other two top panels are folded under these two opposing top panels.
      <br/>
      The aesthetically pleasing gable-top design has a functional aspect that leads to its structure and design.
      <br/>
      That function is to provide an integrated spout for accessing the product contained with the gable-top package.
      <br/>
      The integrated closure is formed by unsealing one of the folded-under top panels and pulling it outward to form the integrated spout.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In order to allow a consumer to unseal the top panel, it is sometimes necessary to provide an abhesive, or to lessen the top seal in some other manner.
      <br/>
      This has created problems for products that require tight seals to prevent oxygen transmission that could otherwise degrade the product.
      <br/>
      Also, after initially opening the package, the resealing of the package is not as tight as desired by some consumers.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The packaging industry responded to this problem by providing plastic closures (also referred to as fitments) that allow for a tight reseal after initial access of the product.
      <br/>
      The closure is attached to the carton either through an aperture in a top panel prior to filling, or on the exterior of the carton over an aperture prior to filling or after top sealing.
      <br/>
      Various attachment methods have been used to apply the closure to the carton, such as ultrasonic sealing, hot melt, induction sealing and the like.
      <br/>
      Thus, the only modification to the traditional gable-top package has been the attachment of the closure to one of the opposing top panels.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The gable-top package with the closure on one of the opposing top panels has come to dominate the packaging of juice, and is a favorite for milk and milk related products such as coffee creamers.
      <br/>
      The closure can be a screw-cap closure or a flip-cap closure, both of which are resealable, and can be attached through the aforementioned application methods.
      <br/>
      Pourability of the product from the package through the closure is acceptable; however, product does not pour as well as from the older designs that include an integrated spout, because of the placement of the closure in the center of the top panel.
      <br/>
      In addition, the closure is usually a predetermined size that corresponds to the surface area of the top panel, which restricts or limits alterations to the closure and new closure designs.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      These restraints on the closure are created, in part, by the development of the closure for the established gable-top package.
      <br/>
      These closures have been adapted to the structure and design of the gable-top package.
      <br/>
      This included the fabrication process of the gable-top package from a carton on a form, fill and seal packaging machine, such as a TETRA REX.RTM. packaging machine available from Tetra Pak Incorporated of Chicago, Ill.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Accordingly, there is a need for a package that can accommodate a variety of closure types and designs.
      <br/>
      Desirably, such a package will accommodate closures configured for enhanced product pourability.
      <br/>
      Most desirably, such a package can be used with, i.e., constructed and sealed on, currently known and operated packaging machines.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      A package includes an extended top panel, a closure, a front wall, a rear wall and parallel side walls.
      <br/>
      The extended top panel can be formed with an aperture therethrough for accommodating a closure.
      <br/>
      The front wall engages the extended top panel at a first edge and has a length.
      <br/>
      The rear wall is opposite the front wall and has a length.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the rear wall length is greater than the length of the front wall.
      <br/>
      The first and second parallel side walls engage the front wall at front edges and the rear wall at rear edges.
      <br/>
      The extended top panel is sealed to the rear wall or a lesser top panel at a sealing region.
      <br/>
      A vertical plane through the sealing region is spaced from (non-coplanar with) a vertical plane through the center of the package.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      For purposes of the present disclosure, three "forms" of the present package will be referred to herein.
      <br/>
      A first form, in which the package is fully or partially constructed, with the side seal in place and with the top and bottom panels sealed is referred to as a "package".
      <br/>
      This is the gable-top package commonly known by consumers and recognized from retailer's and marketer's shelves and displays.
      <br/>
      A "carton" is that form of the package that has a tubular form.
      <br/>
      That is, the side seal has been made, but the top and bottom panels are yet unconstructed (unfolded and/or unsealed).
      <br/>
      Thus, this form has a tubular shape, and is commonly known by paper or stock suppliers and packagers.
      <br/>
      A "blank" is that form in which the stock material is laid flat, with no seals yet made.
      <br/>
      That is, the material has been cut, and the creases made in the stock material, but the material is unfolded and unsealed.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The extended top panel can extend from the rear wall to the front wall and have an angle less than ninety degrees to the rear wall.
      <br/>
      The package can include a second top panel that meets the extended top panel at a top fin of the package.
      <br/>
      The top fin is coextensive with the sealing region.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the second top panel has a surface area less than a surface area of the extended top panel.
      <br/>
      The first and second side walls can have slanted top edges parallel to one another.
      <br/>
      A preferred angle of the extended top panel to the rear wall is about forty-five degrees to about eighty degrees.
      <br/>
      In such an arrangement, the top fin of the package is off-center.
      <br/>
      The present package can use a closure having a cap with a diameter greater than a diameter of the aperture formed in the package to receive the pour spout.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The package can also include a handle attached to the package, preferably at the top fin.
      <br/>
      A multiple of packages can be attached to a single handle to facilitate carrying the packages.
      <br/>
      The handle can be formed with an unattached section and an attached section with the unattached section foldable over the attached section to facilitate pouring the contents from the container.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Another aspect of the present invention is a blank for a package with an extended top panel.
      <br/>
      The blank includes an extended top panel, a rear wall panel, a first side wall panel, a front wall panel and a second side wall panel.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the rear wall panel has a length greater than the length of the front wall panel.
      <br/>
      A plurality of vertical score lines partition each of the panels from adjacent panels.
      <br/>
      The extended top panel is adjacent the front wall panel and is partitioned from the front wall panel by a first horizontal score line.
      <br/>
      The extended top panel can have an aperture therethrough for receiving an optional pour spout.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The blank can include a plurality of slanted top panels.
      <br/>
      The rear wall of the blank can be formed without a top panel.
      <br/>
      The first side wall panel of the blank can be partitioned from a corresponding slanted top panel by a first slanted score line, and the second side wall panel partitioned from a corresponding slanted top panel by a second slanted score line.
      <br/>
      The rear wall of the blank has a corresponding top panel partitioned therefrom by a horizontal score line.
      <br/>
      The corresponding top panel of the rear wall panel has a surface area that is less than a surface area of the extended top panel.
      <br/>
      The blank can include a plurality of triangular top panels.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In one embodiment, the blank includes a central top fin panel that is partitioned from the extended top panel by a top horizontal score line.
      <br/>
      The central top fin panel can be juxtaposed on each side by first and second horizontal top fin panels.
      <br/>
      The first and second horizontal top fin panels can each have slanted top fin panels adjacent thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Another aspect of the present invention is a package including a single top panel, a front wall, a rear wall, first and second parallel side walls and a closure.
      <br/>
      The single top panel can include an aperture therethrough for accommodating an optional closure that is disposed about the aperture.
      <br/>
      The front wall engages the single top panel at a first edge and has a length.
      <br/>
      The rear wall is opposite the front wall and engages the single top panel at a second edge.
      <br/>
      The rear wall has a length that is greater than the length of the front wall.
      <br/>
      The first and second parallel side walls engage the front wall at front edges and the rear wall at rear edges.
      <br/>
      The first and second parallel side walls each engage the single top panel at slanted edges.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      This aspect of the present invention can include a top fin disposed on the rear wall.
      <br/>
      The package is configured to receive a closure having a cap with a diameter greater than a diameter of the aperture formed in the package for receiving the pour spout.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="19">While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in various forms, there is shown in the drawings and will hereinafter be described presently preferred embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments illustrated.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Referring now to the figures and in particular to FIGS. 1-3, there is shown a preferred embodiment of a package 20 embodying the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      An optional closure 22 is disposed on the package 20.
      <br/>
      The package 20 has first and second side walls 24a,b, a front wall 26, a rear wall 28, an extended top panel 30 and a top fin 32.
      <br/>
      The bottom of the package 20 is generally designated 34.
      <br/>
      Edge 36a defines the intersection of the front wall 26 and the side wall 24a, and edge 36b defines the intersection of the front wall 26 and the side wall 24b.
      <br/>
      Edge 38a defines the intersection of the rear wall 28 and the side wall 24a, and edge 38b (not shown), defines the intersection of the rear wall 28 and side wall 24b.
      <br/>
      A slanted edge 40a defines the intersection of the top panel 30 and the side wall 24a, and a slanted edge 40b defines the intersection of the top panel 30 and the side wall 24b.
      <br/>
      A front edge 42 defines the intersection of the top panel 30 and the front wall 26, and a rear edge 44 defines the intersection of the top panel 30 and the rear wall 28.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      As set forth above, three "forms" of the present package will be referred to herein.
      <br/>
      A first form, in which the package is fully or partially constructed, with the side seal in place and with the top and bottom panels sealed is referred to as a "package".
      <br/>
      This is the gable-top package commonly known by consumers and recognized from retailer's and marketer's shelves and displays.
      <br/>
      A "carton" is that form of the package that has a tubular form.
      <br/>
      That is, the side seal has been made, but the top and bottom panels are yet unconstructed (unfolded and/or unsealed).
      <br/>
      Thus, this form has a tubular shape, and is commonly known by paper or stock suppliers and packagers.
      <br/>
      A "blank" is that form in which the stock material is laid flat, with no seals yet made.
      <br/>
      That is, the material has been cut, and the creases made in the stock material, but the material is unfolded and unsealed.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As can be seen form FIG. 1, the extended top panel 30 and rear wall 28 are sealed to one another at a sealing region 33, which in the present embodiment is coextensive with the fin 32.
      <br/>
      Unlike known gable-top packages, the sealing region 33 or fin 32 is positioned asymmetrically, that is spaced from a vertical plane Pc20 through the center of the package 20.
      <br/>
      This vertically asymmetrical configuration, and asymmetrical plane Psr20 though the sealing region, is a novel feature not known in current package arrangement, in which a vertical plane through the center of the package also extends through the fin and defines mirror image, symmetrical package "halves" or portions.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Front wall 26 has a length Lf20 and rear wall 28 has a length Lr20.
      <br/>
      The length Lf20 is less than the length Lr20.
      <br/>
      This difference in the lengths, i.e., Lf20 less Lf20, creates the extended top panel 30.
      <br/>
      Thus, the front edge 42 is lower than the rear edge 44 when the package 20 is in an upright position as shown.
      <br/>
      The top panel 30 is at a predetermined angle  ALPHA 20 to the rear wall 28.
      <br/>
      The angle  ALPHA 20 can be about 10 degrees to about 90 degrees, and preferably, about 30 degrees to about 80 degrees.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the angle  ALPHA 20 is about 45 degrees to about 75 degrees.
      <br/>
      A most preferred angle  ALPHA 20 is 65 degrees.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring now to FIG. 1, the closure 22 typically includes a cap 23, a pour spout 25 and a flange 27.
      <br/>
      The package 20 is configured to accommodate a larger than typical spout 25 and/or cap 23.
      <br/>
      Unlike known packages, the closure 22 of the present package 20 can be larger than known package closure because the present package 20 is configured to accommodate the closure 22, rather than the accepted practice of the closure being configured for the package.
      <br/>
      The closure 22 can cover a large portion of the area of the top panel 30, and can cover at least half of the surface area of the top panel 30, the surface area being defined as the area within the edges 40a, 40b, 42 and 44.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The closure 22 can be attached or mounted to the package 20 in any of a variety traditional, known application methods such as ultrasonic sealing, induction sealing, hot melt adhesive, and the like.
      <br/>
      However, if the cap 23 has a diameter d that is greater than the diameter of the aperture 48 (FIG. 4), then the cap 23 may be attached in a separate operation from the attachment of the entirety of the closure 22.
      <br/>
      Alternately, the closure 22 may be applied in a post processing application such as disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/238,768 which was filed on Jan. 28, 1999, entitled Post-Processing Fitment Applicator, which relevant parts are hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      Such a post processing application allows for a closure 22 of any size and shape to be applied to the package 20.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the closure 22 may have a membrane or like seal (not shown) covering the spout 25 to prevent contamination of the product prior to attachment of the cap 23.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The extended top panel 30 also provides a greater surface area for printing to permit enhanced marketing for the product.
      <br/>
      Marketing of the product will be further described below.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      A blank 50 for the package 20 is shown in FIG. 4.

      The aperture 48 can be formed in the blank 50 if the package 20 is to be fitted with the optional closure 22.
      <br/>
      The aperture 48 can be formed as an opening in the blank 50 or it can be formed by forming a weakened region (a score line or perforations) to define the outline of the aperture.

      In a typical packaging machine (not shown), the blank 50, with the sealing panel 60 sealed to the rear wall panel 28 (as a carton), is supplied from a magazine and erected on a mandrel.
      <br/>
      The bottom 34 of the carton 20 is formed on the mandrel.
      <br/>
      The partially-formed package 20 is then discharged from the mandrel to a conveyor.
      <br/>
      The conveyor transports the partially-formed package to various stations on the packaging machine.
      <br/>
      A first station can be a closure application station, followed by a sterilization station.
      <br/>
      Packages can then be conveyed to a filling station where the product is dispensed into the package 20 through the open top.
      <br/>
      The next and final station may be a top sealing station.
      <br/>
      The top sealing station may require modification from the traditional top sealing station because the top fin 32 is not disposed symmetrically about the central vertical plane Pc20 of the package; rather the coextensive sealing region 33 and fin 32 are asymmetrically positioned relative to the package 20, and in the same vertical plane Psr20 as the rear wall 28.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The various stations in any given packaging machine can be varied, and the above discussion is intended to provide an exemplary operation only.
      <br/>
      As such, the above-discussed packaging operation is not intended to limit the present invention in any manner, but is provided for an understanding of the operation of one known packaging machine system.

      The slanted top panels 62a and 62b are pushed inward at score line 66a to fold panel 62b over panel 62a.
      <br/>
      A similar operation is carried out on panels 64a,b.
      <br/>
      Top panel 30 is then folded over the now folded slanted top panels 62a,b and 64a,b.
      <br/>
      Fin panels 68, 82, 84, 86 and 88 are then sealed to one another in the top sealing operation to form the package 20 of FIG. 1.

      A most preferred embodiment of the package 120 embodying the principles of the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 6A. The package 120 can include an optional closure 22 that is similar to the closure illustrated with the embodiment of the package 20 of FIGS. 1-3. The package 120 has first and second side walls 124a,b (124b not shown), a front wall 126, a rear wall 128 (not shown), an extended top panel 130, a second lesser top panel 131 and a top fin 132.
      <br/>
      An edge 136a defines the intersection of the front wall 126 and the side wall 124a, and an edge 136b defines the intersection of the front wall 126 and the side wall 124b.
      <br/>
      Likewise, edge 138a defines the intersection of the rear wall 128 and the side wall 124a, and edge 138b defines the intersection of the rear wall 128 and side wall 124b.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In this configuration, unlike the package 20 of FIGS. 1-3, an inner gable portion 129a,b is formed on each side of the package above the side walls 124a,b and below and between the extended and lesser top panels 130, 131.
      <br/>
      To this end, a slanted edge 140a defines the intersection of a triangular inner top panel 162b (FIG. 8) and the side wall 124a, and a slanted edge 140b defines the intersection of the opposing triangular inner top panel 164b (FIG. 8) and the side wall 124b.
      <br/>
      Edge 140a corresponds to crease line 172 (FIG. 8) and edge 140b corresponds to crease line 174 (FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      This relationship is presented in more detail below in the portion of the present disclosure that is directed to the package blank.
      <br/>
      A front edge 142 defines the intersection of the top panel 130 and the front wall 126, and a rear edge 144 defines the intersection of the second lesser top panel 131 and the rear wall 128.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The extended top panel 130 and the second lesser top panel 131 meet at the sealing region 133, which in this embodiment is coextensive with a top fin 132.
      <br/>
      As will be seen from FIG. 6, the coextensive sealing region 133 and top fin 132, are generally off-center from an the central plane Pc120 through the package 120.
      <br/>
      Thus, the vertical plane Psr120 through the fin 132 and sealing region 133 defines asymmetrical package portions on each side of the plane.
      <br/>
      This results in the extended top panel 130 having a greater surface area than the second lesser top panel 131.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The front wall 126 has a length Lf120 and the rear wall 128 has a length Lr120.
      <br/>
      As will be apparent from FIG. 6, the length Lf120 is less than the length Lr120, which difference in lengths creates the extended top panel 130.
      <br/>
      Thus, the front edge 142 is lower than the rear edge 144 when the package 120 is in an upright position as shown.
      <br/>
      The slanted edges 140a and 140b are at an angle  ALPHA 120 to the rear wall 128.
      <br/>
      The angle  ALPHA 120 can be about 10 degrees to about 90 degrees, and is preferably about 30 degrees to about 80 degrees.
      <br/>
      A more preferred angle  ALPHA 120 is about 45 degrees to about 85 degrees, and a most preferred angle  ALPHA 120 is about 75 degrees.

    <p num="38">
      The extended top panel 130 also provides a greater surface area for printing, which allows for enhanced marketing of the product.

      Still another embodiment of the package 220 is illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 7A. In this contemplated embodiment, the top panel 230 is extended, however, the rear wall 228 and the front wall 226 are of the same length.
      <br/>
      Like the first and second embodiments 20, 120, the second lesser top panel 231 of this embodiment 220, engages the extended top panel 230 off center from the central plane Pc220 of the package 220.
      <br/>
      The edges 240a and 240b (not shown) are not slanted, but rather are generally parallel to the package bottom 234.
      <br/>
      The extended top panel 230 of the package 220 is configured to accommodate the optional enlarged closure 22 thereon.
