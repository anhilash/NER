    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a non-aqueous electrolytic solution for capacitors which contains primarily a phosphoric ester, specifically a non-aqueous electrolytic solution for electric double layer capacitors, more specifically a capacitor showing high energy density and excellent withstand voltage and charging/cycle properties, and especially a non-aqueous electrolytic solution that can provide electric double layer capacitors.</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Up to the present, capacitors, particularly electric double layer capacitors having a capacity intermediate between that of a battery and that of a capacitor, as a backup power supply for IC's and memories and a supplement or alternative to secondary batteries, have been used widely as a low-power direct-current power supply.
      <br/>
      In recent years, however, there have been new portable electronic devices coming into being one after another, such as VTR with a built-in camera, cellular phones and laptop computers.
      <br/>
      Amid this trend, there has been a growing demand that those electric double layer capacitors used as a backup power supply and a supplement or alternative to secondary batteries should have higher energy density.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      These electric double layer capacitors, unlike batteries, do not convert a chemical change into electric energy.
      <br/>
      They utilize a large capacity of the electric double layer that occurs between the electrodes and the electrolytic solution to put in and take out an electric charge in the same manner as the charge and discharge of batteries.
      <br/>
      Such electric double layer capacitors are made up of two electrodes, a separator and, normally a corrosion-resistant electrolytic solution.
      <br/>
      The two electrodes, formed from a material having a large surface area such as activated carbon and a binder such as a fluororesin, are so arranged that they face each other via a porous separator made of polyethylene or polypropylene, and the space between these electrodes and the porous separator and the inside of the porous separator are filled with the aforementioned electrolytic solution.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      As the electrolytic solution for such electric double layer capacitors, aqueous-solution-based electrolytic solutions and organic-solvent-based electrolytic solutions (non-aqueous electrolytic solutions) are used.
      <br/>
      However, aqueous-solution-based electrolytic solutions have the problem of it being difficult to obtain a low potential window of electrochemical stability(approx. 1.2 V) and high-energy-density electric double layer capacitors from them.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      By contrast, compared with aqueous-solution-based electrolytic solutions, organic-solvent-based electrolytic solutions (non-aqueous electrolytic solutions) show a high potential window of electrochemical stability and therefore make the formation of high-energy-density capacitors possible.
      <br/>
      Because of this, electric double layer capacitors using non-aqueous electrolytic solutions are beginning to come into use rapidly as backup power supplies for electronic equipment for non-military use.
    </p>
    <p num="6">As such non-aqueous electrolytic solutions, a mixture of a non-aqueous solvent such as a cyclic carbonic ester exhibiting a high dielectric constant and an electrolyte such as tetraethylammoniumtetrafluoroborate, for example, is used.</p>
    <p num="7">
      However, such an electrolytic solution as mentioned above has had the problem of releasing a large amount of gas due to the decarboxylation decomposition of the solvent at high temperature due to the use of cyclic carbonic ester as the solvent and consequently being unable to provide long-life capacitors.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, when future capacitors have high energy density, the aforementioned electrolytic solutions might be insufficient in the potential window of electrochemical stability.
      <br/>
      Because of this, it has been hoped that a non-aqueous electrolyte having better charging/discharging cycle properties will come into existence.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The inventors of the present invention sought a solution to the problems of the conventional technology as described above.
      <br/>
      The present invention is intended to provide non-aqueous electrolytic solutions for capacitors which release little gas and have an excellent potential window of electrochemical stability, and enable capacitors to have excellent charging/discharging cycle properties and safety performance.
      <br/>
      This invention is also intended to provide capacitors containing such non-aqueous electrolytic solutions.
      <br/>
      The non-aqueous electrolytic solution for capacitors to which the present invention relates comprises a solvent for electrolytic solution containing a phosphoric ester represented by the following formula (I) and an electrolyte:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)

    <p num="9">(wherein, R1, R2 and R3, which may be the same or different, are an alkyl group, an unsaturated hydrocarbon group or an aryl group).</p>
    <p num="10">The capacitors to which the present invention relates use the non-aqueous electrolytic solution for capacitors as described above.</p>
    <p num="11">The non-aqueous electrolytic solution for capacitors to which the present invention relates releases little gas and shows a high potential window of electrochemical stability and excellent safety performance and charging/discharging cycle properties.</p>
    <p num="12">
      Especially, the use of the non-aqueous electrolytic solution for capacitors to which the present invention relates in the formation of capacitors enables the obtaining of capacitors which generate high voltage, release little gas and show excellent charging/discharging cycle properties and energy density.
      <br/>
      This effect manifests itself markedly especially when the electrolytic solution is used in electric double layer capacitors.

      <br/>
      Further, the use of (C2 H5)3 (CH3)NBF4 enables high electric conductivity to be obtained.

    <p num="37">Because of this, the use of he non-aqueous electrolytic solution for electric double layer capacitors to which the present invention relates enables the obtaining of electric double layer capacitors which release little gas and show high withstand voltage and excellent charging/discharging cycle properties.</p>
    <p num="38">Capacitors</p>
    <p num="39">
      The electric double layer capacitors are made up of two electrodes, a separator and normally a corrosion-resistant electrolytic solution.
      <br/>
      The two electrodes, formed from a material having a large surface area such as activated carbon and a binder such as fluororesins, are so arranged that they face each other via a porous separator made of polyethylene or polypropylene, and the space between these electrodes and the porous separator and the inside of the porous separator are filled with the electrolytic solution.

      Examples of the binder are carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylidene chloride, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyimide, polyvinyl alcohol and polyacrylic acid.
      <br/>
      Further, a combination of the aforementioned electrode material (active material) and a collector is normally used preferably for the electrodes.

      Sealing Part 7, made of rubber, is attached to the Anode Site Lead Wire 2 and Cathode Site Lead Wire 4 of Capacitor Element 1.
      <br/>
      Further, Capacitor Element 1, previously impregnated with a driving electrolytic solution, is put in Metal Case 8 made of aluminum in a bottomed cylindrical form.
      <br/>
      As a result of Capacitor Element 1 being housed in Metal Case 8, Sealing Part 7 is located at the opening of Metal Case 8, and the opening of Metal Case 8 is sealed by subjecting the case to the processing of side squeezing and curling.
      <br/>

      Furthermore, it can also be seen that since the wound-type electric double layer capacitors using the electrolytic solutions of Examples 1, 2, 3 and 4 show only a slight change in height after the charging/discharging test compared with the wound-type electric double layer capacitors using the electrolytic solutions of Comparative Example 1, the use of the electrolytic solution of the present invention makes possible the formation of electric double layer capacitors which release little gas and show high withstand voltage and excellent charging/discharging cycle properties.

      In the foregoing, the electrolytic solution for capacitors was explained by using electric double layer capacitors as an example.
