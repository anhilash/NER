      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The invention relates to a field effect transistor and a method of fabricating the same, and more particularly to a field effect transistor as a highly reliable, high-performance chemical compound electronic device operating in a range of microwaves and millimeter waves, and a method of fabricating the same.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      In these days, ternary and quaternary mixed crystal semiconductor such as InGaAs and InGaAsP have attracted attention.
      <br/>
      Among them, InGaAs matching in lattice to an InP substrate is in particular suitable to optical devices and material of which field effect transistors are made.
      <br/>
      In particular, a field effect transistor employing two-dimensional electron gas at a hetero-interface between InP and InAlAs has been much studied.
      <br/>
      The reasons why InGaAs is promising as an electron transfer device in comparison with GaAs and so on are as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      (a) a peak value at electron drift velocity is greater;
      <br/>
      (b) mobility of an electron at a low intensity electric field is greater;
      <br/>
      (c) it is easier to form ohmic electrodes with the result of smaller contact resistance;
      <br/>
      (d) greater overshoot in an electron speed can be expected;
      <br/>
      (e) smaller noise caused by root scattering; and
      <br/>
      (f) better characteristics with respect to an interface with insulating materials.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In addition, it is one of major reasons to be able to accomplish a two-dimensional electron gas device.</p>
    <p num="8">
      A field effect transistor employing two-dimensional electron gas at an interface between InGaAs and InAlAs is presently considered promising as a high performance microwave milliwave device, and is researched and developed.
      <br/>
      In particular, the above-mentioned field effect transistor has been confirmed to be effective as a low-noise device in experiments.
      <br/>
      For instance, as reported by K. H. G. Duh et al. in "A Super Low-Noise 0.1  MU m T-Gate InAlAs-InGaAs-InP HEMT", IEEE MICROWAVE AND GUIDED WAVE LETTERS.
      <br/>
      Vol. 1, No. 5, May 1991, pp. 114-116, noise figure of 1.2 dB and associated gain of 7.2 dB at 94 GHz in room temperature have been confirmed.
      <br/>
      The device having been reported by Duh was made of material accomplishing lattice match on an InP substrate, that is, In0.53 Ga0.47 As/In0.52 Al0.48 As, and material defining In composition.
      <br/>
      In the device, two-dimensional electron gas is formed in the In0.53 Ga0.47 As layer.
    </p>
    <p num="9">In order to enhance performance of the device, for instance, an attempt was made by G. I. NG et al. in "Improved Strained HEMT Characteristics Using Double-Heterojunction In0.65 Ga0.35 As/In0.52 Al0.48 As Design", IEEE ELECTRON DEVICE LETTERS, Vol. 10, No. 3, March 1989, pp. 114-116, where In composition in an InGaAs layer constituting a channel was arranged to have a figure greater than 0.53.</p>
    <p num="10">
      Recently, various high performances of a device have been reported in the field of InAlAs/InGaAs family hetero-junction field effect transistor.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, thermally unstable factors have been also reported.
      <br/>
      That is, impurities such as fluorine which is not a constituent of a device enter an epitaxial layer from outside to thereby inactivate donor in an impurity containing InAlAs layer usually used as a donor layer.
    </p>
    <p num="11">For instance, Hayafuji has reported degradation of a device caused by fluorine in "Thermal stability of AlInAs/GaInAs/InP heterostructure", Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 66, No. 7, February 1995, pp. 863-865. For another instance, Takahashi has reported degradation of a device caused by oxygen in "Thermal Stability of Al0.48 In0.52 As/Ga0.47 In0.53 As/InP Heterostructure and its Improvement by Phosphidization", Proceedings of 7th International Conference of InP and Related Materials, 1995, pp. 597-600.</p>
    <p num="12">
      Fujihara et al. reported in Technical Report of IEICE ED95-105, pp. 13-20 that impurities entering an epitaxial layer are reduced in an amount by decreasing a composition rate of Al in an InAlAs Schottky layer formed on an InAlAs donor layer.
      <br/>
      That is, when a donor layer is composed of InAlAs, the thermal instability may be eliminated by forming a barrier layer on the donor layer for preventing impurities from entering to the donor layer.
      <br/>
      Fujihara reported conducting experiment in which there were formed samples of InAlGaAs Schottky layers containing no impurities and having different composition rates between Al and Ga, and the samples stood in heated condition.
      <br/>
      The result of the experiment was that as a composition rate of Al was decreased, fluorine entering an epitaxial layer was reduced in an amount, and further a reduction of a sheet electron density was stopped.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      As an example for enhancing reliability of a device in a similar manner, Fujihara et al. suggested a field effect transistor in "Thermally stable InAlAs/InGaAs heterojunction FET with AlAs/InAs superlattice insertion layer", ELECTRONICS LETTERS, 23rd May 1996, Vol. 32, No. 11, pp. 1039-1041. In the suggested field effect transistor, a superlattice layer composed of AlAs and InAs is inserted between a donor layer and a gate forming layer.
      <br/>
      It is reported that the field effect transistor can prevent intrusion of fluorine thereinto, and stop thermal degradation.
    </p>
    <p num="14">As an example of an InP layer used as a barrier layer, Enoki et al. has suggested a structure in "0.1- MU m InAlAs/InGaAs HEMTS WITH AN InP-RECESS-ETCH STOPPER GROWN BY MOCVD", Proceedings of 7th International Conference of InP and Related Materials, 1995, pp. 81-84. It is reported that an InP layer as a gate contact layer is formed on an InAlAs layer to thereby enhance uniformity of device characteristics in a wafer.</p>
    <p num="15">
      As mentioned above, when a donor layer is composed of InAlAs, inactivation of donor caused by intrusion of impurities thereinto is a major problem significantly reducing reliability of a device.
      <br/>
      In most of heterojunction field effect transistors to be formed on an InP substrate, a donor source layer is generally composed of an InAlAs layer.
      <br/>
      To the contrary, a transistor which does not employ InAlAs, but employs InP for a donor layer has been suggested by A. M. Kusters et al. in IEEE ELECTRON DEVICE LETTERS, Vol. 16, No. 9, 1995, pp. 396-398. The suggested transistor avoids inactivation of donor caused by intrusion of impurities such as fluorine by not employing InAlAs for a donor source layer, to thereby ensure thermal reliability.
    </p>
    <p num="16">As mentioned earlier, a major problem for reducing reliability in an InAlAs/InGaAs heterojunction transistor is that impurities such as fluorine present in an atmosphere or fluorine adhered to a surface of a sample in a process enters an epitaxial layer while a device is held in heated condition, resulting in that donor in an InAlAs layer containing n-type impurities therein is inactivated.</p>
    <p num="17">
      One of objects of the present invention is to solve this problem by providing a highly reliable high performance InAlAs/InGaAs family heterojunction transistor.
      <br/>
      One of solutions to the problem is to insert a barrier layer between an InAlAs donor layer and a gate electrode for preventing intrusion of impurities into an epitaxial layer.
      <br/>
      Up to now, it has been found out by experiments that intrusion of impurities into an epitaxial layer can be prevented by employing material other than InAlAs and AlGaAs, as having been reported by Hayafuji, Fujihara and Enoki.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      However, the use of a barrier layer is accompanied with other problems.
      <br/>
      If a barrier layer had positive conduction band discontinuity to material of which a cap layer is composed, since an ohmic electrode is formed on the barrier layer, a source resistance would be increased with the result of deterioration of performance of a device.
      <br/>

    <p num="41">
      One of keys of the present invention is to form a barrier layer below a gate electrode.
      <br/>
      The barrier layer is composed of material which does not allow impurities to pass therethrough in order to prevent InAlAs and AlGaAs layers, to which n-type impurities are implanted and which are readily contaminated with impurities such as fluorine, from being exposed outside.
      <br/>
      However, when the InAlAs and AlGaAs layers are crystal-grown in usual planar state, the formation of a barrier layer below a gate electrode may be accompanied with problems such as an increase of a source resistance and gate leakage.
      <br/>
      In addition, if a barrier layer is formed directly below a gate electrode, crystal growth conditions have to be determined in detail and/or a barrier layer may have a thickness limitation in order to avoid degradation in quality of a cap layer to be formed on a barrier layer.
      <br/>
      Hence, in accordance with the present invention, a recess is first formed, then a barrier layer and a gate contact layer are selectively grown within the recess, and finally a gate electrode is formed on the barrier layer.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The field effect transistor in accordance with the present invention prevents thermal instability thereof caused by impurities such as fluorine entering a donor layer to thereby inactivate donor.
      <br/>
      As a result, there is presented a highly reliable compound field effect transistor to be formed on an InP substrate.

    <p num="96">
      FIG. 9 illustrates a conventional field effect transistor including an InAlAs donor layer.
      <br/>
      The illustrated conventional field effect transistor includes a semi-insulating InP substrate 501, and an epitaxial-layered structure formed on the InP substrate 501.
      <br/>
      The epitaxial-layered structure is comprised of an InAlAs layer 502 containing no impurities therein, an InGaAs layer 503 containing no impurities therein, an InAlAs layer 504 containing no impurities therein, an InAlAs layer 505 containing impurities such as silicon therein, an InAlAs layer 506 containing no impurities, and an InGaAs layer 507 containing impurities such as silicon therein, all of which are deposited one on another in this order.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      Source and drain electrodes 508a and 508b are formed on the uppermost layer or InGaAs layer 507.
      <br/>
      The InGaAs layer 507 is formed with a recess between the source and drain electrodes 508a and 508b.
      <br/>
      A gate electrode 508c is formed on the InAlAs layer 506 within the recess of the InGaAs layer 507.
    </p>
    <p num="98">The gate electrode 508c and the recess are entirely covered with a rotection film 511 composed of SiN and deposited by PECVD.</p>
    <p num="99">The inventor conducted the experiment where the field effect transistors in accordance with the first to twelfth embodiments and the conventional field effect transistor illustrated in FIG. 9 were kept heated in a furnace at 300 (degree)  C. FIGS. 2A, 4A, 6A, and 8A illustrate fluctuation in a drain current with the lapse of time in the experiment in the field effect transistors in accordance with the first to twelfth embodiments, and FIGS. 2B, 4B, 6B and 8B illustrate fluctuation in a mutual conductance with the lapse of time in the experiment in those field effect transistors.</p>
    <p num="100">
      In the conventional field effect transistor, both a drain current and a mutual conductance were gradually degraded with the lapse of time.
      <br/>
      After 100 hours had passed, a drain current was degraded by 25% or greater relative to the initial drain current, and a mutual conductance was degraded by 15% or greater relative to the initial mutual conductance.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      On the other hands, in the field effect transistors in accordance with the first to twelfth embodiments, even after 100 hours had passed, a drain current was degraded by 10% or less relative to the initial drain current, and a mutual conductance was degraded by 5% or less relative to the initial mutual conductance.
      <br/>
      Thus, it was confirmed that the field effect transistors in accordance with the embodiments provided superior thermal stability.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      In addition, SIMS analysis was conducted to the field effect transistors having been kept heated for 100 hours to thereby examine whether impurities entered the field effect transistors.
      <br/>
      It was confirmed that impurities, that is, foreign materials other than constituents of the field effect transistor, did not exist in the transistors, and that there was no fluctuation in profiles of constituents of the transistors.

    <p num="103">
      Apart from the field effect transistors in accordance with the third, sixth and ninth embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 1C, 3C and 5C, respectively, in which the superlattice composed of AlAs and InAs is employed, the inventor had fabricated field effect transistors including an AlX Ga1-X As (0 &lt;= X &lt;= 1) layer, an InX Ga1-X As (0 &lt;= X &lt;= 1) layer, and an InX Al1-X As (0 &lt;= X&lt;0.4 or 0.6&lt;X &lt;= 1) in place of the above-mentioned superlattice, and tested them.
      <br/>
      When those layers had a thickness of 3 nm, the same thermal stability was obtained as thermal stability which would be obtained when the superlattice is used.

      <br/>
      It should be noted that the field effect transistor in accordance with the present invention may be advantageously designed to have an InAlAs donor layer into which silicon or other impurities is(are) planar-doped.
      <br/>
      Any material other than silicon may be employed as donor impurity unless it enables n-type doping.
