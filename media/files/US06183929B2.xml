    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention is directed to improved amino-functional release agents for the fusing of electrostatic toner particles.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention is directed to amino- and mercapto-functional release agents, and to fuser members coated or impregnated therewith, that exhibit advantages such as long fuser release life, good adhesion of articles such as 3M Post-It.RTM. notes to prints made therewith, and the like.
      <br/>
      One embodiment of the present invention is directed to a fuser member comprising a substrate, a layer thereover comprising a polymer, and, on the polymeric layer, a coating of a release agent comprising a mixture of (a) an organosiloxane polymer concentrate containing amino-substituted or mercapto-substituted organosiloxane polymers, wherein there are amino or mercapto functional groups on at least some of the polymer molecules of the concentrate, said concentrate having a degree of functionality of from about 0.2 to about 5 mole percent, said concentrate having a viscosity of from about 50 to about 500 centistokes; and (b) a nonfunctional organosiloxane polymer diluent, said diluent having a viscosity of from about 100 to about 2,000 centistokes; said mixture having a degree of functionality of from about 0.05 to about 0.4 mole percent, wherein the mixture has a viscosity of from about 100 to about 1,000 centistokes, and wherein the ratio by weight of concentrate to diluent is from about 1:2 to about 1:30.

      In a typical electrostatographic reproducing apparatus, a light image of an original to be copied is recorded in the form of an electrostatic latent image upon a photosensitive member, and the latent image is subsequently rendered visible by the application of electroscopic thermoplastic resin particles and pigment particles, or toner.
      <br/>
      The visible toner image is then in a loose powdered form and can be easily disturbed or destroyed.
      <br/>
      The toner image is usually fixed or fused upon a support, which can be the photosensitive member itself, or some other support sheet such as plain paper.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The use of thermal energy for fixing toner images onto a support member is well known.
      <br/>
      To fuse electroscopic toner material onto a support surface permanently by heat, it is usually necessary to elevate the temperature of the toner material to a point at which the constituents of the toner material coalesce and become tacky.
      <br/>
      This heating causes the toner to flow to some extent into the fibers or pores of the support member.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, as the toner material cools, solidification of the toner material causes the toner to be bonded firmly to the support.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Typically, the thermoplastic resin particles are fused to the substrate by heating to a temperature of from about 90 (degree)  C. to about 200 (degree)  C. or higher, depending on the softening range of the particular resin used in the toner.
      <br/>
      It may be undesirable, however, to increase the temperature of the substrate substantially higher than about 250 (degree)  C. because of the tendency of the substrate to discolor or convert into fire at such elevated temperatures, particularly when the substrate is paper.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Several approaches to thermal fusing of electroscopic toner images have been described.
      <br/>
      These methods include providing the application of heat and pressure substantially concurrently by various means, a roll pair maintained in pressure contact, a belt member in pressure contact with a roll, a belt member in pressure contact with a heater, and the like.
      <br/>
      Heat can be applied by heating one or both of the rolls, plate members, or belt members.
      <br/>
      Fusing of the toner particles occurs when the proper combination of heat, pressure, and/or contact for the optimum time period are provided.
      <br/>
      The balancing of these variables to bring about the fusing of the toner particles is well known in the art, and can be adjusted to suit particular machines or process conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      During the operation of one fusing system in which heat is applied to cause thermal fusing of the toner particles onto a support, both the toner image and the support are passed through a nip formed between a pair of rolls, plates, belts, or combination thereof.
      <br/>
      The concurrent transfer of heat and the application of pressure in the nip effects the fusing of the toner image onto the support.
      <br/>
      It is important in the fusing process that minimal or no offset of the toner particles from the support to the fuser member takes place during normal operations.
      <br/>
      Toner particles offset onto the fuser member can subsequently transfer to other parts of the machine or onto the support in subsequent copying cycles, thereby increasing the image background, causing inadequate copy quality, causing inferior marks on the copy, or otherwise interfering with the material being copied there as well as causing toner contamination of other parts of the machine.
      <br/>
      The referred to "hot offset" occurs when the temperature of the toner is increased to a point where the toner particles liquefy and a splitting of the molten toner takes place during the fusing operation with a portion remaining on the fuser member.
      <br/>
      The hot offset temperature or degradation of the hot offset temperature is a measure of the release properties of the fuser member, and accordingly it is desirable to provide a fusing surface having a low surface energy to provide the necessary release.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      To ensure and maintain good release properties of the fuser member, it has become customary to apply release agents to the fuser member during the fusing operation.
      <br/>
      Typically, these materials are applied as thin films of, for example, silicone oils, such as polydimethyl siloxane, or substituted silicone oils, such as amino-substituted oils, mercapto-substituted oils, or the like, to prevent toner offset.
      <br/>
      In addition, fillers can be added to the outer layers of fuser members to increase the bonding of the fuser oil to the surface of the fuser member, thereby imparting improved release properties.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The use of polymeric release agents having functional groups which interact with a fuser member to form a thermally stable, renewable self-cleaning layer having good release properties for electroscopic thermoplastic resin toners, is described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,029,827, 4,101,686, and 4,185,140, the disclosures of each of which are totally incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,029,827 is the use of polyorganosiloxanes having mercapto functionality as release agents. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,101,686 and 4,185,140 are directed to polymeric release agents having functional groups such as carboxy, hydroxy, epoxy, amino, isocyanate, thioether, and mercapto groups as release fluids.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      It is important to select the correct combination of fuser surface material, any filler incorporated or contained therein, and fuser oil.
      <br/>
      Specifically, it is important that the outer layer of the fuser member react sufficiently with the selected fuser oil to obtain sufficient release.
      <br/>
      To improve the bonding of fuser oils with the outer surface of the fuser member, fillers have been incorporated into or added to the outer surface layer of the fuser members, The use of a filler can aid in decreasing the amount of fusing oil necessary by promoting sufficient bonding of the fuser oil to the outer surface layer of the fusing member.
      <br/>
      It is important, however, that the filler not degrade the physical properties of the outer layer of the fuser member, and it is also important that the filler not cause too much of an increase in the surface energy of the outer layer.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Fillers are also sometimes added to the outer layers of fuser members to increase the thermal conductivity thereof.
      <br/>
      Examples of such fillers include conductive carbon, carbon black, graphite, titanium, and the like, as well as mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Efforts have been made to decrease the use of energy by providing a fuser member which has excellent thermal conductivity, thereby reducing the temperature needed to promote fusion of toner to paper.
      <br/>
      This increase in thermal conductivity also allows for increased speed of the fusing process by reducing the amount of time needed to heat the fuser member sufficiently to promote fusing.
      <br/>
      Efforts have also been made to increase the toughness of the fuser member layers to increase abrasion resistance and, accordingly, the life of the fuser member.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      With regard to known fuser coatings, silicone rubber has been the preferred outer layer for fuser members in electrostatographic machines.
      <br/>
      Silicone rubbers interact well with various types of fuser release agents.
      <br/>
      Perfluoroalkoxypolytetrafluoroethylene (PFA Teflon), however, which is frequently used as an outer coating for fuser members, is more durable and abrasion resistant than silicone rubber coatings.
      <br/>
      Also, the surface energy for PFA Teflon is lower than that of silicone rubber coatings.

      With regard to known fusing oils, silicone oil has been the preferred release agent for PFA Teflon coatings for fuser members.
      <br/>
      Release agents comprising silicone oil, however, do not provide sufficient release properties for toner because the silicone oil does not wet fuser coatings of PFA Teflon.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a large amount (greater than 5 mg/copy) of silicone oil is required to obtain minimum release performance.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a large amount of wax must be incorporated into the toner in order to provide adequate release of the toner from the fuser member.

    <p num="35">
      For other fluoropolymer, and especially flucoroelastomer, fuser member outer layers, amino silicone oil has been the release agent of choice, Amino oil, however, does not diffuse into paper products, but instead reacts with the cellulose in the paper and therefore remains on the surface of the paper.
      <br/>
      It is believed that hydrogen bonding occurs between the amine groups in the amino oil and the cellulose hydroxy groups of the paper.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the amine groups can hydrolyze the cellulose rings in the paper.
      <br/>
      The amino oil on the surface of the copied paper prevents the binding of glues and adhesives, including attachable notes such as adhesive 3M Post-it.RTM. notes, to the surface of the copied paper.
      <br/>
      In addition, the amino silicone oil present on the surface of a copied paper prevents ink adhesion to the surface of the paper.
      <br/>
      This problem results in the poor fix of inks such as bank check endorser inks and other similar inks.
      <br/>
      Similar problems can also occur with mercapto-functional fusing oils, although such problems are usually observed to a lesser extent than with amino- functional fusing oils.

      While known compositions and processes are suitable for their intended purposes, a need remains for improved fuser release agents.
      <br/>
      In addition, a need remains for fuser release agents that do not interact chemically with copy substrates such as paper.
      <br/>
      Further, a need remains for fuser release agents that enable the production of prints upon which adhesives such as those on 3M Post-It.RTM. notes adhere adequately.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a need remains for fuser release agents that enable the production of prints upon which inks such as check endorser MICR inks can print images of good quality and permanence.
      <br/>
      There is also a need for fuser release agents that enable the production of prints which can then be bound well with binder adhesives.
      <br/>
      In addition, there is a need for fuser release agents that form complete and uniform layers on fuser members having fluoropolymer surfaces.
      <br/>
      Further, there is a need for fuser release agents that enable long release life times for fuser members employed therewith.
      <br/>
      Additionally, there is a need for fuser release agents that have sufficient viscosity to be applied uniformly to a fuser member surface with a metering donor roll.
      <br/>
      A need also remains for fuser release agents that enable reduced or eliminated toner offset from the fuser member onto the copy substrate.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="39">
      Referring to FIG. 1, in a typical electrostatographic reproducing apparatus, a light image of an original to be copied is recorded in the form of an electrostatic latent image on a photosensitive member, and the latent image is subsequently rendered visible by the application of electroscopic thermoplastic resin particles, commonly referred to as toner.
      <br/>
      Specifically, photoreceptor 10 is charged on its surface by means of a charger 12 to which a voltage has been supplied from power supply 11.
      <br/>
      The photoreceptor is then imagewise exposed to light from an optical system or an image input apparatus 13, such as a laser and light emitting diode, to form an electrostatic latent image thereon.
      <br/>
      Generally, the electrostatic latent image is developed by bringing a developer mixture from developer station 14 into contact therewith.
      <br/>
      Development can be effected by use of a magnetic brush, powder cloud, or other known development process.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      After the toner particles have been deposited on the photoconductive surface in image configuration, they are transferred to a copy sheet 16 by transfer means 15, which can be pressure transfer, electrostatic transfer, or the like.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the developed image can be transferred to an intermediate transfer member and subsequently transferred to a copy sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      After transfer of the developed image is completed, copy sheet 16 advances to fusing station 19, depicted in FIG. 1 as fusing and pressure rolls, wherein the developed image is fused to copy sheet 16 by passing copy sheet 16 between fusing member 20 and pressure member 21, thereby forming a permanent image.
      <br/>
      Photoreceptor 10, subsequent to transfer, advances to cleaning station 17, wherein any toner left on photoreceptor 10 is cleaned therefrom by use of a blade 22 (as shown in FIG. 1), brush, or other cleaning apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Referring to FIG. 2, an embodiment of a fusing station 19 is depicted with an embodiment of a fuser roll 20 comprising polymer surface 5 on a suitable base member or substrate 4, which in this embodiment is a hollow cylinder or core fabricated from any suitable metal, such as aluminum, anodized aluminum, steel, nickel, copper, or the like, having a suitable heating element 6 disposed in the hollow portion thereof which is coextensive with the cylinder.
      <br/>
      The fuser member 20 optionally can include an adhesive, cushion, or other suitable layer 7 positioned between core 4 and outer layer 5.
      <br/>
      Backup or pressure roll 21 cooperates with fuser roll 20 to form a nip or contact arc 1 through which a copy paper or other substrate 16 passes such that toner images 24 thereon contact polymer or elastomer surface 5 of fuser roll 20.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, an embodiment of a backup roll or pressure roll 21 is depicted as having a rigid steel core 2 with a polymer or elastomer surface or layer 3 thereon.
      <br/>
      Sump 25 contains polymeric release agent 26, which may be a solid or liquid at room temperature, but is a fluid at operating temperatures, and, in fuser members of the present invention, is a mixture of an amino-substituted or mercapto-substituted organosiloxane polymer and a nonfunctional organosiloxane polymer.
      <br/>
      The pressure member 21 can also optionally include a heating element (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2 for applying the polymeric release agent 26 to polymer or elastomer surface 5, two release agent delivery rolls 27 and 28 rotatably mounted in the direction indicated are provided to transport release agent 26 to polymer or elastomer surface 5, Delivery roll 27 is partly immersed in the sump 25 and transports on its surface release agent from the sump to the delivery roll 28.
      <br/>
      By using a metering blade 29, a layer of polymeric release fluid can be applied initially to delivery roll 27 and subsequently to polymer or elastomer 5 in controlled thickness ranging from submicron thickness to thicknesses of several microns of release fluid.
      <br/>
      Thus, by metering device 29, preferably from about 0.1 to about 2 microns or greater thicknesses of release fluid can be applied to the surface of polymer or elastomer 5.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      FIG. 3 depicts a cross-sectional view of another embodiment of the invention, wherein fuser member 20 comprises substrate 4, optional intermediate surface layer 7 comprising silicone rubber and optional fillers 30, such as aluminum oxide or the like, dispersed or contained therein, and outer polymeric surface layer 5.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 also depicts a fluid release agent or fusing oil layer 9 according to the present invention, comprising a mixture of an amino-substituted or mercapto-substituted organosiloxane polymer and a nonfunctional organosiloxane polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The term "fuser member" as used herein refers to fuser members including fusing rolls, belts, films, sheets, and the like; donor members, including donor rolls, belts, films, sheets, and the like; and pressure members, including pressure rolls, belts, films, sheets, and the like; and other members useful in the fusing system of an electrostatographic or xerographic, including digital, machine.
      <br/>
      The fuser member of the present invention can be employed in a wide variety of machines, and is not specifically limited in its application to the particular embodiment depicted herein.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Any suitable substrate can be selected for the fuser member.
      <br/>
      The fuser member substrate can be a roll, belt, flat surface, sheet, film, or other suitable shape used in the fixing of thermoplastic toner images to a suitable copy substrate.
      <br/>
      It can take the form of a fuser member, a pressure member, or a release agent donor member, preferably in the form of a cylindrical roll.
      <br/>
      Typically, the fuser member is made of a hollow cylindrical metal core, such as copper, aluminum, stainless steel, or certain plastic materials chosen to maintain rigidity and structural integrity, as well as being capable of having a polymeric material coated thereon and adhered firmly thereto.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the supporting substrate is a cylindrical sleeve, preferably with an outer polymeric layer of from about 1 to about 6 millimeters.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the core, which can be an aluminum or steel cylinder, is degreased with a solvent and cleaned with an abrasive cleaner prior to being primed with a primer, such as Dow Corning.RTM. 1200, which can be sprayed, brushed, or dipped, followed by air drying under ambient conditions for thirty minutes and then baked at 150 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Also suitable are quartz and glass substrates.
      <br/>
      The use of quartz or glass cores in fuser members allows for a light weight, low cost fuser system member to be produced.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the glass and quartz help allow for quick warm-up, and are therefore energy efficient.
      <br/>
      In addition, because the core of the fuser member comprises glass or quartz, there is a real possibility that such fuser members can be recycled.
      <br/>
      Moreover, these cores allow for high thermal efficiency by providing superior insulation.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      When the fuser member is a belt, the substrate can be of any desired or suitable material, including plastics, such as Ultem.RTM., available from General Electric, Ultrapek.RTM., available from BASF, PPS (polyphenylene sulfide) sold under the tradenames Fortron.RTM., available from Hoechst Celanese, Ryton R-4.RTM., available from Phillips Petroleum, and Supec.RTM., available from General Electric; PAI (polyamide imide), sold under the tradename Torlon.RTM. 7130, available from Amoco; polyketone (PK), sold under the tradename Kadel.RTM.

      <br/>
      These plastics can be filled with glass or other minerals to enhance their mechanical strength without changing their thermal properties.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, the plastic comprises a high temperature plastic with superior mechanical strength, such as polyphenylene sulfide, polyamide imide, polyimide, polyketone, polyphthalamide, polyether ether ketone, polyethersulfone, and polyetherimide.
      <br/>
      Suitable materials also include silicone rubbers.

    <p num="49">
      The optional intermediate layer can be of any suitable or desired material.

      For example, the optional intermediate layer can comprise a silicone rubber of a thickness sufficient to form a conformable layer.
      <br/>
      Suitable silicone rubbers include room temperature vulcanization (RTV) silicone rubbers, high temperature vulcanization (HTV) silicone rubbers, and low temperature vulcanization (LTV) silicone rubbers.

      Other materials suitable for the intermediate layer include polyimides and fluoroelastomers, including those set forth below.
      <br/>
      Optionally, fillers such as aluminum oxide or the like can be incorporated into the intermediate layer.

      <br/>
      More specifically, if the intermediate layer is present on a pressure member, it typically has a thickness of from about 0.05 to about 5 millimeters, preferably from about 0.1 to about 3 millimeters, and more preferably from about 0.5 to about 1 millimeter, although the thickness can be outside of these ranges.
      <br/>
      When present on a fuser member, the intermediate layer typically has a thickness of from about 1 to about 10 millimeters, preferably from about 2 to about 5 millimeters, and more preferably from about 2.5 to about 3 millimeters, although the thickness can be outside of these ranges.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the thickness of the intermediate layer of the fuser member is higher than that of the pressure member, so that the fuser member is more deformable than the pressure member.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Examples of suitable outer fusing layers of the fuser member include polymers, such as fluoropolymers.
      <br/>

      Conductive fillers can, optionally, be dispersed in the outer fusing layer of the fuser member, particularly in embodiments wherein a functional fuser oil is used.
      <br/>
      Preferred fillers are capable of interacting with the functional groups of the release agent to form a thermally stable film which releases the thermoplastic resin toner and prevents the toner from contacting the filler surface material itself.
      <br/>
      This bonding enables a reduction in the amount of oil needed to promote release.
      <br/>
      Further, preferred fillers promote bonding with the oil without causing problems such as scumming or gelling.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is preferred that the fillers be substantially non-reactive with the outer polymer material so that no adverse reaction occurs between the polymer material and the filler which would hinder curing or otherwise negatively affect the strength properties of the outer surface material.
      <br/>
      Fillers in the outer fusing layer can also increase thermal conductivity.

      Other metal oxides, such as cupric oxide and/or zinc oxide, can also be used to improve release.
      <br/>
      Metal oxides, such as copper oxide, aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, tin oxide, titanium oxide, iron oxide, zinc oxide, manganese oxide, molybdenum oxide, and the like, carbon black, graphite, metal fibers and metal powder particles such as silver, nickel, aluminum, and the like, as well as mixtures thereof, can promote thermal conductivity.
      <br/>
      The addition of silicone particles to a fluoropolymer outer fusing layer can increase release of toner from the fuser member during and following the fusing process.
      <br/>
      Processability of a fluoropolymer outer fusing layer can be increased by increasing absorption of silicone oils, in particular by adding fillers such as fumed silica or clays such as organo-montmorillonites.
      <br/>
      Inorganic particulate fillers can increase the abrasion resistance of the polymeric outer fusing layer.
      <br/>
      Examples of such fillers include metal-containing fillers, such as a metal, metal alloy, metal oxide, metal salt, or other metal compound; the general classes of suitable metals include those metals of Groups 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 5a, 5b, 6b, 7b, 8, and the rare earth elements of the Periodic Table.

      Amino-substituted organosiloxane polymers having a viscosity of about 350 centistokes at about 25 (degree)  C. and an amine concentration of about 0.15 mole percent, when coated onto fluoropolymers commonly used as fuser member outer layers and used to fuse electrostatic toner images to print substrates such as paper, typically exhibit disadvantages such as poor adhesion of 3M Post-It.RTM. notes, poor ink adhesion to the surface of the paper subsequent to fusing, poor fix of inks such as bank check endorser inks and other similar inks to the fused paper, and the like.

      When amino-substituted organosiloxane polymers having a viscosity of about 100 centistokes at about 25 (degree)  C. and an amine concentration of about 0.15 mole percent are employed under similar conditions, the adhesion of Post-It.RTM. notes to the resulting prints is substantially improved.
      <br/>
      The release life of the fuser member, however, is significantly decreased when used in conjunction with the 100 centistoke viscosity release agent.
      <br/>
      When a mixture of concentrate containing an amino-substituted organosiloxane polymer having a viscosity of from about 50 to about 500 centistokes at about 25 (degree)  C. and an amine concentration of from about 0.2 to about 2 mole percent is admixed with a nonfunctional organosiloxane polymer having a viscosity of from about 100 to about 2,000 centistokes at about 25 (degree)  C., the resulting mixture, which generally has a viscosity of from about 100 to about 1,000 centistokes at about 25 (degree)  C. and an amine concentration of from about 0.05 to about 0.2 mole percent, improved adhesion of Post-It.RTM. notes to the prints is observed, and release life of the fuser is also desirably high.

    <p num="90">
      While not being limited to any particular theory, it is believed that lower viscosity fusing oils diffuse into paper faster than higher viscosity fusing oils of the same composition, all conditions being equal, and that functional fusing oils diffuse into paper more slowly than nonfunctional fusing oils of the same composition, all conditions being equal; in the instant invention, it is believed that the diluent portion of the mixture, i.e., the high viscosity nonfunctional oil, diffuses into paper faster than the concentrate portion of the mixture, i.e., the low viscosity amino or mercapto functional oil.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, any low viscosity functional fusing agent molecules chemisorbed onto the paper surface provide insufficient coverage to impair the adhesion of Post-It.RTM. notes to the prints, since the low viscosity amino-substituted polymer diffuses into the paper faster than would a similar functional fusing oil of high viscosity.
      <br/>
      Again, while not being limited to any particular theory, it is believed that the increased release life observed with the mixtures of the present invention, compared to a similar blend containing a low viscosity concentrate and a low viscosity diluent, results from improved hydrodynamics of the fusing agent metering system (such as a donor roll or the like).
      <br/>
      More specifically, it is believed that when one or more dust particles, toner particles, paper particles, or the like are trapped under a metering blade, the fusing agent level in that region of the fuser member is depleted when a low viscosity fusing agent is employed; the depleted fusing agent level on the fuser member promotes toner offset, which can be invisible initially, but will later accelerate to visible offset.
      <br/>
      Specific offset observed with the low viscosity fusing release agent generally begins as a fine streak less than one millimeter in width, and then grows in width as more streaks appear.
      <br/>
      In contrast, with the mixtures making up the fusing release agents of the present invention, the level of fusing agent on the fuser member is substantially more uniform, and offset is not observed until many more copies have been made, said offset appearing as a spot.

      Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described in detail.
      <br/>
      These examples are intended to be illustrative, and the invention is not limited to the materials, conditions, or process parameters set forth in these embodiments.
      <br/>
      All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      Release Life Testing: The described fusing release agents were evaluated on a three inch bench web fixture, the web continuously running at 20 centimeters per second.
      <br/>
      The fuser roll coating comprised 1.5 millimeters of a thermally conductive silicone rubber with a release overcoat of 0.050 millimeter Viton GF cured with the E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Co.
      <br/>
      VC-50 curing system.
      <br/>
      The Viton GF layer contained no heavy metals, heavy metal oxides, or other metal compounds.
      <br/>
      The fuser roll was 50 millimeters in diameter and was operated at 20 centimeters per second surface speed and at a run temperature of 360 (degree)  F., which is 30 (degree)  F. above the temperature at which image fix becomes acceptable.
      <br/>
      A polyester toner was used for the image, and the image coverage was 50 percent.
      <br/>
      The amount of toner as the image on the paper carrier was 1.0 milligrams per square centimeter.
      <br/>
      The toner contained the proper amount of Aerosil (obtained from Cabot Corp.) to promote toner flow and a charge control agent to provide the necessary triboelectric charging characteristics for toner development.
      <br/>
      Failure, in this instance, hot offset, occurred when part of the toner image became attached to the fuser roll and was then transferred to the paper on the next revolution of the fuser roll.
      <br/>
      For the tests described herein, 500,000 prints was considered to be an acceptable release life.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      Sample Generation: A Xerox.RTM. 5775 fuser roll was hand rubbed with oil soaked in a paper towel, and the oil rate on the first copy was typically from about 10 to about 20 milligrams (1 milligram=1 microliter) per copy.
      <br/>
      Without further oil addition, the oil rate dropped on successive copies.
      <br/>
      Copies were selected with the desired oil rate of 3 to 5 milligrams per copy.
      <br/>
      There were no toner images on all of the peel force test samples.
      <br/>
      The paper used was Xerox.RTM. Image Series LX and peel force measurements were performed on the felt side of the paper.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Oil-On-Copy: Since the pressure roll was engaged part of the time to help distribute the oil on the fuser roll, the pressure roll became coated with oil.
      <br/>
      In addition, the inter-document gap also allowed oil transfer between the fuser roll and the pressure roll.
      <br/>
      The amount of oil transferred from the pressure roll to the copy was unknown but could be significant, especially in the first few copies.
      <br/>
      To eliminate this ambiguity, double sheets of paper were used in all samples generated for adhesion measurements, with the back sheet discarded.
      <br/>
      Thus, the oil measured subsequently by solvent extraction came only from the front side of the copy.
      <br/>
      The oil rates reported here are scaled to 8.5 inch by 11 inch size paper.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      Adhesive: For the peel force measurements a 3M.RTM. -658 adhesive tape was used.
      <br/>
      This 1 inch wide paper tape had the same adhesive as that coated on 3M Post-it.RTM. notes.
      <br/>
      About 3.5 inches was used for each measurement, thereby increasing significantly the peel length and accuracy of the peel force measurement by averaging the peel force.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      Adhesion Process: The adhesion developed was very sensitive to the force applied in bringing the adhesive and paper together.
      <br/>
      To minimize any random error in this sensitive factor, a rubber coated steel roller that complied with the Pressure Sensitive Tape Council test procedure PSTC-1 for adhesive tapes, was employed.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      Peel Force Measurement: Peel force measurements were performed with the Slip/Peel Tester model 3M90 made by Instrumentors, Inc.
      <br/>
      According to the manufacturer, the strain gauge was accurate to 1 gram of force.
      <br/>
      The instantaneous peel force was printed on a chart recorder for visual averaging over the test duration.
      <br/>
      The peel angle was 180 (degree)  with respect to the paper surface.
      <br/>
      For consistent results, the adhesive was applied 5 minutes after print generation and peel force measurements made 5 minutes later.
    </p>
    <p num="102">For reference, the peel force required to separate the adhesive from Xerox.RTM. Image Series LX paper without any applied oil was measured to be about 124 grams per centimeter.</p>
    <p num="103">
      The following examples are tests of various types of amino functional silicone oil release agents with differing viscosities or a mixture of viscosities used in the above experiments.
      <br/>
      All fluids were obtained from Dow Corning Corporation.
    </p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE I</heading>
    <p num="104">500 centiStoke Nonfunctional Silicone Oil</p>
    <p num="105">
      A 500 centiStoke nonfunctional silicone fluid, with an oil application rate of 5 milligrams per print, produced hot offset after only some tens of prints, because of the absence of amine groups to bond to the Viton.RTM. surface.
      <br/>
      Paper coated with this oil by the above described procedure at application rates of 3 and 5 milligrams per print demonstrated peel force values of 52 and 38 grams per centimeter, respectively, when subjected to the peel force test described above.
    </p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE II</heading>
    <p num="106">350 centiStoke Amino Functional Silicone Oil</p>
    <p num="107">
      A 350 centiStoke amino functional silicone oil containing 0.6 mole percent pendant propylamine groups (concentrate) was blended with 350 centiStoke nonfunctional silicone oil (diluent) at a ratio by weight of 1 part amine-functional fluid to 3.6 parts nonfunctional fluid to produce a fluid containing 0.13 mole percent amine groups.
      <br/>
      An amino oil mixture made according to this procedure, when utilized in the above described test with an oil application rate of 5 milligrams per print, yielded no hot offset after 500,000 prints, at which time point testing was suspended.
      <br/>
      Paper coated with this oil, by the above-described procedure at application rates of 3 and 5 milligrams per print, demonstrated peel force values of 12 and 8 grams per centimeter, respectively, when subjected to the peel force test described above.
      <br/>
      These peel force values are unacceptably low.
    </p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE III</heading>
    <p num="108">100 centiStoke Amino Functional Silicone Oil</p>
    <p num="109">
      A 100 centiStoke amino functional silicone oil containing 0.6 mole percent pendant propylamine groups (concentrate) was blended with 100 centiStoke nonfunctional silicone oil (diluent) at a ratio by weight of 1 part amine-functional fluid to 3.6 parts nonfunctional fluid to produce a fluid containing 0.13 mole percent amine groups.
      <br/>
      An amino oil mixture made according to this procedure, when utilized in the above described test with an oil application rate of 3 milligrams per print, produced hot offset failure at 200,000 prints.
      <br/>
      This fuser lifetime is unacceptably low.
      <br/>
      Paper coated with this oil by the above-described procedure at application rates of 3 and 5 milligrams per print demonstrated peel force values of 26 and 16 grams per centimeter, respectively, when subjected to the peel force test described above.
      <br/>
      These peel force values are significantly higher than those achieved from the 350 centiStoke fluid of Example I. Release life, however, was considerably reduced.
    </p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE IV</heading>
    <p num="110">Mixed Viscosity Amino Functional Silicone Oil</p>
    <p num="111">
      A 100 centiStoke amino functional silicone oil containing 0.6 mole percent pendant propylamine groups (concentrate) was blended with 500 centiStoke nonfunctional silicone oil (diluent) at a ratio by weight of 1 part amine-functional fluid to 3.6 parts nonfunctional fluid to produce a 350 centiStoke fluid containing 0.13 mole percent amine groups.
      <br/>
      An amino oil mixture made according to this procedure, when utilized in the above described test, with an oil application rate of 5 milligrams per print, produced no hot offset failure after 500,000 prints.
      <br/>
      Paper coated with this oil by the above-described procedure at application rates of 3 and 5 milligrams per print demonstrated peel force values of 21 and 10 grams per centimeter, respectively, when subjected to the peel force test described above.
      <br/>
      The peel force values obtained from this mixed viscosity oil were only slightly inferior to that of the 100 centiStoke fluid, which was applied at a lower oil rate.
      <br/>
      Yet, the mixed viscosity fluid was able to achieve the required release life of 500,000 prints, a result similar to that obtained with the 350 centiStoke fluid of Example II and significantly better release life than the 100 centiStoke fluid of Example III.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the mixed viscosity fluid simultaneously achieved both acceptable Post-It.RTM. adhesion and acceptable fuser release life.
    </p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE V</heading>
    <p num="112">
      The processes of Examples I through IV are repeated except that a mercapto functional polysiloxane oil is substituted for the amino functional polysiloxane oil.
      <br/>
      It is believed that improved adhesion of Post-It.RTM. notes and acceptable fuser release life will be observed.
