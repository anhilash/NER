      <br/>
      The invention relates to a novel one-step process for preparation of phenol by oxidation of benzene with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by molecular sieves doped with copper ions.
      <br/>
      With proper solvent, a phenol yield around 15-35%, selectivity close to 100% and phenol/Cu TON around 100 could be achieved.
      <br/>
      These results show that the inventive process is of great economical value for further development in large scale production of phenol.

    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Phenol is an important compound for industry and pharmaceuticals.
      <br/>
      It can be used as a starting material as well as an intermediate for manufacture of many chemicals, such as dyes, bactericides and herbicides.
      <br/>
      Therefore, its demand has always been extremely great; its annual world production had been reached to 4.9 * 106 tons in 1996�K.
      <br/>
      Weissermel and H. J. Arpe, "Industrial Organic Chemistry", 3rd ed., VCH Publishers, Inc., New York, N.Y., U.S.A. 1997, p. 347�. Although a direct oxidation process of benzene to phenol would be the most economical route, until now only the indirect manufacturing processes have been operated, that is, benzene was reacted at first into an intermediate which was then reacted into phenol.
      <br/>
      The reason resided in that the oxidation capability of phenol is higher than that of benzene and the selectivity of one-step oxidation of benzene into phenol is generally not high.
      <br/>
      In United State and Japan, the most popular process operated presently for phenol production is the cumene process �K.
      <br/>
      Weissermel and H. J. Arpe, supra, p. 347�, which includes the catalytic alkylation of benzene to cumene and consequent oxidation of cumene to phenol and acetone.
      <br/>
      Acetone is generated in stoichiometric amount as the side product.
      <br/>
      The complication of this multi-step process as well as the cost of product separation leave the direct oxidation of benzene to phenol in a single step to be of great challenging to synthetic chemists.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In Europe, a two-step process was used predominantly �K.
      <br/>
      Weissermel and H. J. Arpe, supra, p. 347�, wherein toluene as the starting material was subjected to a catalytic oxidation to form benzoic acid which was then decomposed catalytically into phenol and carbon dioxide.
      <br/>
      These processes were not, of course, as economic as the one-step oxidation of benzene into phenol.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Many approaches for one-step direct oxidation of benzene into phenol have been reported, yet little success has been achieved due to low phenol yield, expensive oxidants, and high operating cost.
      <br/>
      For example, a process using ZSM-5 zeolite as catalyst and N2 O as oxidant has been well examined as an one-step reaction for oxidizing benzene into phenol (see, for example, V. I. Sobolve, A. S. Kharitonov, Y. A. Paukshtis and G. I. Panov, J. Mol. Catal., 1993, 84, 117; R. Burch and C. Howitt, Appl.
      <br/>
      Catal., 1992, 86, 139; J. S. Yoo, A. R. Sohail, S. S. Grimmer and J. Z. Shyu, Appl.
      <br/>
      Catal., A: General 1994, 117, 1).
      <br/>
      Its greatest disadvantage resided in that it should be operated at an elevated temperature of higher than 200 (degree)  C. and N2 O is an expensive oxidant which resulted in an undue high cost.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Another process whose reaction mechanism often been discussed is one using divalent iron as the catalyst and hydrogen peroxide as oxidant (Fenton's reaction) (J. R. Lindsay-Smith and R. O. C. Norman, J. Chem. Soc., 1969, 2897).
      <br/>
      However in view of the catalytic efficiency, its phenol yield was extremely low, the turnover number (TON, or phenol yield per active site) was around 1, and that rendered it evidently of little developing potential.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Furthermore, liquid phase reactions using Ti- or V-containing zeolites as catalysts and hydrogen peroxide as oxidant have been reported (J. S. Reddy, S. Sivasanker and P. Ratnasamy, J. Mol. Catal., 1992, 71, 373; A. V. Ramaswany, S. Sivasanker and P. Ratnasamy, Micro.
      <br/>
      Mater., 1994, 2, 451), wherein some deep oxidation side products such as p-benzoquinone and hydroquinone were produced and the phenol selectivity was not high.
      <br/>
      The same reaction using tetra-nuclear platinum complex as a catalyst has been proposed (A. V. Ramaswany, S. Sivasanker and P. Ratnasamy, Micro.
      <br/>
      Mater., 1994, 2 , 451), and the difficulty laid in the preparation of such a catalyst.
      <br/>
      Still another process using ammonium salt of mono-vanadium(V)-substituted hetero-polyamines as the catalyst has been tried (K.
      <br/>
      Sakai and K. Matsumoto, J. Mol. Catal, 1991, 67, 7), but a low phenol yield was obtained.
      <br/>
      Recently, an one-step process for oxidizing benzene into phenol was reported, wherein a mesoporous molecular sieve, MCM-41, either exchanged with copper ion or loaded with copper oxide was used as the catalyst, 10 atm of oxygen as oxidant, ascorbic acid as reducing agent and acetic acid as solvent (K.
      <br/>
      Nomiya, K. Yagishita, Y. Nemoto and T. Kamataki, J. Mol. Catal. A, 1997, 126, 43).
      <br/>
      Although it claimed to have a very high phenol selectivty, the use of ascorbic acid and acetic acid as well as the formation of di-ketones as side products could increase the difficulty in product separation.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, its phenol yield did not exceed 1.5%, and its phenol/Cu TON was not higher than 15.
      <br/>
      This report revealed also that hydrogen peroxide generated during the reaction was the true oxidant.

      X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the molecular sieves containing different copper contents thus-synthesized were compared with the JCPDS pattern library, and it was found that the crystalline phases of the so-obtained molecular sieves were nearly 100% pure.
      <br/>
      It is known that AlPO4 -5 aluminum phosphate molecular sieve is the most easily synthesized one among a variety of aluminum phosphate molecular sieves.
      <br/>
      There is great freedom in the synthetic conditions, such as the stirring time can vary from tens minutes to several days, and more than twenty kinds of organic compounds can be used as template reagent.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment of the invention, triethylamine was used as the template reagent.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a hydrothermal reaction time of longer than 24 hours and a temperature of higher than 160 (degree)  C. was used to form readily the crystalline form of AlPO4 -5.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In addition to the confirmation that all the synthesized samples with different copper contents (0.5%, 1%, 2%) were AlPO4 -5 structures with good crystallinity, XRD patterns were also used to calculate the lattice parameter and the change of unit cell volume (Table 1).
      <br/>
      Since AlPO4 -5 belongs to hexagonal system, a and b axes have equal length.
      <br/>
      A step scan fashion was adopted during pattern scanning, wherein, lattice parameters were calculated based on 12 diffraction peaks having the strongest intensity and lattice parameters such as a, b, and c were obtained by inputting (h, k, l) values.
      <br/>
      From the relationship between doping amounts of Cu ions and values of lattice parameters, it could be seen that the unit cell volume increased with increase in the content of divalent copper ions.

      This meant that copper ions were incorporated in the framework of the aluminum phosphate other than in pores beyond such framework.

      The appearance of crystal form of typical AlPO4 -5 is hexagonal prism and the height of its prism is much greater than its hexagonal plane.
      <br/>
      In general, the grains with hexagonal prism form tend to align into a spheroid or ellipsoidal shape.
      <br/>
      It was found from the scanning electron microphotographs that as the copper content increased the regularity of crystal alignment became worse.
      <br/>
      Some loose and discrete particulates appeared gradually while their crystal form of basic hexagonal prism changed into flat cylindrical.
      <br/>
      In view of the macroscopic crystal form revealed from SEM, it was suggested that when there were foreign metal atoms incorporated within the framework, the lattice would have distortion along the propagating direction of crystal growth.

      In order to confirm the molecular sieve structure of samples thus-synthesized, AlPO4 -5 samples with different copper loadings were subjected to vibrational spectroscopy.
      <br/>
      The absorptions around 1100 and 730 cm-1 were attributed to the internal symmetry stretching vibration of AlO4 and PO4 tetrahedron within the AlPO4 framework.
      <br/>
      The absorption around 1230 cm-1 was the external asymmetry stretching vibration of the AlO4 and PO4 tetrahedron, and absorptions around 630 cm-1 and 560 cm-1 were vibrations of double-four-membered rings or double-six-membered rings on the framework of the molecular sieve.
      <br/>
      Basically, no effect of copper substitution on the spectra could be observed and this meant that infrared absorption peaks confirmed definitely the molecular sieve structure of the catalysts synthesized above.

      In experiments of direct oxidation of benzene to phenol, various catalysts have been tried, however only the molecular sieves containing copper as those prepared in Examples 1 and 2 were active.
      <br/>
      Moreover, AlPO4 -5 incorporated with copper ion had optimal activity.
      <br/>
      By selecting suitable reaction conditions, product containing predominantly phenol could be obtained with a selectivity higher than 99.5%. Secondary oxidation products such as catechol, hydroquinone and p-benzoquinone, could only be detected at extremely trace amount with extremely low yield.
      <br/>
      Concurrently, CuO/AlPO4 -5 molecular sieves prepared by impregnation method as well as CuO and Cu2 O were tested as catalyst in this reaction.
      <br/>
      In these cases, products therefrom contained mainly polymer of high molecular weight with low yield of phenol.
      <br/>
      This confirmed that active sites on the copper-containing molecular sieves should not be the extra-framework copper oxide.

      It could be seen that a linear increase in phenol yield was obtained when the catalyst amount increased.

      Table 5 shows the result of benzene oxidation catalyzed with different Cu-loading AlPO4 -5.
      <br/>
      AlPO4 -5 with zero Cu-loading was completely inactive.
      <br/>
      This demonstrated that copper ion is indeed the active center with respect to benzene oxidation.
      <br/>
      The catalytic activity of %Cu-APO-5 was significantly better than that of 0.5%Cu-APO-5, since increasing copper loading means increasing the number of active sites.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, phenol yields were about the same when 1%Cu-APO-5 and 2%Cu-APO-5 were used as catalysts, and, furthermore, in case of using 2%CuAPO-5 as catalyst, a small amount of macromolecule products were produced in the reaction solution.
      <br/>
      This was similar to the situation when CuO was used as catalyst and meant that in case of 2%Cu-APO-5, a part of copper ion outside the framework might be in a form of metal oxide.
      <br/>
      Whereas in case of low Cu-loading, such as 0.5%Cu-APO-5 and 1%Cu-APO-5, copper ions should be within the framework of the molecular sieve.

    <p num="72">
      In attempt to know if adsoption of benzene ring on the surface of the molecular sieve were involved in the reaction, the initial concentration of benzene was varied.
      <br/>
      In case that the activity changes linearly with benzene concentration, it indicates that benzene reacts homogeneously in solution and is not limited by the step of adsorption on the catalyst surface.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the activity approaches a plateau or lowers as the benzene concentration increases to a certain extent, it should indicate that benzene reacts through adsorbing on the surface of the molecular sieve and thereby is limited by the amount of adsorption.
      <br/>
      Results in FIG. 1 reveals that the reaction cannot occur at a benzene concentration lower than 7%.
      <br/>
      Beyond 7% phenol yield changes almost linearly with benzene concentration, and phenol yield reachs an optimal value at a benzene concentration of 25%.
      <br/>
      Above 25%, phenol yield decreases with benzene concentration.
      <br/>
      Thus, it implies that adsorption of benzene ring on the active site over the surface of the catalyst must be involved in the reaction process.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      An experiment by changing the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was also performed and its result was shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      As the concentration of hydrogen peroxide increases, the activity becomes better but not in a linear relationship and the curve approaches a plateau gradually.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is believed that hydrogen peroxide, like benzene, has to adsorb on the surface active sites.
      <br/>
      The results also imply that the adsorption capability of benzene on the active sites is probably stronger than that of hydrogen peroxide.
      <br/>
      At a benzene concentration above 25%, benzene would displace hydrogen peroxide originally adsorbed on the active site so as to cause a decrease in the reactivity.

      FIG. 3 reveals the products formed by using various alkyl-substituted benzene rings as reactants.
      <br/>
      The conversion and product yield are tabulated in Table 8.
      <br/>
      Therein the products can be divided into two groups: one group includes phenols and quinones which are the products of hydroxylation of the benzene ring, and the other includes alcohols and aldehydes which are the products of oxidation of the alkyl chains.
      <br/>
      In oxidation reactions involving OH radical, the  ALPHA -carbon of the alkyl group substituted on benzene ring is generally the most active position subjected to oxidation.

      However, the reaction data shown in this example is just contrary.
      <br/>
      It shows that the oxidation reaction in this invention is not a simple oxidation reaction with OH radicals, instead during the reaction benzene ring should be adsorbed on the active sites of catalyst surface.
