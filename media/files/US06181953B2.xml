      A radio access system connects a public switched telephone network and a subscriber unit.
      <br/>
      The subscriber unit includes a first detection part detecting a telematique signal; and a first control part transmitting a detection signal of the telematique signal on a control channel and transmitting the telematique signal on a traffic channel while bypassing a first speech coding-and-decoding part.
      <br/>
      The radio access system includes a second control part, provided between a radio base station and the public switched telephone network, transmitting the telematique signal on the traffic channel toward the public switched telephone network while bypassing a second speech coding-and-decoding part when the detection signal of the telematique signal is transmitted on the control channel.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention generally relates to a radio access system, and more particularly, to a radio access system for a telematique service which is constructed with subscriber lines from an exchanger to subscribers' premises through radio lines.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Recently, for constituting the subscriber line from the exchanger to each subscriber's premise, instead of a wire line such as a copper cable or an optical fiber cable, a radio line system is being used.
      <br/>
      This system is referred to as a wireless local loop (WLL) system.
      <br/>
      In the WLL system, an air interface used in mobile communication systems (TDMA system which is used in a personal digital cellular system (PDC) and a personal handy phone system (PHS) in Japan, CDMA system, etc.) is used for a radio line part.
      <br/>
      Further, for a subscriber terminal, a conventional telephone unit is commonly used through a mobile communication subscriber terminal or a dedicated WLL terminal.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The WLL system is provided for replacing the wire-line system as an access system which accommodates subscribers with rapid service at a low cost.
      <br/>
      Therefore, for services provided in the WLL system, substantially the same convenience as that of the conventional wire telephone is expected.
      <br/>
      For example, in the WLL system, telecommunication services except a telephone service (which are referred to as "telematique services", such as a facsimile service and a personal-computer communication service, the term "telematique" was made in CCITT) need to be carried out with the same protocol and apparatus as those of the conventional telephone.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The WLL system is constructed based on the mobile communication system.
      <br/>
      However, the WLL system is not a perfect duplicates of the mobile communication system, but has the following differing features.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      As the first feature, though the mobile communication system is constructed in a dedicated mobile communication network which is independent from a public switched telephone network (PSTN), the WLL system is constructed as a part of the PSTN.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the mobile communication system exclusively uses mobile exchangers in the mobile communication network, but the WLL system is connected to a conventional subscriber exchanger in the PSTN.
    </p>
    <p num="8">As the second feature, the mobile communication system supports only dedicated mobile communication subscriber terminals, but the WLL system supports the conventional wire telephone used in the PSTN as well as the mobile communication subscriber terminal.</p>
    <p num="9">
      These two features may be a large disadvantage when the telematique service dealing with a data signal from such as a facsimile machine or a MODEM is carried out in the WLL system.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows a basic configuration of the prior-art WLL system.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In FIG. 1, a subscriber terminal SU 10 is provided at the subscriber's premise, and has a modular jack so as to be usable as a conventional telephone.
      <br/>
      The air interface is provided between the SU 10 and a base terminal station BTS 12.
      <br/>
      In a speech coding-and-decoding device (CODEC) inside the SU 10, highly efficient coding and decoding of speech are carried out.
      <br/>
      A telephone TEL 11 is a conventional wire telephone.
      <br/>
      The BTS 12 accommodates a plurality of SUs 10, and converts the air interface and a base station controller (BSC) interface to each other.
      <br/>
      The BSC 13 accommodates a plurality of BTSs 12, and has a converting function of a WLL-side interface and a PSTN-side interface.
      <br/>
      The BSC 13 further has connecting/handing-off/call-processing functions and a monitoring function.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      A PSTN 14 is a conventional network, and accommodates the PSTN subscriber telephones TEL 11 and the WLL system through subscriber local exchangers (LEs).
      <br/>
      The LE 15 is an exchanger for connecting the WLL system to the PSTN, and commonly accommodates the PSTN subscriber telephones.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In the above-discussed configuration of the WLL system, only a speech service is supported.
      <br/>
      Namely, since the CODEC is provided in the SU 10 and the BSC 13, the telematique service for such as a facsimile machine cannot be provided.
    </p>
    <p num="13">In the following, before considering the telematique service in the WLL system, how the telematique service in the mobile communication system is carried out will be studied.</p>
    <p num="14">In the mobile communication system, the dedicated mobile communication network is provided independent from the PSTN, and is connected to the PSTN through a mobile gate switching system.</p>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 2 shows a illustration for explaining the telematique service in the mobile communication system.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, a portable set PS 20 is connected to a base terminal station BTS 12a through an air interface, and has functions of compressing a subscriber speech and supplying the compressed signal to a traffic channel of the radio lines.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      A telematique-service adaptor ADP 21 is connected between the PS 20 and one of a FAX 22 and a MODEM (modulator and demodulator) when the telematique data communication using facsimile transmission and reception or the MODEM is carried out.
      <br/>
      The ADP 21 carries out a converting operation of the MODEM protocol and a disconnecting control of the CODEC in the PS 20.
      <br/>
      Therefore, two kinds of ADPs for the facsimile and the MODEM are provided.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The BTS 12a establishes radio links with a plurality of PSs 20, and is connected to a base station controller BSC 23.
      <br/>
      The BSC 23 accommodates a plurality of BTSs 12a, and has connecting/handing-off/call-processing functions and a monitoring function.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      A mobile switching center MSC 24 (which corresponds to the mobile switching system) carries out line connecting and switching operations, and includes an inter-working function IWF 25.
      <br/>
      The IWF 25 is a FAX/PC adaptor, and controls conversion of the modem protocol and disconnection of the CODEC.
      <br/>
      The IWF 25 is operable for both protocols of the facsimile machine and the MODEM.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      A mobile gate switching system MGS 26 is located between the mobile communication network and one of another mobile communication network and a PSTN 27, and carries out an interactive line switching operation.
      <br/>
      The PSTN 27 accommodates a PSTN subscriber telephone 29 through an LE 28.
      <br/>
      Further, the PSTN 27 is connected to the mobile communication network through the MGS 26.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      As discussed above, in the mobile communication system, the IWF 25 is additionally provided in the MSC 24, and by the subscriber connecting the FAX 22 to the PS 20 through the ADP 21, a transparent line for the FAX 22 is established between the IWF 25 and the ADP 21.
      <br/>
      In this way, the facsimile transmitting-and-receiving operation may be carried out.
    </p>
    <p num="21">In the following, a description will be given of how the telematique service in the WLL system is carried out.</p>
    <p num="22">
      FIG. 3 shows an illustration for explaining a prior-art method of carrying out the telematique service in the WLL system.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, in the SU 10, in addition to the modular jack for connecting the conventional telephone, a dedicated connector for connecting a mobile communication adaptor ADP 31 is provided.
      <br/>
      Namely, in the SU 10, the same function as that of the PS 20 may be provided.
      <br/>
      Therefore, to the SU 10, both the wire telephone and the ADP 31 may be connected.
      <br/>
      In this case, for the BSC 13, the same function as that of the IWF 25 is required.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The above-discussed configuration of the WLL system is one method of carrying out the facsimile transmitting-and-receiving operation in the WLL system.
      <br/>
      However, at present, a telephone combined with a facsimile (referred to as a facsimile-combined telephone) is in wide commercial use.
      <br/>
      When the conventional telephone TEL 11 is replaced with the facsimile-combined telephone, the facsimile-combined telephone needs to be connected to the SU 10 through the modular jack interface connection.
      <br/>
      In this case, the ADP 31 becomes unusable.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a problem in that in the above-discussed configuration of the WLL system, a facsimile function of the facsimile-combined telephone may not be used.
    </p>
    <p num="24">In the above-discussed configuration, when the facsimile function is operated in a speech path of the telephone, since the CODEC for coding and decoding the speech is provided in the speech path, the telematique signal such as a facsimile signal and a MODEM signal is distorted due to the CODEC.</p>
    <p num="25">
      In the same way, since a dual-tone-multi frequency (DTMF) signal produced from a push-button phone is also transmitted through the CODEC, the waveform of the DTMF signal may be distorted.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a problem that in the prior-art WLL system, an airline ticket reservation cannot be carried out due to the DTMF signal on an up-link line being distorted, and reproduction of a stored message in an answer phone cannot be carried out due to the DTMF on a down-link line being distorted.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="26">
      It is an object of the present invention to provide a radio access system for a telematique service.
      <br/>
      In the system, a telematique service may be provided in a wireless local loop system, and a facsimile-combined telephone is also usable.
      <br/>
      Further, transparent transmission of a DTMF signal on both up-link and down-link lines may be positively performed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, ticket reservation service using the DTMF signal and remote control of the telephone may be positively carried out.
      <br/>
      This permits the disadvantages described above to be eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="27">The object described above is achieved by a radio access system connecting a public switched telephone network and a subscriber unit, the subscriber unit comprising: a first detection part detecting a telematique signal; and a first control part transmitting a detection signal of the telematique signal on a control channel and transmitting the telematique signal on a traffic channel while bypassing a first speech coding-and-decoding part; the radio access system comprising a second control part, provided between a radio base station and the public switched telephone network, transmitting the telematique signal on the traffic channel toward the public switched telephone network while bypassing a second speech coding-and-decoding part when the detection signal of the telematique signal is transmitted on the control channel.</p>
    <p num="28">According to the above-discussed radio access system, when the telematique signal such as a facsimile signal or a MODEM signal is transmitted from the subscriber unit to the public switched telephone network, the speech coding-and-decoding part is bypassed, and, thus, the telematique signal may be positively transmitted without being distorted.</p>
    <p num="29">The object described above is also achieved by a radio access system connecting a public switched telephone network and a subscriber unit, the radio access system comprising: a second detection part detecting a telematique signal; and a third control part transmitting a detection signal of the telematique signal on a control channel, and transmitting the telematique signal on a traffic channel while bypassing a second speech coding-and-decoding part; wherein the second detection part and the third control part are provided between the public switched telephone network and a radio base station; the subscriber unit comprising a fourth control part transmitting the telematique signal on the traffic channel while bypassing a first speech coding-and-decoding part when the detection signal of the telematique signal is transmitted on the control channel.</p>
    <p num="30">According to the above-discussed radio access system, when the telematique signal such as a facsimile signal or a MODEM signal is transmitted from the public switched telephone network to the subscriber unit, the speech coding-and-decoding part is bypassed, and, thus, the telematique signal may be positively transmitted without being distorted.</p>
    <p num="31">The object described above is also achieved by the radio access system mentioned above, wherein the second detection part comprises a plurality of detection parts, a number thereof being less than a number of lines between the public switched telephone network and the radio base station.</p>
    <p num="32">
      According to the above-discussed radio access system, the number of lines for communicating the telematique signal is less than the total number of lines.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the number of the detection parts in the second detection part may be reduced, and, thus, a circuit size of the radio base station is prevented from being enlarged.
    </p>
    <p num="33">The object described above is also achieved by the radio access system mentioned above, wherein each of the subscriber unit and the radio base station comprises a protocol conversion part converting between a communication protocol for the telematique signal and a communication protocol for a telephone signal.</p>
    <p num="34">
      According to the above-discussed radio access system, for the telematique signal, a dedicated communication protocol may be used.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the telematique signal may be positively transmitted without an error due to fading, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="35">The object described above is also achieved by the radio access system mentioned above, wherein the subscriber unit comprises a subscriber termination device.</p>
    <p num="36">According to the above-discussed radio access system, for the subscriber termination device, a conventional facsimile-combined telephone may be used to carry out facsimile transmission and reception.</p>
    <p num="37">The object described above is also achieved by the radio access system mentioned above, wherein the subscriber unit comprises a mobile communication subscriber unit.</p>
    <p num="38">According to the above-discussed radio access system, when a facsimile machine or a facsimile-combined telephone is connected to the mobile communication subscriber unit through an adaptor, facsimile transmission and reception may be carried out.</p>
    <p num="39">The object described above is also achieved by a radio access system connecting a public switched telephone network and a subscriber unit, the subscriber unit comprising: a third detection part detecting a dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signal; and a fifth control part controlling transmission of a detection signal of the DTMF signal on a control channel; the radio access system comprising: a first generation part generating the DTMF signal; and a sixth control part controlling the first generation part to generate the DTMF signal and transmitting the DTMF signal toward the public switched telephone network when the detection signal of the DTMF signal is detected on the control channel; wherein the first generation part and the sixth control part are provided between a radio base station and the public switched telephone network.</p>
    <p num="40">
      According to the above-discussed radio access system, the DTMF signal may be positively transmitted from the subscriber unit to the public switched telephone network without being distorted.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the radio access system, by calling a ticket center connected to the public switched telephone network, a ticket reservation may be easily carried out.
    </p>
    <p num="41">The object described above is also achieved by a radio access system connecting a public switched telephone network and a subscriber unit, the radio access system comprising: a fourth detection part detecting a dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signal; and a seventh control part controlling transmission of a detection signal of the DTMF signal on a control channel; wherein the fourth detection part and the seventh control part are provided between a radio base station and the public switched telephone network; the subscriber unit comprising an eighth control part carrying out one of an operation of detecting the DTMF signal when the detection signal of the DTMF signal is transmitted on the control channel and an operation of controlling a second generation part to generate a DTMF signal.</p>
    <p num="42">
      According to the above-discussed radio access system, the DTMF signal may be positively transmitted from the public switched telephone network to the subscriber unit without being distorted.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the radio access system, from a telephone connected to the public switched telephone network, a user may remotely reproduce a speech signal stored in an answer phone of a subscriber unit used in a wireless local loop system such as a mobile communication system.
    </p>
    <p num="43">The object described above is also achieved by a radio access system connecting a public switched telephone network and a subscriber unit, the subscriber unit comprising: a third detection part detecting a dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signal; and a ninth control part transmitting a detection signal of the DTMF signal on a control channel and transmitting the DTMF signal on a traffic channel while bypassing a first speech coding-and-decoding part; the radio access system comprising a tenth control part, provided between a radio base station and the public switched telephone network, transmitting the DTMF signal on the traffic channel toward the public switched telephone network while bypassing a second speech coding-and-decoding part when the detection signal of the DTMF signal is transmitted on the control channel.</p>
    <p num="44">
      According to the above-discussed radio access system, the DTMF signal may be positively transmitted from the subscriber unit to the public switched telephone network without being distorted.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the first generation part of the DTMF signal becomes unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p num="45">The object described above is also achieved by a radio access system connecting a public switched telephone network and a subscriber unit, the radio access system comprising: a fourth detection part detecting a dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signal; and an eleventh control part transmitting a detection signal of the DTMF signal on a control channel and transmitting the DTMF signal on a traffic channel while bypassing a second speech coding-and-decoding part; wherein the fourth detection part and the eleventh control part are provided between a radio base station and the public switched telephone network; the subscriber unit comprising a twelfth control part controlling the DTMF signal transmitted on the traffic channel to bypass a first coding-and-decoding part when the detection signal of the DTMF signal is transmitted on the control channel.</p>
    <p num="46">
      According to the above-discussed radio access system, the DTMF signal may be positively transmitted from the public switched telephone network to the subscriber unit without being distorted.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the second generation part generating the DTMF signal becomes unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p num="47">The object described above is also achieved by the radio access system mentioned above, wherein the fourth detection part comprises a plurality of detection parts, a number thereof being less than a number of lines between the public switched telephone network and the radio base station.</p>
    <p num="48">
      According to the above-discussed radio access system, the number of lines for communicating the DTMF signal is less than the total number of lines.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="55">
      First, a description will be given of a first embodiment of a radio access system for a telematique service according to the present invention, by referring to FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows a block diagram of the first embodiment of the radio access system for the telematique service according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the radio access system shown in FIG. 4, a subscriber unit (SU) 40 has functions of connecting subscriber termination devices such as a conventional telephone (TEL) 41, a facsimile machine (FAX) 42, and a modulator-and-demodulator (MODEM) 49.
    </p>
    <p num="56">In the SU 40 shown in FIG. 4, a telematique detection part (DET) 44 (constituting a first detection part) detects an answer tone of a facsimile machine or a MODEM, and determines a kind of the transmitted signal in order to produce a telematique detection signal such as a facsimile mode signal or a MODEM mode signal.</p>
    <p num="57">A telematique control part (CONT) 45 (constituting first and fourth control parts) receives the telematique detection signal produced from the DET 44, or receives switching information of a control channel produced from a multiplexing-and-demultiplexing part (MUX/DMUX) 46, and controls a switching operation of a switching part (SW) 47.</p>
    <p num="58">
      The MUX/DMUX 46 separates the control channel from a data sequence transmitted from a base station controller (BSC) 60, and transmits the separated control channel to the CONT 45.
      <br/>
      The SW 47 switches between a speech coding-and-decoding part (CODEC) 48 and the MODEM 49.

      The SPE 120 is constructed with the CODEC 121 which is separated from the BSC 130.

FIG. 21 shows a block diagram of the seventh embodiment of the radio access system for the telematique service according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the seventh embodiment, the DTMF signal may be positively transmitted from the PSTN side to the PS side.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      In FIG. 21, speech data provided from the LE in the PSTN to the SW 131 in the BSC 130 is transmitted to the SPE 120 from the SW 131 on, for example, 64-kbps fast traffic channel.
      <br/>
      Also, the speech data is provided from the SW 131 to the receiver 134 to detect the DTMF signal.
      <br/>
      When the DTMF signal is detected, the receiver 134 informs the CPU 132 and a character converter 142 of the detection of the DTMF signal.

      The character converter 142 converts the DTMF signal to character data, and transmits the character data to the SPE 120 on, for example, an 11.2-kbps low-rate traffic channel.
      <br/>
      In response to the information of the DTMF signal detection, the CPU 132 generates a control command, and transmits the control command on a control channel to the SPE 120.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      In the SPE 120, the fast traffic channel is speech-coded by the CODEC 121, for example, is converted to an 11.2-kbps low-rate traffic channel, and is provided to the SEL 122.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the low-rate traffic channel transmitting the character data is provided to the SEL 122 without passing through the CODEC 121.
      <br/>
      In general, the SEL 122 selects the traffic channel from the CODEC 121 according to the control command on the control channel.
      <br/>
      When the DTMF signal is transmitted, the SEL 122 selects the traffic channel transmitting the character data of the DTMF signal produced from the character converter 142.

      In the PS 100, the traffic channel is provided to the CODEC 101 and a character converter 102.
      <br/>
      The CODEC 101 decodes the speech data to, for example, 64-kbps speech data, and provides it to a selector (SEL) 104. When the character converter 102 detects the character data of the DTMF signal, the character converter 102 informs detection of the DTMF signal to a sender 103 (constituting a second generation part).
      <br/>
      The sender 103 generates speech data of the DTMF signal corresponding to the character, and provides the speech data to the SEL 104.

    <p num="129">
      When a CPU 105 (constituting an eighth control part) receives a control command of the control channel transmitted from the BTS 110, the CPU 105 allows the character converter 102 to operate, and controls the SEL 104 to switch.
      <br/>
      Thus, in a normal state, the SEL 104 selects the speech data from the CODEC 101, and when the DTMF signal is transmitted, the SEL 104 selects the speech data of the DTMF signal.
      <br/>
      The selected speech data is provided to a digital to analog converter (D/A converter) 106.

    <p num="141">In the following, a description will be given of sequences in a case where the DTMF signal is transmitted on the up-link radio line from the TEL 160 in the SU 150.</p>
    <p num="142">
      In FIG. 25, a speech signal produced from the TEL 160 is provided to an analog-to-digital converter (A/D converter) 159 to be digitized, and is provided to the CODEC 151 and the receiver 152.
      <br/>
      The CODEC 151 (constituting a first speech coding and decoding part) processes speech coding of the speech data at, for example, an 11.2-kbps rate.
      <br/>
      The 11.2-kbps coded speech data is transmitted on a traffic channel to the SPE 120 through the BTS 110 by a selector (SEL) 171, and is provided to the CODEC 121 by a selector (SEL) 122 in the SPE 120.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      The 11.2-kbps coded speech data is decoded in the CODEC 121 to produce, for example, 64-kbps speech data.
      <br/>
      The 64-kbps speech data is provided to the SW 131 in the BSC 130, and is transmitted from the SW 131 toward the LE in the PSTN.
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      When the receiver 152 (constituting a third detection part) detects the DTMF signal, the receiver 152 informs the CPU 153 and a character converter 172 of the detection of the DTMF signal.
      <br/>
      The character converter 172 converts the information of the DTMF-signal detection to character data of the DTMF signal, and supplies the character data on, for example, an 11.2-kbps low-rate traffic channel from the SEL 171 to the SPE 120 through the BTS 110.
    </p>
    <p num="145">When the CPU 153 (constituting ninth and twelfth control parts) receives the information of the DTMF-signal detection, the CPU 153 generates a control command, and transmits the control command on a control channel to the CPU 132 in the BSC 130 through the BTS 110, the SPE 120, and the SW 131 in the BSC 130.</p>
    <p num="146">
      When the CPU 132 (constituting tenth and eleventh control parts) receives the control command on the control channel, the CPU 132 allows the character converter 142 to operate, and controls the SEL 122 in the SPE 120 to switch.
      <br/>
      In a normal state, the SEL 122 supplies a signal on the traffic channel to the CODEC 121 (constituting a second speech coding and decoding part).
      <br/>
      The speech data is decoded by the CODEC 121 to produce, for example, 64-kbps speech data, and is transmitted toward the LE in the PSTN through the SW 131 in the CPU 132.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      However, in the above-discussed switching control, the SEL 122 supplies the character data of the DTMF signal on the traffic channel to a character converter 142 in the BSC 130 by bypassing the CODEC 121.
      <br/>
      When the character converter 142 detects the character data of the DTMF signal, the character converter 142 informs the sender 133 of the detection of the DTMF signal.
      <br/>
      The sender 133 generates speech data of the DTMF signal corresponding to the character data, and transmits the speech data toward the LE in the PSTN through the SW 131.
    </p>
    <p num="148">Next, a description will be given of an eleventh embodiment of the radio access system for the telematique service according to the present invention, by referring to FIG. 26. FIG. 26 shows a block diagram of the eleventh embodiment of the radio access system for the telematique service according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="149">In the following, a description will be given of sequences in a case where the DTMF signal is transmitted on the down-link radio line from the PSTN side to the SU side.</p>
    <p num="150">
      In FIG. 26, speech data provided from the LE in the PSTN to the SW 131 in the BSC 130 is transmitted to the SPE 120 from the SW 131 on, for example, a 64-kbps fast traffic channel.
      <br/>
      Also, the speech data is provided from the SW 131 to the receiver 134 to detect the DTMF signal.
      <br/>
      When the DTMF signal is detected, the receiver 134 (constituting a fourth detection part) informs the CPU 132 and the character converter 142 of the detection of the DTMF signal.
      <br/>
      The character converter 142 converts the information into character data of the DTMF signal, and transmits the character data to the SPE 120 on, for example, an 11.2-kbps low-rate traffic channel.
      <br/>
      In response to the information of the DTMF signal detection, the CPU 132 generates a control command, and transmits the control command on a control channel to the SPE 120.
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      In the SPE 120, the fast traffic channel is speech-coded by the CODEC 121, for example, is converted to an 11.2-kbps low-rate traffic channel, and is provided to the SEL 122.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the low-rate traffic channel transmitting the character data is provided to the SEL 122 without passing through the CODEC 121.
      <br/>
      In general, the SEL 122 selects the traffic channel from the CODEC 121 according to the control command on the control channel.
      <br/>
      When the DTMF signal is transmitted, the SEL 122 selects the traffic channel transmitting the character data of the DTMF signal produced from the character converter 142.
      <br/>
      The selected traffic channel with the control channel is transmitted to the SU 150 through the BTS 110.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      In the SU 150, the traffic channel is provided to the CODEC 151 and a character converter 172.
      <br/>
      The CODEC 151 decodes the speech data to, for example, 64-kbps speech data, and provides it to a selector (SEL) 156. When the character converter 172 detects the character data of the DTMF signal, the character converter 172 informs a sender 155 of the detection of the DTMF signal.
      <br/>
      The sender 155 generates speech data of the DTMF signal corresponding to the character, and provides the speech data to a selector (SEL) 156.
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      When a CPU 153 receives a control command of the control channel transmitted from the BTS 110, the CPU 153 allows the character converter 172 to operate, and controls the SEL 156 to switch.
      <br/>
      Thus, in a normal state, the SEL 156 selects the speech data from the CODEC 151, and when the DTMF signal is transmitted, the SEL 156 selects the speech data of the DTMF signal.
      <br/>
      The selected speech data is provided to a digital-to-analog converter (D/A converter) 157.
      <br/>
      In the D/A converter 157, the speech data is converted to an analog speech signal, and is produced from the TEL 160 through a subscriber circuit 158.
