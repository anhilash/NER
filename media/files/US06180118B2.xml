    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a composition, preferably a gelled oxidizing composition, intended for treating a keratin substance comprising at least one polymer selected from crosslinked and at least 90% neutralized poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulphonic acid) polymers, as well as to its uses for the dyeing, permanent reshaping or bleaching of the hair.</p>
    <p num="2">
      It is known to dye keratin fibres, and in particular human hair, with dye compositions containing oxidation dye precursors, in particular ortho- or para-phenylene diamines, orth- or para-aminophenols, and heterocyclic compounds, these generally being referred to as oxidation bases.
      <br/>
      Oxidation dye precursors, or oxidation bases, are colourless or weakly coloured compounds which, when combined with oxidizing products, can give rise to coloured compounds and dyes by a process of oxidative condensation.
      <br/>
      It is also known that the shades obtained with these oxidation bases can be varied by combining them with couplers or colour modifiers, the latter being chosen in particular from aromatic meta-diamines, meta-aminophenols, meta-diphenols and certain heterocyclic compounds such as indole compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The oxidizing agent present in the composition as defined above can be chosen from the oxidizing agents used conventionally for the oxidation dyeing of keratin fibres, and among which mention may be made of hydrogen peroxide or compounds capable of producing hydrogen peroxide by hydrolysis such as urea peroxide, and persalts such as perborates and persulphates.
      <br/>
      Hydrogen peroxide is particularly preferred.

      It is known that the most common technique for permanently reshaping the hair comprises the steps of, in a first stage, opening the -S-S-disulphide bonds of keratin (cystine) using a composition containing a suitable reducing agent (the reduction step), followed, after the hair thus treated has been rinsed, by re-forming, in a second stage, the said disulphide bonds by applying to the hair, which has been placed under tension (curlers and the like) beforehand, an oxidizing composition (the oxidation step, also known as the fixing step) in order, finally, to give the hair the desired shape.
      <br/>
      This technique thus makes it possible either to make the hair wavy or to straighten it or remove curls therefrom.
      <br/>
      The new shape given to the hair by a chemical treatment as above is remarkably long-lasting and withstands the action of washing with water or shampoo, this being in contrast with simple standard techniques of temporary reshaping such as hairsefting.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The reducing compositions which may be used to carry out the first step of a permanent-wave operation generally contain sulphites, bisulphites, alkylphosphines or, preferably, thiols as reducing agents.
      <br/>
      Among these agents, those commonly used are cysteine and its various derivatives, cysteamine and its derivatives, thiolactic acid or thioglycolic acid, salts thereof and esters thereof, in particular glyceryl thioglycolate.
    </p>
    <p num="6">In regards to the oxidizing compositions required to carry out the fixing step, compositions based on aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution are usually used in practice.</p>

      Attempts to develop cosmetic formulations in the form of transparent gels have been continuing for many years.
      <br/>
      This type of presentation is particularly favoured by consumers for aesthetic reasons and for reasons of ease and comfort of use.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The gel form usually corresponds to a practical concern of the formulator, namely, to facilitate the removal of the product from its container without any significant loss, limit the spread of the product to the local area of treatment and enable it to be used in sufficient amounts to obtain the desired cosmetic effect.
      <br/>
      These aims are important for the oxidizing formulations used in hair dyeing, for permanent-waving or for bleaching of the hair.
      <br/>
      It is desired that the formulations spread well and distribute themselves uniformly along the keratin fibres and not run down the forehead, the nape of the neck, the face or into the eyes.

      It is generally difficult to produce gels based on peroxide, such as hydrogen peroxide, which are stable on storage by using standard water-soluble gelling agents and/or thickeners, for example those of the crosslinked acrylic polymer type such as those sold under the name Carbopol by the company Goodrich.
      <br/>
      Peroxides are used in cosmetics in the form of acidic aqueous solutions for reasons of stability.
      <br/>
      In the presence of standard gelling agents, they usually cause appreciable variations in the viscosity of the gel during storage.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Gels are known from U.S. Pat. No. 4,804,705, the disclosure of which is specifically incorporated by reference herein, which are based on hydrogen peroxide containing a gelling agent formed by reaction of a quaternized hydroxyethyl cellulose such as Celquat (product sold by National Starch), a 15% by weight aqueous solution of a non-crosslinked poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulphonic acid) polymer such as Cosmedia HSP-1180 (product sold by Henkel) and a poly(sodium styrenesulphonate) such as Flexan 3 (product sold by National Starch), which are used in specific concentrations.</p>
    <p num="11">
      The inventor has discovered, surprisingly, a novel family of thickeners and/or gelling agents which makes it possible to obtain transparent gels based on hydrogen peroxide or on oxidizing compound capable of releasing hydrogen peroxide, these gels being stable on storage.
      <br/>
      They are crosslinked and at least 90% neutralized poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulphonic acid) polymers.
      <br/>
      These novel gelling agents do not affect the oxidizing properties of the hydrogen peroxide, or of a compound capable of producing hydrogen peroxide by hydrolysis, present in the gel thus formed.
    </p>
    <p num="12">The subject of the present invention is thus a cosmetic and/or dermatological composition intended for treating a keratin substance, comprising, preferably in a support which is suitable for a keratin substance:</p>
    <p num="13">
      (a) at least one polymer selected from crosslinked and at least 90% neutralized poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulphonic acid) polymers, and
      <br/>
      (b) at least one oxidizing agent selected from hydrogen peroxide and compounds capable of producing hydrogen peroxide by hydrolysis.
    </p>
    <p num="14">The invention also relates to the use of these polymers as thickeners and/or gelling agents in cosmetic and/or dermatological compositions comprising at least one oxidizing agent selected from hydrogen peroxide and compounds capable of producing hydrogen peroxide by hydrolysis.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The crosslinked and completely or almost completely neutralized poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulphonic acid) polymers in accordance with the invention are generally characterized in that they comprise, distributed randomly:
      <br/>
      a) from 90 to 99.99%, preferably 99.9%, by weight of units of formula (1):  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
      <br/>
      in which X+ denotes a cation or a mixture of cations, not more than 10 mol % of which cations X+ may be protons H+ ;
      <br/>
      b) from 0.01 to 10% by weight of crosslinking units derived from at least one monomer having at least two olefinic double bonds; the weight proportions being defined relative to the total weight of the polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Preferably, the polymers of the invention contain a number of units of formula (1) in a sufficiently large amount to obtain polymer particles whose hydrodynamic volume in aqueous solution has a radius ranging from 10 to 500 nm and whose distribution is homogeneous and unimodal.</p>
    <p num="17">The polymers according to the invention which are more particularly preferred comprise from 98 to 99.8%, preferably 99.5%, by weight of units of formula (1) and from 0.2 to 2% by weight of crosslinking units.</p>
    <p num="18">X+ represents a cation or a mixture of cations chosen in particular from a proton, an alkali metal cation, a cation equivalent of an alkaline-earth metal or the ammonium ion.</p>
    <p num="19">More particularly, 90 to 100 mol % of the cations are NH4+ cations and 0 to 10 mol % are protons (H+).</p>
    <p num="20">Crosslinking monomers having at least two olefinic double bonds are chosen, for example, from dipropylene glycol diallyl ether, polyglycol diallyl ethers, triethylene glycol divinyl ether, hydroquinone diallyl ether, tetrallyl-oxethanoyl or other polyfunctional allyl or vinyl ether alcohols, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, triallylamine, trimethylolpropane diallyl ether, methylenebisacrylamide and divinylbenzene.</p>
    <p num="21">Crosslinking monomers having at least two olefinic double bonds are more particularly chosen from those corresponding to formula (2) below:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="22">in which R1 denotes a hydrogen atom or a C1 -C4 alkyl and more particularly methyl (trimethylolpropane triacrylate).</p>
    <p num="23">
      The reaction for the polymerization of the polymers of the invention produces not only linear chains but also branched or crosslinked polymer molecules.
      <br/>
      These molecules may be characterized in particular by their rheological behaviour in water, but more particularly by dynamic light scattering.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In the case of characterization of the molecules by dynamic light scattering, the distribution of the hydrodynamic volume of the polymer structures is measured.
      <br/>
      The macromolecules dissolved in water are flexible and surrounded by a solvation sheath formed of water molecules.
      <br/>
      With charged polymers such as those of the invention, the size of the molecules depends on the amount of salt in the water.
      <br/>
      In polar solvents, the uniform charge along the main chain of the polymer leads to a considerable expansion of the polymer chain.
      <br/>
      Increasing the amount of salt increases the amount of electrolyte in the solvent and separates the uniform charges of the polymer.
      <br/>
      In addition to the molecules transported in the solvation sheath, the solvent molecules are bound in the polymer cavities.
      <br/>
      In this case, the solvent molecules form part of the macromolecules in solution and move at the same average speed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the hydrodynamic volume describes the linear size of the macromolecule and of these solvation molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The hydrodynamic molecule vh is determined by the following formula:
      <br/>
      vh =M/NA * (V2 +dV1)
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      where:
      <br/>
      M denotes the mass in grams of the non-dissolved macromolecule;
      <br/>
      NA denotes the Avogadro number;
      <br/>
      V1 denotes the specific volume of the solvent;
      <br/>
      V2 denotes the specific volume of the macromolecule;
      <br/>
      d is the mass in grams of the solvent which is associated with 1 gram of non-dissolved macromolecule.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      If the hydrodynamic particle is spherical, it is easy to calculate the hydrodynamic radius from the hydrodynamic volume, by the formula:
      <br/>
      vh =4 PI R3 /3
    </p>
    <p num="28">where R denotes the dynamic radius.</p>
    <p num="29">
      The cases in which the hydrodynamic particles are perfect spheres are extremely rare.
      <br/>
      Most synthetic polymers involve compact structures or ellipsoids of high eccentricity.
      <br/>
      In this case, the radius is determined on a sphere which is equivalent from a friction point of view to the shape of the particle considered.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      As a general rule, the calculations are done on molecular weight distributions and thus on hydrodynamic volume and radius distributions.
      <br/>
      For polydispersed systems, the distribution of the diffusion coefficients should be calculated.
      <br/>
      From this distribution, the results relating to the radial distribution and the hydrodynamic volume distribution are deduced.
    </p>
    <p num="31">The hydrodynamic volumes of the polymers of the invention are determined in particular by dynamic light scattering from the diffusion coefficients D according to the Stokes-Einstein formula: D=kT/6 PI  ETA R where k is the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin,  ETA  is the viscosity of the solvent (water) and R is the hydrodynamic radius.</p>
    <p num="32">
      These diffusion coefficients D are measured by the method of characterizing a polymer mixture by laser scattering, described in the following references:

      The crosslinked poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulphonic acid) polymers of the invention may be obtained by the preparation process comprising the following steps:

      According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the dyeing process according to the invention, the dye composition described above is mixed, at the time of use, with an oxidizing composition according to the invention.

      The first step in this process is the application of a reducing composition to the hair.
      <br/>
      This application is carried out lock by lock or all at once.
    </p>
    <p num="50">The reducing composition comprises at least one reducing agent, which may in particular be chosen from thioglycolic acid, cysteine, cysteamine, glyceryl thioglycolate, thiolactic acid, or salts of thiolactic or thioglycolic acid.</p>

    <p num="53">
      Before proceeding to the following optional rinsing step, the hair on which the reducing composition has been applied should, as is conventional, be left to stand for a few minutes, generally from 5 minutes to one hour, preferably from 10 to 30 minutes, in order to give the reducing agent plenty of time to act properly on the hair.
      <br/>
      This wait preferably takes place at a temperature ranging from 35 (degree)  C. to 45 (degree)  C., preferably while also protecting the hair with a bonnet.

    <p num="67">
      2006.2 g of tert-butanol and then 340.0 g of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulphonic acid are introduced into a 5-litre round-bottomed flask fitted with a stirrer, a reflux condenser, a thermometer and a device for conveying nitrogen and aqueous ammonia, the acid being dispersed in the solution with vigorous stirring.
      <br/>
      After 30 minutes, aqueous ammonia is added via the upper tube of the flask and the reaction mixture is maintained for 30 minutes at room temperature until a pH of about 6-6.5 is obtained. 19.2 g of 25% trimethylolpropane triacrylate solution in tert-butanol are then added and the reaction medium is heated to 60 (degree)  C. and is simultaneously made inert by supplying nitrogen into the flask.
      <br/>
      Once this temperature has been reached, dilauroyl peroxide is added.
      <br/>
      The reaction starts immediately, as evidenced by an increase in temperature and by precipitation of the polymerizate. 15 minutes after the start of the polymerization, a stream of nitrogen is introduced. 30 minutes after adding the initiator, the temperature of the reaction medium reaches a maximum of 65-70 (degree)  C. 30 minutes after this temperature has been reached, the mixture is heated to reflux and maintained under these conditions for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      The formation of a thick paste is observed in the course of the reaction.
      <br/>
      The mixture is cooled to room temperature and the product obtained is filtered off.
