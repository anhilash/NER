    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to an image-forming system comprising superposing a heat developable color photographic material (hereinafter referred to as "light-sensitive element") onto an image-receiving material provided on a different support, and forming an image by transferring a diffusible dye.
      <br/>
      The heat developable color photographic material contains at least light-sensitive silver halide and a dye-donating compound.
      <br/>
      Further, an image obtained by the heat developable color photographic material and the image-receiving material according to the present invention is mainly used as a color-proof in the printing field.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">Heat developable photographic materials are well-known and heat developable photographic materials and processes for using such photographic materials are disclosed, for example, in "Shashin Kogaku no Kiso, Hi-Gin-En Shashin-Hen (The Elementary Course of Photographic Engineering, Section of Nonsilver Photography)", pp. 242 to 255, Corona Publishing Co. (1982), and U.S. Pat. No. 4,500,626, etc.</p>
    <p num="3">
      A method of imagewise forming or releasing diffusible dyes by heat development and transferring these diffusible dyes to an image-receiving material has been proposed.
      <br/>
      In this method, a negative dye image and a positive dye image can be obtained by changing the kind of the dye-donating compound and the kind of silver halide to be used.
      <br/>
      Further details are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,500,626, 4,483,914, 4,503,137, 4,559,290, JP-A-58-149046, JP-A-60-133449, JP-A-59-218443, JP-A-61-238056 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application"), EP 220746 A2, Kokai Giho No. 87-6199 and EP 210660 A2, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Various methods have been proposed as to methods of obtaining positive color images by heat development.
      <br/>
      For example, a method in which a so-called dye releasing redox compound (hereinafter referred to as a DRR compound) is converted to a compound of an oxidized form having no dye-releasing capability, and the compound, in the presence of a reducing agent or a precursor thereof, is heat developed, the reducing agent is oxidized corresponding to the exposure amount of silver halide by heat development, and the compound is reduced by the remaining reducing agent not oxidized to release diffusible dyes is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,290. Further, a heat developable color photographic material using, as a compound which releases diffusible dyes by the same mechanism, a compound which releases diffusible dyes by the reductive cleavage of N--X bond (wherein X represents an oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom or a sulfur atom) is disclosed in EP 220746 A and Kokai Giho No. 87-6199 (No. 22, Vol. 12).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Conventionally used color photographic materials generally have blue, green and red spectral sensitization.
      <br/>
      For forming images on such color photographic materials using image information once converted to electric signals, a color CRT (cathode ray tube) is generally used as an exposure light source but CRT is inappropriate for obtaining a large size print.
    </p>
    <p num="6">A light emitting diode (LED) and a semiconductor laser (LD) have been developed as a write head capable of obtaining a large size print, but a photo-write head which efficiently emits blue light has not been developed yet.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Accordingly, for example, when LED is used, it is necessary to use a light source combining three LED's of near infrared (800 nm), red (670 nm) and yellow (570 nm) for exposing color photographic materials having three layers spectrally sensitized to infrared, red and yellow.
      <br/>
      A system of image recording according to such configuration is described in "Nikkei New Materials", pp. 47 to 57, Sep. 14, 1987, and has partly been put to practical use.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Further, a system of recording on a color photographic material having three light-sensitive layers each having spectral sensitization in wavelength of 880 nm, 820 nm and 760 nm using a light source combining three LD's showing emission of each of these wavelengths is disclosed in JP-A-61-137149.</p>
    <p num="9">
      In general, when yellow, magenta and cyan colors in a multilayer color photographic material are colored by exposure to light in three different spectral regions, it is an important technique in color reproduction to develop each color without color mixing.
      <br/>
      In particular, when LED or LD is used as an exposure light source, it is unavoidable to design three spectral sensitivities in a spectral region of narrow range (from red to infrared region), therefore, how to lessen the overlap of each spectral sensitivity is the key to the improvement of color isolation.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      For ensuring color isolation, as is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,619,892, techniques of making the sensitivity in short wavelength side successively high or using a filter are known.
      <br/>
      However, if the sensitivity in short wavelength side is made successively high, fog increases and raw stock storability deteriorates with the lapse of time.
      <br/>
      In infrared sensitization, it has been difficult to achieve high sensitivity due to desensitization by the addition of dyes and the low efficiency of color sensitization.
    </p>
    <p num="11">For solving these problems, color photographic materials excellent in color isolation, showing high sensitivity and good raw stock storability due to the use of an infrared sensitizing dye of a J-band type of high spectral sensitivity are disclosed in JP-A-4-146431 and JP-A-5-45828.</p>
    <p num="12">
      The above heat developable color photographic materials are used in combination with an image-receiving material which mordants a diffusible dye.
      <br/>
      When an image obtained in this image-forming system is used as a color-proof in the printing field, the color reproduction level of the image obtained by synthesizing dye images of three colors of yellow, magenta and cyan is an important factor.
      <br/>
      That is, it is necessary that the image obtained in such an image-forming system should be able to cover the color reproduction level equal to or higher than the level of images obtained using standard printing ink.
      <br/>
      Further, the tint of a white ground part is required to coincide with the whiteness of standard paper for printing.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="23">
      Absorption wavelength of each dye released from or formed by a yellow, magenta and cyan dye-donating compound contained in the heat developable color photographic material for use in the present invention is prescribed.
      <br/>
      This is because peak wavelengths of three colors of yellow, magenta and cyan dyes and the absorption at the foot in the short wavelength side of the cyan dye are important for forming a color-proof for printing which coincides with the tint of the printed matter.
      <br/>
      In particular, the absorption of the cyan dye influences the color reproduction of pure cyan color and green.
      <br/>
      The terminologies "absorption", "hue" and "spectral absorption" of yellow, magenta and cyan dyes as used herein mean those of the spectral absorption in the state of each dye fixed in an image-receiving material.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      As the dye-donating compound of each color, two or more dye-donating compounds can be used in admixture in the present invention to obtain desired hue.
      <br/>
      When dye-donating compounds are used in admixture, it is sufficient that the absorption peak of the dyes after being mixed falls within the range of the present invention and the absorption peak of the respective dye is not particularly restricted.
    </p>
    <p num="25">The heat developable color photographic material according to the present invention contains a compound which forms or releases cyan, magenta and yellow dyes corresponding to the reaction of reducing a silver ion to silver under high temperature, i.e., a dye-donating compound.</p>
    <p num="26">
      As the example of a dye-donating compound for use in the heat developable color photographic material according to the present invention, a compound which forms a dye upon oxidation coupling reaction (a coupler) can be exemplified in the first place.
      <br/>
      This coupler may be either 4-equivalent or 2-equivalent. 2-Equivalent couplers which have a diffusion-resisting group as a separable group and form a diffusible dye upon oxidation coupling reaction are also preferably used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      This diffusion-resisting group may be a polymer chain.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of color developers and couplers are described in detail in T. H. James, "The Theory of the Photographic Process", 4th Ed., pp. 291 to 334 and 354 to 361, "Research Disclosure", No. 307105, p. 871, JP-A-58-123533, JP-A-58-149046, JP-A-58-149047, JP-A-59-111148, JP-A-59-124399, JP-A-59-174835, JP-A-59-231539, JP-A-59-231540, JP-A-60-2950, JP-A-60-2951, JP-A-60-14242, JP-A-60-23474 and JP-A-60-66249.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Further, as the example of the dye-donating compound different from the above-described couplers, compounds having the function of imagewise releasing or diffusing a diffusible dye can be exemplified.
      <br/>
      Compounds of this type can be represented by the following formula (L1):
      <br/>
      ((Dye)m --Y)n --Z   (L1)
    </p>
    <p num="28">wherein Dye represents a dye group, or a dye group or precursor thereof which is shifted to shortwave temporarily; Y represents a single bond or a linking group; Z represents a group having the function of imagewise making difference in diffusibility of the compound represented by ((Dye)m --Y)n --Z corresponding to light-sensitive silver salt having a latent image, or releasing (Dye)m --Y and differentiating the released (Dye)m --Y from ((Dye)m --Y)n --Z in diffusibility; m represents an integer of from 1 to 5; and n represents an integer of 1 or 2, and when m or n does not represents 1, a plurality of Dyes may be the same or different.</p>
    <p num="29">Specific examples of the dye-donating compounds represented by formula (L1) include the compounds belonging to the following (1) or (2).</p>

    </p>
    <p num="31">
      (2) Compounds which are reducible against silver halide or organic silver salt and release a diffusible dye when the object (a DRR compound) have been reduced.
      <br/>

      For achieving the tint of the desired whiteness as a color-proof for printing, the whiteness of the present invention should coincide with the whiteness of these papers.

      The tint of the desired whiteness in the present invention means that the point (a, b) on the chromaticity diagram in CIE colorimetric system Lab values falls within the range of -2 &lt;= a &lt;= 2, -1 &lt;= b &lt;= 4, more preferably -1 &lt;= a &lt;= 1, 0 &lt;= b &lt;= 3.

      The heat developable color photographic material for use in the present invention fundamentally comprises a support having thereon light-sensitive silver halide, a binder and a dye-donating compound (a reducing agent serves also as a dye-donating compound in some cases as described below).

      In addition to the above, an organic metal salt oxidizing agent may be contained, if necessary.
      <br/>
      These components are in many cases added to the same layer but they may be added dividedly to different layers if it is possible to cause reaction.
      <br/>
      For example, when a colored dye-donating compound is present in the lower silver halide emulsion layer, the reduction of sensitivity can be prevented.
      <br/>
      A reducing agent is preferably incorporated into the heat developable photographic material, but it may be supplied from the outside, e.g., by a method of diffusing from an image-receiving material, as is described later.

      Gloss as used in the present invention can be determined by various methods.
      <br/>
      A representative method is described in "Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry", T442su-72.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      Gloss in the present invention means the gloss when determined using a digital deformation glossimeter UGV-5D (a product of Suga Testing Machine Co., Ltd.), by the conditions of incident angle: 20 (degree) , light reception angle: 20 (degree) , a throttle plate for a light source part: aperture of 8 mm square, and others are by the prescribed conditions.
      <br/>
      Other glossimeters can be used for determination (e.g., a glossimeter manufactured by Gardner Co., U.S.A., a Hunter type calorimetric glossimeter, etc.).
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      The gloss of an image largely affects the texture of that image.
      <br/>
      That is, if the gloss is high, the image gives photographic texture.
      <br/>
      There are a variety of printing papers and glosses are different according to printing papers.
      <br/>
      When the gloss is low, the texture is near to the plain paper print.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, for obtaining the texture near to the plain paper print, gloss is 20 or less, preferably 15 or less.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      The gloss of the image-receiving material according to the present invention can be controlled by selecting the kind and the addition amount of a matting agent contained in the image-receiving material and the layer to which a matting agent is added.
      <br/>
      Kinds of matting agents which can be used are described later.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      As for the addition amount of a matting agent, the more the addition amount, the lower is the gloss.
      <br/>
      Larger effect can be obtained when a matting agent is added in an upper layer (the layer on the opposite side of the support).
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Preferred addition amount for making the gloss 20 or less largely differs according to the selection of the kind of a matting agent and the layer to which a matting agent is added.
      <br/>
      For example, when the kinds of matting agents and addition layers described in Example of the present invention are selected, the total addition amount of the matting agent in the image-receiving layer is 50 mg/m2 or more, preferably 80 mg/m2 or more, more preferably 100 mg/m2 or more, and the upper limit is 2.5 g/m2.

      For obtaining a wide range of colors on the chromaticity diagram using three primary colors of yellow, magenta and cyan, at least three silver halide emulsion layers each having light sensitivity in a different spectral region can be used in combination.

      Each light-sensitive layer can take various orders of arrangement known in general color photographic materials.

      When an image obtained by the heat developable color photographic material and the image-receiving material is used as a color-proof for printing, it is required that an image by the heat developable material has no color difference between an image obtained by printing ink.
      <br/>
      Having no color difference is premised that the color reproduction region of an image obtained by the heat developable color photographic material and the image-receiving material is broader than the color reproduction region of an image obtained by printing ink.
      <br/>
      This color reproduction region means the color reproduction in every lightness region.

    <p num="88">Tints of three dyes of yellow, magenta and cyan to be used, or four dyes including black, or tints of mixed dyes of them are of course important factors determining the color reproduction region of an image obtained by the heat developable color photographic material and the image-receiving material, but the tint of the white part of an image also has an important influence on the color reproduction region.</p>
    <p num="89">
      The white ground of an image obtained by heat development is decided by various factors, e.g., the white ground of the image-receiving material itself, the tints of components transferred from the heat developable color photographic material at heat development, and the tints of components which are colored by heating, if present.
      <br/>
      Of these factors, the white ground of the image-receiving material itself is an important factor.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      The white ground of the image-receiving material itself is decided by the tints of a support, a dye fixing layer, protective layers provided on and under a dye fixing layer, an interlayer, etc.
      <br/>
      Therefore, how to design the tint of each constitutional component is an important factor.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      The white ground of the image-receiving material itself can be controlled by means of adding a coloring component, e.g., a pigment or a dye, to a support, a dye fixing layer, protective layers provided on and under a dye fixing layer, an interlayer, etc.
      <br/>
      When a support comprising a paper support both sides of which are laminated with polyethylene is used, a method of adding a white pigment such as titanium oxide and magnesium oxide, a bluish pigment such as ultramarine to a paper support or laminated supports can be used.

      As printer 14, a laser printer can be used, which is emitted, for example, corresponding to RGB image data Iout (R is image data corresponding to cyan density and is converted to output data of LD of 750 nm emission; G is image data corresponding to magenta density and is converted to output data of LD of 680 nm emission; and B is image data corresponding to yellow density and is converted to output data of LD of 810 nm emission), and each laser beam of 680 nm, 750 nm and 810 nm strength-converted corresponding to each of RGB image data Iout scans heat developable photographic material 40, thereby latent image is exposed and recorded and a visible image is formed by heat development.
      <br/>
      Specifically, it is possible to prepare a proof by the combination of various personal computers, appropriate software, files such as LUT and Pictrography 4000 manufactured by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. and the like.
