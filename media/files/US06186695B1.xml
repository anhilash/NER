No. 3,869,959 there is known a dowel for securing objects to construction elements, in particular to gypsum plaster boards, with a spreadable dowel body which has an inner bore into which a fastening screw can be screwed, wherein the dowel body is subdivided into at least two head segments by slots starting at a front end and includes at the front area along its outer surface a continuous necking, and wherein the dowel body at the rear end opposite to the front end includes a stopping plate extending transversely to a dowel longitudinal axis.</p>
    <p num="6">
      The dowel known from U.S. Pat. No. 3,869,959 is made of a uniform dowel body with a cylindrical section which corresponds to a bore in the construction part to which the dowel is to be secured.
      <br/>
      At the rear end of the dowel body, there is disposed a threaded inner bore and a stopping plate.
      <br/>
      At the rear area opposite to the front area, the dowel body has a collar which is connected with the rear area through a conical necking.
      <br/>
      At the front area, the dowel body has a plurality of slots which can spread radially when a fastening screw is inserted in the inner bore.
      <br/>
      On the circumference of the dowel body there are arranged a plurality of ribs for preventing rotation of the dowel in the dowel bore.
      <br/>
      With the known dowel, the fastening screw can disadvantageously be pulled out of the inner bore when tensile forces are applied along the longitudinal axis of the dowel.
      <br/>
      To making it more difficult for the fastening screw to be pulled out, the known dowel has to be provided with a relatively coarse thread which makes it hard to turn the screw.
      <br/>
      The dowel may disadvantageously also rotate together with the fastening screw when the fastening screw tightened.
      <br/>
      To counteract this situation, additional ribs are provided on the circumference.
      <br/>
      These ribs, however, can damage the construction element surrounding the dowel.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      It is therefore an object of the present invention to improve the known dowel so that the resistance to tensile forces and the load bearing capacity, respectively, are increased in the axial direction and the fastening screw can be tightened easily without causing rotation of the dowel.
      <br/>
      The object is solved by the invention in that the inner bore includes a recess located in a rear area opposite to the front area, wherein the recess holds an insert with a female thread.
      <br/>
      Since the insert is immovably installed in the recess, a fastening screw which is easy to turn can be used, while the load bearing capacity in the axial direction is simultaneously increased.
      <br/>
      More particularly, by using the insert, the material for the dowel body can be selected for the required speadability and resiliency, and the material for the insert can be selected for the strength necessary to prevent stripping of the thread.
      <br/>
      Since the fastening screw can now be tightened easily and the dowel body can be spread apart easily, ribs or other protruding elements can be eliminated from the outside diameter.
    </p>
    <p num="8">It is yet another object of the invention to provide a simple method for manufacturing a dowel with an inner bore and a female thread.</p>
    <p num="9">
      This object is solved with the invention in that the dowel is made of two vertical halves with a recess adapted to receive an insert with a female thread, wherein the insert is inserted into the first half and the second half is then joined with the first half.
      <br/>
      With the method of the invention, the dowel body can be manufactured by injection molding preferably from plastic--without the need for cutting a thread in the dowel.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the insert does not have to be inserted in the mold form prior to molding.
      <br/>
      The insert is particularly easy to install since the dowel body is constructed from two halves.
    </p>
    <p num="10">In another advantageous embodiment, the two halves are joined with each other at a longitudinal side in such a way that, after insertion of the insert, the two halves can be folded together by pivoting the two halves about the joined portion and then secured by, for example, pushing a ring over the dowel body.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="12">
      A dowel is composed of a dowel body (1, 1', 1") and an insert (2) with a thread.
      <br/>
      The dowel body (1, 1', 1") has an insertion front area (3) with a front end (4).
      <br/>
      The front area (3) is subdivided into head segments (6, 6', 6") by slots (5, 5', 5") starting at the front end (4).
      <br/>
      A necking (7) in the form of a truncated cone is located in the front area (3) of the dowel body (1, 1', 1").
      <br/>
      As a result of the necking (7), the head segments (6, 6', 6") function as teeth and are able to grip with the planar surface (8)--which is located opposite to the front end (4)--the construction element (9), for example a gypsum plaster boards (10) surrounding the dowel body (1, 1', 1"), from behind.
      <br/>
      The dowel can advantageously also be used with a construction element (9') having a blind hole (11).
      <br/>
      In this case, the head segments (6, 6', 6") are deformed by the fastening screw (17) and pressed against the wall of the blind hole (11), thereby firmly securing the dowel body (1, 1', 1") in the construction element (9').
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      At the rear end (12) of the dowel body (1, 1', 1") opposite to the front end (4), there is disposed a stopping plate (13, 13', 13") which makes contact with the construction element (9, 9', 9").
      <br/>
      The stopping plate (13, 13') has two parallel flat areas (14) spaced apart by a distance which corresponds approximately to the diameter of the portion of the dowel body (1, 1') which is to be inserted in a bore hole (18, 18') of a construction element (9, 9', 9").
      <br/>
      The dowel body can thus advantageously be assembled from two foldable halves (15, 16) which are joined together.
      <br/>
      Moreover, an open-end wrench can be used to hold the dowel body (1, 1') at the stopping plate (13, 13') during installation.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The dowel body has an inner bore (19, 19') which is tapered or closed at the front end facing the front area (3).
      <br/>
      The front end of the inner bore (19, 19') can be in the shape of a truncated cone or a hemisphere.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the front end of the inner bore (19, 19') can also be formed by two cross bores (22) extending transversely to the dowel longitudinal axis (21).
      <br/>
      When a fastening screw (17) is screwed in, the front end of the inner bore (19, 19') is pushed apart, thereby spreading apart the front area (3) of the dowel body (1, 1', 1").
      <br/>
      The inner bore (19, 19') can either be manufactured with a thread already built in, or the thread can be cut by a self-tapping fastening screw (17) when the dowel is installed.
      <br/>
      The inner bore preferably incorporates a recess (20) for receiving a threaded insert, such as a hexagonal nut.
      <br/>
      It becomes thereby almost impossible to pull the fastening screw (17) out, so that the fastening screw (17) in this case can be an easily rotatable screw with a machine thread--such as a conventional metric thread.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the front end of the fastening screw (17) is provided with a conical tip so as to easily penetrate the front area (3) of the dowel body (1, 1', 1").
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The section of the dowel body (1, 1', 1") which is to be inserted in a bore hole (18, 18'), is essentially cylindrical.
      <br/>
      However, this section can also be polygonal or have, for example, a hexagonal cross section with six head segments (6, 6").
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      To install the dowel, a bore hole (18, 18') is drilled in the construction element (9, 9'), and the dowel body (1, 1', 1") is inserted in the bore hole (18, 18').
      <br/>
      The bore (24) of the object (23) to be secured is then overlapped with the inner bore (19, 19') and secured with the fastening screw (17).
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The dowel body (1, 1') is manufactured by (plastic) injection molding to form two vertical halves (15, 16) which are joined together at a longitudinal side (25) and which can be spread apart.
      <br/>
      After the insert (2) is inserted in a recess (20), the two vertical halves (15, 16) are folded together and latched with the help of a latching mechanism (not shown) or joined with a ring (26) which is pushed over the dowel body (1, 1').
