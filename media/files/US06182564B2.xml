    <p num="1">The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. .sctn. 119 of German Patent Application No. 198 28 156.0, filed on Jun. 24, 1998, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to an apparatus for the smoothing of a material web, e.g., a paper or card web.
      <br/>
      The apparatus include at least one smoothing zone through which the material web is passed.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Discussion of Background Information</p>
    <p num="5">
      A calender of the type generally described above is disclosed, e.g., in EP 0 361 402 A1.
      <br/>
      In this calender, the smoothing zones are respectively formed between a heated chill-cast roll and an endless band formed with a soft or resilient cover.
      <br/>
      A smoothing process of this type always occurs at a side of a material web that contacts the respective chill-cast roll.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a relatively heavy, heated, chill-cast roll, which requires long heat up and cool down times, must be used.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the chill-cast roll is only capable of being handled with heavy apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      This known calender is relatively expensive and complicated in its construction.
      <br/>
      Further, when it becomes necessary to exchange these heavy rolls, and subsequently necessary to heat the new rolls, considerable cost arises in this complex exchange.
      <br/>
      The use of a heated, chill-cast roll with corresponding bearings involves a series of disadvantages which relate, e.g., to its large mass, the long heating up and cooling down times and to the fact that corresponding handling is only possible with heavy apparatus.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is apparent that the use of rolls is extremely costly.
      <br/>
      Moreover, at least one complete replacement roll must be kept available.
      <br/>
      Further, zonal heating is not practicable due to the considerable cost which is associated with the requisite induction segments.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Finally, correspondingly high pressures and high temperatures are necessary for large rolls.</p>

      The present invention provides an apparatus of the type generally discussed above in which the above-noted disadvantages are overcome and which ensures an ideal treatment of the material web and, e.g, an ideal glazing result.
      <br/>
      Further, the construction of the apparatus is kept as simple as possible so as not to require the heavy heated hard rolls or the like of the prior art.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Accordingly, the present invention provides at least one smoothing zone formed between a deflection adjustment (controlled or compensation) roll having a soft or elastic surface and a heatable endless band of high thermal conductivity having a hard and smooth surface.
      <br/>
      The heatable endless band is guided, in the region of the smoothing zone, over a support surface arranged within the band loop, and is heated on an inner side or surface on by a heating medium.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the endless band can not only be heated, but a liquid film can be created which provides a hydrodynamic lubrication between the support surface and the endless band.
    </p>
    <p num="10">A hot gaseous medium, e.g., steam, may be preferably used as the heating medium, and the liquid film, which brings about hydrodynamic lubrication, can be expediently built up or formed by the heating medium condensing on the endless band.</p>
    <p num="11">
      As a result of this arrangement, a substantially simplified construction of a smoothing apparatus is provided without the previously customary, heavy, heated rolls, while providing ideal smoothness and gloss values.
      <br/>
      That is, ideal glazing results are ensured despite the simpler construction.
      <br/>
      While the deflection adjustment roll, which does not need to be heated, has a soft or elastic surface (or an elastic jacket or coating), the heated endless band, which is positioned on the other side of the material web, has a hard and smooth surface, so that the desired smoothing process occurs on the side web facing the heated endless band.
      <br/>
      The soft or resilient surface of the deflection adjustment roll ensures uniform compression.
      <br/>
      Through the introduction of a hot gaseous medium, e.g., steam, on the inner side of the endless band, which preferably can have a high thermal conductivity, the endless band is not only heated, but, at the same time, heating medium condensing on the inner surface forms hydrodynamic lubrication between the support surface and the endless band.
      <br/>
      Through the condensate, which is towed or dragged into the lubrication gap, a corresponding liquid film can be built up.
      <br/>
      Thus, in accordance with the features of the present invention, the gaseous medium or steam on the inner side of the endless band has a double function.
      <br/>
      Moreover, any eventually required exchange of a heatable endless band is possible with a minimum of cost and complexity.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      With the heatable endless band, only a relatively small mass has to be heated or cooled in comparison with the known heated, chill-cast rolls, and no replacement rolls are required, i.e., only a replacement band, which further reduces the total cost of operation.
      <br/>
      The heating can occur at favorable cost, e.g., by steam or by another gaseous medium, and additional lubrication is not required because the condensate of the gaseous medium or steam provides such lubrication.
      <br/>
      Further, the endless band of higher thermal conductivity can be straightforwardly heated both in total, i.e., across its entire width, and also zone-wise.
      <br/>
      Zone-wise heating in particular can be possible without problems and with a minimum of cost.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      While the use of a heatable endless band of high thermal conductivity is admittedly already known from EP 0 370 185 A1, this apparatus is provided with a metal band that is heated from the outside via an inductive heater.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a non-metallic band can be acted on by steam or heated air from the outside.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in this known apparatus, both surfaces bounding a respective smoothing zone are to be heated. thus, a heated roll is required on one side of the web to be smoothed.
      <br/>
      Instead of a heated roll, a heated adjustable support element can also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In a exemplary embodiment of the apparatus of the instant invention, the heatable endless band can be acted on by the heating medium upstream of the support surface in the web running direction.
      <br/>
      In this manner, timely condensation provides reliable hydrodynamic lubrication.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      With a heating apparatus which is controlled zone-wise over the width of the web, by which the heatable band can be acted on by the heating medium with zone control, a further optimization of web treatment is possible.
      <br/>
      In this arrangement, the heating device can include, e.g., a zone controlled steam moistener or a steam blowing box.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In order to assist the formation of condensate, the support surface can be formed by at least one support element which is cooled, at least in the region of the support surface.
      <br/>
      A metal band can be provided, e.g., as the heatable endless band of high thermal conductivity.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In order to ensure smoothness and/or gloss values which are as ideal as possible on the acted on surface of the material web, the support surface can be expediently formed by at least one stationary support element of high rigidity.
      <br/>
      For example, a support shoe or the like can be provided as the support element.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      A condensate removal device can be advantageously provided within the band loop of the heatable endless band and positioned, with respect to a web running direction, downstream of the support device.
      <br/>
      The condensate removal device can include, e.g., a removal channel with an associated doctor blade.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, or additionally, at least one suction device can also be provided.
      <br/>
      The region within the band loop can be expediently kept at ambient pressure, e.g., by a suitable vapor extraction system.
    </p>
    <p num="19">The heatable endless band can be guided over at least one band guiding roll and/or one tensioning roll.</p>
    <p num="20">
      In an expedient embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention, at least one heatable endless band having a hard and smooth surface may be simultaneously associated with a plurality of deflection controlled rolls, each having a soft or elastic surface.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the at least one heatable endless belt can form corresponding smoothing zones with each of the deflection controlled rolls.
    </p>
    <p num="21">If a plurality of smoothing zones are provided, then one surface of the material web can be placed in contact with a heatable endless band in at least one smoothing zone while the other surface of the material web can be placed in contact with a heatable endless band in at least one other smoothing zone.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="47">
      The particulars shown herein are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the embodiments of the present invention only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this regard, no attempt is made to show structural details of the present invention in more detail than is necessary for the fundamental understanding of the present invention, the description taken with the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how the several forms of the present invention may be embodied in practice.
    </p>
    <p num="48">FIG. 1 schematically illustrates a smoothing zone 10 of an apparatus 12 for smoothing a material web 14, e.g., a paper web or card web.</p>
    <p num="49">Smoothing zone 10 may be formed between a deflection adjustment (controlled) roll 16 having, e.g., an elastic jacket or elastic covering, and a recirculating endless band 18 with high thermal conductivity having a hard and smooth surface, e.g., a metal band.</p>
    <p num="50">
      In a region of smoothing zone 10, heatable endless band 18 may be guided over a support surface 20 of a fixed support element 22 of high stiffness, which is arranged to lie within the band loop.
      <br/>
      In the exemplary embodiment, support element 20 can be arranged directly above deflection adjustment roll 16 and can be of shoe-like design in its lower region with support surface 20.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Heatable endless band 18 may be guided over a plurality of band guiding rolls 24 and over a tensioning roll 26, which are arranged in an area outside of the generally vertically aligned support element 22.
      <br/>
      A heating device 28 can be arranged within the band loop formed by heatable endless band 18 such that the inner side or surface of recirculating heatable endless band 18 is acted on by a hot gaseous medium, e.g., steam, so that the endless band 18 is heated and so that a liquid film 30, which provides hydrodynamic lubrication, is formed between support surface 20 and endless band 18.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      As illustrated in FIG. 1, heating device 28 can be arranged upstream of support surface 20 in web running direction L. In the present case, heating device 28 may be provided between a lower web guide roll 24 (i.e., downstream of the smoothing zone) and the shoe-like lower section of support element 22.
      <br/>
      Moreover, heating device 28 may be, e.g., a steam moistener or a steam blowing box controlled zone-wise over the web width.
      <br/>
      In this manner, heatable endless band 18 can be acted on by hot gaseous medium or steam with zone control.
      <br/>
      Of course, the use of some other sectional injection device for a heated fluid is basically also conceivable.
    </p>
    <p num="53">To assist the formation of condensate, support element 22 can be cooled, e.g., at least in the region of support surface 20.</p>
    <p num="54">
      A condensate removal device 32 may be provided within the band loop of heatable endless band 18 and downstream of support surface 20 in the band travel direction L. Condensate removal device 32 can include, e.g., at least one removal channel with an associated doctor blade and/or at least one suction system.
      <br/>
      In the exemplary embodiment, the region within the band loop can be kept at environmental pressure by a suitable vapor extraction system.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      In FIG. 2, a schematic illustration of an embodiment of a smoothing apparatus including two heatable endless bands 18 of higher thermal conductivity each having a hard and smooth surface.
      <br/>
      The two heatable endless bands 18 can be simultaneously associated with a plurality, e.g., three, deflection adjustment rolls 16 having, e.g., elastic jackets or elastic coatings.
      <br/>
      In this manner, respective smoothing zones 10 can be formed between each of the deflection controlled rolls 16 and the heatable endless bands 18.
      <br/>
      In this exemplary arrangement, each of the two heatable endless bands 18 may be supported on their inner surfaces by at least one support element 22 in a region of smoothing zone 10.
      <br/>
      A respective heating device 28 may also be provided upstream of each support element 22 so that a hot gaseous medium or steam acts on the respective heatable endless band 18.
      <br/>
      In this way, endless band 18 can be heated in the region of smoothing zone 10, and a liquid film 30 which provides hydrodynamic lubrication can be built up between support surface 20 and endless band 18.
      <br/>
      Condensate removal device 32 (see FIG. 1) or the like can also be provided within the band loops.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      As shown in FIG. 2, three smoothing zones 10 may be vertically arranged one above the other, and two zone groups, which include the three vertically arranged smoothing zones, can be horizontally positioned alongside one another.
      <br/>
      In this arrangement, one heatable endless band 18 can be associated with the left-hand group of smoothing zones 10 and the other heatable endless band 18 can be associated with the other group of smoothing zones 10.
      <br/>
      In accordance with this exemplary arrangement, one surface or side of material web 14 can be in contact with the respective heatable endless band 18 of the first three vertically arranged smoothing zones 10, and the other surface of material web 14 can be in contact with the respective heatable endless band 18 associated with other three vertically arranged smoothing zones 10.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      As illustrated in FIG. 2, material web 14 may be guided around a lower web guiding roll 34, generally upwardly through the first three smoothing zones 10, over two upper web guiding rolls 36, then generally downwardly through the three last smoothing zones 10, and subsequently over a lower web guiding roll 38 at the right.
      <br/>
      The two heatable, recirculating endless bands 18 can be guided over web guiding rolls 24 and at least one tensioning roll.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      In the exemplary embodiment, a sectionally controllable and/or regulatable supply of heat can be supplied via heating devices 28, e.g., internal steam blowing boxes.
      <br/>
      Support surfaces 20 of support elements 22, which are provided in the band loops, can be hydrodynamically lubricated by the condensate of the relevant gaseous medium or steam.
      <br/>
      The desired smoothness process occurs at the surface of the web positioned against heatable endless band 18.
      <br/>
      Thus, in the embodiment of FIG. 2, after passing through the two zone groups with vertically arranged smoothing zones, each surface of the material web is smoothed.
