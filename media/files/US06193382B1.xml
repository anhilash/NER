    <p num="1">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/083,774 and 60/096,612 filed on May 1, 1988 and Aug. 14, 1998, respectively.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates generally to lighting devices.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention relates to lighting devices for temporarily providing light to appliances, such as thermostats, VCR's, telephone caller ID's and the like as well as to provide light to designated areas and for use as a portable light source.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Electrical and electronic appliances are often difficult to read and, therefore, to properly set and control.
      <br/>
      For example, thermostats for furnace and air conditioning units are typically placed in areas, such as in a corner of a room or in hallways, and which are often not well lighted.
      <br/>
      Thermostat controls are usually adjusted at night when natural lighting is not available.
      <br/>
      Thus, home owners often have a difficult time reading and adjusting thermostats.
      <br/>
      This problem is compounded for the elderly and to those having eyesight difficulties whom may need a flashlight, a match, a lighter or may need to light an adjoining space to make a thermostat reading and adjustment.
      <br/>
      The latter use of electrical energy, often involving 110 volts/100 watts or more, represents a high consumption of energy despite the world wide attempt to conserve electrical energy use.
      <br/>
      The lighting device of this invention provides an energy efficient means to momentarily illuminate a thermostat.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Various electrical appliances and/or controls for such appliances are used in households as well as in other settings.
      <br/>
      Often times, such appliances or controls require periodic monitoring or setting.
      <br/>
      For purposes of this patent application, a thermostat will be discussed and particularly, the lighting device of the present invention is constructed and arranged to provide a momentary light for a thermostat.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Despite the need for an economical, versatile, efficient and functional device to aid the reading and operation of electrical appliances, such as thermostats, none as far as is known has been commercialized.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,895,455 to Horning discloses a cover for a wall mounted thermostat having illumination and magnifying means, however, the components are mounted beneath the cover in the interior of the thermostat itself. U.S. Pat. No. 5,113,318 to Conley also discloses a thermostat light, however, the U-shaped device of this invention is bulky and limited in use with certain appliance designs. U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,615 to Nichols discloses a light attachment for a thermostat which includes a pivotally mounted telescoping arm.
      <br/>
      These prior art references disclose generally complex lighting devices which are limited in use and which are particularly difficult to adapt to existing thermostats.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It is an object of the present invention to provide a lighting device which is economical, efficient and constructed and arranged to be adapted on a variety of existing thermostat designs as well as other electrical and electronic appliances.
      <br/>
      The lighting device of the present invention provides a lighting unit which can be added to existing appliances or which can be incorporated into the original design and construction of the electrical or electric appliance to be illuminated.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      It is another object to provide lighting structures having slip-in lighting modules comprising the bulb, energy source and switch.
      <br/>
      The slip-in module body may be used for a variety of lighting device structures and enables the lighting devices to be easily assembled and serviced when necessary.
      <br/>
      It is another object to provide lighting structures having a hood or cover adapted to provide light onto predetermined areas of a thermostat, appliance or selected area and the cover is constructed and arranged to receive the lighting module which permits the bulb and battery, for example, to be easily replaced.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      It is another object to provide light unit structures integral with an annular cover or housing adapted to fit onto thermostats or other structures.
      <br/>
      Light unit structures are also provided for placement onto flat, round or any contoured surfaces of an appliance, for example, and having means for securing the lighting structure onto such surfaces of thermostats and other appliances.
      <br/>
      Removable light structures are also provided for use in emergency lighting situations when electrical power is disrupted, for example.
      <br/>
      Further, light structures are provided to be adapted for mounting on a door plate to illuminate the door entry and door handle areas.
      <br/>
      Other lighting structures are designed for multiple use, such as for various thermostat designs, emergency use, and mounting to locations, such as doors.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The lighting device of the present invention is comprised of a self contained base and hood structure which is mountable to an existing electrical appliance or which can be incorporated into the design and construction of the electrical appliance itself.
      <br/>
      When used with a thermostat, for example, the lighting device may be mounted onto the top of the thermostat cover or housing or it may be manufactured and sold as a device with a decorative thermostat cover and wherein the original thermostat ring is replaced by the decorative cover with integral lighting device, or wherein the decorative cover with light unit is mounted over an existing thermostat or similar appliance.
      <br/>
      The lighting devices may also be used in other applications as will be further described.
    </p>
    <p num="10">

      <br/>
      The cover has a forward extending hood area which is adapted to direct the light from the light bulb to the area to be illuminated.
      <br/>
      The cover has an aperture or slot through which the switch is accessible for operation.
      <br/>
      The base structure contains a lighting module comprised of various components including, for example, a light bulb, a battery or batteries, a switch and a conductive connector member structure which communicate between these components.
      <br/>
      The base structure preferably slips into the cover and, preferably, is frictionally held therein.
      <br/>
      The base structure of the lighting device is constructed and arranged in a unique manner which provides an economical means to securely and effectively hold and interconnect these components in a unitary and self contained manner.
      <br/>
      The cover structure of the invention may also have various structures and designs including depending ring-like members whereby the cover is provided with means to frictionally receive the lighting module and the ring-like member is adapted to be mounted over appliances such as thermostats and door plates, for example.
      <br/>
      The cover structures may be decorative and adapted to receive informational or advertising materials.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="14">
      The present invention relates to lighting devices for providing momentary lighting to specified areas, such as electrical and electronic appliances as well as other areas requiring illumination.
      <br/>
      The lighting devices of this invention are useful for those users having difficulty reading an appliance, such as a thermostat, for example.
      <br/>
      Thermostats are typically placed in dark areas such as hallways, which make them difficult to read and operate and particularly for the elderly or those having visual impairment.
      <br/>
      Although the lighting devices will be primarily discussed with respect to thermostats to control furnaces and air conditioning units, the lighting devices are also useful with other electric and electronic appliances such as VCR's, telephone caller ID's and the like as well as other areas.
      <br/>
      The teachings of this invention are also applicable to lighting devices that may be removable or used with or incorporated into other apparatus, for example, used to illuminate any desired location or area.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 1 is a front view of lighting device 10 shown mounted on top of thermostat 21.
      <br/>
      The thermostat 21 shown is a digital, programmable thermostat sold by Honeywell and which has a heat/cool setting 22 on its backplate as well as a fan setting 23.
      <br/>
      Thermostat 21 has a cover ring 24 which is generally not easily removed from the thermostat structure.
      <br/>
      The lighting device 10 is shown mounted to the top of the existing thermostat ring 24.
      <br/>
      The device 10 has a hood 30 which has a body design that does not impede the flow of air through the air channels of the thermostat 21.
      <br/>
      Hood 30 is further shown having a switch 14 extending through aperture 31.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The lighting device 10 is a compact self contained and adaptable unit.
      <br/>
      The lighting device 10 has an internal lighting structure beneath hood 30.
      <br/>
      The internal lighting structure comprised of a base structure, a light bulb, power means, such as batteries, and a switch mechanism.
      <br/>
      The internal lighting structure may have various embodiments as will be described.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      FIG. 2 is a front view showing the base structure 28 of lighting device 10 mounted on ring portion 37 which, as a unit with the lighting device 10 is adapted to surround a thermostat.
      <br/>
      The ring portion 37 is a replaceable ring for mounting on a thermostat and it is provided with a recessed inner ring 38.
      <br/>
      A conductive connector member 33 is mounted in the base structure 28 and the light bulb 29 extends outwardly through the front opening 35.
      <br/>
      A switch 14 extends upwardly from the conductive connector member 33.
      <br/>
      The conductive connector member 33 is secured within slot 36 and extends rearward and covers aperture 34 within base structure 28 wherein a battery is placed.
      <br/>
      The light bulb 29 is threaded into a socket area 45 of the conductive connector member 33 and extends above and outward from the ring 37.
      <br/>
      Contact by the conductive connector member 33 to the battery by means of pushing down the switch 14 completes the electrical circuit and causes light bulb 29 to illuminate.
      <br/>
      The light bulb 29 is positioned within the hood 30 so that when the switch 14 is activated, the readout and control areas of a thermostat are illuminated.
      <br/>
      Although various switches may be used within the purview of this invention, it is preferred that a momentary, hold down switch 14 be used.
      <br/>
      Thus, when illumination is desired, the switch 14 is merely pressed down and when the switch 14 is released, the light device is again in the off position.
      <br/>
      The momentary, hold down switch conserves both battery and bulb life by preventing the inadvertent continuous activation of the light device.
    </p>
    <p num="18">

Upon securing the cover 30 to base 28, the lips 40 and 41 align and cover the sides of ridges 42 and 43 for aesthetic purposes.
      <br/>
      Aperture 39 in cover 30 allows a fastener, such as a screw or the like, to secure cover 30 to base structure 28.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3B is a top view of cover 30 having a rear indented area 49 and an aperture 31 for switch 14.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      FIGS. 4A and 4B show base structure 28 which preferably is constructed of a nonconductive molded plastic material, i.e., urethane or the like.
      <br/>
      The base structure 28 may be injection molded and is shown to have various apertures, an internal cavity and aligned slots.
      <br/>
      The bottom 56 of the base 28 has a predetermined shape to mate with the appliance surface on which the lighting device is mounted, i.e., flat or contoured.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4A shows the base structure 28 having top aperture 34, front opening 35 and slot 36 which extends from the edges of the opening 35 and into the bottom of the base structure 28.

      <br/>
      FIG. 4B shows the opposing snap ridges or lips 42 and 43 of the base structure 28 and which secure base structure 28 of the light unit to thermostat cover ring 37.
      <br/>
      The base structure 28 is constructed to fit into the rear of the cover 30.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 5 shows an embodiment 15 of the internal lighting structure.
      <br/>
      The conductive connector member 33 provides the structural support and connection between the bulb 29, battery 44, and switch 14 and is shown to have a generally L-shaped configuration having legs 54 and 55.
      <br/>
      The switch 14 is shown attached by a fastener 47, such as a screw, to leg 55 of conductive connector 33.
      <br/>
      The light bulb 29 is shown screwed into internally threaded socket area 45 on the adjoining leg 54 of conductive connector strip 33 to expose bulb contact end 46.
      <br/>
      A battery 44 is also shown and which is placed within the cavity of base structure 28.
      <br/>
      Upon placement of these components within base structure 28, the light bulb 29 is threaded through socket area 45 to secure the battery 44 within the cavity of base structure 28.
      <br/>
      The downward movement of switch 14 contacts the conductive side of battery 44 which completes the circuit causing light bulb 29 to illuminate.
      <br/>
      The release of switch 14 opens the circuit as a result of the inherent spring-like properties of the conductive connector strip 33.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, conductive connector member 33(a) is shown extending from the rear of the battery and to below the switch 14.
      <br/>
      The conductive connector member 33(a) may be used if the battery 44 has a non-conductive side wall.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The light bulb 29 used in the internal lighting structure is preferably a premium grade 2.25 volt, 0.25 amp bulb although other bulb specifications may be utilized within the purview of this invention depending upon the battery type.
      <br/>
      The battery 44 may be any suitable battery or batteries, for example a 3 volt, 750 ma lithium battery and the conductive connector members 33 and 33(a) are preferably phosphorous bronze strips having a thickness range of approximately 0.006 to 0.014 inches and having a width of approximately 0.5 inches.
      <br/>
      The conductive connector strip 33 is bent into a predetermined L-shape which is secured into the slots of the base 28 and communicates with the battery 44 and bulb 29.
      <br/>
      The phosphorous bronze members 33 and 33(a) have been found to provide the proper electrical conductivity, physical strength, flexibility, and resilience required for use in the lighting device 10.
      <br/>
      However, as known by those skilled in the art, other bulb types, batteries, i.e., batteries in series, and conductive members may be used within the purview of this invention.

    <p num="22">
      FIG. 6 shows base structure 28 mounted to ring 37 which is constructed and arranged as a replacement cover ring for use on circular thermostats.
      <br/>
      Base member 28 is shown mounted to ring 37, however, as will be further described, various methods and structures may be used to mount the light unit 10 to a thermostat.
      <br/>
      Essentially, the method and structure is dependent upon whether the light device 10 is an aftermarket item, whether it is incorporated with a replacement thermostat ring structure and whether the ring of the thermostat is removable.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 shows the front ridge 43 and rear ridge 42 snapped over the thermostat ring 37.
      <br/>
      The bottom 56 of base structure 28 is shown having the contour of thermostat ring 37.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="23">
      FIG. 7 shows cover 30 over base structure 28 by threaded fastener 32 and the lighting device 10 mounted to thermostat ring 24 of a thermostat.
      <br/>
      The thermostat ring 24 is part of the thermostat and thus, light device 10 is mounted to thermostat ring 24 of the thermostat.
      <br/>
      The cover 30 is shown to have a forward sloping hood portion as defined by front edge 52.
      <br/>
      Further, a rearward sloping edge 53 extends downwardly toward the thermostat ring 24.
      <br/>
      This forward hood of cover 30 configuration in conjunction with a reflective interior surface of the cover, for example, directs light toward the front of the thermostat for reading and control purposes.
      <br/>
      The curvature of the hood of cover 30 provides a reflective light for illuminating the reading and control area of the thermostat.
      <br/>
      As shown, the cover 30 is curved along its length as well as in the direction perpendicular to its length.
      <br/>
      The curved forward end of the hood may be hemispherical in shape having a diameter of approximately 0.75 inches, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Although the lighting device of the present invention has been shown and described for use with circular cover ring having a curved periphery, the lighting device may also be used on flat or other contoured surfaces or structures.
      <br/>
