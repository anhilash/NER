      <br/>
      A intravenous catheter device having a biased spring hard needle, disposed in a soft catheter.
      <br/>
      The biased spring hard needle is held within an elongated hollow barrel wherein the biased spring hard needle is extended past the first end of the soft catheter, and is further disposed in the inside of the soft catheter and further extends past the first end of the elongated hollow barrel wherein the biased spring hard needle is pulled into an almost straight line wherein the second end of the biased spring hard needle is fixed to an end cap at the second end of the elongated hollow barrel.
      <br/>
      The biased spring hard needle is held within the soft catheter and the elongated hollow barrel by an inclined plane latching device.
      <br/>
      When the inclined plane latching device is disengaged with the biased spring hard needle, the spring section of the biased spring hard needle that is near the second end of the biased spring hard needle instantly withdraws the first end of the biased spring hard needle out of the soft catheter and further withdraws the first end of the biased spring hard needle out of the first end of the elongated hollow barrel wherein the first end of the biased spring hard needle cannot accidentally prick or injure a person thereby preventing an accidental injection of bacteria, virus or other undesirable material into a person.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      There are several types of safety intravenous catheter designs.
      <br/>
      Most of the designs are similar to syringes or blood sampling devices that are available today.
      <br/>
      One such design is shown in a patent issued to JAGGER et al on Jun. 3, 1986 U.S. Pat. No. 4,592,744. This is a safety blood sampling device however it requires two (2) hands to operate or to cover the needle cannula.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Blood samples are also taken with syringes and there are also many safety syringes available.
      <br/>
      Some of these designs have a sleeve or sheath that will cover the needle after it has been used.
      <br/>

      Other designs have a retractable needle such as WELTMAN U.S. Pat. No. 3,306,290, and DENT U.S. Pat. No. 4,392,859. These designs do not have a means whereby the needle is extended from the syringe and held in place in a positive and rigid position in order to first inject the needle prior to injecting the medication.
      <br/>
      Still other designs have methods of bending to render the needle harmless after the medication has been injected.
      <br/>
      Most of these designs have one major purpose and that is to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as aids, hepatitis, or other diseases from an accidental injection with a contaminated needle into others after the needle of the syringe was inserted into a patient with the above mentioned disease.
      <br/>
      These various designs all work well to a degree, but they all fall short of their intended purpose during the act of covering the needle, or removing the needle, which requires two hands.

    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="7">It is the object of this invention to provide an intravenous catheter device with a fail safe latch and release means wherein the latch and release means will not cause the needle to retract in the event of a shock due to dropping the packaged IV catheter.</p>
    <p num="8">Another object of the present invention is to render the needle of the intravenous catheter device useless after the needle is retracted into the flashback chamber of the intravenous catheter device to prevent the accidental reuse of the contaminated needle or to further prevent the reuse and abuse by users of illicit drugs.</p>
    <p num="9">It is still another object of the present invention to further prevent the accidental release of the needle cannula after the needle is in the flashback chamber of the intravenous catheter device.</p>
    <p num="10">The foregoing and other objects and advantages are attained by a device, an elongated hollow barrel, a spring needle, hub post and an end cap in combination with a failsafe latch and release means wherein when said intravenous catheter is used to inject a soft needle cannula into a vein in the body or part of the body in order to inject medication or other fluid at a consistent rate into the body, the fail safe latch and release means releases the biased spring needle cannula and further pulls the spring needle cannula into the flash back chamber of the intravenous catheter device rendering the contaminated spring needle cannula harmless to prevent the accidental pricking of others and to prevent a contaminated spring needle cannula from being released from the flash back chamber of the intravenous catheter device.</p>
    <p num="11">The features of the present invention can be best understood together with further objects and advantages by reference to the following descriptions taken in connection with accompanying drawings, wherein like numerals indicate like parts.</p>

      <br/>
      The first end of the biased spring hard needle 3 is being withdrawn from the soft catheter 4 leaving the soft catheter 4 in the body 21.
      <br/>
      The second end of the hub post 6 is shown as tapered to prevent it from catching a corner of the latch foundation 7.
      <br/>
      Only the second end of the biased spring hard needle 3 is fixed to the second end of the flash back chamber 2 by way of the end cap 10 and end bar 11.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Referring to FIG. 7 there is shown a section elevation of the device 1 with the biased spring hard needle 3 retracted.</p>

      The biased spring hard needle 3 is no longer biased; the second end has formed into a coil 34 and is permanently pulling or holding the first end of the biased spring hard needle 3 inside of the flash back chamber 2.
      <br/>
      The coil 34 is also causing the biased spring hard needle 3 to rest at an angle within the flash back chamber 2 thereby preventing the point 35 at the first end of the biased spring hard needle 3 from re-entering the flange hole 26 formed in the flash back chamber flange 25.
    </p>
    <p num="37">The soft catheter 4 is shown left in the body 21 where it will be suitably attached or fixed to other devices.</p>
    <p num="38">Referring to FIG. 8 there is shown a view of the end cap 10 of the device 1.</p>
    <p num="39">

    <p num="41">
      The second end of the biased spring hard needle 3 is formed into a loop 37 wherein the entire loop 37 is disposed or could be disposed in the cap hole 24.
      <br/>
      The end cap 10 is suitably fixed to the second end of the flash back chamber 2 by adhesive, threads, rivets, or welding or other suitable means by design choice.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Although the system described in detail supra has been found to be most satisfactory and preferred, many variations are possible.
      <br/>
      For example the second end of the soft catheter may be provided with valves to suitably stop the flow of blood while other devices are being attached or removed from the soft catheter, or the latch means could be placed in another location.
