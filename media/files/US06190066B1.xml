      A printing device produces printed pieces of paper having no blank areas, and which can precisely position print content on the back side of continuous printing paper.
      <br/>
      A mark is provided in a blank area on the back side of printing paper.
      <br/>
      A sensor senses the mark, whereby the position of a regular-form print area adjacent to the blank area on the printing paper can be recognized.
      <br/>
      A thermal head and a cutter respectively print the printing paper and cut off the blank area based on the sense output.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is possible to produce a printed piece of paper having a desired print on the front side and a regular-form print on the back side without positional misalignment and without blank in the feed direction, with the mark removed therefrom.

    <p num="4">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      FIG. 20 is a conceptual diagram showing a mechanism 100 of a conventional printing device (a heat transfer printer device).
      <br/>
      In FIG. 20, 1 denotes a thermal head, 2 denotes an ink sheet coated with thermo-dissolving ink or thermo-sublimating ink for heat transfer recording, 3 denotes printing paper, 4 denotes a platen roller for transferring the sheet of printing paper 3 while pressing the sheets in close contact with each other against the thermal head 1, 5 denotes pinch rollers for transferring the printing paper 3 while gripping the paper, 6 denotes a cutter for cutting the roll-type printing paper 3, and 7 denotes a reflection-type optical sensor for sensing the front end position of the printing paper 3.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      FIG. 21 is a conceptual diagram showing the conventional thermal head 1.
      <br/>
      The effective heating width W1 of the thermal head 1 is shorter than the paper width W2 of the printing paper 3.
      <br/>
      FIG. 22 is a diagram showing the front side of a printed piece of paper 300 produced in the conventional system.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The conventional printing device operates as described below.
      <br/>
      Initially, suppose that the cutter 6 has cut the printing paper 3.
      <br/>
      The pinch rollers 5 transfer the printing paper 3 in the paper-supply direction.
      <br/>
      In the feed direction in which the printing paper is sent, the direction from the printing paper supplying side to the printed paper discharge side is referred to as a paper-discharge direction and the opposite direction is referred to as the paper-supply direction.
      <br/>
      The sensor 7 senses the front end 31 of the printing paper 3.
      <br/>
      The pinch rollers 5 position the front end 31 at the position of the pinch rollers 5 based on the information about the position of the front end 31 sensed by the sensor 7.
      <br/>
      Next, a desired image 30 is printed.
      <br/>
      Then, the pinch rollers 5 transfer the printing paper 3 in the paper-discharge direction and position the rear end 32 at the position of the cutter 6 such that a blank 34 is left.
      <br/>
      Then the cutter 6 cuts the printing paper 3.
      <br/>
      In the conventional system, the positioning of the printing paper 3 is thus obtained on the basis of the positional information about the front end 31 of the printing paper 3.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The conventional heat transfer printer device has the following problems.
      <br/>
      Since the effective heating width W1 of the thermal head 1 is shorter than the width W2 of the printing paper 3 as shown in FIG. 21, the printed piece of paper 300 has blanks 35 in its width direction, as shown in FIG. 22. Further, since the conventional heat transfer printer device operates as described above, blanks are left in the feed direction on the printed piece of paper 300, as shown in FIG. 22. More specifically, the printed paper has a gripping blank 33 having the width L from a pinch rollers 5 to the thermal head 1 and a margin blank 34 for preventing the image 30 from being cut.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Further, the positioning of the printing paper 3 is obtained on the basis of the information about the position of the front end 31 and not on the basis of contents on the back side of the printing paper 3.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the conventional heat transfer printer cannot be applied to printing that requires that contents on the front side of the printed paper 300 should be positioned in correspondence with contents on the back side, as in the case of picture postcards.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      A first aspect of the present invention is directed to a printing device for use with a continuous sheet of printing paper, wherein the front side of the printing paper is a printing surface on which a desired print is printed, and the back side thereof is an already printed surface in which regular-form print areas printed with a given print are intermittently provided with blank areas interposed therebetween, with positional references provided in the blank areas.

      FIG. 4 is a diagram showing the front side of the printing paper 3a and FIG. 5 is a diagram showing its back side.
      <br/>
      The front side of the printing paper 3a forms the printing surface on which desired print is produced, which is empty without any figure, for example.

      <br/>
      The printed piece of paper 300a has a desired print on the front side and a print of a postcard surface on the back side.
      <br/>
      The parts 311 and 312 are prints left on the piece of paper 310 as cutting margins for the cutter 6.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Next, operation of the printing device in the first preferred embodiment will be described referring to FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 8 to FIG. 10. In the operation of the printing device in the first preferred embodiment, FIG. 8 provides a flow chart showing operation in initialization based on control by the CPU 28 etc., and FIG. 9 provides a flow chart showing operation for producing a printed piece of paper based on the control by the CPU 28 etc.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 shows dimensions in the printing paper 3a.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 10, L3 shows the length of the cutting margin shown in FIG. 6 in the feed direction, L4 shows the length between the cut positions C1 and C2 minus L3, L2 shows the length of the print, and other characters correspond to those in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      First, referring to FIG. 8, the operation for initialization of the printing device will be described.
      <br/>
      The printing paper 3a is set in the printing device (Step S101) and the initialization starts (Step S102).
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Next, in Steps S103 to S110, the cutter 6 cuts the paper at the cut position C2.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the pinch rollers 5 transfer the printing paper 3a to bring the mark 36 located on the front end side of the printing paper 3a closer to the sensor 7 (Step S103).
      <br/>
      When the sensor 7 senses the mark 36 on the printing paper 3a (Step S104), the pinch rollers 5 temporarily stop transferring (Step S105).
      <br/>
      At this moment, the mark 36 is positioned at the sensor 7.
      <br/>
      The sensor 7 radiates light and receives the reflected light to sense the mark 36 or the front end of the printing paper 3a.
      <br/>
      The CPU 28 reads a previously set amount of transfer (here, the difference between L1 and L6) and sets it in the mechanical controller 27 (Step S106).
      <br/>
      Note that L1 is longer than L6.
      <br/>
      Next, the pinch rollers 5 transfer the printing paper 3a in the paper-supply direction (Step S107).
      <br/>
      When the pinch rollers 5 have transferred the printing paper 3a in the distance set in the mechanical controller 27 (Step S108), they then stop transferring (Step S109).
      <br/>
      At this moment, the cut position C2 is located at the cutter 6.
      <br/>
      The cutter 6 cuts the printing paper 3a (Step S110).
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      After the initialization of the printing device, a printed piece of paper is produced.
      <br/>
      First, referring to FIG. 9, in Steps S201 to S205, a desired print is made on the front side of the printing paper 3a.
      <br/>
      In more detail, the pinch rollers 5 transfer the printing paper 3a in the paper-supply direction (Step S201).
      <br/>
      When the sensor 7 senses the cut position C2 at the front end of the printing paper 3a (Step S202), the CPU 28 outputs a printing command.
      <br/>
      At this time, the CPU 28 outputs the printing command to the memory controller 24 and the mechanical controller 27 (Step S203).
      <br/>
      In response, the pinch rollers 5 start transferring the printing paper 3a in the paper-discharge direction.
      <br/>
      Correspondingly, the thermal head 1a starts heat transfer on the basis of the picture data provided from the frame memory 25 through the memory controller 24 and the transfer circuit 26 (Step S204).
      <br/>
      The pinch rollers 5 move the printing paper 3a for the length L2 in the paper-discharge direction, and a desired print is produced in the length L2 (Step S205).
      <br/>
      Desired print is produced on the front side of the printing paper 3a in this way.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Since the front end of the printing paper 3a is moved back to the position of the sensor 7 in Steps S201 to S202, the length of the piece of paper 310 shown in FIG. 6 in the feed direction can be shorter.
      <br/>
      Thus, the front end of the printing paper 3a is sensed in Step S202 not for the purpose of positioning the contents on the front side in correspondence with the contents on the back side.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      In Steps S206 to S210, the cutter 6 cuts the paper at the cut position C1.
      <br/>
      In more detail, the CPU 28 reads a previously set amount of transfer and sets it in the mechanical controller 27 (Step S206).
      <br/>
      Next, the pinch rollers 5 transfer the printing paper 3a in the paper-supply direction (Step S207).
      <br/>
      The pinch rollers 5 transfer the printing paper 3a for the amount of transfer set by the CPU 28 (Step S208) and then stops transferring (Step S209).
      <br/>
      At this time, the cut position C1 is positioned at the cutter 6.
      <br/>
      The cutter 6 cuts the printing paper 3a (Step S210).
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The amount of transfer is set in Step S206 as follows.
      <br/>
      At the time when the processing in Step S205 is finished, the front end of the desired print is protruding over the cutter 6 in the paper-discharge direction and the rear end of the desired print is located at the thermal head 1a.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, to position the cut position C1 at the cutter 6, the printing paper 3a is first moved in the paper-supply direction for the length of the protrusion over the cutter 6, i.e., for (L2-L5), and is next moved in the paper-discharge direction for L3.
      <br/>
      That is to say, the amount of transfer, L7, in Step S206 is L2-L5+L3.
    </p>
    <p num="52">Next, similarly to the operation in Steps S103 to S110, the paper is cut at the cut position C2 by the cutter 6.</p>
    <p num="53">As described above, the sensor 7 senses the mark 36 on the printing paper 3a, and the CPU 28 etc. control the thermal head 1a and the cutter 6 on the basis of the sense output from the sensor 7 so that the thermal head 1a applies heat transfer printing on the front side of the printing paper 3a corresponding to the regular-form print area 37 and the cutter 6 cuts off the blank area 38 from the printing paper 3a, whereby the printing device produces the printed piece of paper shown in FIG. 6 and FIG. 7.</p>
    <p num="54">The first preferred embodiment provides the following effects.</p>
    <p num="55">As shown in FIG. 6, since the printed piece 300a does not have the blank 33, the blank 34, and the blanks 35 shown in FIG. 22, it looks very much like a frameless photograph.</p>
    <p num="56">It is possible to produce a desired print on the front side of the printing paper 3a with accurate positioning to the regular-form print area 37 on the back side of the printing paper 3a.</p>
    <p num="57">When a postcard surface is printed on the back side, it is possible to produce a card very similar to a picture postcard printed with a frameless photograph on the front side.</p>
    <p num="58">Since the mark 36 is formed in the blank area 38, the mark 36 is not left on the produced printed piece 300a.</p>

      In the fourth preferred embodiment, the printing device performs the following operation instead of Steps S206 to S209.
      <br/>
      That is to say, the pinch rollers 5 transfer the printing paper 3a in the paper-supply direction.

      In the first preferred embodiment, the margin length L3 for preventing formation of blank in the feed direction on the front side of the printed piece 300a is set long.
      <br/>

      In the first and second preferred embodiments, the front end of the printing paper cannot be used as a positional reference, since it is necessary to register contents on the front side and contents on the back side.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, since it is not necessary in the third preferred embodiment to position the contents on the front side to the contents on the back side, the front end of the printing paper may be used as the positional reference.
    </p>
    <p num="87">Although the third preferred embodiment uses a continuous, roll-type sheet of printing paper having a sequence of areas for desired printing, pieces of cut-type (single-piece type) printing paper having separated printing areas may be used instead.</p>
