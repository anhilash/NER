    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to methods of making intermediate oxidation products, such as acids, ketones, alcohols, hydroperoxides, for example, and in general organic compounds different than carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by oxidizing a hydrocarbon with a gas containing an oxidant, preferably oxygen.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      There is a plethora of references (both patents and literature articles) dealing with the formation of intermediate oxidation products, one of the most important being adipic acid.
      <br/>
      Adipic acid is used to produce Nylon 66 fibers and resins, polyesters, polyurethanes, and miscellaneous other compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      There are different processes of manufacturing adipic acid.
      <br/>
      The conventional process involves a first step of oxidizing cyclohexane with oxygen to a mixture of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol (KA mixture), and then oxidation of the KA mixture with nitric acid to adipic acid.
      <br/>
      Other processes include, among others, the "Hydroperoxide Process," the "Boric Acid Process," and the "Direct Synthesis Process," which involves direct oxidation of cyclohexane to adipic acid with oxygen in the presence of solvents, catalysts, and promoters.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The Direct Synthesis Process has been given attention for a long time.
      <br/>
      However, to this date it has found little commercial success.
      <br/>
      One of the reasons is that although it looks very simple at first glance, it is extremely complex in reality.
      <br/>
      Due to this complexity, one can find strikingly conflicting results, comments, and views in different references.
    </p>
    <p num="6">It is important to note that most, if not all, studies on the Direct Synthesis Process have been conducted in a batch mode, literally or for all practical purposes.</p>

    <p num="54">
      The reader's understanding of this invention will be enhanced by reference to the following detailed description taken in combination with the drawing figure, wherein:
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 illustrates schematically a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="55">As mentioned earlier, this invention relates to methods of making intermediate oxidation products, such as acids, for example, by oxidizing a hydrocarbon with a gas containing an oxidant, preferably oxygen.</p>
    <p num="56">
      The reaction rate in an oxidation such as for example the direct oxidation of cyclohexane to adipic acid, is very important for a number of reasons, among which productivity is of major significance.
      <br/>
      High productivity may be also compromised with lower temperatures, which usually result in better selectivity and yield.
      <br/>
      Since in a process productivity has usually to be compromised with selectivity and yield, a predetermined optimal solution has to be found, depending on each particular occasion.
      <br/>
      Thus, control of the reaction rate during an oxidation is of utmost importance.
    </p>
    <p num="57">According to this invention, pressure drop rate monitoring and control, achieves a fast and easy way to control the reaction rate within desirable predetermined limits.</p>
    <p num="58">To measure the pressure drop rate, a number of different techniques may be used, among which the most preferred ones are:</p>
    <p num="59">
      after the reaction chamber is pressurized, the feeding and exiting of gases is stopped temporarily. and the time for the initial pressure (first pressure) to drop to a second predetermined pressure level is measured; and
      <br/>
      after the reaction chamber is pressurized to a first pressure, the feeding and exiting of gases is stopped and a second pressure attained in predetermined period of time is measured.
    </p>
    <p num="60">The above measurements and operations may be made in a continuous basis, or a sporadic basis, or in any desirable predetermined pattern.</p>
    <p num="61">
      A preferred embodiment of this invention is illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, there is depicted a device or continuous reactor system 10 comprising a reaction chamber 12.
      <br/>
      The reaction chamber 12 may be any type of reaction chamber, according to the instant invention.
      <br/>

      The predominantly non-gas outlet line 21 leads to a material management station 30, at which the products of reaction, any by-products, non-converted raw materials, etc., are separated by well known to the art techniques.

      The desired product of reaction follows product path 32, the non-recyclable by-products follow non-recyclables path 34, while recyclable materials follow recyclables line 36, which line 36 leads to an analytical apparatus 38 for analysis of the contents of the recyclables.
      <br/>
      The analytical apparatus 38 samples and analyzes the recyclables before they enter line 36ii.
      <br/>
      Line 36 may comprise one or a plurality of lines, depending of the nature of the recyclables.
      <br/>
      Some of these lines may even circumvent the analytical apparatus 38, if so desired (if for example the content of the recyclable material under consideration is known or previously determined by any of well known to the art techniques).

      Flow regulation valves 50, 52, 54, 56, and 58 are connected to inlet lines 50i, 52i, 54i, 56i, and 58i, which provide hydrocarbon, solvent, catalyst, promoter, and other adjuncts, respectively, to a pre-mixing vessel 48.
      <br/>
      The premixing vessel 48 is preferably of small size and positioned in a way that all its contents are moving out of it and through line 16, so that if more than one phase is present, there is no accumulation of a particular phase in the pre-mixing vessel.
      <br/>
      Pre-mixing vessel 48 is connected with a second heat exchanger (including cooler or heater or the like) 60, which in turn is connected to the reaction chamber 12.
      <br/>
      The inlet lines 50i, 52i, 54i, 56i, and 58i, may however be directly connected to the second heat exchanger 60 or to the reaction chamber 12.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      The inlet lines 50i, 52i, 54i, 56i, and 58I may be heated separately with their own individual heaters (not shown for purposes of clarity), which heaters are preferably controlled by controller 28.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, formation of two phases may be avoided in premixing vessel 48.
      <br/>
      The heater 60 may then be omitted or it may be used for fine tuning of the final temperature.

    <p num="71">
      Flow regulation valves 50, 52, 54, 56, and 58 are controlled by the computerized controller 28 through output lines 50", 52", 54", 56", and 58", respectively.
      <br/>
      A number of flowmeters (not shown for purposes of clarity) connected to lines 50i, 52i, 54i, 56i, and 58i, provide flow information regarding hydrocarbon, solvent, catalyst, promoter, and other adjuncts, to the computerized controller 28 through multiple input line 62.
    </p>
    <p num="72">The reaction chamber 12 may be heated or cooled by heating or cooling means (not shown) well known to the art.</p>
    <p num="73">The lines 14 and 16 may merge together into a single line (not shown), and feed the reaction chamber through said single line.</p>
    <p num="74">
      In operation of this embodiment, hydrocarbon, solvent, catalyst, promoter and any other desired adjuncts are added to the pre-mixing vessel 48, where they are mixed together.
      <br/>
      The pre-mixing vessel is small enough and positioned in a manner that if there is phase separation, no particular phase remains behind, but all phases are commingled and they proceed through the second heat exchanger 60 and to the reaction chamber 12 through line 16.
      <br/>
      The feed rates of the new raw materials fed through lines 50i, 52i. 54i, 56i, and 58i depend on the feed rates of the recyclables fed to the reaction chamber 12 through recycle feeding line 14.
      <br/>
      Information regarding the analytical results from the analytical apparatus 38 is provided to the computerized controller 28, which combines this information with the information from the flowmeter 46 and the information from the flowmeters (not shown) of lines 50i, 52i, 54i, 56i, and 58i, and calculates the total feed rate of each individual ingredient entering the reaction chamber 12.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The computerized controller preferably gives precedence to the recyclables, and then it adjusts each of the valves 50, 52, 54, 56, and 58 through output lines 50", 52", 54", 56", and 58", respectively, in a manner that the total feed rate of each individual ingredient entering the reaction chamber 12 has a desired value.
      <br/>
      The desired value of each ingredient feed rate is preferably adjusted toward a desired range of values of pressure drop, as it will be discussed later.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Of course, when the operation starts, there are no recyclable materials, so that only new raw materials start entering the system through one or more of lines 50i, 52i, 54i, 56i, and 58i, and finally enter the reaction chamber 12 through line 16.
      <br/>
      During starting the operation, the different feed rates of new raw materials are arranged so that the pressure drop rate falls within the predetermined range.
      <br/>
      An initiation period, before the reaction starts, has to be taken into account.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the reaction is driven toward formation of a single phase, as described for example in our co-pending patent application, of Mark W. Dassel, Eustathios Vassiliou, David C. DeCoster, Ader M. Rostami, and Sharon M. Aldrich, titled "Methods and Devices for Controlling the Reaction Rate of a Hydrocarbon to an Acid by Making Phase-related Adjustments," filed on Mar. 6, 1997, having Ser.

      No. 08/812,847, which is incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      The balance of materials is also preferably arranged to be such that when water starts being formed during the oxidation, no second phase is formed.
      <br/>
      This, however is not necessary for the practice of the instant invention.
      <br/>
      The amount of water formed depends on the conversion taking place when the system attains a steady state.
      <br/>
      The more solvent, acetic acid for example, is present at this steady state, the more water may be withstood by the system without formation of a second phase.
      <br/>
      Since the formation of water is substantially unavoidable when a hydrocarbon is oxidized, and in some respects its presence may even be desirable (for at least partial hydrolysis of undesirable ester by-products, for example), it is preferable to work at a steady state which can contain at least a predetermined content of water without the formation of a second phase.
      <br/>
      Removal of water in any step of the process, if necessary or desired, may be achieved by a number of ways, including for example distillation, addition of acid anhydrides, and other well known to the art methods.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      The more hydrocarbon, cyclohexane for example, is present in the reaction chamber the higher the potential of formation of a second phase.
      <br/>
      At the same time, if too little hydrocarbon is present, the reaction starts starving from lack of hydrocarbon.
      <br/>
      According to the instant invention, the amount of hydrocarbon present in the steady state is preferably just above the point at which starvation is observed. "Just above" starvation means preferably between 0% to 20% above starvation, and more preferably 5% to 20% above starvation.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      At the same time that the above mentioned ingredients enter the reaction chamber 12, a gas containing an oxidant, preferably oxygen, enter the reaction chamber through the gaseous oxidant feeding line 18, and it comes in contact with the mixture containing the hydrocarbon.
      <br/>
      Oxidant may be recirculated in the system for better sparging.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that the oxidant for recirculation is obtained at a point before valve 74 (between valve 74 and the reaction chamber 12).
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      The reaction temperature or first temperature is monitored by one or more thermocouples, such as thermocouples 22 for example, which provides temperature information to the controller 28.
      <br/>
      The pressure in the reaction chamber 12 is monitored by the pressure gauge or transducer 68, which provides pressure information the computerized controller 28 through input line 68'.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      The computerized controller 28, based on this temperature information adjusts the first and second heat exchangers through output lines 44' and 60', respectively, in a manner that in combination with the heat released by the reaction, and the thermal characteristics of the reaction chamber 12, the temperature attains and maintains a desired value.
      <br/>
      In order to lower the temperature in the reaction chamber, the heat exchangers are adjusted to lower the temperatures in lines 14 and 16.
      <br/>
      In addition to or instead of this, the reaction chamber itself may be provided with heating and/or cooling means (not shown for purposes of clarity, but well known to the art), controlled by the computerized controller 28, so that the temperature attains and maintains the desired value.
      <br/>
      The desired value may, of course, be a desired range of values.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      When the temperature is raised, the potential for formation of a single phase is increased, and the rate of reaction is increased.
      <br/>
      However, the selectivity to the desired final product may suffer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a balance among rate of reaction, selectivity, and temperature has to be decided.
      <br/>
      This decision may depend on the particular circumstances, and may be based on economical, safety, environmental, and other considerations.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Thus, the temperature may preferably be adjusted through the computerized controller 28 within the desired range in a manner to promote the formation and/or maintenance of a single phase.
      <br/>
      If a single phase already exists, the temperature may preferably be reduced to the minimum limit of the desired range, and maintained there, if this decrease in temperature does not cause the formation of a second phase.
    </p>
    <p num="84">For constant purge rates of non-condensibles from the reaction chamber 12, lowering the pressure within the reaction chamber 12 moves the system toward a single phase formation since more hydrocarbon, cyclohexane for example, evaporates and the content of hydrocarbon in the liquid decreases.</p>
    <p num="85">Increasing gas sparging in the case of a stirred-tank reaction chamber, or in general the flow of the gaseous oxidant in the case of an atomization reactor (described for example in our aforementioned patents and patent applications) has a similar effect as lowering the pressure.</p>
    <p num="86">Lowering the conversion, or hold-up time in the reaction chamber 12, decreases the amount of water formed, which decrease has as an effect to promote the formation of a single phase.</p>
    <p num="87">
      Lowering the amount or rate of catalyst, cobalt acetate for example, also promotes the formation of a single phase.
      <br/>
      It should be noted here that when cobaltous acetate tetrahydrate is used, water is necessarily introduced, corresponding to the water of hydration of the cobaltous acetate salt.
    </p>
    <p num="88">According to the instant invention, the pressure is monitored by the pressure monitor 68, and the information is fed to the computerized controller 28 through input line 68'.</p>
    <p num="89">
      A gas comprising oxidant, preferably oxygen enters the system through line 18, which line 18 is fed from lines 72i and 72ii, which in turn comprise valves 72a and 72b, respectively.
      <br/>
      Valves 72a" and 72b" are controlled by the computerized controller 28 through output lines 72a" and 72b", respectively.
      <br/>
      Although it is preferable for the line 18 to be fed by the two lines 72i and 72ii, it may also be fed by just one of the two lines, as long as that one line comprises oxidant, preferably oxygen.
      <br/>
      In the particular case of this example, line 72i, conducts a gas containing oxidant, such as air for example, and line 72ii conducts oxidant, such as oxygen for example.
      <br/>
      The exact content of oxidant in the lines may assume any values, as long as a controlled amount or rate of oxidant may be fed to line 18.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that line 72i conducts air and line 72ii conducts oxygen.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      When the pressure inside the reaction chamber reaches a desired first pressure value, the valves 72a, 72b and 74 are caused to close by the controller 28, and the first pressure is allowed to drop to a second pressure value, preferably close to the first pressure value.
      <br/>
      The time interval between the two pressures determines the pressure drop rate.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the pressure drop rate may be determined by measuring the first pressure and the pressure attained within a predetermined time interval.
      <br/>
      The time interval is preferably in the range of 1/5 to 1/50 of the hold up time in the reaction chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      The determination of the pressure drop rate is very important because it is a measure of the reaction rate.
      <br/>
      In turn, the reaction rate is important because of higher productivity.
      <br/>
      Also with higher rates, lower temperatures may be afforded which may result in better selectivity and yield.
      <br/>
      Of course a balance should be selected and exercised between selectivity/yield and reaction rate.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide monitors (not shown) in the off-gases are also preferably utilized because they are indicative of selectivity and yield.
      <br/>
      An oxygen monitor (not shown) is also preferably used for determination of the oxygen content within the reaction chamber 12 or in the off gases.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      When the determination of drop rate is completed, valve 72b is opened for the missing oxidant, preferably oxygen, to enter the reaction chamber, and raise the pressure to attain its first pressure value again.
      <br/>
      Then it is closed, and the same process may be followed for a number of cycles.
      <br/>
      In turn, valve 74 is opened for off gases to leave the system and new supply of gas is provided to the reaction chamber through lines 72i and 72ii, after 72a and 72b open, for the pressure to attain again its first pressure value.
      <br/>
      Measurements of flow through the flowmeters 70 and 76 are useful for information sent to the computerized controller 28, which adjusts in turn 72a, 72b and 74 appropriately.
    </p>
    <p num="94">In place or in addition to flowmeter 70, flowmeters (not shown) in both or one of lines 72i and 72ii may be used for more information.</p>
    <p num="95">
      Instead of the sequence of valve openings and closings described above any other sequence may be utilized as long as the pressure drop rate due to oxidant, preferably oxygen, consumption is measured.
      <br/>
      For example, in another embodiment of the present invention, oxidant may be entering the reaction chamber and simultaneously off gasses may be exiting the reaction chamber 12.
      <br/>
      At a predetermined point valves 74, 72a and 72b are closed, and the pressure drop rate is determined.
      <br/>
      After the pressure drop determination, the valves 74, 72a and 72b are opened again to an appropriate degree and the same process is repeated after a desired interval of time.
    </p>
    <p num="96">When the determination of pressure drop rate has been made by the computerized controller 28, action is taken to control said pressure drop rate, and in a parallel manner the reaction rate, to fall within a desired region.</p>
    <p num="97">
      If the measured pressure drop rate, or reaction rate, falls under the desired region, the computerized controller is for example preferably programmed to follow the following sequence of steps to raise the pressure drop rate.
      <br/>
      However, depending on the individual circumstances, the sequence may be changed, a number of steps may be omitted, or other steps added.
      <br/>
      If a step is proven to be ineffective during the operation, any action that was performed to perform the step may be reversed and the next step conducted.
      <br/>
      Small increases or decreases of feed rates or other parameters are conducted to avoid overshooting.
      <br/>
      These depend on the individual case, and they may be easily determined by a person of ordinary skill in the art, for example:
      <br/>
      the partial pressure of oxidant, preferably oxygen, may be increased by controlling valves 72a and 72b in a manner for example that the valve 72b provides more oxidant; although the total pressure within the reaction chamber 12 is preferably constant, except for the fluctuations needed to measure the pressure drop rate, the total pressure may be increased in a manner that the partial pressure of oxidant is also increased; this is especially useful in case that the two valves 72a and 72b are replaced with a single valve providing line 18 with a mixture of oxidant and inert gas of a constant composition;
      <br/>
      the feed rate of hydrocarbon, preferably cyclohexane in the case of production of adipic acid, is increased, especially when the operation takes place close to the limit under which hydrocarbon starvation may be the cause of decrease of the pressure drop rate; this may be arranged by controller 28 through output line 50" which controls valve 50;
      <br/>
      the feed rate of catalyst, preferably comprising cobalt ions, is increased through valve 54, which is controlled by the computerized controller 28 through output line 54";
      <br/>
      the feed rate of promoter is increased through valve 56, which is controlled by the computerized controller 28 through output line 56";
      <br/>
      the feed rate of solvent is initially increased through valve 52, which is controlled by the computerized controller 28 through output line 52"; If this has no effect or negative effect, the feed rate of solvent is decreased from its initial value and the effect is also evaluated; if a beneficial effect is achieved the feed rate of solvent is further decreased within predetermined limits, and so on;
      <br/>
      the temperature in the reaction chamber 12 is increased either by means of one or both heat exchangers 44 and 60 through lines 44" and 60", respectively, or by adding more heat directly to the reaction chamber, or removing less heat directly from the reaction chamber, or decreasing the sparging rate of inert gases, such as nitrogen for example, to the reaction chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      The opposite procedures may be followed if the pressure drop rate is too high.
      <br/>
      The controller 28 also compares analytical results of the reaction products, preferably from line 21, and from the aforementioned gas monitors (CO, CO2 and O2), with the influence of the above steps on pressure drop rate, yield, selectivity, conversion, and the like, and optimizes the process according to a predetermined desirable program, depending on the individual occasion, readily designed by a person of ordinary skill in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="99">A preferable type of computerized controller comprises a "learning computer" or a "neuro-computer", the functionality of which is known to the art, and which collects information from different places of the device (for example pressure, temperature, chemical or other analysis, etc.), stores this information along with the result (pressure drop rate, reaction rate, and the like, for example), and it is programmed to use this information in the future, along with other data if applicable, to make decisions regarding the action to be at each instance.</p>
    <p num="100">Although the miscellaneous functions are preferably controlled by the computerized controller 28, it is possible, according to this invention, to utilize manual controls for controlling one or more functions.</p>
    <p num="101">
      Oxidations according to this invention, are non-destructive oxidations, wherein the oxidation product is different than carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and a mixture thereof.
      <br/>
      Of course, small amounts of these compounds may be formed along with the oxidation product, which may be one product or a mixture of products.
      <br/>
      The carbon dioxide and/or carbon monoxide formed should be taken into account in many occasions for more accurate correlation of pressure drop rate with reaction rate or with reactivity.
