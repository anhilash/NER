    <heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
    <p num="1">This is an continuation application of U.S. Ser. No. 08/894,716, filed Aug. 26, 1997, now abandoned; which, in turn, is a 371 of PCT/JP96/03834, filed Dec. 26, 1996.</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a lock for orthodontic treatment.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      As a lock for orthodontic treatment, a lock called "ST lock" has been generally known so far.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 56, this lock has a locking portion formed at an end of a wire "a" (shown as formed at opposite ends of the wire in the drawing).
      <br/>
      The locking portion includes a bent-down portion "b" formed proximally to a distal end of the wire "a", a horizontal portion "c" extending distally from the bentdown portion "b", a bent-up portion "d" formed at a distal end of the horizontal portion "c", and a short pin "e" and a long pin "f" brazed at position "g" between the bent-down portion "b" and the bent-up portion "d".
      <br/>
      As shown with respect to one of the locking portions, the short pin "e" and the bent-up portion "d" are inserted respectively into a pipe P1 and a pipe P2 which are fixedly attached to a band B fitted on a molar tooth.
      <br/>
      The long pin "f" is bent onto and fixed to the top end of the pipe P1.
      <br/>
      The "ST" lock is comparatively easy to mount in position, but on the other hand the process of fixing the short and long pins to the wire "a" by brazing involves a very troublesome operation in fabricating the device, because the wire "a" is a material having a thickness of less than 1 mm.
      <br/>
      Another problem with the device is that comparatively fragile brazed portions are liable to become damaged when a strong pull is applied upon the device in use.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      As another type of lock, a lock called "lingual lock" is described in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 4-18572. This device includes lock portions formed adjacent to a distal end of a wire by bending the wire in a hairpin-like fashion at two locations spaced a specified distance.
      <br/>
      The lock portions are press-fitted respectively into two tubes fixedly provided on a molar tooth band with a specified distance.
      <br/>
      With this lock, the problem is that high technical skill and precise care are required in the fabrication of the device because the hairpin-like bent portions must be spaced precisely as designed.
      <br/>
      Another problem is that since the hairpin-like bent portions are inserted into the tubes and held in position merely by frictional force, there is a danger of their slipping off the tube.
    </p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">In view of these problems with the prior art, the present invention has an object to provide a lock for orthodontic treatment which is comparatively easy to fabricate, simple to handle for locking, has no fragile part liable to damage during use, and can ensure enhanced safety.</p>
    <p num="6">In order to accomplish the object, a lock for orthodontic treatment in accordance with the present invention comprises a holding member fixed to a molar band, and a spring wire having an end removably held by the holding member,</p>
    <p num="7">
      the holding member being configured such that the end of the spring wire is held on the holding member by being moved axially along the holding member,
      <br/>
      one of the holding member and the spring wire having elasticity in a direction perpendicular to its axis,
      <br/>
      the holding member including a first engagement portion for preventing the movement of the end of the spring wire in a mounting direction, and a second engagement portion for preventing the movement of the end of the spring wire in a removing direction, and
      <br/>
      the spring wire including a first locking portion for engaging with the first engagement portion of the holding member, and a second locking portion for engaging with the second engagement portion of the holding member,
      <br/>
      whereby, when the end of the spring wire is moved axially along the holding member and held on the holding member, the first locking portion of the spring wire engages with the first engagement portion of the holding member and the second locking portion of the spring wire engages with the second engagement portion of the holding member under the elasticity of one of the holding member and the spring wire so that the spring wire is locked by the holding member.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In one embodiment of the invention, the holding member is preferably a holding tube of cylindrical shape into which the spring wire is to be inserted.</p>
    <p num="9">
      In this case, one of the holding tube and the spring wire may have elasticity in a direction perpendicular to the axis thereof.
      <br/>
      In order to enable the spring wire to have such elasticity, a distal end of the spring wire may be bent to form a spring hook portion.
      <br/>
      In order to enable the holding tube to have elasticity, the holding tube may be formed with a slit in a longitudinal direction thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="10">In another embodiment of the invention, the holding member preferably has a sectional configuration of H shape or channel shape which comprises a web portion and flange portions extending from both ends of the web portion.</p>
    <p num="11">In this case, in order to enable the spring wire to have elasticity, a distal end of the spring wire may be bent to form a spring hook portion.</p>
    <p num="12">
      The lock for orthodontic treatment of the invention constructed as described above is easy to fabricate because it involves no such particular difficulty or complicated job, or high skill as have been required in the manufacture of prior art devices.
      <br/>
      In use, the spring wire is simply moved axially.
      <br/>
      To disengage the lock, it is only necessary to push down or push up the outer end of the spring wire, then pull out the wire.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the device is far much more simple to handle than conventional devices.
      <br/>
      Locking is positively performed through engagement between the cutout surface portion and the engagement surface portion.
      <br/>
      In addition, the device has no such fragile part as has been found with prior art devices.
      <br/>
      Thus, safety in use can be further enhanced.

    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">Embodiment 1</p>
    <p num="15">
      FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate a lock representing a first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 11 designates the lock as a whole; 12 designates a holding tube of the device, and 13 designates a spring wire.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The holding tube 12 includes a tubular portion 14 fixed to a molar tooth band B. The tubular portion 14 is transversely disposed along the length (in the circumferential direction) of the band B. One side of the tubular portion extends laterally to form wing portions 15 so as to be readily affixed to the band B by spot welding or brazing.
      <br/>
      On the top side of tubular portion 14 there is provided a window 16 along with an engagement surface portion 19 having a pair of engaging edges 17, 18.
      <br/>
      The length L of the tubular portion 14 is generally 3 to 5 mm, preferably 3 to 4 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The spring wire 13 includes a linearly extending wire body 20 and a spring hook portion 22 formed by bending the wire at a position adjacent the end of the wire body, that is, at a curved portion 21.
      <br/>
      A required space 28 is provided between the spring hook portion 22 and the wire body 20.
      <br/>
      The distance between respective outer sides of the wire body 20 and the spring hook portion 22 is defined slightly larger than the inner diameter of the tubular portion 14.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In the figures, the wire body 20 is shown with respect to its one end side only.
      <br/>
      However, in the same way as wire "a" shown in FIG. 18, the wire body 20 may be bent in an arch-shaped fashion and formed with spring hook portions 22 at both ends.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the spring wire 13 is made of stainless steel, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      On the upper side of the spring hook portion 22 there is provided a shallow cutout surface portion 23 for receiving the engagement surface portion 19 of the tubular portion 14.
      <br/>
      The cutout surface portion 23 is formed with end edges 24, 25 at opposite ends thereof.
      <br/>
      An outer end portion 26 of the spring hook portion 22 is extended so that it projects from an engaging edge 17 when the spring hook portion 22 is fitted into the tubular portion 14.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      To fit the spring wire 13 into the holding tube 12, the spring wire 13 is inserted into the tubular portion 14 in the direction of arrow A as shown in FIG. 2 with the curved portion 21 positioned on the fore side.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the spring hook portion 22 is pressed by the engagement surface portion 19 so that the space 28 between the spring hook portion 22 and the wire body 20 is shortened.
      <br/>
      When the wire body 20 is further forced in, the cutout surface portion 23 coincides with the engagement surface portion 19 of the tubular portion.
      <br/>
      Then, the spring hook portion 22 expands outward by its own elasticity so that ends 24, 25 of the cutout surface portion 23 come into engagement with the engaging edges 17, 18 of the engagement surface portion 19, whereby automatic locking is effected.
      <br/>
      In this locked state, the wire body 20, even when pushed or pulled, is prevented from slipping off the holding tube 12.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In order to disengage the lock to remove the wire body 20, the outer end portion 26 is pressed against the elastic force in the direction of arrow F as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the spring hook portion 22 is flexed to allow the cutout surface portion 23 to move away from the engagement surface portion 19, which caused the engagement relationship between the end edges 24, 25 of the cutout surface portion 23 and the engaging edges 17, 18 of the engagement surface portion 19 to be released.
      <br/>
      The spring wire 13 can be easily pulled out of the holding tube 12 by pulling the wire body 20 or by pushing the curved portion 21 in a direction opposite to the direction of arrow A.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The reference numeral 27 designates a flank provided as required between the cutout surface portion 23 of the spring hook portion 22 and the curved portion 21.
      <br/>
      The provision of the flank 27 permits easy insertion of the spring hook portion 22 into the tubular portion 14 and easy removal of the same.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In this embodiment, only one side of the window 16 of the holding tube 12 is used as the engagement surface portion 19.
      <br/>
      However, both sides of the window 16 may be used as a pair of engagement surface portions 19.
      <br/>
      In this case, one of the pair of engagement surface portions 19 may be selected for engagement with the cutout surface portion 23 of the spring hook portion 22, whereby the spring wire 13 can be adjusted in length.
      <br/>
      Also, the spring hook portion 22 may be formed with a pair of cutout surface portions 23 in complementary relation to the pair of engagement surface portions 19 of the holding tube 12.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      A spring wire 13a shown in FIG. 1A is one such that the outer end portion 26 of the spring wire 13 shown in FIG. 1 is formed with a flat crushed portion 26a.
      <br/>
      When the spring wire 13a is inserted into the holding tube 12, a shoulder portion 26b of the flat crushed portion 26a engages with a vertical edge formed in continuation to the engaging edge 17 of the holding tube 12, preventing the spring hook portion 22 from projecting through the holding tube 12.
      <br/>
      Such a crushed portion 26a is equally applicable to the spring wire in any of embodiments and modifications to be described hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Embodiment 2</p>
    <p num="26">With respect to the following embodiments, only different parts will be described, and substantially identical parts will be designated by the same reference numerals so that description of such parts is omitted.</p>
    <p num="27">
      FIG. 3 shows a lock 31 representing a second embodiment of the invention.

      The tubular portion 14 of a holding tube 32 of the present embodiment is different from that of the first embodiment in that it has no such window 16 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      On both ends of the upper side of the tubular portion 14, there are formed engaging edges 17, 18 so that the upper side in its entirety defines an engagement surface portion 19.
      <br/>
      A shallow cutout surface portion 23 is formed generally centrally of a spring hook portion 22 of a spring wire 33 so that end edges 24, 25 mechanically engage with the engaging edges 17, 18.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3 is especially suitable for application in the case where available space is not sufficient to accommodate the same length of tubular portion 14 as in the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, for example where the lock is to be mounted to a tooth other than molar tooth.
      <br/>
      This embodiment provides accurate locking through mechanical engagement between the engaging edge 17, 18 of the engagement surface portion 19 and end edge 24, 25 of the cutout surface portion 23, and ease of insertion/removal handling, and in these respects it is equal to the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.

      FIG. 4 illustrates a lock 41 representing a third embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      In this lock 41, a holding tube 42 is formed with two tubular portions 14A, 14B arranged on the wing portion 15 with a required space portion 44 therebetween.
      <br/>
      The upper side of each tubular portion 14A, 14B functions as an engagement surface portion 19, with engaging edges 17, 18 formed at opposite sides.
      <br/>
      A spring hook portion 22 of a spring wire 43 is also formed with two cutout surface portions 23 in complementary relation to the tubular portions 14A, 14B.
      <br/>
      Each cutout surface portion 23 is provided at both ends thereof with end edges 24, 25 adapted to engage with the engaging edges 17, 18.
      <br/>
      An outer end portion of the spring hook portion 22 is made to project from the tubular portion 14A.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      This third embodiment provides more powerful locking effect than the foregoing two embodiments in that mechanical locking is performed by means of two tubular portions 14A, 14B and two cutout surface portions 23.
      <br/>
      For the purpose of disengaging the lock, it is preferable that the outer end portion 26 be pushed down as in the case of FIG. 2 and, at the same time, a portion intermediate between the two tubular portions 14A, 14B be depressed.
      <br/>
      However, such simultaneous depression of the intermediate portion is not always required if adjustment is made with respect to the distance between the wire body 20 and the spring hook portion 22, and the thickness of the engagement surface portion 19,

      FIG. 8 shows a spring wire 33 having an engagement recess portion 76 formed thereon by bending or pressing the spring hook portion 22.
      <br/>
      The engagement recess portion 76 takes the place of the cutout surface portion 23 in the second embodiment.
      <br/>
      The engagement recess portion 76 is easier to form and more excellent in strength than the cutout surface portion 23.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In order to strengthen the locking function of the spring wire 33, the wire body 20 may be fitted with a ring 77 preferably made of rubber (rubber band) as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      The ring 77 should be kept away from the spring hook portion 22 before the spring wire 33 is inserted into the tubular portion 14.
      <br/>
      After insertion of the spring wire, the ring 77 is set between the spring hook portion 22 and the wire body 20 as shown by a phantom line.
      <br/>
      This arrangement prevents deformation of the spring hook portion 22 due to a force acting thereon in the direction of arrow F. Therefore, the engagement between the engagement surface portion 19 of the tubular portion 14 and the engagement recess portion 76 of the spring wire 33 is maintained, there being no possibility of the spring wire 33 becoming disengaged from the tubular portion 14.
      <br/>
      This ring 77 is also applicable to various other embodiments and modifications to be described hereinafter with respect to locks comprising a spring wire having a spring hook portion, and a holding tube.

      FIG. 9 shows a spring wire 33 having a cutout surface portion 23 formed on the wire body 20 instead of the cutout surface portion 23 formed on the spring hook portion 22 of the spring wire 33 as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The locking function of the cutout surface portion 23 of the wire body 20 is similar to that of the cutout surface portion 23 of the spring hook portion 22 in the above described embodiment.
      <br/>
      In order to remove the spring wire 33 shown in FIG. 9, it is necessary to depress the wire body 20, not the spring hook portion 22, in the direction of arrow F. This, as compared with the case in which the cutout surface portion 23 is formed on the spring hook portion 22, provides an advantage that the depressing position is not limited and smaller pressing force is required.
      <br/>
      The spring wire 33 may be advantageously used when it is desirable to provide a gap between the wire body 20 and the gum.

      FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate a lock 81 representing a seventh embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, an inwardly projecting engagement surface portion 19 is formed on the upper wall of the tubular portion 14 of a holding tube 82, and opposite end edges of the engagement surface portion 19 act as engaging edges 17, 18.
      <br/>
      A spring hook portion 22 of a spring wire 83 is formed with a cutout surface portion 23 engageable with the engagement surface portion 19 of the tubular portion 14, and opposite ends of the cutout surface portion 23 act as end edges 24, 25.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      When the spring wire 83 is inserted into the tubular portion 14 in the direction of arrow A, the cutout surface portion 23 of the spring hook portion 22 comes into engagement with the engagement surface portion 19 of the tubular portion 14.
      <br/>
      As a result, the end edge 24 of the spring wire 83 engages with the engaging edge 17 of the tubular portion 14 so that the wire movement in the inserting direction is prevented, and the end edge 25 of the spring wire 83 engages with the engaging edge 18 of the tubular portion 14 so that the wire movement in the removing direction is prevented.
      <br/>
      For removing the spring wire 83, as in the case of the foregoing embodiment, an outer end portion 26 or curved portion 21 of the spring hook portion 22 which projects from one end of the tubular portion 14 is pressed in the direction of arrow F. Thereby, the cutout surface portion 23 of the spring hook portion 22 is disengaged from the engagement surface portion 19 of the tubular portion 14.
      <br/>
      Thus, the spring wire 83 can be pulled out of the tubular portion 14.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the tubular portion 14 has no opening other than the openings at opposite ends, such as window 16 in the above described embodiment.

      In this tenth embodiment, it is basically intended that the two engagement raised portions 107 come into engagement with the two engagement hole portions 104.
      <br/>
      However, the engagement raised portion 107 shown at left side may engage with the engagement hole portion 104 shown at right side, or the engagement raised portion 107 shown at right side may engage with the engagement hole portion 104 shown at left side.
      <br/>
      In this way, the spring wire 123 can be locked at any one of three positions.
      <br/>
      Therefore, this enables length adjustment of the wire spring 123 in clinical use of the device.

      In this embodiment, a holding tube 14 includes a bent edge 144, as a first engaging portion, formed by bending perpendicularly to the axis the forward end of a wing portion 15 extending axially from one end of the tubular portion 14 of a holding tube 142, and an elastic pawl projection 145, as a second engaging portion, extending axially from the upper wall of other end of the tubular portion 14 and projecting perpendicularly to the axis.
      <br/>
      The pawl projection 145 may be made shorter and non-elastic by bending the edge of the tubular portion 14.
      <br/>
      A fore-side end of the spring hook portion 22 of the spring wire 143 is notched to define a stepped projection 149.
      <br/>
      In the spring wire 143, the outer surface of its curved portion 21 and the projection 149 respectively form end edges for coming into engagement with the bent piece 144 and the pawl projection 145.

      In this embodiment, a holding tube 202 includes a tubular portion 204 having a rectangular section of which one side is slightly larger than the outer dimension of the spring wire 203, and wing portions 205 extending laterally from opposite ends of a rear side wall of the tubular portion 204.
      <br/>
      The tubular portion 204, as FIG. 35 shows, has an axially extending slit 206 formed along a corner portion defined by the rear side wall and an upper wall, whereby the tubular portion is possessed of elastic characteristics effective in the direction perpendicular to the axis.
      <br/>
      The tubular portion 204 has an inwardly projecting engagement surface portion 207 formed on its upper wall, and opposite end edges of which serve as engaging edges 208, 209.
      <br/>
      The spring wire 203 is formed on the upper surface of a straight end portion thereof with a cutout surface portion 210, opposite ends of which serve as end edges 211, 212.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      When the spring wire 203 is inserted into the tubular portion 204 in the direction of arrow A, the engagement surface portion 207 of the tubular portion 204 is pressed by the distal end of the spring wire 203 so that the tubular portion 204 is expanded.
      <br/>
      When the spring wire 203 is inserted further until the cutout surface portion 210 of the spring wire 203 coincides with the engagement surface portion 207 of the tubular portion 204, the tubular portion 204 is contracted by its own elasticity so that the engagement surface portion 207 of the tubular portion 204 comes into engagement with the cutout surface portion 210 of the spring wire 203.
      <br/>
      As a result, an end edge 211 of the spring wire 203 is engaged by an engaging edge 208 of the tubular portion 204 so that the spring wire is prevented from further movement in the inserting direction.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the end edge 211 of the spring wire 203 is engaged by the engaging edge 208 of the tubular portion 204 so that the spring wire is prevented from movement in the removing direction.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      To remove the spring wire 203, the spring wire 203 is lifted in the direction of arrow F', or a suitable tool is inserted in the slit 206 to pull up the upper wall portion 204.
      <br/>
      As a result, the upper wall of the tubular portion 204 is forced upward to cause the engagement surface portion 207 of the tubular portion 204 to be disengaged from the cutout surface portion 210 of the spring wire 203.
      <br/>
      Thus, the spring wire 203 can be drawn out of the tubular portion 204.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the tubular portion 204 is of a small size such that it is substantially equal to the diameter of the spring wire 203.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the device is particularly suitable for use in the case where the crown length is short.
      <br/>
      Both holding tube 202 and the spring wire 203 are simple in configuration, easy to fabricate, and inexpensive.
    </p>
    <p num="78">In the above described seventeenth embodiment, it is possible to use, as an alternative to the spring wire 203 with the cutout surface portion 210, a spring wire 214 having an engagement recess portion 213 formed by bending as shown in FIG. 34. The engagement surface portion 207 of the tubular portion 204 may be formed on a front wall as in the case of a holding tube 215 shown in FIG. 36. The slit 206 of the tubular portion 204 may be provided in a corner portion defined by the rear side wall and the lower wall as in the case of a holding tube 216 shown in FIG. 37, or may be provided centrally of the front wall as in the case of a holding tube 217 shown in FIG. 37A.</p>
    <p num="79">A crushed portion 26a as shown in FIG. 1A may be provided at a location spaced at least the length of the tubular portion 204 of the holding tube 202 or more from the tip of the spring wire 203 in the seventeenth embodiment, whereby the spring wire 203 can be prevented from projecting through the holding tube 202 during the inserting process of the spring wire 203.</p>
