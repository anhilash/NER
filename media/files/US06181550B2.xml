      <br/>
      A device for mounting a speaker on a portable computer is provided that hingably secures a speaker housing to the side of the display unit.
      <br/>
      The device and speaker housing move between a recessed and folded position and an unfolded and extended position.
      <br/>
      A channel shaped groove is formed in the side portion of the main body to allow the speaker housing to be folded into a recessed and flush position.
      <br/>
      The device may also be constructed with a latch that is attached to the speaker housing to secure the display unit to the main body in its folded position.
      <br/>
      To allow the distance between the speakers to be adjusted the device is constructed with an extendable bar that can slide in and out of the display unit.This speaker mounting device provides a way to vary the distance between speakers attached to a portable computer, a way to mount speakers so that both the device and the attached speakers can be retracted flush with the portable computer to allow the portable computer and the associated speakers to be easily shipped and stored, a way to eliminate the need for a separate locking mechanism, and a way to enhance the stereophonic qualities of the sound supplied by the speakers.

      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a device for a computer and, more specifically, to a device for mounting speakers to a portable computer that increases the effect of the sound generated by speakers.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      A recent trend in personal computing has been toward the multimedia computer that provides high quality audio and video output.
      <br/>
      Such systems have typically included a pair of add-on speakers which are placed near the monitor and plugged into a sound board in the computer.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, the use of add-on speakers consumes valuable desktop space and requires separate re-orientation of the monitor and the speakers when a user desires to change position.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, portable or notebook computers have become a popular alternative to traditional desktop computers, largely due to their superior movability, simplicity, and convenience.
      <br/>
      Portable computers are often equipped with various peripheral devices that aid in achieving a multimedia effect.
      <br/>
      These portable computers use speakers to reproduce sound generated by the sound system within the computer.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the typical sound system has been improved to support stereophonic or three-dimensional stereophonic, and the speakers are usually incorporated into the main body of the portable computer.
      <br/>
      The speakers built into the portable computer are generally kept at an interval that facilitates simulating a stereophonic effect.
    </p>

      Contemporary speakers used with laptop computers are limited in the distance that the speakers can be separated from each other during operation without using wires to connect the speakers to the monitor.
    </p>
    <p num="7">I believe it may be possible to improve on the contemporary art by providing a device for attaching speakers to a portable computer's monitor, that is extendable to vary the distance between the speakers, that allows both the device and the attached speakers to be retracted flush with the computer to allow the portable computer and the associated speakers to be easily shipped and stored, that may be constructed with rigid components to connect the speakers to the monitor while avoiding the problem of tangled wires and imprecise symmetrical positioning, that doubles as a locking mechanism to secure the display section of the portable computer to the main housing when the portable computer is in a closed position, that does not require the use of wires exclusively to connect the speakers to the monitor, that connects to the monitor to allow for better audio and visual synchronization, and that enhances the stereophonic qualities of the speakers.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a device for attaching speakers to a portable computer that is extendable to vary the distance between the attached speakers.</p>
    <p num="9">It is another object to provide a device for attaching speakers to a portable computer that allows both the device and the speakers to be retracted flush with the portable computer to allow the portable computer to be more easily shipped and stored.</p>
    <p num="10">It is still another object to provide a device for attaching speakers to a portable computer that is constructed substantially of rigid members to avoid the problem of tangled wires and to avoid the imprecise symmetrical positioning of speakers.</p>
    <p num="11">It is yet another object to provide a device for attaching speakers to a portable computer that does not exclusively use wires to connect the speakers to the monitor.</p>
    <p num="12">It is still yet another object to provide a device for attaching speakers to a portable computer that prevents the speakers from requiring separate repositioning when the portable computer is rotated.</p>
    <p num="13">It is a further object to provide a device for attaching speakers to a portable computer that allows the speakers to deliver an improved stereophonic sound.</p>
    <p num="14">It is a further object still to provide a device for attaching speakers to a portable computer that connects to the monitor to allow for better audio and visual synchronization.</p>
    <p num="15">It is yet a further object to provide a device for attaching speakers to a portable computer that doubles as a locking mechanism to secure the display section of the portable computer to the main housing when the portable computer is in a closed position.</p>
    <p num="16">
      To achieve these and other objects, a device for mounting a speaker on a portable computer is provided that hingably secures a speaker housing to the side of the display unit.
      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="18">
      Turning now to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows a portable computer having liquid crystal display 200 mounted on support member 30 that is hingedly attached to main body 32 of portable computer 10.
      <br/>
      The location for various mounting speakers 12, organized in pairs, is shown on top surface 201 of portable computer 10.
      <br/>
      Due to the space limitations, speakers 12 can only be mounted along upper center 202, upper sides 203, and lower sides 204 of top surface 201 of portable computer 10.
      <br/>
      Speakers 12 are preferably microspeakers and the intervals between the speakers are limited to, at most, a full width of main body 32 of portable computer 10.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the speakers mounted on the main body generally face a direction perpendicular to the plane of base 205 of portable computer 10.
      <br/>
      The combination of the orientation of the speakers and the intervals between the speakers deteriorates the stereophonic effect that can be experienced by a user.
      <br/>
      Additionally, portable computer 10 has latch device 20 positioned at the top center portion of LCD support member 30 that couples with main body 32 when the portable computer is in a closed position, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Latch device 20 includes button 22 and hook 24.
      <br/>
      Groove 26 is positioned along center portion 206 top surface 201 of main body 32 to engage hook 24 of latch 20 when LCD support member 30 is closed.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate a speaker mounting device as constructed according to a first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The speaker mounting device secures speakers to both sides of LCD support member 30 of portable computer 10 in an extendable manner.
      <br/>
      Speaker mounting device 40 includes speaker housing 42 hingedly secured to top side portion 201 of LCD support member 30.
      <br/>
      Speaker housing 42 may be constructed using a microspeaker.
      <br/>
      Speaker housing 42 has projections 56, at the top and bottom portions of pivot 62.
      <br/>
      Projections 56 are positioned along the opposite side of grooved compartment 48.
      <br/>
      Hole 60 is positioned along one side at a center portion of speaker housing 42 to allow electric cord 43 to enter the speaker housing.
      <br/>
      Electric cord 43 connects the speaker mounted in speaker housing 42 with the audio output terminal (not shown) of the sound generation circuitry of portable computer 10.
      <br/>
      Speaker mounting device 40 further includes latch 70 that is positioned in compartment 48 of speaker housing 42.
      <br/>
      Latch 70 may be constructed with button 71, hook 74, shaft 76, and spring 78.
      <br/>
      The speaker housing 42 can have a substantially rectangular prism shape.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Top side portion 207 of LCD support member 30 has notch 102 formed facing the front of the main body of the portable computer and is designed to pivotally receive speaker housing 42.
      <br/>
      The notch 102 shown in FIG. 4 can also be described as a slot 102.
      <br/>
      Speaker housing 42 pivots around groove 55 between a recessable position and an extended position.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, main body 32 of portable computer 10 has a channel shaped groove 101 formed along the sides of main body 32 that allow speaker housing 42 to be moved flush with the portable computer.
      <br/>
      Along a lower center portion of groove 101 is side hole 73 that engages hook 74 of latch 70 when the LCD supporting member is in a closed position and the speaker housings are pivoted into a position flush with the portable computer.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 5 illustrates speaker housing 42 and the portable computer when in a closed and locked state.
      <br/>
      In this condition the portable computer and extendable speakers are easy to store and ship without damaging the components.
      <br/>
      Speaker housing 42 may be manually moved from an extended position, as shown in FIG. 3, to a recessed position, as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      In the recessed position, speaker housing 42 fits flush inside of groove 101 in the sides of main body 32 of portable computer 10.
      <br/>
      When the speakers are in the recessed position, hook 74 of latch 70 is engaged with hole 73 formed in groove 101 of main body 32.
      <br/>
      LCD support member 30 maintains a secure coupling state with respect to main body 32.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The arrangement of speaker mounting device 40 in the recessed, or folded down, position is shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Speaker housing 42 has space 46 to mount microspeaker 44 and a plurality of holes on a front surface to allow sound to leave the speaker housing.
      <br/>
      Groove 55 receives speaker housing 42 and has enough space to allow projection 56 of housing 42 to rotate counterclockwise and then be placed in an unfolded position.
      <br/>
      When the speaker housing is an unfolded position, the speaker housing is flush with main body 32 of portable computer 10.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, through a portion of groove 55 is positioned hole 61 that allows electric cord 43 to enter LCD support member 30.
      <br/>
      Button 71 of latch 70 is elastically supported within compartment 48 of speaker housing 42 in a manner known in the art.
      <br/>
      The design of latch 70 is one that is well known in the art and is shown in FIG. 7.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      FIG. 8 illustrates LCD support member 30 in a position with the speaker housing and latch securing the LCD support member in the closed position.
      <br/>
      By pressing and lifting button 71 of latch 70, the locking mechanism of LCD support member 30 is released and rotation of the speaker housing 42 into an extended position is possible.
      <br/>
      FIG. 9 shows speaker housing 42 in an position where the speaker housing is not locking the LCD support member in a closed position.
      <br/>
      When hook 74 of speaker housing 42 is not engaged with side hole 73, speaker housing 42 can be extended outwardly from the side of LCD support member 30.
      <br/>
      Once the LCD support member 30 of the portable computer is opened to its proper view position, the interval between the speakers can be increased, beyond that available with speakers mounted on a top surface of the main body of portable computer 10, to the extent of the speaker housings 42 width.
      <br/>
      This allows a widening of the stereophonic sound effect produced by the speakers.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, latch 70 located in each of speaker housing 42 eliminates the need to provide a separate latch device to secure the portable computer in a closed position.
      <br/>
      This simplifies the manufacturing process while enhancing the stereophonic effect of the speakers.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 10 illustrates a second embodiment of the speaker mounting device as constructed in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This speaker mounting device provides a means for horizontally extending a speaker housing, that is constructed in the same manner as the speaker housing of the first embodiment, from both sides of LCD support member 30 of portable computer 10.
      <br/>
      As also shown in FIG. 11, speaker mounting device 40 may be constructed with extension bar 80 that is slidably mounted in both side portions of LCD support member 30 of portable computer 10.

      <br/>
      On one end of extension bar 80 is pair of protrusions 84.
      <br/>
      On opposing inner faces 208 of protrusions 84 are holes 88.
      <br/>
      The notch 102 shown in FIGS. 10 and 11 can also be described as a slot 102.
      <br/>
      The detailed construction of extension bar 80 will be described later in regards to FIGS. 14 to 16.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Speaker mounting device 40 has speaker housing 42 hingedly secured between protrusions 84 of extension bar 80.
      <br/>
      The speaker housing 42 projection 56 on one side of one end and pivots 62 on each side.
      <br/>
      Speaker housing 42 has compartment 48 on an opposite side from projection 56.
      <br/>
      Speaker housing 42 has hole 60 formed in a central portion of one side to allow electric cord 43 to enter the speaker housing.
      <br/>
      Speaker mounting device 40 has latch 70 positioned in compartment 48 of speaker housing 42.
      <br/>
      Latch 70 may be constructed with button 71, hook 74, and shaft 76, and spring 78.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Along the top side portion of LCD support member 30, notch 102 is formed facing the front side of LCD support member 30.
      <br/>
      In the middle porting of notch 102 is hollow compartment 100 that receives extension bar 80.
      <br/>
      Groove 55 is positioned on one wall of notch 102.
      <br/>
      Extension bar 80 is inserted into compartment 100 and speaker housing 42 pivots around groove 55 between a folded position and an extended position.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, main body 32 of portable computer 10 has groove 101 along both sides.
      <br/>
      Groove 101 accommodates speaker housing 42 flush in main body 32.
      <br/>
      Lower center portion of groove 101 has side hole 73 to engage hook 74 of latch 70 when the LCD supporting member is in a closed position.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, electric cord 43 connects the speaker mounted in speaker housing 42 with the audio output terminal (not shown) of the sound generation circuitry via holes 60 and 88 of speaker housing 42, extension bar 80, hollow compartment 100, and LCD support member 30.
      <br/>
      The extension bars 80 can be replaced with telescoping beams.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      FIG. 12 illustrates the recessed, or folded down, position of speaker mounting device 40 with LCD support member 30 in the closed position.
      <br/>
      Speaker housing 42 is manually moved from the unfolded position, as shown in FIG. 10, to the extended position and then extension bar 80 can be slidably moved into compartment 100 of LCD support member 30.
      <br/>
      In the recessed and folded down position, speaker housing 42 fits flush into groove 101 of main body 32.
      <br/>
      When LCD supporting member 30 is in the closed position, hook 74 of latch 70 is engaged with hole 73 that is located in groove 101 of main body 32.
      <br/>
      Thus, LCD support member 30 stays securely coupled with main body 32.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The arrangement of the speaker mounting device 40 in the recessed and folded down position is shown in FIG. 13. Speaker housing 42 has space 46 to mount microspeaker 44 and a plurality of holes in the front surface for sound to be emitted through.
      <br/>
      Groove 55 receives projection 56 of speaker housing 42 and has space enough to allow projection 56 of housing 42 to rotate counterclockwise to place the speaker housing in the unfolded position.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Furthermore, in a portion of groove 55 is hollow compartment 100 that extends inside LCD support member 30.
      <br/>
      This allows extension bar 80 to slidably extend from or retract into LCD support member 30.
      <br/>
      Elongated hole 106 is shown in FIG. 14, along one side wall of compartment 100, and guide projection 104 is shown in FIG. 13 along another side wall of compartment 100.
      <br/>
      Thus, guide projection 104, is positioned in compartment 100 to guide and limit the movement of extension bar 80.
      <br/>
      Elongated hole 106 of compartment 100 passes electric cord 43 through hole 90 of extension bar 80.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Another embodiment of the extension bar is shown in FIG. 15. Extension bar 110 is similar to that shown in FIG. 13, except for cylindrical guide projection 120 positioned along a center portion of the extension bar.
      <br/>
      Guide projection 120 has a circular extension on an outer end forming circular groove 210.
      <br/>
      Circular groove 210 of projection 120 is engaged with elongated hole 106.
      <br/>
      Hollow compartment 100 is formed such that elongated hole 106 is formed along one side wall of compartment 100.
      <br/>
      Thus, as shown in FIG. 16, the periphery of guide projection 120 is fit into the center portion of extension bar 110 through elongated hole 106 that is formed in hollow compartment 100 of LCD support member 30.
      <br/>
      Electric cord 43 is led from hole 118 to the hole of guide projection 120 of extension bar 110.
      <br/>
      Guide projection 120 guides the lateral movement of extension bar 110 along elongated hole 106 and limits the distance of the movement.
      <br/>
      The hole 118 is located between a pair of protrusions 114 of the extension bar 110.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      FIG. 17 shows a locking state of LCD support member 30 of the portable computer when LCD support member 30 is in a closed position and speaker mounting device 40 is retracted and in a folded down position.
      <br/>
      By pressing and lifting button 71 of latch 70, the locking mechanism of LCD support member 30 is released and then rotation of speaker housing 42 can begin.
      <br/>
      FIG. 18 shows an unlocked condition of LCD support member 30 where speaker mounting device 40 can be moved to an extended position.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, by pulling out speaker housing 42 extension bar 80 moves outwardly along elongated hole 90 due to the interaction with projection 104 of compartment 100.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The configuration of the speaker mounting device allows extension bar 80 to be drawn out of both sides of LCD support member 30 of the portable computer.
      <br/>
      After the extension bar 80 is extended to the desired position, the interval between the speakers can be controlled as extension bar 80 slides in and out of LCD support member 30.
      <br/>
      This increases the interval that the speakers may be separated from each other.
      <br/>
      Thus, the interval between the speakers is no longer limited to the width of the main body.
      <br/>
      Now the interval between the speakers can be increased to be equivalent to the width of the main body, plus extension bar 80, and plus speaker housing 42, in view of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, the present invention allows for positioning of the speakers outside of the interval priorly possible with attached speakers, and improving the present invention therefore improves the quality of sound supplied by the speakers.
      <br/>
      Latch 70 is positioned on each one of the speaker housings to eliminate the need for a separate latch device to secure the portable computer in a closed position.
    </p>
    <p num="33">This speaker mounting device provides a way to vary the distance between speakers attached to a portable computer, a way to mount speakers so that both the device and the attached speakers can be retracted flush with the portable computer to allow the portable computer and the associated speakers to be easily shipped and stored, a way to easily rotate a portable computer while avoiding the problem of tangled wires and imprecise symmetrical positioning, a way to eliminate the need for a separate locking mechanism, and a way to enhance the stereophonic qualities of the sound supplied by the speakers.</p>
    <p num="34">
      As apparent from foregoing, the speaker mounting device of the present invention provides for an extendable speaker system for a portable computer.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the present invention provides a new structure for mounting speakers to a portable computer that improves the sound quality produced by the speaker while eliminating a separate latching mechanism.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Although these two preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.
      <br/>
      For example, it should be understood that the extending members that attach to the speaker housings can have multiple sections to allow for an even greater separation distance between the speakers.
      <br/>
      It is also possible that other benefits or uses of the currently disclosed invention will become apparent over time.
