    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention is directed to a container assembly containing an adsorbent material.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention is directed to a container having a large surface area for enabling gases or liquids to pass through the adsorbent.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      A large amount of effort has been spent to control water and air pollution and has resulted in a number of devices and materials being produced.
      <br/>
      Noxious vapors and gases are a typical example of sources of air pollution which can make breathing difficult and unpleasant.
      <br/>
      To effectively clean air in large areas, mechanical filters and electronic cleaners are often used.
      <br/>
      These devices include air exchange filtration systems or electronically charged fields and plates to collect and remove particulate matter.
      <br/>
      The mechanical filters and electronic devices can be expensive to produce and require continuous maintenance thereby limiting their use.
      <br/>
      A further disadvantage of electronic air cleaners is that some of the devices produce ozone which is itself an air pollutant.
      <br/>
      Household odors such as cooking odors, pet odors and bathroom odors can be difficult to control.
      <br/>
      Numerous devices are presently on the market designed for deodorizing and freshening the air.
      <br/>
      These products are produced in many forms including, mist, blocks, liquids, powders and aerosol sprays.
      <br/>
      These products are generally effective for masking odors, but do not eliminate the odors or remove contaminants from the air.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Other solutions have been proposed to purify and freshen the air.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 1,737,532 discloses an air purifying and deodorizing device for use in refrigerators, toilets and sick rooms.
      <br/>
      A metallic container having a perforated surface and an adsorbent deodorizing material is placed within the area to be purified.
      <br/>
      The disclosed deodorizing material is a charcoal combined with other ingredients having germicidal qualities.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A further example of an air and water purifying device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,224,975 to Purnell et al.
      <br/>
      This device is a canister having a perforated side wall and closed ends for containing a zeolite material.
      <br/>
      The canister has a limited number of openings for the exchange of air and water which limits its utility and effectiveness.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Accordingly, there is a continuing need in the industry for improved devices for purifying air and water.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention is directed to a container for adsorbing contaminants from air or water, also acting as a desiccant.
      <br/>
      The invention is further directed to the combination of a housing having at least one permeable wall where the housing supports the container.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Accordingly, a primary aspect of the invention is to provide a method container for adsorbing odors and moisture from air and contaminants from water which is convenient and easy to use.</p>
    <p num="8">A further aspect of the invention is to provide a container enclosing an adsorbent material where the container has a porous inner and a porous outer surface.</p>
    <p num="9">Another aspect of the invention is to provide a container enclosing an adsorbent material having an axial passage through the container for the passage of air or water through an adsorbent contained within the container.</p>
    <p num="10">Another aspect of the invention is to provide a container enclosing an adsorbent material where the container has a large number of openings to allow the passage of air or water through the adsorbent.</p>
    <p num="11">A further object of the invention is to provide a method for removing odors and moisture from the air using an adsorbent in a container.</p>
    <p num="12">
      These and other aspects of the invention are basically attained by providing a device for removing contaminants from air or water where the device comprises an outer wall having a generally cylindrical shape with open first and second ends and a plurality of spaced apart open slots extending in a circumferential direction around the outer wall.
      <br/>
      The slots are of sufficient size to allow air or water to pass readily through the outer wall.
      <br/>
      An inner wall is mounted concentric with the outer wall and spaced therefrom to define an axial passage.
      <br/>
      The inner wall has a generally cylindrical shape with first and second open ends and a plurality of spaced apart open slots extending in a circumferential direction around the inner wall and being of sufficient size to allow the passage of air or water.
      <br/>
      An annular space is formed between the inner and outer walls and contains a particulate adsorbent material capable of removing contaminants from air or water.
      <br/>
      First and second end caps close the ends of the outer wall and the annular space.
      <br/>
      The end caps include a central opening aligned with the axial passage of the inner wall to allow the flow of air or water through the axial passage.
      <br/>
      In embodiments of the invention, the adsorbent material is a natural or synthetic zeolite.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The objects and advantages of the invention are further attained by providing an air purifying device for removing contaminants from the air comprising a housing having a top wall, a bottom wall, a rear wall, first and second end walls and a first and second support adjacent the end walls.
      <br/>
      A contaminant adsorbing container is positioned within the housing and supported by the first and second supports at the ends of the container.
      <br/>
      The supports space the container a distance from the top, bottom and rear walls of the housing to allow air circulation around the container.
      <br/>
      The container comprises a cylindrical outer wall having open ends and a plurality of spaced apart open slots extending in a circumferential direction around the outer wall where the slots are sufficient size to allow air to pass through the outer wall.
      <br/>
      A concentric inner wall is positioned within the outer wall to form an annular space between the walls.
      <br/>
      The inner wall defines an axial passage for the flow of air and includes, a plurality of spaced apart open slots extending in a circumferential direction around the inner wall.
      <br/>
      The slots in the inner wall are of sufficient size to allow air to pass through the inner wall.
      <br/>
      End caps are attached to the outer wall to close the annular space.
      <br/>
      The end caps include a central opening aligned with the axial passage of the inner wall to allow the flow of air through the container.
