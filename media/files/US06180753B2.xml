    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a process for treating a compound having epithio structure for disposal, and more particularly to a process for treating for disposal an unused portion of a mixture comprising a compound having epithio structures and a catalyst for curing the compound obtained in a process comprising casting and polymerizing the mixture to produce an optical material, such as a plastic lens, a prism, an optical fiber, an information recording substrate and a filter.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Arts</p>
    <p num="4">
      The present inventors have discovered novel compounds having epithio structures which provide optical materials having useful properties as optical materials, i.e., a small thickness, a small chromatic aberration, a refractive index of 1.7 or more and an Abbe number of 35 or more as described in the specifications of patent application for these compounds (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Heisei 9(1997)-110979 and Japanese Patent Application No. Heisei 8(1996)-5797).
      <br/>
      These compounds having epithio structures and compounds having epithio structures which are similar to these compounds (hereinafter, both referred to as compounds having epithio structures) show large reactivity in the presence of a curing catalyst.
      <br/>
      However, no process for mildly solidifying an unused portion of these compounds for disposal have been developed.
      <br/>
      Compositions containing a compound having episufide structures also show large reactivity in the presence of a curing catalyst.
      <br/>
      For example, when such compositions are left standing in a completely adiabatic system, abnormal polymerization takes place to generate a large amount of heat and to form bubbles and fumes.
      <br/>
      Therefore, to dispose these compounds and compositions, the compounds and the compositions cannot be left standing but must be divided into small portions and kept under control at a low temperature.
      <br/>
      Disposal in a large amount has been actually impossible.
      <br/>
      Moreover, compositions containing a compound having epithio groups contain a large amount of sulfur and there is the possibility that toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, sulfur oxide and hydrogen sulfide are generated in the abnormal polymerization.
      <br/>
      Thus, development of a process for mildly solidifying these compositions for disposal has been desired.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">An object of the present invention is to provide a process for treating for disposal an unused portion of a mixture comprising a compound having epithio structures represented by formula (1) shown below and a catalyst for curing the compound obtained in a process comprising casting and polymerizing the mixture to produce an optical material, wherein the portion of the mixture is solidified mildly for disposal.</p>
    <p num="6">
      As the result of intensive studies by the present inventors to develop the process for treating the above compound having epithio structures, it was found that the compound having epithio structures represented by formula (1) shown below can be mildly solidified when an acidic substance is added to a mixture containing the compound and a catalyst for curing the compound.
      <br/>
      The present invention was completed on the basis of this knowledge.

      <br/>
      A plurality of types of the acidic inorganic compounds and the acidic organic compounds may be used in combination.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      Among the above compounds, acidic organic compounds are preferable and monohydric and dihydric phenols are more preferable.
      <br/>
      The amount can be changed as desired depending on the acid strength of the acidic substance.
      <br/>
      The acidic substance may be added in an amount of 0.01 to 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the mixture containing the compound having epithio structures represented by formula (1) and the catalyst for curing the compound.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      An optical material is produced by mixing the main materials and the auxiliary materials, subsequently casting the obtained mixture into a mold and curing the mixture.
      <br/>
      An unused portion of this mixture containing the compound having epithio structures represented by formula (1) and the catalyst for curing the compound is disposed as a waste material.
      <br/>
      This portion is treated in accordance with the process of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The acidic substance is added to the unused portion of the mixture to solidify the portion for disposal.
      <br/>
      This process is specifically described in the following:
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      The temperature in the addition of the acidic substance is not particularly limited as long as the compound having epithio structures represented by formula (1) is not polymerized rapidly and can be mixed well with the acidic substance.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the acidic substance can be added at a temperature of -50 to 100 (degree)  C. It is preferable that the mixture obtained after the addition of the acidic substance is made as uniform as possible.
      <br/>
      When the mixture is not sufficiently uniform, there is the possibility that portions of abnormal solidification or insufficient solidification are formed in the mixture.
      <br/>
      The mixture obtained after the addition can be solidified by simply leaving the mixture at a suitable temperature.
      <br/>
      The temperature of solidification may be different depending on the type and the amount of the acidic substance, the total amount of the monomer and the amount of heat removed from the solidified system.
      <br/>
      In general, the mixture can be solidified at a temperature in the range of -50 to 100 (degree)  C. It is preferable that the mixture is solidified at a temperature of 50 (degree)  C. or lower when safety with respect to abnormal reactions is considered and 0 (degree)  C. or higher when economy, i.e., the time required for solidification, is considered.
      <br/>
      In other words, the temperature is preferably in the range of 0 to 50 (degree)  C. It is preferable that the temperature is kept constant after the acidic substance is added until the solidification is completed.
      <br/>
      However, the temperature may be changed within the above range.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      To summarize the advantage of the invention, a mixture containing a compound having an epithio structure represented by formula (1) and a catalyst for curing the compound can be solidified mildly for disposal in accordance with the process of the present invention in which the mixture is solidified by addition of an acidic substance.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is not necessary that the portion of the mixture unused in the casting and polymerization is divided into small portions and kept at a low temperature before the mixture is solidified.
      <br/>
      A large amount of the compound having epithio structures represented by formula (1) can be solidified.
