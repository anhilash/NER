      This application claims priority benefit of U.S. patent application Ser.

      No. 60/094,019, filed on Jul. 24, 1998, which is hereby incorporated by reference.

    <p num="2">The invention relates to composite materials on the basis of one or more non-acid, non-ionic, hydrophilic crosslinker monomers and one or more non-acid, non-ionic, hydrophilic dilution monomers having a viscosity of &lt;1 Pas, which are suitable in particular as dental materials.</p>
    <p num="3">Dental materials which are capable of releasing ions, such as for example fluoride, calcium or hydroxide ions, in the oral cavity are increasingly of interest because of their remineralizing, bioactive and cariostatic action.</p>
    <p num="4">Restorative dental materials which display a caries-inhibiting action because they contain sources of fluoride, such as special chlorohexidine-fluoride compounds, are known e.g. from U. Salz, Phillip Journal 14 (1997) 296.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Further examples of ion-releasing dental materials are glass ionomer cements and compomers whose organic matrix is made up at least in part from acid monomers, oligomers or polymers (A. D. Wilson, J. W. McLean, Glasionomer Cement, Quintessence Publishers, Chicago 1988; J. Nicholson, M. Anstice, Trends Polym.
      <br/>
      Sci. 2 (1994) 272; R. Hickel, L. Kremers, C. Haffner, Quintessenz 47 (1996) 1581).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Glass ionomer cements are water-containing, two-component cements on the basis of polymeric organic acids such as for example poly(acrylic acid) and powdery, solid bases such as calcium-fluoride-aluminium silicate glasses.
      <br/>
      The curing of the cement takes place through ionic reaction between polymer-bound COOH groups and the calcium or aluminium ions emerging from the filler, so that the components of the glass ionomer cement can be mixed only shortly before use.
      <br/>
      This is laborious, and moreover the inclusion of air is unavoidable in most cases, which adversely affects the strength of the material.
      <br/>
      Because of their poor bending strength, glass ionomer cements are not suitable for occlusion-bearing fillings.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The term compomers is taken to mean compositions which are composed of polymerizable acid monomers and ion-releasing glass particles.
      <br/>
      They are anhydrous single-component systems which cure through radical polymerization of the monomer matrix.
      <br/>
      Acid-base reaction takes place to a small extent only when water is absorbed into the filling via saliva.
      <br/>
      The non-cured materials are moisture-sensitive, and uncontrolled contact with water, for example during production or storage, leads to a premature curing which makes the material unusable.
      <br/>
      Compomers have a greater mechanical strength than glass ionomer cements, but frequently display a smaller ion release.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Both glass ionomer cements and compomers generally display a high ion-release capacity when the matrix of the materials has an adequate hydrophilic character which encourages absorption of water.
      <br/>
      In the case of glass ionomer cements, the matrix is formed by polyalkene acids, whereas in the case of compomers it is above all carboxylic acid-containing monomers that are used as matrix materials.
      <br/>
      However, since a high water content or a high water absorption has a disadvantageous effect on the mechanical properties of polymers, it was not previously possible to produce materials having a high ion-release capacity which simultaneously display a high mechanical strength.
    </p>
    <p num="9">EP 0 449 399 B1 discloses as underfilling materials suitable composites on the basis of ion-releasing fillers and a mixture of customary dental monomers, such as e.g. the di-methacrylate of ethoxylated bisphenol-A, a hydrophobic dimethacrylate, with the urethane dimethacrylate comprising 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and 2,2,4-trimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate, which do not contain acid monomers but do display only a small ion release.</p>
    <p num="10">The object of the invention is to provide composite materials having a high ion-release capacity and high mechanical strength capacity which are storage-stable in the uncured state even under moist conditions and whose mechanical properties are not substantially impaired after curing by the addition of water.</p>
    <p num="11">This object is achieved by composite materials on the basis of polymerizable monomers which are characterized in that the material contains a mixture of</p>
    <p num="12">
      (a) at least one non-acid, non-ionic, hydrophilic crosslinker monomer,
      <br/>
      (b) at least one non-acid, non-ionic, hydrophilic dilution monomer having a viscosity of &lt;1 Pas and
      <br/>
      (c) at least one ion-releasing filler.
    </p>

    <p num="52">
      All the quantities that are given above and in the following in the description and in the claims of the components of the transparent fluoride-containing glasses are to be understood as values which were obtained as follows.
      <br/>
      The quantities of the oxides were ascertained by quantitative determination of the corresponding cations, i.e. Si, Ca, Na, B, Mg, Sr, Zn and Al, by means of X-ray fluorescence analysis and conversion of the obtained values into the quantities of corresponding oxides.
      <br/>
      Thus the level of a cation serves as a basis for deducing the level of the corresponding oxides.
      <br/>
      In contrast to this, the quantity of F- is determined directly by means of an electrode which is selective for fluoride ions after the glass had been subjected to a soda-potash dissolution.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      As a result of the high F-contents of the transparent glasses, there is formation to a noticeable extent of fluorides, such as e.g. CaF2, in the glass.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the calculated oxide contents and accordingly the absolute oxygen content of the glass are too high, and the sum of the components exceeds 100%.
      <br/>
      The portion going beyond 100% is therefore shown as so-called "fluorine-equivalent oxygen".
      <br/>
      This is customary for silicate glasses containing fluoride and is described at length e.g. in J. Lange "Rohstoffe der Glasindustrie", Deutscher Verlag fur Grundstoffindustrie, Leipzig, Stuttgart (1993), pp. 221-223.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      It is generally customary in glass manufacture to add small quantities of fluoride as flux in order to improve the melting behaviour of the glass in question.
      <br/>
      However, the overall structure of the glasses is not substantially changed by these small portions of fluoride.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      In contrast to this, a high fluoride portion of at least 4,0 wt.-% incorporated into the transparent glass used according to the invention, which substantially changes the basic structure of the glass compared with corresponding glasses which are free from fluoride or have only small fluoride contents as a result of the use of flux.
      <br/>
      A marked degradation of the SiO4 tetrahedron network structure of the glass occurs because of this high fluorine content and the simultaneous incorporation of other network transformer ions, such as e.g. Ca2+ or Na+. A glass structure forms which can no longer be explained by the classical network theory.
      <br/>
      The glass structure comes close to a new glass structure which is called "inverted glass structure".
      <br/>
      The term inverted glass is taken to mean a glass which has less than 50 mol.-% network-former material.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      As a result of the changed structure, it is above all the refractive index of the glass which changes, and surprisingly an emission of fluorine ions with a simultaneous emission of calcium ions from the glass is also possible.
      <br/>
      When the composite material is used in the dental field, the desired alkaline action can therefore be brought about in the oral cavity by the calcium ions together with carbonate in the saliva, and, through the fluorine ions, their known remineralizing action.
      <br/>
      Calcium ions also promote the remineralization process.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Furthermore, the high fluoride content of the glass brings about a marked reduction in its refractive index to values below 1.60 and preferably below 1.56. The organic matrix of the composite forming through curing of the polymerizable monomer has a very similar refractive index, for which reason the whole composite material can likewise be translucent or even transparent.
      <br/>
      This is naturally of particular advantage if the composite material is to be used for the production of visible dental restorations, which naturally are to have similar optical properties to translucent natural dental material.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      To produce the transparent glass used according to the invention, suitable raw materials, in particular oxides, carbonates and fluorides, are mixed and melted at temperatures of in particular 1000 to 1600 (degree)  C. to form a glass.
      <br/>
      The glass melt that forms is then quenched by being poured into water.
      <br/>
      The obtained transparent glass frit is then ground, dried and can be combined with polymerizable monomer to give the polymerizable composite material according to the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="59">The glass is customarily used as powder, the average size of the particles customarily being 1 to 100  MU m and preferably 10 to 30  MU m relative to the number of particles.</p>

      <br/>
      The term mini-fillers is taken to mean fillers having a particle size of 0.5 to 1.5  MU m and the term macro-fillers to describe fillers having a particle size of 10 to 20  MU m.

    <p num="62">
      In addition, the compositions according to the invention can, in case of need, contain further auxiliaries, in particular stabilizers, UV absorbers, dyestuffs, pigments and/or slip agents.
      <br/>
      The term stabilizers is taken to mean those substances which prevent a premature polymerization and thus above all increase the stability in storage of monomer mixtures and composites, without however impairing the properties of the cured materials.
      <br/>
      Preferred stabilizers are hydroquinone mono-methyl ether (MEHQ) and 2,6-di-tert.-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT).

      It was surprisingly found that, through the simultaneous use of the crosslinker and dilution monomers named above, compositions having a high ion-release capacity can be obtained which are storage-stable in the uncured state even in moist conditions and whose mechanical properties are not significantly worsened by the addition of water.

    <p num="69">Testpieces were formed from the composite pastes in accordance with ISO standard 4049 (1988), cured by irradiation with light of a wavelength of 400-500 nm (2 * 3 minutes) and their mechanical properties were then determined.</p>
    <p num="70">To establish the fluoride-release capacity, cured testpieces (diameter=20 mm, H=1.5 mm) were stored in 30 ml of buffer solution at 37 (degree)  C. in the agitator and the amount of released fluoride was measured after specific intervals using a fluorelectrode.</p>
    <p num="71">
      The results summarized in Table 3 show that the hydrophilic composite 1, which contains no acid or ionic monomer components, releases about ten times more fluoride ions within 28 days than does Compoglass.RTM., a compomer customary in the trade that is based on COOH-acid monomers (filler: SP-2034 and YbF3).
      <br/>
      The fluoride-ion release of composite 1 is thus of the same order as that of glass ionomer cements (cf. e.g. Vivaglass.RTM., glass ionomer cement based on polyacrylic acid, filler: SP-2034 and YbF3).
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      However, composite 1 displays clearly better mechanical properties and a higher resistance to water than do the compomer and the glass ionomer cement.
      <br/>
      Even six days' storage in water followed by 24-hour boiling scarcely impair the mechanical properties.
    </p>
    <p num="73">Uncured composite 1 was storage-stable under moist conditions (90% atmospheric humidity) over the 8-week investigation period.</p>
    <p num="74">If the hydrophilic GDMA in composite 1 is replaced by the hydrophobic TEGDMA (composite 2), a clearly smaller fluoride release is measured, although composite 2 contained, instead of SP-2034, a greater proportion of alkaline glass which displays a clearly higher fluoride release than SP-2034.</p>
    <p num="75">
      Composite 3 contains exclusively SP-2034 as ion-releasing filler.
      <br/>
      Its fluoride release is comparable with that of Compoglass.RTM. but, unlike Compoglass.RTM., composite 3 is storage-stable in the uncured state even under moist conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      In composite 4, GDMA was replaced by TEGDMA.
      <br/>
      As in the case of composites 1 and 2, this replacement brings about a clear reduction in fluoride release.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      In composite 5, the hydrophilic but multifunctional HEMA was used instead of GDMA.
      <br/>
      Although composite 5 displays a clearly higher fluoride release than does composite 4, the mechanical properties are unsatisfactory after the addition of water.
