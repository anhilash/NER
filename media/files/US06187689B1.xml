    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">a) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and its manufacturing method, and more particularly to a highly integrated semiconductor device having fine patterns and its manufacturing method.</p>
    <p num="4">b) Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      As the integration density of semiconductor integrated circuit devices increases the wiring patterns (inclusive of electrode patterns) are made finer and highly integrated.
      <br/>
      In order to form intersecting wiring patterns, it is necessary to form a plurality of wiring layers with interlevel or interlayer insulating films being interposed therebetween.
      <br/>
      In order to form multi-layered wiring patterns, it is necessary to perform photolithography for forming contact holes in insulating layers and for patterning wiring layers.
    </p>
    <p num="6">The following methods (A) to (D) are known as the methods of patterning a wiring or electrode conductive material layer.</p>
    <p num="7">
      (A) As shown in FIG. 32, a conductive material layer 3 is formed on an insulating film 2 covering the surface of a semiconductor substrate 1.
      <br/>
      A resist film is coated on the conductive material layer 3, and resist patterns 4A to 4C having a desired shape are patterned therefrom by photolithography in a well-known way.
      <br/>
      By using these resist patterns as a mask, the conductive material layer 3 is selectively dry-etched.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      (B) As a patterning mask, a silicon oxide film or silicon nitride having a low etching rate is used (for example, refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2-125425).
      <br/>
      Also used as a patterning mask for patterning a polysilicon layer is a laminate of a silicon oxide or silicon nitride film and a resist layer formed thereon (for example, refer to J. S. Maa et al.: J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B9(3), May/June, 1991, pp. 1596-1597).
    </p>
    <p num="9">(C) In coating a resist mask on a high reflectivity substrate, a resist layer mixed with light-absorbing dye is used.</p>
    <p num="10">
      (D) In patterning a conductive material layer formed on a high reflectivity substrate, an antireflection film is coated on the surface of the conductive material layer.
      <br/>
      As an antireflection film, a silicon nitride film is used (for example, refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publications Nos. 1-241125 and 5-55130) or a TiN film is used (for example, refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publications Nos. 60-240127, 61-185928, and 63-232432).
    </p>
    <p num="11">A laminate structure of a barrier metal layer, an aluminum layer and an anti-reflection layer such as TiN or amorphous silicon is etched by using resist patterns as a sole mask (P. E. Riley et al.: Solid State Technology February, 1999, pp. 47-55).</p>
    <p num="12">When a fine wiring pattern is formed by the method (A), there occurs a phenomenon (the microloading effects of an etching rate) that an etching rate changes with a wiring space (space width).</p>
    <p num="13">As shown in FIG. 32, in the case of patterns reducing space widths between adjacent pairs of the resist patterns 4A, 4B, 4C, . . . , the etching rate may become lower as the space width is narrowed as shown in FIG. 33. If the conductive material layer is etched to a predetermined depth at the narrow space width, the layer at the broad space width may be etched excessively and the underlie layer such as the insulating film 2 may be thinned.</p>
    <p num="14">
      In some cases, an etching rate is increased as the space width is narrowed.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 34, in the case of patterns increasing space widths between adjacent pairs of resist patterns 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, . . . , the etching rate may be increased as the space width is narrowed as shown in FIG. 35. Therefore, if a conductive material layer 3 is etched to a predetermined (depth at the broad space width, the layer at the narrow space width may be etched excessively, and if a selective etching ratio of the underlie layer is low, the underlie layer may be etched as indicated at X1 and X2.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      When a fine wiring pattern is formed, there occurs a phenomenon (the microloading effects of a shape of an etched layer) that a shape or size of an etched layer changes with the space width.
      <br/>
      Such a size change lowers a yield of forming wiring patterns.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Specifically, as shown in FIG. 36, if densely distributed wiring patterns 3P and 3Q are formed by dry etching by using densely distributed resist patterns 4P and 4Q, the width WD of the densely distributed wiring pattern 3P for example may become nearly equal to the width WO of the resist pattern 4P (WD,  (congruent to) WO).
      <br/>
      In contrast, as shown in FIG. 37, if an isolated wiring pattern 3R is formed by the same dry etching by using an isolated resist pattern 4R, generally the width WI of the isolated wiring pattern 3R becomes broader than the width WD shown in FIG. 36 (WI &gt;WD).
      <br/>
      For the etching of a laminated layer of WSi2 /polycrystalline silicon, the width exceptionally becomes WI &lt;WD.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In forming fine wiring patterns, the amount of thinning a film of mask material such as resist increases and the etching selectivity of the mask material (etching ratio of the layer to be etched with respect to the mask) lowers.
      <br/>
      There is therefore a tendency of lowering a yield of forming wiring patterns.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      A film of mask material is thinned during dry etching by collisions of ions or particles having high kinetic energy with the mask material as well as the chemical reaction between gas and the mask material.
      <br/>
      Collisions of particles having high kinetic energy with the mask material truncate the shoulders of a resist film 4S as shown in FIG. 38. The angle of each mask material shoulder takes a value giving the best sputtering efficiency.
      <br/>
      A real angle is not 45 (degree)  which gives the best efficiency in purely physical etching.
      <br/>
      The phenomenon of truncating the shoulders of mask material is called "faceting", and the plane formed at each shoulder is called a "facet".
      <br/>
      FIG. 39 shows a state where two opposing facets meet each other.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      FIG. 38 illustrates a process of forming a wiring layer by dry-etching a conductive material layer 3 by using the resist layer 4S as a mask.
      <br/>
      A line width (wiring pattern width) K is set to have a small value approximately equal to the thickness T of the conductive material layer 3.
      <br/>
      Even if faceting occurs as shown in FIG. 38, the top surface of the resist layer 4S is left until the right and left facets meet each other.
      <br/>
      In this case, the amount T1 of thinning a resist film is equal to that of a resist pattern having a sufficiently large area as compared with the thickness T of the conductive layer 3 to be etched.
      <br/>
      The sufficiently large area means a large dimension in any in-plane direction of a resist pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      This phenomenon becomes more conspicuous as the width of a wiring pattern becomes small.
      <br/>
      That is to say, an effective selectivity of the wiring pattern to resist lowers more as the wiring pattern becomes narrower.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 40 shows a dependency upon a line width K of an amount of thinning a resist film, a selection ratio with respect to the resist film, and a resist taper angle  THETA .
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 40, the resist taper angle  THETA  is an angle between a line extended from a facet and a bottom surface of the conductive material layer 3.
      <br/>
      Data shown in FIG. 40 were obtained when aluminum alloy was etched by using BCl3 /Cl2 as an etchant gas and a microwave plasma etcher to be described later with reference to FIG. 16. The data shows that as the line width K becomes narrow, the amount of thinning a resist film increases (the selection ratio of the conductive material to resist lowers) and the resist taper angle  THETA  becomes large.
    </p>
    <p num="22">Although a resist mask used as an etching mask is preferably made thin, a substantial selection ratio wiring patterns with respect to an etching mask lowers as wiring patterns are made fine, as previously described with reference to FIGS. 38 to 40. As a result, if a resist layer is made thin, the resist mask may be etched completely during etching and wiring patterns may be broken.</p>
    <p num="23">
      In order to prevent a selection ratio from being lowered as patterns are made fine, it is necessary to develop etching techniques having a high selection ratio with respect to mask material or to use mask material providing a high selection ratio.
      <br/>
      The method (B) is effective for raising a selection ratio with respect to mask material.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      However, if a silicon oxide film is used as a patterning mask, this mask is associated with a problem that it rarely has a function as an antireflection film.
      <br/>
      A silicon nitride film used as a patterning mask has an insufficient antireflection function.
      <br/>
      With either method, inorganic mask material is left on the surface of a wiring pattern or an electrode after etching.
      <br/>
      If the substrate is exposed to a high temperature at a later process, the mask material may be peeled off from the surface of the wiring pattern or electrode to produce mask material particles, because of a difference of thermal expansion coefficients between mask material and conductive wiring material.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a yield is lowered.
      <br/>
      Such a phenomenon occurs at a heat treatment such as a lamp annealing process for activating impurities ion-implanted into source/drain regions and a CVD process for forming an interlevel or interlayer insulating film at a temperature of 400 to 500 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Another problem associated with the formation of a wiring pattern on a high reflectivity substrate is that a pattern size precision is lowered by light reflections at the substrate surface.</p>
    <p num="26">
      Specifically, suppose a situation as shown in FIG. 41. Insulating films 5A and 5B are formed on the surface of a semiconductor substrate 1, forming a step on the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      A resist layer 7A is formed over the substrate surface on a wiring material layer 6A.
      <br/>
      Light 9 is irradiated to the resist layer 7A at the exposure process through a mask 8 having a desired pattern.
      <br/>
      Light is reflected in a direction different from the incident direction at sloped surfaces A-B and C-D of the high reflectivity wiring material layer 6A, and is incident uncork the regions of the resist layer 7A not to be exposed.
      <br/>
      The regions not to be exposed are applied with light.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the resist development process is performed.
      <br/>
      FIG. 42 is a plan view of the etched resist pattern, and FIGS. 43 and 44 are cross sectional views taken along lines X-X' and Y-Y' of FIG. 42, respectively.
      <br/>
      A resist pattern 7 with a narrow part such as grown in FIG. 42 is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="27">At the flat region, the cross section of the resist pattern 7 is rectangular and has a designed width W1 as shown in FIG. 43. At the region surrounded by the insulating films 5A and 5B, the cross section of the resist pattern 7 is semicircular and has a narrower width W2 than the designed width W1, as shown in FIGS. 42 and 44. Therefore, as the wiring material layer 6A is dry-etched by using the resist layer 7 as a mask, the obtained wiring layer has a narrowed part the portion of width W2 or is broken at this portion.</p>
    <p num="28">Still another problem associated with the formation of a wiring pattern on a high reflectivity substrate is that a pattern size changes at the regions having different reflectivities.</p>
    <p num="29">
      For example, as shown in FIG. 45, an insulating film 11 is formed over a substrate 1, covering an insulating film 5 and polycide gate electrode layer 10.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, a contact hole 11a reaching the substrate surface and a contact hole 11b reaching the polycide gate electrode layer 10 are formed in the insulating film 11 by dry etching using the resist layer 12 as a mask.
      <br/>
      In this case, the size WA of the contact hole 11a becomes smaller than the size WB of the contact hole 11b.
      <br/>
      The larger size of the contact hole 11b reduces an alignment margin at the photolithography process.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 46, in some cases the contact hole 11b may be off-set from the position of the polycide gate electrode layer 10.
      <br/>
      Side wall oxide of the gate electrode is etched at an oxide etching process.
      <br/>
      The gate wiring interconnects the gate electrode and source/drain region.
      <br/>
      In order to avoid such a case, it is necessary to use a large alignment margin at the design stage, and so the integration density should be lowered.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      A large size of a contact hole at a high reflectivity region may result from the phenomenon that the diameter R of the contact hole in the resist layer 12 becomes large.
      <br/>
      The reason of the phenomenon that the diameter R becomes large will be explained in the following.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In photolithography techniques, photosensitive material which makes resist hard to be soluble in development liquid, is decomposed only at the region exposed to light to make the resist easy to be soluble in the development liquid.
      <br/>
      A resist pattern is formed by selectively dissolving the resist.
      <br/>
      The photosensitive material is decomposed more as the exposure energy is increased.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the diameter R of the contact hole shown in FIG. 47 becomes larger as the exposure energy is increased.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Since the polycide gate electrode layer 10 having a high reflectivity exists under the resist layer 12, light reflected by this high reflectivity material is applied to the resist layer 12.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the effective exposure energy absorbed by the resist layer 12 becomes larger than at the region having a low reflectivity.
      <br/>
      As a result, decomposition of the photosensitive is enhanced and the diameter R of a contact hole becomes large.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The method (C) uses a resist layer mixed with dye which absorbs exposure light.
      <br/>
      Therefore, reflection at the lower level layer is reduced so that the size precision to be degraded by light reflection can be suppressed to some degree.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      However, as shown in FIG. 48, even if a resist layer 15 containing dye is formed to have a desired pattern, on a wiring layer 14 covering an insulating film 5, the cross section of the resist layer 15 has a tapered skirt.
      <br/>
      This is because the exposure energy in resist is attenuated toward a deeper region from the surface thereof, and the region not exposed is left unetched.
      <br/>
      The size of a resist pattern becomes large as the exposure energy becomes small.
      <br/>
      A pattern width is generally and often defined by the bottom of a resist pattern.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a pattern is designed on the assumption that a skirt is formed.
      <br/>
      The skirt portions a and b of the resist layer 15 are etched when the wiring material layer 14 is dry-etched to form wiring patterns.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the wiring layer may be thinned.
      <br/>
      The resist layer 15 containing dye lowers a resolution of photolithography.
      <br/>
      It can be said therefore that the method (C) is not suitable for fine patterns.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The method (D) suppresses light reflection by forming an antireflection film on the surface of a conductive material layer under a resist layer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, this method is effective for preventing a size precision from being degraded by light reflection, and does not have the problem associated with the method (C).
    </p>
    <p num="36">Although the method (D) uses an antireflection film, a sufficiently thick resist layer is used as an etching mask so that the microloading effects during dry etching cannot be reduced.</p>
    <p num="37">
      Photolithography techniques for patterning a conductive material layer have been explained above.
      <br/>
      Similar photolithography techniques are also used for forming a contact hole or a recess in an insulating film.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      A reflectivity of the surface of an insulating film is considerably small as compared to that of the surface of a conductive material layer.
      <br/>
      An insulator such as silicon oxide is transparent relative to ultraviolet rays and allows incident light to reach the surface of the underlie layer.
      <br/>
      If a high reflectivity surface such as metal and semiconductor exists under an insulating layer, a pattern precision is also degraded by reflected light beams and the microloading effects also occur.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="39">It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel method of forming a conductive layer capable of forming a fine conductive pattern with a good size precision.</p>
    <p num="40">It is another object of the present invention to provide a novel method of forming an insulating film capable of forming a fine pattern hole or recess with a good size precision.</p>
    <p num="41">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, comprising the steps of: a) providing a substrate; b) forming a conductive layer over the substrate, the conductive layer serving as a main conductive layer; c) forming a conductive antireflection layer on the main conductive layer; d) providing A resist mask for patterning the conductive antireflection Layer; e) selectively removing the conductive antireflection layer by a fist etching gas to form a laminated mask of the resist mask and a conductive antireflection mask self-aligned with the resist mask; and f) selectively removing the main conductive layer through the laminated mask by a second etching gas which is different from the first etching gas.</p>
    <p num="42">
      In patterning the main conductive layer, the unetched portion of the conductive antireflection layer is used as an etching mask.
      <br/>
      As the conductive antireflection layer, for example, a TiN layer may be used.
      <br/>
      In the case of the TiN layer for example, the antireflection effect is obtained if it has a thickness of about 30 to 50 nm.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="48">
      FIGS. 1 to 15 illustrate a method of manufacturing a MOS IC according to an embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      The processes (1) to (15) of this method will be described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 15 whose serial numbers corresponds to the process number.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      (1) As shown in FIG. 1, on the surface of a semiconductor substrate 30 made of, for example, silicon, a field insulating film 32 made of thermal silicon oxide is formed by well-known selective oxidation.
      <br/>
      The insulating film 32 has holes 32A and 32B where active regions are formed.
      <br/>
      The substrate surfaces in the holes 32A and 32B are thermally oxidized to form gate insulating films 34A and 34B made of thermal silicon oxide.
      <br/>
      An Si3 N4 film may be used instead of the thermal silicon oxide films 34A and 34B.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      (2) As shown in FIG. 2A, an electrode material layer 36 is deposited over the substrate surface, covering the insulating films 32, 34A, and 34B.
      <br/>
      As the electrode material layer 36, a polycrystalline Si layer or polycide layer (e.g., WSi2 layer 36b on polycrystalline Si layer 36a) may be used.
      <br/>
      A conductive material layer 38 serving both as an antireflection film and etching mask is deposited on the electrode material layer 36.
      <br/>
      As the conductive material layer 38, a TiN layer or TiON layer may be used.
      <br/>
      These layers may be deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or reactive sputtering.
      <br/>
      The conductive material layer 38 may be deposited to a minimum thickness ensuring an antireflection effect.
      <br/>
      For example, the thickness of 30 to 50 nm is sufficient if a TiN layer or TiON layer is used and light of i- or g-line of mercury is used for exposure.
      <br/>
      The conductive material layer 38 may be TiN, TiON, CrN, or a laminate of these materials.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown in FIG. 2B the (conductive material layer 38 is a stack or laminate of a Ti layer 38a and a TiN layer 38b.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      (3) In the processes illustrated in FIGS. 3 to 5, a desired resist pattern is formed by photolithography.
      <br/>
      First, as shown in FIG. 3, a resist layer 40 is formed over the substrate, by spin coating, covering the conductive material layer 38.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      (4) Next, as shown in FIG. 4, an exposure process is executed.
      <br/>
      Namely, ultraviolet exposure rays are irradiated to the resist layer 40 by using light shielding masks MA and MB.
      <br/>
      Since the antireflection conductive layer 38 is formed under the resist 40, the exposure light is attenuated by the anti-reflection layer 38 and prevented from being intensely reflected by the underlie reflective film (polycrystalline silicon).
      <br/>
      Therefore, the size of the resist pattern 40 can be correctly controlled.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      (5) Next, as shown in FIG. 5, the resist layer 40 is subjected to a development process to leave resist layers 40A and 40B having desired patterns.
      <br/>
      The resist layers 40A and 40B have a thickness sufficient for patterning at lest the conductive material layer 38 but not so thick as to assure some thickness to remain after the following etching.
      <br/>
      For example, it may be 0.5  MU m. It is therefore possible to relieve the requirements of a depth of focus of photolithography and to form a fine pattern.
      <br/>
      The microloading effects are also reduced because the resist layer thinner than a conventional resist layer is patterned.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      (6) As shown in FIG. 6, by using the resist layers 40A and 40B as a mask, the conductive material layer 38 is patterned in a selfaligned manner by dry etching to leave conductive material layers 38A and 38B (parts of the conductive layer 38).
      <br/>
      As etching gas, it is preferable to use Cl2.
      <br/>
      When a TiN layer is etched, the substrate may be heated or not be heated, but the substrate temperature should be 20 (degree)  C. or higher.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      (7) As shown in FIG. 7, by using the stack of the resist layers 40A and 40B and the underlying conductive material layers 38A and 38B as a mask, the electrode material layer 36 is etched by dry etching.
      <br/>
      The resist layer 40A and 40B may be lost during the etching for patterning the electrode layer 36.
      <br/>
      The conductive material layers 38A and 38B will work as a mask in such a case.
      <br/>
      If the resist layers 40A and 40B remain after the etching, they are removed by ashing or by washing in organic solvent.
    </p>
    <p num="56">(8) As shown in FIG. 8, the electrode layer 36 is patterned after the pattern of the conductive material layer 38.</p>
    <p num="57">A laminate of the electrode material layer 36A and conductive material layer 38A constitutes a gate electrode layer 42A, and a laminate of the electrode material layer 36B and conductive material layer 38B constitutes a gate electrode layer 42B.</p>
    <p num="58">Since the antireflection film is patterned and used as an etching mask, it is not necessary to use another process of forming an etching mask.</p>
    <p num="59">
      In patterning the electrode material layer 36, gas containing O2 or F, such as Cl2 /O2, and HBr/O2, is used as etching gas.
      <br/>
      If gas containing O2 or F is used, titanium oxide (TiO, TiO2, Ti2 O3) or titanium fluoride (TiF3) of a low vapor pressure is formed on the surface of TiN (or TiON), and TiN (or TiON) etching is suppressed.
      <br/>
      As a result, the TiN (or TiON) layer accomplishes a reliable function of an etching mask.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      (9) As shown in FIG. 9, by using the electrode layers 42A and 42B and insulating film 32 as a mask, impurity ions are selectively implanted to the substrate surface to form source/drain regions of a low impurity concentration.
      <br/>
      Side spacers 44A and 44B are formed on the side surfaces of the electrode layers 42A and 42B.
      <br/>
      For example, the side spacer is formed by depositing an SiO2 film by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) conformal to the substrate surface and anisotropically etching it by reactive ion etching (RIE).
      <br/>
      Thereafter, similar to the above, impurity ions are implanted to the substrate surface to form source/drain regions of a high impurity concentration.
      <br/>
      Source regions 46S1 and 46S2 and drain regions 46D1 and 46D2 respectively having an additional low impurity concentration region are therefore formed.
      <br/>
      A MOS transistor TA includes the electrode layer 42A, source region 46S1, and drain region 46D1.
      <br/>
      A MOS transistor TB includes the electrode layer 42B, source region 46S2, and drain region 46D2.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      (10) As shown in FIG. 10, an interlevel insulating film 48 is formed over the substrate surface by chemical vapor deposition or other processes, covering the transistors TA and TB and insulating film 32.
      <br/>
      A silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, a phosphorus silicate glass (PSG) film, or a boron phosphorous silicate glass (BPSG) film may be used as the insulating film 48.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      (11) As shown in FIG. 11, a resist layer 50 having a desired contact hole pattern is formed on the insulating film 48 by photolithography.
      <br/>
      If the insulating film 48 is transparent, the conductive material layers 38A and 38B constituting the gate electrode layers function as the antireflection layers when the resist layer 50 is exposed.
      <br/>
      Reflected light reduces at the region above the gate electrode layers so that the size precision of the resist pattern becomes good.
      <br/>
      Light of g- and i-line passes through a silicon oxide film (any of BPSG, PSG, SOG, and TEOS oxide) used as the interlevel insulating film.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the precision of a pattern size can be affected by a reflectivity of the film under the interlevel insulating film.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The material of gate electrode is generally polycrystalline silicon and refractory metal silicide such as tungsten silicide.
      <br/>
      These materials have a reflectivity higher than a silicon substrate and lowers the patterning precision because exposure light is reflected by these materials.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the antireflection film is left on the gate electrode so that light can be prevented from being intensely reflected by the gate electrode.
      <br/>
      Even if an antireflection film is not formed on the interlevel insulating film, it is therefore possible to prevent the wiring precision from being lowered.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      (12) By using the resist layer 50 as a mask, a contact hole 48a for the source 46S1 and contact holes 48b and 48c for the gates 42A and 42B are formed in the insulating film 48 by dry etching.
      <br/>
      Contact holes reaching the substrate and gates can be formed by over-etching the antireflection film on the gates without changing etching gas even after the holes reach the antireflection film on the gates.
      <br/>
      Contact holes for the source 46S2 and drains 46D1 and 46D2 are also formed in the insulating film 48 at the regions not shown in FIG. 12. If an insulating film such as titanium oxide or titanium fluoride is formed on the surface of the conductive material layers 38A and 38B, in order to ensure good electrical contact, the contact holes 48b and 48c are formed to pass through the conductive layers 38A and 38B and reach the electrode material layers 36A and 36B, respectively.
      <br/>
      If an insulating film is not formed on the surface of the conductive material layers 38A and 38B, the contact holes 48b and 48c are formed to reach the surfaces of the conductive material layers 38A and 38B, respectively.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the resist layer 50 is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      (13) As shown in FIG. 13, a wiring layer 52 of lamination of a barrier metal layer (such as Ti, TiN) and an Al or Al alloy layer (made of Al--Si--Cu, Al--Si, etc.) is deposited over the substrate surface, covering the insulating film 48 and filling the contact holes 48a to 48c.
      <br/>
      A conductive layer 54 serving as both antireflection and etching mask is formed on the wiring material layer 52, in the manner described with the processes of FIGS. 2A and 2B. The material of the conductive layer 54 is a material selected from a group consisting of TiN, TiON, CrN, and a laminate thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="66">(14) As shown in FIG. 14, a resist layer 56 having a desired wiring pattern is formed on the conductive material layer 54 by photolithography.</p>
    <p num="67">
      (15) By using the resist layer 56 as a mask, the conductive material layer 54 is patterned by dry etching to leave conductive material layers 54A, 54B, and 54C (parts of the conductive material layer 54).
      <br/>
      Since the conductive material layer 54 having an antireflection function exists under the resist layer 56, reflected light reduces.
      <br/>
      By using the resist musk as a mask, the wiring layer 52 is patterned by dry etching to leave wiring material layers 52A, 52B, and 52C (parts of the wiring material layer 52).
      <br/>
      A laminate of the wiring material layer 52A and conductive material layer 54A constitutes a wiring layer 58S1 for the source of the transistor TA.
      <br/>
      A laminate of the wiring material layer 52B and conductive material layer 54B constitutes a wiring layer 58G1 for the gate of the transistor TA.
      <br/>
      A laminate of the wiring material layer 52C and conductive material layer 54C constitutes a wiring layer 58G2 for the gate of the transistor TB.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The conductive material layers 54A, 54B, and 54C are left on the wiring material layers 52A, 52B, and 52C to be used as a film for preventing electromigration.
      <br/>
      Since Ti and TiON are conductive, the electrical characteristics of the conductive material layers 54A, 54B, and 54C are not degraded.
      <br/>
      It is not necessary therefore to use an additional process of forming a film for preventing electromigration.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      In the above embodiment, the electrode material layer 36 and wiring material layer 52 are patterned without removing the resist layer, by using a laminate of the resist layer and conductive material layers 38A and 38B (or 54A, 54B, and 54C) as a mask.
      <br/>
      The resist mask is etched during dry etching for patterning the electrode material layer 36 or wiring material layer 52.
      <br/>
      It may not be necessary therefore to use a separate process of removing the resist layer.

    <p num="70">In order to confirm that a TiN layer is effective as an etching mask, experiments were made in which TiN, WSi2, and polycrystalline Si were etched by using gas containing O2 or F and three types of dry etching systems shown in FIGS. 16 to 18.</p>

      The following conditions were commonly fixed.
      <br/>
      A gas pressure was 5 mTorr, an RF (2 MHz) power was 30 W, a microwave power (anode current of the magnetron) was 160 mA, an electrode cooling water temperature was 20 (degree)  C., an upper coil current was 20.5 A, and a lower coil current was 7.5 A.

    <p num="79">
      As seen from Table 1, if O2 is added to Cl2, an etching rate of TiN lowers and an etching rate of WSi2 increases.
      <br/>
      As a result, a selective etching ratio of WSi2 to TiN is improved.
    </p>
    <p num="80">(B) Use of ECR plasma etcher</p>
    <p num="81">
      TiN having a thickness of 40 nm was etched for five minutes by using the ECR plasma etcher shown in FIG. 17. TiN was scarcely etched.
      <br/>
      The etching conditions were as follows. a flow of Cl2 /O2 was 25/11 sccm, a gas pressure was 2 mTorr, an RF power (13.56 MHz) was 34 W, a microwave (2.45 GHz) power was 1400 W, and an electrode cooling water temperature was 15 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      If it is assumed that TiN having a thickness of 40 nm was etched in five minutes, the etching rate of TiN is 8 nm/min.
      <br/>
      The etching rate of TiN is therefore slower than 8 nm/min.

    <p num="85">For example, in the dry etching of a polycide layer of WSi2 /polycrystalline Si=200/150 nm by using a TiN layer as a mask, if the TiN layer has a thickness of 13.9 nm or more, it can operate as an etching mask even if a 30% over-etch is performed, because the selective etching ratios of WSi2 and polycrystalline Si to TiN are larger than 35.1 and 30.3, respectively.</p>
    <p num="86">
      If a TiN layer on a WSi2 is used as an antireflection film and i- or g-line exposure light is used, the pattern precision is good if the TiN layer has a thickness of 30 to 50 nm.

      TiN, WSi2, and polycrystalline Si were etched by using the magnetron RIE system shown in FIG. 18, and data shown in Table 3 was obtained.

      A flow of HBr/SF6 was 15/45 sccm, a pressure was 20 mTorr, an RF power was 250 W, a magnetic flux density was 30 Gauss, and a cooling water temperature was 40 (degree)  C.

      It can be understood from the calculation using the selective etching ratios shown in Table 3 that in the dry etching of a polycide layer of WSi2 /polycrystalline Si=200/150 nm by using a TiN layer as a mask, it is sufficient if the TiN layer has a thickness of 47.8 nm, even if a 30% over-etch is performed.
      <br/>
      If WSi2 /polycrystalline Si is 100/100 nm, it is sufficient if the TiN layer has a thickness of 26.6 nm (at a 30% over-etch).
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      In the dry etching of a polycide layer using gas containing O2 or F, a TiN can be used as an etching mask because the selective etching ratio of polycide to TiN is large.
      <br/>
      If a TiON layer is used instead of a TiN, the function as an etching mask is further improved because the selective etching ratio of polycide to TiON is higher than TiN.

      In the above embodiment, a conductive layer having an antireflection function and a mask function is used when a conductive layer is patterned.

      (19) As shown in FIG. 19, on the surface of a semiconductor substrate 120 made of, for example, silicon, a field insulating film 122 made of thermal silicon oxide is formed by well-known selective oxidation.
      <br/>
      The substrate surfaces in holes corresponding to active regions are thermally oxidized to form gate insulating films I1 and I2 made of thermal silicon oxide.

      An Si3 N, film may be used instead of the insulating films 11 and 12.

      Polycrystalline Si and silicide (WSi2 or the like) are sequentially deposited over the substrate surface.

      Impurity ions are selectively implanted to the substrate surface to form source/drain regions of a low impurity concentration, by using the gate electrode layers G1 and G2 and insulating film 122 as a mask.

      (20) As shown in FIG. 20, a conductive material layer 126 serving both as an antireflection film and etching mask is formed on the insulating film 124.
      <br/>
      As the conductive material layer 126, a TiN layer or TiON layer may be used.
      <br/>
      These layers may be deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or reactive sputtering.
      <br/>
      The conductive material layer 126 may be deposited to a minimum thickness ensuring an antireflection effect.
      <br/>
      For example, the thickness of 30 to 50 nm is sufficient if a TiN layer or TiON layer is used and light of i- or g-line of mercury is used for exposure.
      <br/>
      The conductive material layer 126 has a function of reducing reflection at the whole area of a resist layer coated on the conductive material layer 126.
      <br/>
      As described earlier, the conductive material layer 126 may be TiN, TiON, CrN, or a laminate of these materials.

      (21) As shown in FIG. 21, a resist layer 128 having a desired hole pattern is formed over the substrate surface by photolithography, covering the conductive material layer 126.
      <br/>
      The resist layer 128 is formed to a thickness sufficient for selectively etching the conductive material layer 126.
      <br/>
      For example, a thickness is set to 0.5  MU m. While the insulating film 124 is selectively etched, the conductive material layer 126 functions as a mask.
      <br/>
      Since the conductive material layer 126 functions as an antireflection film during a resist exposure process, it is possible to prevent a hole size from becoming large at the region above the gate electrode layer.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, light scattering at a sloped surface of a step is suppressed so that it is possible to prevent a hole on the sloped surface from becoming elliptical.

    <p num="107">
      Next, by using the resist layer 128 as a mask, holes corresponding to the holes in the resist layer 128 are formed in the conductive material layer 126 by dry etching.

      As etching gas, it is preferable to use Cl2.

      <br/>
      Since the etching mask is conductive, charge-up on the surface of the mask is not likely to occur.
      <br/>
      As etching gas, it is preferable to use gas containing fluorine (or freon) and not containing Cl or Br.
      <br/>
      If gas containing Cl or Br is used, it is difficult to use the conductive layer 126 as an etching mask because Ti chloride or Ti bromide has a higher vapor pressure than Ti oxide or Ti fluoride (Ti and Ti compound is easy to be etched by Cl or Br).
      <br/>
      In the resist layer 128 remains, it is removed by an ashing process or a washing process using organic solvent.

      If etching gas containing O2 or F is used, titanium oxide (TiO, TiO2, Ti2 O3) or titanium fluoride (TiF3) of a low vapor pressure is formed on the surface of a TiN layer (or TiON layer), and TiN (or TiON) etching is suppressed.
