      Solid superacid catalysts, in the form of spheres or microspheres, consisting of a mixed sulfated oxide of zirconium and of at least one other element selected from those of group 3, group 4, group 5, group 6, group 7, group 8 group 9, group 10, group 11, group 12, group 13, group 14, group 15 and those of the series of lanthanides, alone or combined with each other, are characterized in that they are obtained by means of a sol-gel process comprising the following steps:preparing a zirconium sol, mixed with a thickening agent and optionally with the element or elements selected;adding, only when microspheres are to be obtained, a non-ionic surface-active agent, to the sol; dripping, obtaining spheres, or atomising, obtainingmicrospheres, the sol into a basic gelation bath; ageing the spheres or microspheres of gel thus obtained;washing the spheres or microspheres with water up to pH=9; and draining them without drying them;impregnating the spheres or microspheres of gel with an aqueous solution of ammonium sulfate or, if it is not possible to obtain cogelation of the element selected with the zirconium hydroxide, with a solution of ammonium sulfate and a salt of said element selected;drying the spheres or microspheres and calcining them in air at temperatures ranging from 450° C. to 700° C.In particular, the solid superacid catalysts, when the element of group 13 is Al, can be conveniently used for isomerizing aliphatic hydrocarbons having a low molecular weight.

    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to solid, superacid catalysts, based on zirconia and mixed sulfated oxides, obtained directly via sol-gel, with a non-alkoxide synthesis method, in the forms of use, microspheres, or spheres having dimensions of up to 3 mm and over, and with textural and mechanical characteristics which make them suitable for isomerization processes of hydrocarbons, verified by means of the model conversion reaction of n-butane to iso-butane.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Background</p>
    <p num="4">Interest in solid (super)acid catalysts derives from considerations of an environmental nature, associated with improvements in industrial isomerization and alkylation processes of hydrocarbons, which use large quantities of sulfuric or hydrofluoric acid in emulsion.</p>
    <p num="5">
      If solid acids can be compared with the known liquid superacids, the question will remain open until a clear definition of solid superacid is formulated �J.
      <br/>
      Sommer et al., Catal. Today, 38 (1997)309�. In fact, whereas the definition of liquid superacid is based on the definition of R. J. Gillespie �Adv.
      <br/>
      Phys. Org. Chem., 9 (1972)1�: any acid stronger than sulfuric acid at 100% (H0 =-12 in Hammett's acidity scale), the most convincing evidence of the superacid nature of a solid should be, viceversa, its capacity to reversibly protonize an alkane, exploiting the  SIGMA - basicity of the C--H or C--C bond �G. A. Olah, Angew.
      <br/>
      Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 12 (1973) and J. Sommer et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 19 (1997)3274�.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Among all linear alkanes, n-butane is the most difficult to isomerize, requiring the formation of a primary isobutyl cation.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, isobutane is an essential intermediate for the production of alkylated and oxygenated products for fuel.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      It has been known for some time that sulfated zirconia is a solid acid, active in the isomerization of n-butane �M.
      <br/>
      Hino et al., Chem. Lett., (1979)1259�. The tetragonal, rather than monoclinic sulfated phase, seems to be the active crystalline phase of this material �C.
      <br/>
      Monterra et al., J. Catal., 157 (1995) 109�.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The doping of sulfated zirconia with transition elements favourably influences the isomerization rate of n-butane, in particular the combination of mixed oxides of iron and manganese �F. C. Lange et al., Catal. Lett., 41 (1996)95�. The addition of 0.4% Pt to a sulfated zirconia, doped with iron and manganese oxides, produces an increase in the activity with respect to sulfated zirconia alone �X. M. Song et al., Catal. Lett., 37 (1996)187�. The role of the metal consists in favouring the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation mechanism, by inhibiting the formation of carbonaceous substances, which can deactivate the system.
      <br/>
      Its role therefore consists in establishing a bifunctional mechanism, by increasing the surface concentration of the olefins, rather than increasing the acid strength of the sites �F.
      <br/>
      Garin et al., J. Catal., 151 (1995)26�. As a consequence, a considerable increase in the life of the catalyst is observed �J. C. Yori et al., Appl. Catal., 129 (1995)83� and, following this scheme, doping with iridium and platinum allows more active sulfated zirconias to be obtained �M.
      <br/>
      Hino et al., Catal. Lett. 30 (1995)25 and J. C. Yori et al., Appl. Catal.:A, 129 (1995)83�. A promoting role of aluminum has recently been observed, which is different from that of transition metals, in stabilizing the surface sulfated complex and increasing the number of acid sites with intermediate acid strength, the most effective for the isomerization of n-butane �Z.

      Finally, WO3 also makes zirconia a strong solid acid �M.
      <br/>
      Hino et al., Chem. Commun., (1987)1259� and Pt (0.3%) promotes the selective hydroisomerization of alkanes, from n-heptane upwards, at 373-473K, without the formation of carbonaceous substances �E.

      U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,459 of the same applicant describes a sol-gel process for the production of spheres and microspheres of pure zirconia or mixed oxides based on zirconia, obtained starting from a basic zirconium carbonate, and useful as catalysts or carriers for catalysts.
      <br/>
      This patent provides a detailed description of the procedure for obtaining pure zirconia spheres, example 1, pure zirconia microspheres, example 2, and spheres of mixed zirconia-alumina oxides (10% by weight), example 4.

    <p num="11">
      PCT/US97/07424 describes a sol-gel process for the production of sulfated zirconia, obtained starting from zirconium alkoxides mixed with acetylacetone in a solution of ethanol, and precipitated in an acidified mixture of a C8 -C18 alkylamine and water.
      <br/>
      The sulfation process with diluted sulfuric acid takes place on powders dried at 110 (degree)  C., after precipitation, aging, centrifugation and extraction with ethanol.
      <br/>
      The end-catalyst, sulfated zirconia in powder form, is obtained after calcination of the solid at temperatures ranging from 600 to 750 (degree)  C. for about two hours.
      <br/>
      As an alternative, the same patent describes a process in which sulfated zirconia in powder form is obtained by hydrolysis of a solution of zirconyl chloride in diluted ammonia, washing with water and drying at 110 (degree)  C., powdering and impregnation in diluted sulfuric acid for 5 hours, filtration and calcination at about 650 (degree)  C.

      CA-2069373 describes a process in which the life of the superacid catalyst is prolonged if the isomerization is carried out under supercritical conditions or almost critical conditions.

      Example 1 of this patent describes a procedure in which the superacid catalyst in powder form is obtained by hydrolyzing at pH 7-8, with an ammonia solution, a solution of a zirconium salt, obtained starting from a zirconium carbonate dissolved in nitric acid.
      <br/>
      The precipitate is separated, washed, filtered, dried and ground.
      <br/>
      It is then impregnated using the "incipient wetness" method with a solution of ammonium sulfate, dried and calcined at 725 (degree)  C. The sulfated zirconia thus obtained contains a percentage of sulfates of 4%.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the example also describes the incorporation of one or more transition metals, for example Fe and Mn, onto the sulfated zirconia.
      <br/>
      The catalyst is obtained, alternatively, by impregnating a salt of the metal either onto dried zirconium hydroxide or sulfated hydroxide.
    </p>
    <p num="13">A similar superacid catalyst, based on sulfated zirconia, obtained however starting from a solution of zirconium oxychloride, hydrolyzed with a solution of ammonia, and then impregnating the dry powder with sulfuric acid, and others based on sulfated titania and sulfated iron oxide are described in U.S. Pat.

      EP-0653397 discloses a method for the preparation of superacids based on sulfated zirconia, which incorporates, by means of "incipient wetness" impregnation, heteropolyacid (HPA) components or polyoxoanionic (POA) components, which give advantageous properties for effecting alkylation processes in liquid phase of isoparaffins to olefins.
      <br/>
      In the invention, preference is given to HPA or POA having the Keggin structure, represented by the formula H4 XM14 O40, wherein X can be any metal of groups IV, V, VI, VIII, or lanthanides, and M is any element of groups III, IV, V, VI.

      EP-0661254 describes a process for improving the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins, or of alkylaromatic compounds, using a solid superacid catalyst.
      <br/>
      Examples of solid superacid catalysts are: sulfated zirconia, sulfated titania, sulfated alumina, halogenated alumina, etc.; used alone or combined with one or more metals capable of increasing the acidity, preferably V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Zn, Co, Sn, Pb, Ca and Sb.

      EP-0504741 discloses a method for producing hydrogen peroxide directly in a reaction medium containing a promoter, for example, a halogenated compound, in the presence of a metal of the platinum group supported on a solid acid or solid superacid.
      <br/>
      The solid superacid consists of sulfated zirconia, alumina or titania, calcined preferably from 400 to 600 (degree)  C. As there may be problems of dissolution of the sulfate ion if the superacid is placed for long periods of time in a reducing environment, a solid superacid consisting of metal oxides is preferable for this type of reaction.
      <br/>
      These metal oxides preferably consist of molybdenum oxides or tungsten oxide supported on zirconia.
      <br/>
      The calcination temperatures preferably range from 600 to 800 (degree)  C. The form of solid superacid can be a microfine powder, grains or pellets.
      <br/>
      No mention is made in this patent of the techniques, preferably of the traditional ceramic type, for obtaining these forms.

    <p num="20">
      Finally, JP-06/321878 describes in an example a solid superacid obtained by impregnating zirconium hydroxide with 8 parts by weight of sulfuric acid 1N and, after drying, calcination at 570 (degree)  C. for 3 hours.
      <br/>
      The catalyst is claimed as being useful in the synthesis of esters containing amine groups.
    </p>
    <p num="21">None of the above processes describes a reliable method for the production, via sol-gel, of solid superacid catalysts based on zirconia, directly into a form which can be used in industrial isomerization and alkylation processes of hydrocarbons with a low molecular weight.</p>
    <p num="22">As previously specified in the known art, processes using synthesis phases possibly belonging to sol-gel methods, although more similar to precipitation techniques, invariably lead to the production of more or less agglomerated fine powders (which therefore also need grinding phases), from which the synthesis of the solid superacid is initiated.</p>
    <p num="23">
      Bearing in mind that interest in solid superacids is due to the possible substitution of traditional strong liquid acids, such as H2 SO4 or HF, for considerations of an environmental nature and to comply with regulations which are becoming stricter and stricter in this field, it is evident however that a solid superacid cannot be used directly in the form of a very fine powder.
      <br/>
      In fact, this would imply facing very serious problems of liquid-solid separation which are not easy to solve.
    </p>
    <p num="24">The only alternative is to resort to the traditional pelletization, extrusion or pressing, ceramic techniques as mentioned for example in WO-98/09727 and EP-0504741.</p>
    <p num="25">These techniques inevitably have counter-indications due to heterogeneity in the structure of the end-catalyst and therefore in its textural properties and also due to the use of various additives, both organic and inorganic, whose influence on the catalytic properties of the system is often not known or ignored.</p>
    <p num="26">Sol-gel techniques are absolutely preferable from the point of view of homogeneity of the chemical compositions; however neither techniques which use costly metal alkoxides, in particular zirconium, as starting materials, for example in PCT/US97/07424, nor those using less costly salts, for example in CA-2069373, offer solutions for the direct synthesis of a form of solid superacid catalyst which can be used under real isomerization process conditions.</p>
    <p num="27">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,459 discloses a sol-gel process for the production of spheres (and microspheres) of pure zirconia or mixed oxides based on zirconia, useful as catalysts or carriers for catalysts.
      <br/>
      However it does not disclose any process which can be simply used by any expert in the field for obtaining solid superacids based on zirconia.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In fact the most widely-used impregnation technique, the "incipient wetness" method, which can alternatively be used on dried material or calcined material, does not provide any useful result in this specific case.
      <br/>
      Experiments effected by impregnating with solutions of sulfuric acid or ammonium sulfate, more or less dilute, have not produced at the end of the calcination process at the temperatures indicated in literature of 400-700 (degree)  C., structurally resistant spheres but pretensioned materials susceptible to considerable cracking, before and mainly after catalytic isomerization tests.
      <br/>
      The phenomenon is more serious when Pt, for example, is used as promoter.
    </p>
    <p num="29">A solution could therefore be to introduce the precursor of sulfate ions directly into the sol and follow the procedures for the preparation of spheres as described in the examples of U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,459. However, apart from the integrity of the spheres at the end of the calcination treatment, there would be no control over the stoichiometric ratio Zr4+ /SO42- as, after dripping the sol into the gelation bath, during the aging of the spheres of gel in the bath, dissolution kinetics of the sulfates present inside the sphere would be established, which would depend on a considerable number of parameters and in particular the aging time and relative gel/gelation bath volumetric ratio.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="30">It has been surprisingly found, on the other hand, that it is possible to obtain a solid superacid catalyst, based on sulfated zirconia, with appropriate textural and mechanical characteristics, by subjecting the spheres of gel to impregnation, immediately after aging and simple washing up to pH 9, with a solution of ammonium sulfate.</p>
    <p num="31">The solid superacid catalysts of the present invention, in the form of spheres or microspheres consisting of a mixed sulfated zirconium oxide and at least one other element selected from those of group 3 (according to the new IUPAC agreement), preferably Y or La, group 4, preferably Ti, group 5, group 6, preferably W, group 7, preferably Mn, group 8, preferably Fe, group 9, preferably Co, group 10, preferably Ni, group 11, preferably Cu, group 12, preferably Zn, group 13, preferably Al, Ga or In, group 14, preferably Si, Sn or Pb, group 15, preferably Sb or Bi, and those of the series of lanthanides, preferably Ce, Nd, Sm or Eu, alone or combined with each other, are characterized in that they are obtained by means of a sol-gel process comprising the following steps:</p>
    <p num="32">
      preparing a zirconium sol, mixed with a thickening agent and optionally with the element or elements selected;
      <br/>
      adding, only when microspheres are to be obtained, a non-ionic surface-active agent (for example iso-octylphenoxy-polyethoxy-ethanol), to the sol;
      <br/>
      dripping, obtaining spheres, or atomizing, obtaining microspheres, the sol into a basic gelation bath;
      <br/>
      aging the spheres or microspheres of gel thus obtained;
      <br/>
      washing the spheres or microspheres with water up to pH=9 and draining them without drying them;
      <br/>
      impregnating the spheres or microspheres of gel with an aqueous solution of ammonium sulfate or, if it is not possible to obtain cogelation of the element selected with the zirconium hydroxide, with a solution of ammonium sulfate and a salt of said element selected;
      <br/>
      drying the spheres or microspheres and calcinating them in air at temperatures ranging from 450 (degree)  C. to 700 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="33">The oxide of the other element (or oxides of the other elements) in the mixed sulfated oxide preferably ranges from 0.5 to 30% by weight.</p>
    <p num="34">When the element selected is aluminum, in the mixed sulfated oxide the alumina more preferably ranges from 0.5 to 8% by weight.</p>
    <p num="35">The sulfate groups contained in the superacid catalysts preferably range from 1% to 15% by weight (with respect to the dry product), more preferably from 3% to 10% by weight with respect to the dry product).</p>
    <p num="36">As specified above, these catalysts can be obtained in the form of spheres, with end dimensions preferably ranging from 0.5 mm to 5 mm, more preferably about 2 mm, or in the form of microspheres with a diameter preferably ranging from 1 micron to 0.5 mm.</p>
    <p num="37">Depending on the uses, these solid superacid catalysts may also contain one or more precious metals selected from Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, Ir and Au.</p>
    <p num="38">The impregnation procedure, described in detail in the examples, allows a homogeneous distribution of the sulfate groups to be obtained within the sphere and, at the same time, guarantees its integrity at the various calcination temperatures, as can be observed from the "crush strength" data of the single spheres, effected according to the international regulation ASTM D 4179.</p>
    <p num="39">
      It has also been demonstrated that it is possible to establish with close accuracy the percentage quantity of sulfates present on the spheres after drying at 110 (degree)  C., on the basis of a formula empirically established in relation to the concentrations of the impregnation solutions (C0), if the ratio between the gel mass to be impregnated and the volume of the impregnation solution (1750 g/l) is kept constant.
      <br/>
      This ratio is that which allows a certain gel mass to be covered with a minimum volume of impregnation solution.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The formula is the following:
      <br/>
      %SO4=CALC =103.2 C00.908 /(1.032 C00.908 +275)
    </p>
    <p num="41">The agreement of the calculated data with the analytical data can be verified from table 1.</p>
    <p num="42">It has been even more surprisingly found that it is possible to obtain a superacid catalyst which is very active in the isomerization of hydrocarbons with a low molecular weight (having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms) and stable over a period of time, so that the incorporation of a promoter, such as Pt, is not necessarily required, if a mixed sulfated zirconia-alumina oxide is used instead of pure sulfated zirconia.</p>
    <p num="43">
      The process for the isomerization of aliphatic hydrocarbons with a low molecular weight, a further object of the present invention, by means of the solid superacid catalysts specified above containing aluminum, comprises the following steps:
      <br/>
      introducing the calcined spheres into a reactor and activating them in air at a temperature ranging from 300 (degree)  C. to 500 (degree)  C., preferably from 450 (degree)  C. to 500 (degree)  C.;
      <br/>
      introducing a reagent mixture with an H2 /n-paraffin ratio varying from 2/1 to 10/1, preferably from 3/1 to 5/1, with a space velocity (GHSV) ranging from 2000 to 10000 h-1 ;
      <br/>
      effecting the reaction at temperatures lower than 300 (degree)  C., preferably from 230 to 270 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The reaction can also be carried out without hydrogen.
      <br/>
      Inert gases, such as nitrogen, helium or argon can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The basic composition of a mixed oxide of this type, in particular with a weight percentage content of Al2 O3 of 10%, has already been described in example 4 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,459. The compositions tested herein have a lower content of Al2 O3 : 0.83% by weight, 1.66%, 2.5%, 4.2% and 7.6%, as indicated in examples 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively.
      <br/>
      All the impregnation procedures were carried out on the spheres in gel form after washing and draining of the liquid, as previously described for pure zirconia.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The effect of introducing the sulfate groups substantially causes, together with that of the alumina content, a shift in the crystallization of the zirconia towards higher temperatures, as can be observed from the maximum of the exothermic crystallization peak in the DTA curves, effected with a heating rate of 2 (degree)  C./min. The values are indicated in the tables of the various examples.
      <br/>
      On comparing, for example, the value of 660 (degree)  C. of the crystallization peak of a material with Al2 O3 10% (U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,459, column 4, line 28), with the same temperature value, example 5, it can be seen that this temperature can be reached with Al2 O3 4.2%+SO42- 7.3% (value with respect to dry product).
      <br/>
      However, contents of SO42- which are higher than this value make it practically impossible to determine the presence of the peak, even with Al2 O3 0.83%.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      From a structural point of view, for the various materials calcined under the same temperature conditions and for the same time (3 hours), the X-diffraction shows:
      <br/>
      for products calcined at 450 (degree)  C.: amorphous materials, for all sulfate contents and for Al2 O3  &gt;= 2.5%; materials slightly crystallized, for the two lowest contents of SO42- and Al2 O3 =1.66%, amorphous for higher sulfate contents; a well crystallized material for the lower sulfate content for Al2 O3 =0.83%, a slightly crystallized material for SO42- =2.8% (with respect to the dry product) and amorphous materials in the other cases;
      <br/>

      The "crush strength" measurements, only effected on alternating sulfate contents and for calcination temperatures of 550 (degree)  C. and 650 (degree)  C. (the latter being more interesting for the isomerization tests), showed the following tendency:
      <br/>
      for products calcined at 550 (degree)  C.: excellent mechanical characteristics, in the order of 37-38 N;
      <br/>
      for products calcined at 650 (degree)  C.: much lower mechanical resistances, of about 11-12 N, but in any case capable of keeping the material structurally integral, even after use.

      The textural property measurements, carried out with BET Micromeritics ASAP 2000 equipment, invariably show a unimodal distribution of the pore dimensions, with the maximum situated close to the lower limit of the mesoporosity range (2-50 nm according to the IUPAC agreement).
      <br/>
      For accurate values of the position of this maximum, as well as those of the surface area and cumulative pore volume, determined from the adsorption branch in the N2 adsorption/desorption hysteresis, reference should be made to the single compositions in the tables of the various examples.

      Some examples of sol-gel synthesis of solid superacids in the form of spheres, based on mixed zirconia-alumina oxides and containing SO42- groups as group capable of supplying the superacid properties, are provided hereunder.
      <br/>
      Example 1 describes the preparation method of a pure sulfated zirconia, which should be considered as reference and comparative material, in the isomerization tests, for the other compositions based on mixed sulfated zirconia-alumina oxides, described in examples 2-6.

      In fact, although examples are provided which relate to sphere dimensions of about 2 mm, these spheres can be prepared with dimensions of up to 3 mm and even more.
      <br/>
      In addition, the whole range of compositions specified in the examples can be prepared in the form of microspheres, in diameters ranging from 1 micron to 0.5 mm, as already described and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,459.
