      A prism includes: a first portion made of a first material having a wavelength dependency in a refractive index; and a second portion adhered to the first portion, the second portion being made of a second material having a wavelength dependency in a refractive index which is different from the wavelength dependency in the refractive index of the first material.
      <br/>
      The first portion and the second portion have shapes such that the wavelength dependency in the refractive index of the first portion and the wavelength dependency in the refractive index of the second portion are substantially cancelled by each other.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a prism which may be incorporated, for example, in an optical head used for recording/reproducing signals on an optical disk, and a method for producing the prism.
      <br/>
      The present invention further relates to an optical beam shaping apparatus using the above-mentioned prism for shaping a spatial light intensity distribution (for example, for shaping from an oval distribution to a circular distribution) of a light beam such as laser light, and an optical head device employing such an optical beam shaping apparatus.
      <br/>
      The present invention further relates to a method for shaping a light beam.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view showing an optical beam shaping apparatus disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 62-187321 as an example of a conventional optical beam shaping apparatus.
      <br/>
      Herein, a refractive index of air is referred to as n0 =1.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In the optical beam shaping apparatus shown in FIG. 1, a laser light 2 is emitted from a semiconductor laser 1, transmitted through a collimating lens 3, and is thereby converted into a parallel light 4.
      <br/>
      The parallel light 4, in turn, is incident on a surface 5A of a prism 5 made of a glass material (with a refractive index of n1) at an incident angle  PSI 1, (wherein  PSI 1 is an angle defined by the incident light 4 and a normal 5A' to the surface 5A of the prism 5).
      <br/>
      The incident light 4 is refracted at the surface 5A of the prism 5, and becomes a refracted light 4a having a refractive angle  PSI 1 ' with respect to the normal 5A' and an angle  THETA 2 (not shown) with respect to the incident light 4.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The refracted light 4a is then incident on a surface 5B (or "a bottom surface 5B" which opposes the surface 5A of the prism 5) at an incident angle  PSI 2 (wherein  PSI 2 is an angle defined by the light 4a and a normal 5B' to the surface 5B).
      <br/>
      The refracted light 4a reflects off the surface 5B and becomes a reflected light 4a'. An angle between the reflected light 4a' and the incident light 4 is referred to as an angle  THETA 2 ' (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The reflected light 4a' is incident on the surface 5A at an incident angle  PSI 21 (wherein  PSI 21 is an angle defined by the light 4a' and the normal 5A'), thereby being refracted by a refractive angle  PSI 21 ' to the normal 5A' and becomes emitting light 6.
      <br/>
      An angle between the refracted light 6 (i.e., the emitting light 6) and the original incident light 4 is referred to as an azimuth angle  THETA 21 ' (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      When the surface 5A of the prism 5 is inclined by  ALPHA 1 to the incident light 4, the incident angle  PSI 1 is characterized as follows:
      <br/>
      PSI 1 = PI /2- ALPHA 1  Formula (1)
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Further, the following Formula (2) is derived from Snell's Law at the surface 5A:
      <br/>
      sin  PSI 1 =n1 sin  PSI 1 '  Formula (2)
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Due to this refraction, the incident light 4 is either magnified or reduced by a factor of (cos PSI 1 '/cos PSI 1) within the refracting plane (i.e., within the plane of the drawing).
      <br/>
      The azimuth angle  THETA 2 of the refracted light 4a is given by the following Formula (3):
      <br/>
      THETA 2 =- PI /2+ ALPHA 1 + PSI 1 '  Formula (3)
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      When the bottom surface 5B is inclined by  ALPHA 2 to the incident light 4, the incident angle  PSI 2 is characterized as follows:
      <br/>
      PSI 2 = PI /2- ALPHA 2 + THETA 2  Formula (4)
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Further, the following Formula (5) is derived from the Law of Reflection at the bottom surface 5B:
      <br/>
      THETA 2 '= PI /2+ ALPHA 2 - PSI 2  Formula (5)
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The incident angle  PSI 21 of the light 4a' to the surface 5A is given by the following Formula (6):
      <br/>
      PSI 21 = PI /2+ ALPHA 1 - THETA 2 '  Formula (6)
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Further, the following Formula (7) is derived from Snell's Law at the surface 5A:
      <br/>
      n1 sin  PSI 21 =sin  PSI 21 '  Formula (7)
    </p>
    <p num="15">Due to this refraction, the light is further magnified or reduced by a factor of (cos  PSI 21 '/cos  PSI 21) within the refracting plane.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The azimuth angle  THETA 21 ' of the emitting light 6 is given by the following Formula (8):
      <br/>
      THETA 21 '= PI /2+ ALPHA 1 - PSI 21 '  Formula (8)
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Due to the two refractions at the surface 5A, the emitting light 6 is either magnified or reduced by a factor of m within the refracting plane, where m is given by the following Formula (9):
      <br/>
      m=(cos  PSI 1 '/cos  PSI 1) * (cos  PSI 21 '/cos  PSI 21)  Formula (9)
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      By sequentially applying the above-mentioned Formulae (1) through (9), for example, when BK7 is selected as a glass material for forming the prism 5 under the following conditions: an oscillation wavelength of the semiconductor laser 1=0.64385  MU m (where n1 =1.51425);  ALPHA 1 =17.59 (degree) ; and  ALPHA 2 =31.340, an azimuth angle  THETA 21 ' of the emitting light 6 of 89.9963 (degree)  and a magnification ratio m of 2.501 are obtained.
      <br/>
      The traveling direction of the emitting light 6 is bent by an angle of about 90 (degree)  with respect to that of the incident light 4 and the beam is magnified about 2.5 times within the refracting plane.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In general, the parallel light 4 derived from the light 2 emitted from the semiconductor laser 1 has an oval spatial light intensity distribution (an oval cross-sectional intensity with an ellipticity of about 2.5).
      <br/>
      The above-described prism 5 magnifies the spatial light intensity distribution in a direction along a minor axis of the oval distribution, thereby obtaining the parallel light having a circular spatial light intensity distribution (a circular cross-sectional intensity).
    </p>
    <p num="20">However, such a conventional light beam shaping apparatus has the following problems.</p>
    <p num="21">
      A glass material forming the prism 5 always has a wavelength dependency of the refractive index (i.e., "dispersion").
      <br/>
      Specifically, the refractive index of the light becomes smaller as the wavelength of the light becomes longer.
      <br/>
      For example, in the case where the prism 5 is made of BK7 under the conditions where an oscillation wavelength of the semiconductor laser 1 is 0.70652  MU m, the refractive index n1 of the prism 5 is 1.51243. Under this circumstance, the azimuth angle (emitting angle)  THETA 21 ' of the emitting light 6 is 89.9313 (degree)  which is smaller by 0.065 (degree)  than that in the above-described case where the oscillation wavelength of the semiconductor laser 1 is 0.64385  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Generally, due to variation in the output of the semiconductor laser 1, the oscillation wavelength is momentarily fluctuated several nanometers.
      <br/>
      When the oscillation wavelength is fluctuated, for example, by 10 nm in the above-described conventional optical beam shaping apparatus which employs the prism 5 made of BK7, the azimuth angle  THETA 21 ' of the emitting light 6 changes by 0.0104 (degree) .
    </p>
    <p num="23">In the case where the emitting light 6 is focused by an objective lens (e.g., with a focal length of 3 mm) so as to be used in an optical head for recording/reproducing signals in an optical disk, the above-mentioned change in the angle of 0.0104 (degree)  will result in a spot displacement of 0.54  MU m. This spot displacement of 0.54  MU m is not negligible when the optical head is used for reproducing signals recorded in signal pits of the optical disk on the order of submicrons, and may result in a fatal defect.</p>

    <p num="24">
      A prism of the present invention includes: a first portion made of a first material having a wavelength dependency in a refractive index; and a second portion abutting to the first portion, the second portion being made of a second material having a wavelength dependency in a refractive index which is different from the wavelength dependency in the refractive index of the first material.

      In such a case, when a surface A denotes a surface of the first portion on which the external incident light is incident, a surface B denotes a joint surface between the first portion and the second portion, and a surface C denotes a surface of the second portion facing the surface B; the light path of the reflective-type prism is such that the external incident light is incident on and refracted at the surface A, the light refracted at the surface A is incident on and refracted at the surface B, the light refracted at the surface B is incident on and reflected by the surface C, the light reflected by the surface C is again incident on and refracted at the surface B, and the light refracted at the surface B is again incident on and refracted at the surface A, and thereby supplied to the outside of the prism as the emitting light.

      According to still another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for producing a prism including a first portion made of a first material having a wavelength dependency in a refractive index and a second portion abutting to the first portion, the second portion being made of a second material having a wavelength dependency in a refractive index different from the wavelength dependency in the refractive index of the first material.
      <br/>
      The method includes the steps of: selecting a combination of the first material and the second material; generating a line segment on a coordinate plane which has a refractive index n1 of the first material and a refractive index n2 of the second material as coordinate axes, the line segment illustrating changes in the refractive indices n1 and n2 according to a change in a wavelength of light; generating a plurality of groups of contour lines on the coordinate plane, each of the groups of contour lines illustrating a change of an emitting angle of an emitting light from the prism with respect to the refractive indices n1 and n2, while using, as parameters, a first angle  ALPHA 1, a second angle  ALPHA 2 and a third angle  ALPHA 3 which determine a shape of the first portion and the second portion; finding a combination of the first angle  ALPHA 1, the second angle  ALPHA 2 and the third angle  ALPHA 3 such that a slope of the line segment and a slope of the group of the contour lines at a predetermined emitting angle in the coordinate plane are substantially the same; comparing a magnification or reduction ratio of the emitting light obtained for the found combination with respect to an incident light to a predetermined value; determining a final selection set of the combination of the first angle  ALPHA 1, the second angle  ALPHA 2 and the third angle  ALPHA 3 based on the comparison; processing the first portion and the second portion into shapes determined based on the values of the first angle  ALPHA 1, the second angle  ALPHA 2 and the third angle  ALPHA 3 of the final selection set; and abutting the processed first portion and the processed second portion to each other.

      According to still another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for shaping a light beam including a step of applying an external incident light to a prism so as to obtain an emitting light having a spatial light intensity distribution different from a spatial light intensity distribution of the external incident light.
      <br/>
      The external incident light is incident on a prism which includes a first portion, made of a first material having a wavelength dependency in a refractive index, and a second portion made of a second material to thereby obtain the emitting light having a desired spatial light intensity distribution, the second portion abutting to the first portion and having a wavelength dependency in a refractive index thereof which is different from the wavelength dependency in the refractive index of the first material, the first portion and the second portion having shapes such that the wavelength dependency in the refractive index of the first portion and the wavelength dependency in the refractive index of the second portion are substantially cancelled by each other.

      Any change in the emitting light angle, which is caused by a wavelength dependency in the refractive index (dispersion) of a material forming the first portion of the prism, is canceled by a wavelength dependency in the refractive index (dispersion) of a material forming the second portion of the prism.

    <p num="40">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described by way of illustrative examples with reference to FIGS. 2 through 5.</p>
    <p num="41">
      FIG. 2 is a schematic cross-sectional view showing an optical beam shaping apparatus according to one example of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The structure of the optical beam shaping apparatus shown in FIG. 2 is substantially the same as that shown in FIG. 1 except that a structure of a prism 15 is different.
      <br/>
      The light source system (e.g., the semiconductor laser 1 and the collimating lens 3) shown in FIG. 1 is omitted in FIG. 2 for the sake of clarity.
      <br/>
      According to the present example, a refractive index of air is referred to as n0 =1.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      As shown in FIG. 2, the prism 15 used in the optical beam shaping apparatus according to the present invention is a composite prism 15 including a first prism portion 5a and a second prism portion 5b having different dispersive characteristics.
      <br/>
      The first prism portion 5a and the second prism portion 5b are abutting, and preferably, directly adhered to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      In the optical beam shaping apparatus shown in FIG. 2, laser light emitted from a semiconductor laser is converted into the parallel light 4 by a collimating lens.
      <br/>
      The parallel light 4, in turn, is incident on a surface 5A of the prism 15 made of a glass material (with a refractive index of n1) at an incident angle  PSI 1 (wherein  PSI 1 is an angle defined by the incident light 4 and a normal 5A' to the surface 5A of the prism portion 5a).
      <br/>
      The incident light 4 is refracted at the surface 5A and becomes a refracted light 4a having a refractive angle  PSI 1 ' with respect to the normal 5A' and having an angle  THETA 2 (not shown) with respect to the incident light 4.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The refracted light 4a is incident on a joint surface 5B between the prism portions 5a and 5b at an incident angle  PSI 2 (wherein  PSI 2 is an angle defined by the light 4a and a normal 5B' to the surface 5B).
      <br/>
      The incident light is refracted at the surface 5B and becomes refracted light 4b having a refraction angle  PSI 2 ' with respect to the normal 5B' and having an angle  THETA 3 (not shown) with respect to the incident light 4.
      <br/>
      The refracted light 4b reflects off a bottom surface 5C of the prism portion 5b at an incident angle  PSI 3 (wherein  PSI 3 is an angle defined by the light 4b and a normal 5C' to the surface 5C) and becomes a reflected light 4b'. An angle made by the reflected light 4b' to the incident light 4 is referred to as an angle  THETA 3 ' (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="45">The reflected light 4b' is incident on the surface 5B at an incident angle  PSI 32 (wherein  PSI 32 is an angle defined by the light 4b' and the normal 5B'), thereby being refracted at a refractive angle  PSI 32 ' to the normal 5B' and becomes refracted light 4a'. An angle made by the refracted light 4a' to the original incident light 4 is referred to as an angle  THETA 32 ' (not shown).</p>
    <p num="46">
      The reflected light 4a' is incident on the surface 5A at an incident angle  PSI 321 (wherein  PSI 321 is an angle defined by the light 4a' and the normal 5A'), thereby being refracted at a refractive angle  PSI 321 ' with respect to the normal 5A' and becomes emitting light 6.
      <br/>
      An angle made by the refracted light 6 (i.e., the emitting light 6) to the original incident light 4 is referred to as an azimuth angle  THETA 321 ' (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      When the surface 5A of the prism portion 5a is inclined by  ALPHA 1 to the incident light 4, the incident angle  PSI 1 is characterized as the above-mentioned Formula (1).
      <br/>
      Further, the above-mentioned Formula (2) is derived from Snell's Law at the surface 5A.
      <br/>
      Due to this refraction, the incident light 4 is either magnified or reduced by a factor of (cos  PSI 1 '/cos  PSI 1) within the refracting plane.
      <br/>
      The azimuth angle  THETA 2 of the refracted light 4a is given by the above-mentioned Formula (3).
      <br/>
      When the bottom surface 5B of the prism portion 5a (i.e., the joint surface 5B) is inclined by  ALPHA 2 to the incident light 4, the incident angle  PSI 2 is characterized as the above-mentioned Formula (4).
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Further, the following Formula (10) is derived from Snell's Law at the surface 5B:
      <br/>
      n1 sin  PSI 2 =n2 sin  PSI 2 '  Formula (10)
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Due to this refraction, the light is further magnified or reduced by a factor of (cos  PSI 2 '/cos  PSI 2) within the refracting plane.
      <br/>
      The azimuth angle  THETA 3 ' of the refracted light 4b is given by the following Formula (11):
      <br/>
      THETA 3 = PI /2+ ALPHA 2 + PSI 2 '  Formula (11)
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      When the bottom surface 5C of the prism portion 5b is inclined by  ALPHA 3 to the incident light 4, the incident angle  PSI 3 is characterized as follows:
      <br/>
      PSI 3 = PI /2 - ALPHA 3 + THETA 3  Formula (12)
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Further, due to the Law of Reflection at the bottom surface 5C, the following Formula (13) is derived:
      <br/>
      THETA 3 '= PI /2+ ALPHA 3 - PSI 3  Formula (13)
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The incident angle  PSI 32, defined by the reflected light 4b' and the normal 5B' to the surface 5B, is given by the following Formula (14):
      <br/>
      PSI 32 = PI /2+ ALPHA 2 - THETA 31 '  Formula (14)
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Further, the following Formula (15) is derived from Snell's Law at the surface 5B:
      <br/>
      n2 sin  PSI 32 =n1 sin  PSI 32 '  Formula (15)
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Due to this refraction, the light is further magnified or reduced by a factor of (cos  PSI 32 '/cos  PSI 32) within the refracting plane.
      <br/>
      An azimuth angle  THETA 32 ' of the reflected light 4a' is given by the following Formula (16):
    </p>
    <p num="55">THETA 32 '= PI /2+ ALPHA 2 - PSI 32 '  Formula (16)</p>
    <p num="56">
      The incident angle  PSI 321, defined by the reflected light 4a' and the surface 5A, is given by the following Formula (17):
      <br/>
      PSI 321 = PI /2+ ALPHA 1 - THETA 32 '  Formula (17)
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Further, the following Formula (18) is derived from Snell's Law at the surface 5A:
      <br/>
      n1 sin  PSI 321 =sin  PSI 321 '  Formula (18)
    </p>
    <p num="58">Due to this refraction, the light is further magnified or reduced by a factor of (cos  PSI 321 '/cos  PSI 321) within the refracting plane.</p>
    <p num="59">
      The azimuth angle  THETA 321 ' of the emitting light 6 is given by the following Formula (19):
      <br/>
      THETA 321 '= PI /2+ ALPHA 1 - PSI 321 '  Formula (19)
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The emitting light 6 is either magnified or reduced by a factor of m within the refracting plane due to the four refractions (two refractions at each of the surfaces 5A and 5B), where m is given by the following Formula (20):
      <br/>
      m=(cos  PSI 1 '/cos  PSI 1) * (cos  PSI 2 '/cos  PSI 2) * (cos  PSI 32 '/Cos  PSI 32) * (cos  PSI 321 '/cos  PSI 321)  Formula (20)
    </p>
    <p num="61">By sequentially applying the above-mentioned Formulae (1) through (20), the azimuth angle  THETA 321 ' of the emitting light 6 and the enlargement (reduction) ratio m are obtained while using angles  ALPHA 1,  ALPHA 2, and  ALPHA 3 (which define the shapes of the prism portions 5a and 5b of the composite prism 15) and refractive indices n1 and n2 of the prism portions 5a and 5b as parameters.</p>
    <p num="62">FIG. 3 is a contour line diagram illustrating values of the emitting angle  THETA 321 ' with respect to the refractive indices n1 and n2, where  ALPHA 1 =18.0 (degree) ,  ALPHA 2 =25.0 (degree)  and  ALPHA 3 =33.0 (degree) . For example, a straight line indicated as "100" in FIG. 3 is a line (a contour line) illustrating combinations (coordinates) of the refractive indices n1 and n2 where the emitting angle  THETA 321 ' of 100 (degree)  is obtained.</p>
    <p num="63">Referring to FIG. 3, each contour line is a straight line having a negative slope.</p>
    <p num="64">
      In general, when the wavelength of the light increases by d LAMBDA , the refractive indices n1 and n2 of the glass materials forming the prism portions 5a and 5b, respectively, change to (n1 -k1 * d LAMBDA ) and (n2 -k2 * d LAMBDA ) (where k1 and k2 are coefficients).
      <br/>
      This change is shown in FIG. 3 in an exaggerated manner as a line segment having the starting point at P (n1, n2) and the end point at Q (n1 -k1 * d LAMBDA , n2 -k2 * d LAMBDA ).
    </p>
    <p num="65">In the example shown in FIG. 3, for example, an emitting angle  THETA 321 ' at point P is 101 (degree)  whereas an emitting angle  THETA 321 ' at point Q is 100 (degree) . This indicates that the emitting angle  THETA 321 ' is changed by 1 (degree)  when the refractive indices n1 and n2 of the glass materials forming the prism portions 5a and 5b are changed due to the change d LAMBDA  in the wavelengths.</p>
    <p num="66">Since the above-mentioned coefficients k1 and k2 are always positive in any glass materials, the line segment PQ always has a positive slope k2 /k1, wherein the slope k2 /k1 provides an indication regarding how the emitting angle  THETA 321 ' changes in accordance with changes in the wavelength of incident light.</p>
    <p num="67">For example, when BK7 is selected as a glass material for forming the prism portion 5a and SF6 is selected as a glass material for forming the prism portion 5b, the prism portions 5a and 5b will have a refractive index n1 of 1.51425 and a refractive index n2 of 1.79750 at a wavelength of 0.64385  MU m, and a refractive index n1 of 1.51243 and a refractive index n2 of 1.79118 at a wavelength of 0.70652  MU m. Accordingly, k2 /k1 is 3.47. On the other hand, when SF6 is selected as the glass material for forming the prism portion 5a and BK7 is selected as the glass material for forming the prism portion 5b, k2 /k1 is 0.288.</p>
    <p num="68">
      The prism 15 is preferably designed so that, even when the refractive indices n1 and n2 of the glass materials for forming the prism portions 5a and 5b are changed due to the change in the wavelengths of the incident light, adverse effects of the change are cancelled as a whole and the value of the azimuth angle  THETA '321 ' of the final emitting light 6 is not changed.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 3, the slope of the segment PQ, which shows the change of the refractive indices n1 and n2 of the glass materials for forming the prisms 5a and 5b due to the change of the wavelength of the light should be the same as (in other words, parallel to) the slope of the contour lines.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention, the angles  ALPHA 1,  ALPHA 2 and  ALPHA 3 which define the shapes of the prism portions 5a and 5b of the composite prism 15 are suitably set such that the slope of the contour lines in FIG. 3 have the same slope as that of the segment PQ.
    </p>
    <p num="69">FIG. 4 is a contour line diagram illustrating values of the emitting angle  THETA 321 ' with respect to the refractive indices n1 and n2, where  ALPHA 1 =18.0 (degree) ,  ALPHA 2 =39.0 (degree)  and  ALPHA 3 =33.0 (degree) . As in FIG. 3, a straight line indicated as "100" in FIG. 4 is a line (a contour line) illustrating combinations (coordinates) of the refractive indices n1 and n2 where the emitting angle  THETA 321 ' of 100 (degree)  is obtained.</p>
    <p num="70">Each contour line shown in FIG. 4 is a straight line having a slope of about 3.6.</p>
    <p num="71">
      For example, when BK7 is selected as a glass material for forming the prism portion 5a and SF6 is selected as a glass material for forming the prism portion 5b, the emitting angle  THETA '321 is 90.2330 (degree)  at the wavelength of 0.64385  MU m, and 90.2275 (degree)  at the wavelength of 0.70652  MU m. Moreover, a magnification ratio m of 2.35 is obtained.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a prism 15 is obtained in which the change in the emitting angle due to the change in the wavelength of the incident light is extremely small (specifically, 1/12 the change in the emitting angle compared to the conventional optical beam shaping apparatus) while a sufficient beam magnification ratio m is maintained.
    </p>
    <p num="72">FIG. 5 is a contour line diagram illustrating values of the emitting angle  THETA 321 ' with respect to the refractive indices n1 and n2, where  ALPHA 1 =18.0 (degree) ,  ALPHA 2 =12.0  (degree)  and  ALPHA 3 =33.0 (degree) . As in FIG. 3, a straight line indicated as "100" in FIG. 5 is a line (a contour line) illustrating combinations (coordinates) of the refractive indices n1 and n2 where the emitting angle  THETA 321 ' of 100 (degree)  is obtained.</p>
    <p num="73">Each contour line shown in FIG. 5 is a straight line having a slope of about 0.29.</p>
    <p num="74">For example, when SF6 is selected as a glass material for forming the prism portion 5a and BK7 is selected as a glass material for forming the prism portion 5b, the emitting angle  THETA '321 is 89.6084 (degree)  at the wavelength of 0.64385  MU m, and 89.60980 at the wavelength of 0.70652  MU m. Moreover, a magnification ratio m is 2.30. Accordingly, a prism 15 is obtained in which the change in the emitting angle due to the change in the wavelength of the incident light is extremely small (specifically, 1/46 the change in the emitting angle compared to the conventional optical beam shaping apparatus) while a sufficient beam magnification ratio m is maintained.</p>
    <p num="75">
      In FIGS. 4 and 5, the traveling direction of the emitting light 6 is bent by an angle of about 90 (degree)  with respect to that of the incident light 4, and the beam is magnified by a factor of about 2.5 within the refracting plane.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the prism 15 according to the present invention is able to cancel the adverse influence of the wavelength dependency in the refractive index (dispersion) of the glass material for forming the prism 15.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the prism 15 according to the present invention magnifies an oval spatial light intensity distribution (an oval cross-sectional intensity) of the semiconductor laser in a direction along a minor axis of the oval distribution, whereby a parallel light having a circular spatial light intensity distribution (a circular cross-sectional intensity) is obtained.

    <p num="76">In order to obtain a desired contour line diagram as FIGS. 4 and 5 which illustrate the emitting angle with respect to the refractive indices n1 and n2 of glass materials forming the prism portions 5a and 5b, a combination of angles  ALPHA 1,  ALPHA 2 and  ALPHA 3 is determined as follows (i.e., a principle for designing desired prism portions 5a and 5b which provide preferable characteristics as illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5).</p>
    <p num="77">
      (1) Regarding the above-described coefficients k1 and k2 (in the formula for indicating the change in the refraction index due to the change in the wavelengths), combinations of glass materials where the ratio k2 /k1 is in a prescribed range, for example, of 3 or higher or 1/3 or lower, are selected.
      <br/>
      Selections of combinations are further made in view of the processability and the environmental durability of the glass materials as the selection guidelines.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      (2) One combination is selected among the thus-obtained selections (for example, in the above-described example, the combination of SF6 and BK7 is selected).
      <br/>
      Then, a line segment PQ between the above-described point P (n1, n2) and the above-described point Q (n1 -k1 * d LAMBDA , n2 -k2 * d LAMBDA ) is drawn on a coordinate plane which have refractive indices n1 and n2 of the selected glass materials as x- and y-axes, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      (3) A contour line diagram such as those shown in FIGS. 3 through 5 is drawn for an azimuth angle (emitting angle)  THETA 321 ' of the emitting light with respect to the refractive indices n1 and n2 of the selected combination of glass materials while using a combination of the angles  ALPHA 1,  ALPHA 2 and  ALPHA 3 as parameters.
      <br/>
      More specifically, a series of the contour line diagrams is drawn while changing the values of the angles  ALPHA 1,  ALPHA 2 and  ALPHA 3.
    </p>
    <p num="80">(4) With respect to each of the thus drawn contour line diagrams, it is determined whether or not a slope of the contour line at a desired azimuth angle (emitting angle)  THETA 321 ' (e.g.,  THETA 321 '=90 (degree) ) of the emitting light is substantially the same as the slope of the line segment PQ.</p>
    <p num="81">(5) When a combination of the angles  ALPHA 1,  ALPHA 2 and  ALPHA 3 satisfying the conditions described above in section (4) is found, it is then determined whether or not a magnification ratio m of the laser beam obtainable under the particular conditions is sufficiently close to the preferable design value (e.g., m=2.5).</p>
    <p num="82">(6) The above-described sections (3) through (5) are repeated until the conditions described in section (5) are satisfied.</p>
    <p num="83">
      As can be appreciated from FIGS. 4 and 5, in order to obtain a contour line diagram with a slope of k2 /k1 for determining shapes of the prism portions 5a and 5b, the values of the angles  ALPHA 1,  ALPHA 2 and  ALPHA 3 are set such that when the dispersion of the prism 5b is greater than that of the prism 5a, the relationship  ALPHA 2 &gt; ALPHA 3 &gt; ALPHA 1 is satisfied.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the dispersion of the prism portion 5b is smaller than that of the prism portion 5a, shapes of the prism portions 5a and 5b are determined by setting the values of the angles  ALPHA 1,  ALPHA 2 and  ALPHA 3 so as to satisfy the relationship  ALPHA 3 &gt; ALPHA 1 &gt; ALPHA 2.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      In the case where a light travelling direction is reversed (i.e., in the case of reducing the beam), in other words, light is incident on the side of the prism 15 from which the emitting light 6 is exiting in FIG. 2 so that the light exits from the side of the prism on which the light 4 is incident in FIG. 2, the angles  ALPHA 1,  ALPHA 2 and  ALPHA 3 are replaced by  PI /2- ALPHA 1,  PI /2- ALPHA 2 and  PI /2- ALPHA 3, respectively.
      <br/>
      In this case, in order to obtain a preferable contour line diagram with a desired slope of k2 /k1, shapes of the prism portions 5a and 5b are determined by setting the values of the angles  ALPHA 1,  ALPHA 2 and  ALPHA 3 such that: the relationship  ALPHA 2 &lt; ALPHA 3 &lt; ALPHA 1 is satisfied when the dispersion of the prism 5b is larger than that of the prism 5a; and the relationship  ALPHA 3 &lt; ALPHA 1 &lt; ALPHA 2 is satisfied when the dispersion of the prism portion 5b is smaller than that of the prism portion 5a.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      According to the above-described example, the prism portions 5a and 5b are directly adhered to each other.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the same advantages as described above are obtained when the prism portions 5a and 5b have a space, or a layer of other material, therebetween at the joint surface 5B, as long as the optical influences of such a space or a layer is negligible.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      As described above, according to the present invention, a prism is realized in which a possible change in the emitting light angle, which is caused by a wavelength dependency in a refractive index (dispersion) of a material (a glass material) forming a first portion of the composite prism, is canceled by a wavelength dependency in a refractive index (dispersion) of a material (a glass material) forming a second portion of the composite prism.
      <br/>
      By using this prism, an optical beam shaping apparatus is provided in which the undesirable change in the emitting angle of the emitting light is suppressed without being influenced by variations in the oscillation wavelength of the semiconductor laser light source.
    </p>
    <p num="87">Furthermore, a high-performance optical head device, and an optical disk apparatus utilizing the same, are provided in which no dislocation of the beam spot is caused by wavelength fluctuations when a light beam emitted from the optical beam shaping apparatus is focused by an objective lens.</p>
    <p num="88">
      Various other modifications will be apparent to and can be readily made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention.
