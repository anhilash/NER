      A therapeutic nasal inhalant for using bioflavanoids as a topical antioxidant.
      <br/>
      The therapeutic nasal inhalant includes a method for making a therapeutic nasal inhalant composition for treating nasal mucosa.
      <br/>

    <p num="2">The present invention relates to bioflavanoid compounds and more particularly pertains to a new therapeutic nasal inhalant for using bioflavanoids as a topical antioxidant.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The use of bioflavanoid compounds is known in the prior art.
      <br/>
      More specifically, bioflavanoid compounds heretofore devised and utilized are known to consist basically of familiar, and expected configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Known prior art includes U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,987; U.S. Pat. No. 5,059,347; U.S. Pat. No. 5,626,883; U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,533; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,817,630.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="27">
      The therapeutic nasal inhalant 10 generally comprises a method for making a therapeutic nasal inhalant composition for treating nasal mucosa.
      <br/>
      The method comprising the steps of:
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      1.
      <br/>
      STEP 1: Mixing together two cups of water, one teaspoon of baking soda, one teaspoon of sodium chloride, four milligrams of vitamin C to form a mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      2. STEP 2: Mixing a bioflavanoid with the mixture.
      <br/>
      Bioflavanoids arc anti-oxidants which are found in forms of plant life.
      <br/>
      The preferred embodiment utilizes proanthocyanidins, which is a class of bioflavanoids.
      <br/>
      The ideal proanthocyanidins are obtained from grape seed extract.
      <br/>
      Seven milligrams of grape seed extract are finely ground and mixes with the mixture.
      <br/>
      Although a range of grape seed extract from two milligrams to fourteen milligrams may be used, seven milligrams is the preferred weight.
    </p>
    <p num="30">3. STEP 3: The mixture is allowed to stand for preferably twenty-four hours.</p>
    <p num="31">
      4. STEP 4: The mixture is then filtered.
      <br/>
      Ideally the filtering takes place mixture multiple times.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      5. STEP 5: The mixture is again allowed to stand for twenty-four hours.
      <br/>
      The mixture is allowed to stand in order that particles suspended in the mixture settle out.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      6. STEP 6: Filtering the mixture again.
      <br/>
      Filtering removed particles that were entered into the mixture from the grape seed extract.
      <br/>
      The particles do not need to be removed but they can cause irritation.
    </p>
    <p num="34">7. STEP 7: Packaging the mixture in a nasal inhaler.</p>
    <p num="35">8. STEP 8: Squirting the mixture into a nasal cavity.</p>
    <p num="36">
      As to a further discussion of the manner of usage and operation of the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above description.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of usage and operation will be provided.
    </p>
    <p num="37">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form. function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</p>
    <p num="38">
      Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention.
      <br/>
      Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.
