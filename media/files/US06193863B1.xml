      <br/>
      These products are generally electroplated by being placed wholly together with the rack in an electrolyte solution.

      <br/>
      and the jig, particularly for the purpose of acquiring an ability to combine a function of nipping a product and a function of feeding an electric current to the product, allowing the attachment and detachment of a thin-wall ribbonlike product to be effected infallibly and easily, and ensuring infallible supply of an electric current from the cathode bar via the jig to the product through the nipped upper part of the product,
      <br/>

    <heading>BEST MODE OF EMBODYING THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">The embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="13">FIG. 1 through FIG. 3 illustrate wholly the product conveying mechanism for the electroplating device according to this invention and FIG. 4 through FIG. 6 illustrate the jig to be used in the product conveying mechanism.</p>
    <p num="14">The electroplating device of this invention electroplates a thin-wall ribbonlike product A such as a printed wiring board by suspending the product from the upper part thereof nipped with a jig 2 supported laterally movably by a cathode bar 1 and laterally conveying the product A in an electrolyte solution B held in a tank 3 meanwhile feeding an electric current from the cathode bar 1 to the upper part of the product through the jig 2.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The product conveying mechanism for this electroplating device is composed of the cathode bar 1 having a rectangular cross section and having a difference in the lateral width (W) of the rectangular cross section between the width during the step of releasing the thin-wall ribbonlike product A from the nip and the width during the step of nipping the thin-wall ribbonlike product A, the jig 2 supported laterally movably by the cathode bar 1 and adapted to nip the thin-wall ribbonlike product A in the upper part thereof, suspend the product from the upper part thereof, and feed an electric current to the thin-wall ribbonlike product A through the nipped part thereof, and a conveying means 5 formed of an endless chain furnished with an engaging claw 6 to be meshed with an engaging projection 4 formed on the jig 2 and adapted to move laterally the jig 2 along the cathode bar 1 in consequence of the lateral transfer of the engaging claw 6.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1 and FIG. 3, reference numeral 7 denotes an anode (ball anodes contained in an anode case).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The jig 2 mentioned above, as illustrated in FIG. 4 through FIG. 6, is composed of a supporting member 10 made of a synthetic resin and inserted around the cathode bar 1 laterally movably along the cathode bar, a first planar contact plate 12 made of a conductive metal material such as stainless steel and adapted to utilize the upper part side thereof as a contact leaf part 12A allowed to establish face contact with one lateral face side of the cathode bar 1 and urged with the spring pressure exerted by a spring member 11 made of a coil spring on the one lateral face side of the cathode bar and utilize the lower part side thereof as a nipping leaf part 12B adapted to nip the thin-wall ribbonlike product A in the upper part, a second contact plate 14 made of a conductive metal material such as stainless steel and having integrally formed in the shape of the letter L a contact leaf part 14A allowed to establish face contact with the bottom face side of the cathode bar 1 and urged with the spring pressure exerted by a spring member 13 on the bottom face side of the cathode bar 1 and a nipping leaf part 14B opposed to the nipping leaf part 12B of the first contact plate 12, product nipping spring members 15, 15 each made of a coil spring and adapted to establish close mutual contact between the nipping leaf parts 12B and 14B of the first contact plate 12 and the second contact plate 14 and exert the spring pressure on the nipping leaf parts 12B and 14B from outside so as to allow the closely contacting nipping leaf parts 12B and 14B to nip therebetween the thin-wall ribbonlike product A in the upper part thereof, a moving vacant part 16 formed in the supporting member 10 for allowing the lower part of the first contact plate 12 to be moved away from the product nipping position toward the outside, and a pressure imparting means for pressing the cathode bar lateral face contact leaf part 12A of the first contact plate 12 against the one lateral face side of the cathode bar 1 in opposition to the spring pressure of the product nipping spring member 15 urged on the nipping leaf part 12B of the first contact plate 12.
      <br/>
      This pressure imparting means constitutes the spring pressure for the cathode bar lateral face pressing spring member 11 serving to exert constantly the spring pressure on the upper part of the first contact plate 12 so as to press the cathode bar lateral face contact leaf part 12A of the first contact plate 12 against the one lateral face side of the cathode bar 1.
      <br/>
      The jig 2 is so constructed as to effect mutual separation of the nipping leaf parts 12B and 14B and consequent release of the thin-wall ribbon product A from the nipping leaf parts 12B and 14B by pressing the cathode bar lateral face contact leaf part 12A of the first contact plate 12 against a gap formed on the one lateral face side of the cathode bar 1 by virtue of the pressure imparting means (the spring pressure of the cathode bar lateral face pressing spring member 11) at the position at which the cathode bar forms a narrowed part of the lateral width (W) and pressing the L-shaped corner part 14C of the second contact plate 14 backward and meanwhile moving the lower part of the first contact plate 12 backward into the vacant place 16 with a stepped part 16A formed at the upper end of the vacant place 16 as a fulcrum.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The aforementioned supporting member 10 made of synthetic resin is composed of a first supporting member 10A for supporting the one lateral face side, the flat face side, and the other upper lateral face side of the cathode bar 1 and a second supporting member 10B supporting the bottom face side and the other lower lateral face side of the cathode bar 1.
      <br/>
      The first supporting member 10A and the second supporting member 10B are fixed by transfixing a clamping bolt 17 having screwed parts 17A and 17B formed in the opposite terminal parts thereof and a shank 17C formed in the middle part thereof across through holes 18 and 19 formed in the nipping leaf parts 12B and 14B of the first contact plate 12 and the second contact plate 14 and causing the screwed parts 17A and 17B to be meshed with screw holes 20 and 21 formed in the first supporting member 10A and the second supporting member 10B.
      <br/>
      To the shank 17C of the clamping bolt 17, the product nipping spring members 15, 15 each made of a coil spring are fitted in a compressed state.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 22 denotes a blind screw for holding the cathode bar lateral face pressing spring member 11 formed of coil spring in a compressed state in a spring hole.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The pressure imparting means mentioned above can constitute the operating force for an operating pin (not shown) moved forward and backward via a through hole 23 formed in the supporting member 10 to reach the cathode bar lateral face contacting leaf part 12A and consequently allow the cathode bar lateral face contacting leaf part 12A of the first contact plate 12 to be pressed against the one lateral face side of the cathode bar 1.</p>
    <p num="19">
      The product sway preventing means denoted by reference numeral 30 in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 is provided for the purpose of preventing the thin-wall ribbonlike product A from swaying while the product nipped in the upper part thereof with the jig 2 is electroplated by being laterally conveyed in the electrolyte solution B held in the tank 3.
      <br/>
      This product sway preventing means 30 is constructed by forming a depressed guide groove 32 on a rectifying box 31 formed on the bottom part side of the interior of the tank 3 so as to admit the lower parts of the laterally conveyed ribbonlike products A as spaced along the path of conveyance of the ribbonlike products A, forming in the depressed guide groove 32 along the central track on the depressed bottom wall of the depressed guide groove 32 a draining conduit 33 for allowing the electrolyte solution in the tank to flow into the rectifying box 31, forming in the rectifying box mentioned above a baffle plate 34 containing therein a plurality of open holes 35 having a smaller total opening area than the total opening area of the draining conduit 33 so as to uniformize the pressure distribution in the electrolyte solution flowing in through the draining conduit 33, and forming a draining mouth 36 for discharging out of the tank the electrolyte solution which has passed through the baffle plate 34 in the interior of the rectifying box 31, thereby guiding the lower parts of the ribbonlike products A admitted as spaced with a given interval into the depressed guide groove 32 by dint of the rectifying action of the electrolyte solution discharged uniformly into the rectifying box 31 through the draining conduit 33 formed in the depressed guide groove along the central track on the depressed bottom wall toward the position of the central track on the depressed bottom wall in the depressed guide groove 32 having the draining conduit 33 formed therein.
      <br/>
      By disposing a plurality of baffle plates 34 in a cascade pattern in the rectifying box 31 and causing the total opening area of the holes 35 formed in the baffle plates 34 to decrease in the descending order of the baffle plates 34, it is made possible to disperse the pressure of inflow to a greater extent, allow the electrolyte solution to flow more uniformly into the depressed guide groove 32, and improve the effect of rectification further.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      A product passing means in a tank partition wall denoted by reference numeral 40 in FIG. 3 and FIG. 2 is provided for the purpose of enabling the thin-wall ribbonlike product A conveyed as nipped in the upper part thereof with the jig 2 to acquire smooth passage through an oblong product passing groove 41 formed in a partition wall 3A of the tank 3 so as to pass the partition wall 3A of the tank 3 and, at the same time, preventing the electrolyte solution in the tank 3 from flowing out through the product passing groove 41.
      <br/>
      The product passing means 40 in the tank partition wall is so constructed as to block the product passing groove 41 by forming within the tank 3 a roll regulating frame 42 for enclosing the oblong product passing groove 41 formed in the partition wall 3A of the tank 3 so as to allow passage through the partition wall 3A of the tank 3 of the thin-wall ribbonlike product A conveyed as nipped in the upper part thereof with the jig 2, forming on the product conveying track of the roll regulating frame 42 an inflow groove 43 for allowing inflow of the electrolyte solution in the tank and passage of the product, holding movably inside the roll regulating frame 42 a pair of rolls 44, 44 adapted to sink in an upright state into the electrolyte solution, and utilizing the flowing action of the electrolyte solution in the tank to be discharged from the inflow groove 43 to the product passing groove 41 for moving the pair of rolls 44, 44 from the position indicated by an alternate long and short dash line in FIG. 3 to the position of close contact with the partition wall 3A blocking the product passing groove 41 indicated by a solid line in FIG. 3 and establishing close mutual contact between the pair of rolls 44, 44.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The pair of rolls 44, 44 are formed of a plastic material made of vinyl chloride in such a manner that the center of gravity may be caused to occur in the lower parts of the rolls by placing weights in the lower parts of the rolls having a cavity formed in the upper part of roll for the purpose of enabling the rolls to sink in an upright state in the electrolyte solution.</p>
    <p num="22">The size of the jig 2 (excluding the engaging projection 4 mentioned above) is 38 mm in lateral width and 74 mm in height in the bearings of FIG. 5.</p>
    <p num="23">
      In FIG. 3 and FIG. 7, reference numeral 50 denotes a draining device for adjusting the liquid level of the electrolyte solution B in the tank 3.
      <br/>
      This draining device 50 is constructed by enclosing oblong draining grooves 51 formed on the lateral wall and the partition wall of the tank 3 with a frame 53 having a draining mouth 52 opened in the lower part thereof and inserting a vertically movable adjusting plate 54 in the frame 53 so that the draining mouth 52 mentioned above may be opened and closed by the vertical motion of the adjusting plate 54.
      <br/>
      The vertical operation of this adjusting plate 54 is automatically controlled by a command issued from a liquid level sensor.
      <br/>
      Since this draining device 50 enables the electrolyte solution to flow out from the middle part of the tank 3, it can decrease the difference between the highest and lowest liquid levels as compared with the device which allows the electrolyte solution to flow out in an overflowing state.
      <br/>
      Since the difference between the highest and lowest liquid levels can be decreased as described above, the boundary of plating in the partially plated part of the product (the plating treatment performed excepting the upper part of the product) can be uniformized.
