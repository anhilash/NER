    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a composition that forms an adherent, transparent, water insoluble polymeric film on a substrate surface, and that provides sustained antimicrobial disinfecting action upon contact with microorganisms for prolonged periods, without the necessity for reapplication.
      <br/>
      The coating provides contact-killing surface disinfecting action only, and does not release its components into contacting liquids at levels that would result in solution disinfection.
      <br/>
      The polymeric film of the invention can be easily removed by treatment with dilute alcoholic base.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The constant threat of bacterial contamination and the associated repercussions on health have made antimicrobial solutions a ubiquitous part of commercial and residential cleaning and disinfection processes.
      <br/>
      Dilute aqueous detergents show no detectable reduction in bacterial levels on surfaces amenable to bacterial growth and proliferation in susceptible environments, such as hospitals and in residential kitchen and bath areas.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, oxidants such as aqueous hypochlorite and phenolic compositions produce substantial reductions in bacterial levels that are relatively short-lived (3 to 6 hours).
      <br/>
      This often results in recontamination due to reuse of such surfaces, requiring frequent reapplication of disinfectant.
      <br/>
      Further, relatively high concentrations of the active agent have to be incorporated in such formulations to obtain broad spectrum disinfection.
      <br/>
      These high concentrations often have undesirable side effects such as skin and eye irritation, in addition to being potentially hazardous when in contact with food.
      <br/>
      There is therefore a need for the development of new disinfecting formulations that can provide sustained broad spectrum microbial disinfection on surfaces over prolonged periods without reapplication, even after being contacted by cleaning solutions and after surface reuse.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is desirable to achieve disinfecting action using low levels of the antimicrobial agent that will not pose toxicity problems for the user.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The modality of action of film-forming surface sanitizers to date has been solution based, that is, the antimicrobial action is obtained by controlled release via diffusion or dissolution of the active agents into contacting aqueous or volatile solutions.
      <br/>
      Numerous examples of this type of sanitizer have been reported.
      <br/>
      Another typical variant involves hydrolysis or dissolution of the matrix containing an antimicrobial compound, thereby effecting its release into solution.
      <br/>
      High levels of preservatives, however, are also released into contacting solutions in long-term applications.
      <br/>
      In such mechanisms, a bioactive compound is covalently bound either directly to the substrate surface or to a polymeric material that forms a nondissolving surface coating.
      <br/>
      The antimicrobial compounds in such coatings exhibit greatly diminished activity, unless assisted by hydrolytic breakdown of either the bound antimicrobial or the coating itself.
      <br/>
      In either case, relatively high levels of preservative have to be released into solution in order to elicit antimicrobial action.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      It is an object of the invention to provide an antimicrobial composition which can be applied to a surface to provide a non-leaching, water-insoluble film which is capable of (i) providing immediate antimicrobial disinfection and antiviral action on the surface, and (ii) providing sustained antimicrobial disinfecting action for prolonged periods after application, even after being contacted by water and aqueous surface cleaners.
      <br/>
      It is also an object of the invention to provide a disinfecting composition that, when applied to a surface, provides a water insoluble film that can be removed from the surface upon application of a non-aqueous, film-dissolving formulation.
      <br/>
      Another object of the invention is to provide a disinfectant composition which further includes an optical reporter, e.g., a fluorophore or an optical brightening agent that enables detection of the composition on a surface by suitable detection devices such as irradiation by an ultraviolet or visible light source.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The invention further provides disinfecting compositions that form transparent, adherent, water insoluble films which, when applied on a surface, kill microorganisms contacting the films, but which do not leach or elute significant amounts of antimicrobial components or species into the contacting liquids at levels sufficient to provide disinfection in the contacting solution.
      <br/>
      The antimicrobial composition comprises a combination of an organic biguanide polymer and an antimicrobial metallic material.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      More particularly, disinfecting compositions of the invention comprise a liquid, gel or foam comprising a solution, dispersion, emulsion or suspension of a polymeric, film-forming material and a metallic biocide in a carrier, which, when applied to a surface, forms a water-insoluble polymeric film on the surface in which the biocide is non-leachably bound to, complexed with, associated with or dispersed.
      <br/>
      The polymeric film forming material preferably comprises a polymer, copolymer or adduct which contains segments that, when the polymer forms a film on a surface, are capable of engaging microorganisms that come in contact with it.
      <br/>
      The biocide preferably is non-leachably attached to, complexed or associated with or dispersed within said film, but is capable of being preferentially transferred directly from the polymeric film to the contacting microorganism due to a higher affinity for proteins within the microorganisms.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In one aspect, the composition comprises a combination of (i) an organic polymeric polycationic material which is capable of forming a layer, film or matrix, and (ii) a broad spectrum metallic biocide which, upon application, becomes intercalated in the layer, film or matrix and that interacts sufficiently strongly with the organic material so that the biocide does not dissolve into or elute from the matrix into the surrounding environment.
      <br/>
      The organic material should possess two important properties: it should be capable of reversibly binding or complexing with the biocide, and should be capable of insinuating the biocide into the cell membrane of a microorganism in contact with it.
      <br/>
      The organic material preferably is capable of dissolving into or adhering to the cell membrane surrounding the microorganism.
      <br/>
      Preferred organic materials are those which can be applied on a surface as water-insoluble films and which bind the biocide in such a manner as to permit transfer of the biocide into the microorganism, but will not release the biocide into the surrounding environment, e.g., into the air or into any liquid in contact with the coated surface.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The biocide preferably is a low molecular weight metallic material that is toxic to microorganisms and is capable of complexing with or reversibly binding to the organic matrix material, thereby rendering the organic matrix water insoluble.
      <br/>
      The biocide exhibits greater binding affinity for functional groups in cellular proteins of microorganisms.
      <br/>
      When a microorganism contacts the antimicrobial material, the organic material engages or disrupts at least the outer portion of the lipid bilayer of the microorganism's cell membrane sufficiently to permit insinuation of the biocide into the microorganism, where cell proteins or proteins in the lipid bilayer compete effectively for the biocide due to favorable binding constants.
      <br/>
      Stated another way, the metallic material binds to or forms a complex with the organic material in which the association between the organic material and metallic material is sufficiently strong that the layer or film does not elute antimicrobial amounts of the metal into a contacting solution.
      <br/>
      However, the metallic material preferentially binds to certain proteins in the microorganism and thus is transferred from the matrix to the microorganism.
      <br/>
      The result is a contact-killing delivery system that selectively transfers the biocide to or into the microorganism's cell membrane upon contact, without elution or dissolution of the biocide into solution, thereby maintaining the long term antimicrobial efficacy of the composition.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The antimicrobial compositions of the present invention are, therefore, molecularly designed to enable a matrix-bound biocide to retain high antimicrobial activity without elution of any compounds into contacting solutions, carriers or other materials.
      <br/>
      The antimicrobial activity stems from the sustained, cooperative biocidal action of its components.
      <br/>
      Selective transfer of one component from within the matrix directly to the microorganism upon contact is achieved via a "hand off" mechanism upon engagement and penetration of the microorganism's cell membrane.
      <br/>
      The antimicrobial material, therefore, maintains long term efficacy without releasing toxic elutables into the surrounding environment.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Organic materials useful in the present invention comprise materials which are capable of: (1) adhering to and/or forming a layer or coating on a variety of substrates, (2) reversibly binding or complexing with the biocide, and (3) insinuating the biocide into the cell membrane of the microorganism upon contact.
      <br/>
      A preferred class of materials are those having the aforementioned properties, and which are capable of complexing and/or binding a bactericidal metallic material.
      <br/>
      Most preferred is the class of organic materials having antimicrobial activity.
      <br/>
      For example, a preferred class of materials, polymeric biguanides, form a layer or coating when applied to a substrate.
      <br/>
      The layer or coating can dissolve into, or adhere to, and penetrate at least the outer portion of the lipid bilayer membrane of a microorganism.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, surface active agents, such as cationic compounds, polycationic compounds, anionic compounds, polyanionic compounds, non-ionic compounds, polynonionic compounds or zwitterionic compounds are useful.
      <br/>
      These compounds include, for example, biguanide polymers, or polymers having side chains containing biguanide moieties or other cationic functional groups, such as benzalkonium groups or quarternium groups (e.g., quarternary amine groups).
      <br/>
      The polymer backbone may be any polymer capable of forming a coating on a substrate.
      <br/>
      It is understood that the term "polymer" as used herein includes any organic material comprising three or more repeating units, and includes oligomers, polymers, copolymers, terpolymers, etc.
      <br/>
      The polymer backbone may be a polysilane or polyethylene polymer, for example.
      <br/>
      Organic materials which currently are most preferred for use in the invention are polymeric biguanide compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The organic polymeric material may be reacted with a water insoluble organic compound or "hydrophobic agent" in order to increase its water insolubility.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the organic material is a polymeric polycationic polymer, which is chemically reacted with a hydrophobic agent to form an adduct.
      <br/>
      The adduct that includes the hydrophobic agent adheres more strongly to certain substrates than the polycationic polymer alone, and exhibits greater water insolubility.
      <br/>

    <p num="23">The term "microorganism" as used herein includes bacteria, blue-green algae, fungi, yeast, mycoplasmids, protozoa and algae.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The term "biocidal" as used herein means bactericidal or bacteriostatic.
      <br/>
      The term "bactericidal" as used herein means the killing of microorganisms.

      The term "bacteriostatic" as used herein means inhibiting the growth of microorganisms, which can be reversible under certain conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      As used herein, the terms "non-leachable" and "substantially non-leachable" mean that bio-active components in films obtained by application of the disinfecting compositions do not dissolve, elute, leach or otherwise provide species into a liquid environment in contact with the said films at levels that would result in solution disinfection, that is, in antimicrobially effective amounts.
      <br/>
      Preferably, this threshold is below the minimum solution concentrations of such components to impart solution disinfection.

      Organic materials useful in the present invention comprise materials which are capable of: (1) adhering to and/or forming a layer or coating on a variety of substrates, (2) reversibly binding to or complexing with the bactericide, and (3) insinuating the bactericide into the cell membrane of the microorganism.
      <br/>
      A preferred class of materials are those having the aforementioned properties, which are capable of being immobilized on a surface and which preferentially bind a biocidal metallic material in such a manner so as to permit release of the metallic biocide to the microorganism, but not to the contacting environment.
      <br/>
      Most preferred is the class of organic materials having antimicrobial properties, that is, materials which, when applied as a coating, can dissolve into, adhere to, disrupt or penetrate the lipid bilayer membrane of a microorganism in contact with the coating.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the organic material is a polymer containing segments which, when the polymer forms a coating on a surface, are capable of engaging microorganisms which come into contact with the coating.
      <br/>
      By "engaging" is meant that the coating can attach and temporarily immobilize a microorganism in contact with it.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, surface active agents, such as cationic compounds, polycationic compounds, anionic compounds, polyanionic compounds, non-ionic compounds, polyanionic compounds or zwitterionic compounds may be used.
      <br/>
      Organic materials which currently are most preferred for use in the invention are polymeric biguanide compounds.
      <br/>
      When applied to a substrate, these polymers form a coating on the substrate which can engage and disrupt a microorganism as shown in FIG. 1.

      In one embodiment of the present invention, the organic material comprises an organic material which has been reacted with a hydrophobic agent to form an adduct.
      <br/>
      Hydrophobic agents which can be used in the present invention are those which react with the organic material to form the adduct.
      <br/>
      Suitable hydrophobic agents include, for example, organic compounds containing multifunctional groups such as isocyanates, epoxides, carboxylic acids, acid chlorides, acid anhydrides, succimidyl ether aldehydes, ketones, alkyl methane sulfones, alkyl trifluoromethane sulfonates, alkyl paratoluene methane sulfones, alkyl halides and organic multifunctional epoxides.
      <br/>
      In a currently preferred embodiment, a polyhexamethylene biguanide polymer is reacted with an epoxide, such as methylene-bis-N,N-diglycidylaniline.
      <br/>
      The degree of hydrophobicity of the resulting adduct can be adjusted by choice of the hydrophobic agent.
      <br/>
      The organic material can be polymeric or non-polymeric, however the resulting adduct must be capable of forming a coherent film.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The biocidal material can be any antimicrobial material which is capable of non-leachably binding to or complexing with the organic matrix, but which, when placed in contact with the microorganism, preferentially transfers to the microorganism.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, metallic materials which are toxic to microorganisms are preferred.
      <br/>
      The metallic material can be a metal, metal oxide, metal salt, metal complex, metal alloy or mixture thereof.
      <br/>
      Metallic materials which are bactericidal or bacteriostatic and are substantially water-insoluble are preferred.
      <br/>
      By a metallic material that is bacteriostatic or bactericidal is meant a metallic material that is bacteriostatic to a microorganism, or that is bactericidal to a microorganism, or that is bactericidal to certain microorganisms and bacteriostatic to other microorganisms.
      <br/>
      Examples of such metals include, e.g., silver, zinc, cadmium, lead, mercury, antimony, gold, aluminum, copper, platinum and palladium, their oxides, salts, complexes and alloys, and mixtures of these.
      <br/>
      The appropriate metallic material is chosen based upon the ultimate use of the device.
      <br/>
      The currently preferred metallic materials are silver compounds.

    <p num="31">
      Carriers useful in the present invention include liquids, gels or foams.
      <br/>
      Liquids useful as the liquid carrier for the antimicrobial materials in the present invention include any polar liquid, including water, alcohols such as ethanol or propanol, polar aprotic solvents such as N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      The currently preferred liquid carrier comprises a mixture of ethanol and water.
      <br/>
      The liquid carrier in the present invention can itself be an antimicrobial disinfectant capable of causing immediate disinfection upon application of the formulation on a bacterially contaminated surface, including specially denatured alcohol (SD-alcohol) which is comprised of 95% ethyl alcohol denatured with 5% isopropanol, or pure isopropanol.

    <p num="33">
      The amount and/or type of the antimicrobial composition which is used in a particular application will vary depending on several factors, including the type and amount of contamination which is likely to occur, and the size of the antimicrobial surface.
      <br/>
      The amount of antimicrobial used will be a minimum amount necessary to maintain the sterility of the surface.
      <br/>
      As stated above, this amount will vary depending upon various considerations understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In a preferred embodiment, when the disinfectant composition is applied to a substrate, the organic material forms an insoluble, non-leachable film having a unique configuration: some of the organic material protrudes into the surrounding environment, that is, "arms" or "tentacles" of the organic material project away from the matrix and into the surrounding environment.
      <br/>
      This phenomenon can be understood by referring to FIG. 1, which is a schematic graphic illustration of a preferred embodiment of the present invention in which the organic material is a biguanide polymer reacted with a water insoluble organic compound to increase the water insolubility of the said polymer, and the biocidal metallic material is a silver halide salt, preferably silver iodide.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1A show the polymer film having tentacles projecting into the ambient environment, with the silver salt being present within reservoirs and on the tentacles.
      <br/>
      Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that when a microorganism contacts the coating, the biguanide polymer tentacles dissolve into the lipid bilayer constituting the organism cell membrane surrounding the microorganism, thereby introducing silver molecules into the interior of the microorganism or to proteins within the cell membrane.
      <br/>
      Silver has a greater binding affinity for certain proteins in the microorganism than for the polymer film, and therefore complexes with the cellular proteins and is transferred into the microorganism, thereby causing protein denaturation within the organism resulting in its death.
      <br/>
      Specifically, it is known that the silver forms complexes with the sulfhydryl and amino groups of the cellular proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In this embodiment, the silver salt is attached to or impregnated into the matrix comprising the film and on the tentacles of the polymer such that the silver is substantially non-leachable into the surrounding environment, that is, substantially no silver leaches from the coating into a liquid in contact with the coating.
      <br/>
      This is substantiated by performing the standard Kirby-Bauer zone of inhibition test using test substrates which contain a disinfecting composition.
      <br/>
      The absence of a zone in such tests indicates that bioactive components from the composition do not dissolve, elute, leach or provide species in the contacting medium at levels necessary to cause death.
      <br/>
      Again, not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the silver salt forms complexes with functional groups in the polymer, and that the complexed silver resists leaching into ambient liquids or other materials (e.g. water, and aqueous solutions including common cleaning liquids) in contact with the treated surface.
      <br/>
      However, when the treated surface becomes exposed to cellular proteins, the silver preferentially complexes with the proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In a currently preferred embodiment, the polymeric material is polyhexamethylene biguanide, (PHMB) and the hydrophobic agent is methylene-bis-N,N-diglycidylaniline (MBDGA).
      <br/>
      The preferred silver salt is a silver halide, most preferably, silver iodide or silver nitrate, which is readily converted to a silver halide, most preferably silver iodide.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the antimicrobial material is made by combining a solution of polyhexamethylene biguanide with a solution of the hydrophobic agent, and reacting the mixture under conditions sufficient to form a PHMB-MBDGA adduct.
      <br/>
      The ratio of PHMB to MBDGA preferably is in the range of from about 1:1 to 3:1 by weight.
      <br/>
      The concentration of the resulting adduct resin preferably is in the range of from about 0.5 to about 20% by weight.
      <br/>
      The biocidal material, preferably silver iodide, is added to the adduct solution to form the liquid antimicrobial composition.
      <br/>
      Silver solutions having a concentration of from about 0.005 to about 0.5% can be used for this step.
      <br/>
      Silver iodide is currently the most preferred form of the biocidal metallic material.
      <br/>
      It is added either to the adduct solution as such or obtained by adding silver nitrate to the adduct solution and converting it to silver iodide by addition of and alkali metal iodide such as sodium or potassium iodide.
      <br/>
      The silver iodide forms reservoirs in the matrix, and becomes attached to the tentacles.
      <br/>
      Silver iodide has sufficient affinity for the PHMB polymer that it forms an insoluble complex that will not leach into ambient solutions or other materials in contact with the material, even at elevated temperatures.
      <br/>
      However, when a microorganism contacts the film, the tentacles disrupt the microorganism's lipid bilayer membrane, thereby introducing the silver iodide into the microorganism.
      <br/>
      Silver iodide has greater affinity for certain proteins within the microorganism than for the PHMB-MBDGA matrix, and forms complexes with these proteins, that is, the silver is preferentially transferred from the coating to the microorganism.
      <br/>
      The silver accumulates to toxic levels in the microorganism and kills it.
      <br/>
      The silver iodide reservoirs within the matrix replenish the silver iodide on the tentacles lost to the microorganism by reestablishing the equilibrium for formation of the complex

      (AgI+PHMB (reversible reaction) �PHMBAgI�).
