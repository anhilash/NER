      <br/>
      The bottom pad 3 may be severed, finished and bonded with adhesive as shown in FIG. 8 for a beautiful appearance thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="18">For fine protection purpose, a fire retarding agent or fire retarding sealant may be incorporated into the aperture between the doorframe and the walls V, H of the construction wall W. For preventing noise pollution, a noise insulating material may also be inserted into the aperture between the doorframe of the present invention and its nearby wall W.</p>
    <p num="19">The material for making the covering plate 5, 5a may be the same material as that of the jamb 1 and lintel 4, such as made of wood or wood-surfaced materials or any other suitable materials.</p>
    <p num="20">The present invention also comprises the method for installing the doorframe on a construction wall, including the following procedures:</p>
    <p num="21">
      1.
      <br/>
      Calibrating, aligning, marking and determining a plurality of locations on a right and a left vertical side wall V within a doorway O of a built construction wall W for installing the two jambs 1, 1 on the right and left vertical side walls V of the construction wall W with respect to the dimension and specification of the doorframe (For instance, to mark a vertical line L on the side wall corresponding to the jamb 1 as shown in FIG. 1);
      <br/>
      2. Fixing a plurality of brackets 2 on the vertical side walls V on the locations as pre-determined on the vertical side walls;
      <br/>
      3.
      <br/>
      Slightly moving each jamb 1 either horizontally or vertically on the brackets 2 by slidably engaging the back grooves 11 in the jamb 1 with the plate extensions 22 formed on the brackets 2 until matching with the specification or dimension of the doorframe to be fixed within the doorway O;
      <br/>
      4.
      <br/>
      Cushioning each jamb 1 with a waterproof pad 3 on a bottom of the jamb 1;
      <br/>
      5.
      <br/>
      Fixing a lintel 4 on a top portion of each jamb 1 to horizontally link the lintel 4, adjacent to a horizontal top wall H of the doorway, with the two jambs 1 to form an inversed U-shaped doorframe; and fastening the jambs 1 on the vertical side walls V after adjustably moving the jambs 1 on the brackets 2 to a desired position;
      <br/>
      6.
      <br/>
      Covering each jamb 1 with each vertical covering plate 5 for shielding an aperture A between each jamb 1 with the vertical side wall V; and covering the lintel 4 with a horizontal covering plate 5a for shielding an aperture between the lintel 4 and the horizontal top wall H of the doorway O (as shown in FIGS. 6, 7, 8).
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      By the way, a doorframe of the present invention can be built with the following advantages superior to a conventional doorframe:
      <br/>
      1.
      <br/>
      There is no need to pre-fit the doorframe for filling concrete or for stacking bricks around the doorframe.
      <br/>
      The construction wall W with doorway O may be built first, while the doorframe of the present invention can be installed within the doorway afterwards.
      <br/>
      2. The elements in construction of the doorframe including jambs 1, lintel 4 and covering plates 5, 5a may be pre-fabricated by mass production in a factory for greatly reducing the production cost.
      <br/>
      All the elements will then be conveniently assembled and installed as a doorframe in the construction site.
      <br/>
      3. The doorframe is installed after finishing the construction wall of a building, thereby minimizing the chance of abrasion or damage on the doorframe.
      <br/>
      4. The jambs 1 may be slightly adjusted on the brackets 2 before being deadly fixed, providing a flexibility for the installation of the doorframe.
    </p>
    <p num="23">As shown in FIG. 9, each jamb 1 is fixed on the vertical side wall V by a plurality of pairs of brackets 2a each bracket 2a formed as L shape and including: a base portion 21 fixed on the side wall V by nails or screws 23, and a plate extension 22 protruding outwardly from the base portion 21 to be perpendicular to the base portion 21, with the plate extension 22 insertable into and engageable with a back groove 11 longitudinally recessed in the jamb 1, upon embedding an embedding end portion 51 of the vertical covering plate 5 into the surface groove 12 recessed in a front or rear surface portion of the jamb 1, the vertical covering plate 5 may be provided to cover the jamb 1 and to shield an aperture A between the side wall V and the jamb of the doorframe when the bonding end portion 52 of the covering plate 5 is adhered on the construction wall W.</p>
    <p num="24">As shown in FIG. 10, each bracket 2 is modified to be a widened bracket 2b including a base portion 21 secured to the vertical side wall V by screws 23, and two plate extensions 22 perpendicularly protruding outwardly from the base portion 21 to define a space 220 between the two plate extensions 22 to embed the jamb 1 into the space 220 between the two plate extensions 22 having screws 13 fastening the jamb 1 on the plate extensions 22, with a front and a rear vertical covering plate 5 embedded into a front and a rear surface groove 12 recessed in a front and a rear surface of the jamb 1 for covering the jamb and shielding an aperture A between the jamb and the side wall V.</p>
    <p num="25">A plurality of prongs 24 may be formed on each plate extension 22 to be pricked into the covering plate 5 as shown in FIG. 10 for firmly securing the covering plate 5 to the jamb 1.</p>
    <p num="26">As shown in FIG. 11, the covering plate 5 may be eliminated, and the screws or nails 13 may be inserted into the groove 12 to be fastened to the plate extension 22 of the bracket 2 fixed on the wall W. Each screw or nail 13 is inserted into the jamb 1 through a guiding recess 121 recessed in each groove 12 for storing a head portion of the screw or nail in the guiding recess.</p>
    <p num="27">The present invention may be modified without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
