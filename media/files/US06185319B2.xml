      <br/>
      A fingerprint input apparatus includes a prism, a light source, a pinhole, and an imaging plane.
      <br/>
      The prism is placed such that a surface in one direction serves as a fingerprint collection surface.
      <br/>
      The light source irradiates light on the fingerprint collection surface through the prism.
      <br/>
      The pinhole is set in the path of light which is reflected by the pattern surface of a finger placed on the fingerprint collection surface and emerges from the prism.
      <br/>
      The light emerging from the prism and passing through the pinhole is formed into an image on the imaging plane.
      <br/>
      When the prism is substituted by air, an optical fingerprint collection surface equivalent to the fingerprint collection surface is set to be substantially parallel to the imaging plane.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a fingerprint input apparatus for inputting fingerprints to register them or collate them with fingerprints already registered.</p>
    <p num="2">
      None of the fingerprints of different people coincide with each other, and the fingerprints do not change throughout their lives.
      <br/>
      Owing to these characteristics of fingerprints, fingerprint collation systems are especially used in the fields that require high degrees of security.
      <br/>
      An apparatus for inputting fingerprint images is a constituent element of such a fingerprint collation system.
      <br/>
      This fingerprint input apparatus includes an optical system as a constituent.
      <br/>
      The collation precision of the fingerprint collation system greatly depends on whether fingerprint images can be correctly input.
    </p>
    <p num="3">Any conventional fingerprint input apparatus, however, cannot obtain high-quality fingerprint images.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">The present invention has been made to solve this problem, and has as its object to provide a fingerprint input apparatus which can obtain high-quality fingerprint images.</p>
    <p num="5">In order to achieve the above object, according to the first aspect of the present invention (according to claim 1), there is provided a fingerprint input apparatus comprising a prism placed such that a surface in one direction serves as a fingerprint collection surface, a light source for irradiating light on the fingerprint collection surface through the prism, a pinhole set in a path of light which is reflected by a pattern surface of a finger placed on the fingerprint collection surface and emerges from the prism, and an imaging plane on which the light emerging from the prism and passing through the pinhole is formed into an image, wherein when the prism is substituted by air, an optical fingerprint collection surface equivalent to the fingerprint collection surface is set to be substantially parallel to the imaging plane.</p>
    <p num="6">According to this aspect, light reflected by the pattern surface of the finger directly or indirectly placed on the fingerprint collection surface and emerging from the prism passes through the pinhole and is formed into an image on the imaging plane set to be almost parallel to the optical fingerprint collection surface of the prism.</p>
    <p num="7">
      According to the second aspect of the present invention (according to claim 2), in the first aspect, when the optical fingerprint collection surface has distortion with respect to the fingerprint collection surface, the imaging plane is rotated through a predetermined angle.
      <br/>

    <p num="9">According to this aspect, the optical system on the first prism side is made similar to the optical system on the second prism side with the pinhole being the center, and light reflected by the pattern surface of the finger directly or indirectly placed on the fingerprint collection surface and emerging from the first prism passes through the pinhole and the second prism and is formed into an image on the imaging plane.</p>
    <p num="10">
      According to the fourth aspect of the present invention (according to claim 4), in the first, second, and third aspects, the apparatus further comprises pinhole position adjusting means for adjusting a position of the pinhole.
      <br/>
      According to this aspect, the position and size of a fingerprint image on the imaging plane can be changed by adjusting the position of the pinhole in the back-and-forth direction, the lateral direction, the vertical direction, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      According to the fifth aspect of the present invention (according to claim 5), in the fourth aspect, the pinhole position adjusting means is constituted by a manual adjusting mechanism, and the apparatus further comprises a display section for displaying a fingerprint image formed on the imaging plane.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="12">
      According to the sixth aspect of the present invention (according to claim 6), the pinhole position adjusting means automatically adjusts the position of the pinhole.
      <br/>
      According to this aspect, the position of the pinhole is automatically adjusted, and the position and size of a fingerprint image on the imaging plane are adjusted to set values.

    </p>
    <p num="14">According to the eighth aspect of the present invention (according to claim 8), there is provided a fingerprint input apparatus comprising a prism placed such that a surface in one direction serves as a fingerprint collection surface, a light source for irradiating light on the fingerprint collection surface through the prism, a pinhole set in a path of light which is reflected by a pattern surface of a finger placed on the fingerprint collection surface and emerges from the prism, a lens placed close to a rear side of the pinhole, and an imaging plane on which the light emerging from the prism and passing through the pinhole and the lens is formed into an image, wherein when a straight line connecting a center of the fingerprint collection surface and a center of the imaging plane is an optical axis, the imaging plane is inclined with respect to the optical axis to prevent a blur, and a central axis of the lens is inclined with respect to the optical axis to prevent trapezoidal distortion.</p>
    <p num="15">
      According to this aspect, the light intensity of a fingerprint image formed on the imaging plane is increased by the lens placed close to the rear side of the pinhole.
      <br/>
      In this case, a blur is suppressed by inclining the imaging plane with respect to the optical axis, and trapezoidal distortion is suppressed by inclining the central axis of the lens with respect to the optical axis under the condition in which this blur is suppressed.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="33">Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail below.</p>
    <p num="34">�Embodiment 1: First to Seventh Aspects�</p>
    <p num="35">
      Prior to a description of the first to seventh aspects of the present invention, the techniques on which these aspects are based will be described.
      <br/>
      To obtain high-quality fingerprint images, some countermeasures must be taken against fingerprint image distortion and blurs.
      <br/>
      Several fingerprint input apparatuses designed to cope with fingerprint image distortion and blurs have already been proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 59-142675, Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 63-99960, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2-176984, and the like.
      <br/>
      Since all these fingerprint input apparatuses use lenses for optical systems, fingerprint distortion and blurs cannot be eliminated at once.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      FIG. 16 shows the main part of the optical system of a conventional fingerprint input apparatus.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 16, reference numeral 1 denotes a prism; and 2, a lens.
      <br/>
      Reference symbol A-B denotes, the fingerprint collection surface of the prism 1; O, the center of the lens 2; and F, the focal point of the lens 2.
      <br/>
      For the sake of descriptive convenience, in the arrangement shown in FIG. 16, the prism 1 is assumed to have the same refractive index as that of air.
      <br/>
      Although not shown, an incandescent lamp is placed on the lower surface side of the prism 1 such that light from the incandescent lamp is irradiated on the fingerprint collection surface A-B through the prism 1.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In this optical system, the imaging plane of a light-receiving unit may be set to a plane E-G (imaging plane 1) to prevent an entire image of the pattern surface of a finger placed on the fingerprint collection surface A-B, i.e., an entire fingerprint image, from blurring.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, since the optical path ratio varies (AO:OG not identical to BO:OE), the fingerprint image is distorted.
      <br/>
      To prevent the fingerprint image from being distorted, the imaging plane of the light-receiving unit may be set to a plane E-H (imaging plane 2.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, a point A on the fingerprint collection surface A-B expands to "H-K" on the imaging plane E-H.
      <br/>
      As a result, the fingerprint image blurs.
      <br/>
      As described above, a blur and distortion cannot be eliminated at once as long as the lens 2 is used.
      <br/>
      As importance is attached to correction of distortion, the blur worsens and leads to difficulty in practical use, and vice versa.
      <br/>
      That is, with the arrangement shown in FIG. 16, a compromise must be made between distortion and a blur within the respective practical ranges.
    </p>
    <p num="38">Under the circumstances, Embodiment 1 uses a pinhole plate in place of the lens 2 to greatly reduce distortion and a blur so as to obtain a high-quality fingerprint image.</p>
    <p num="39">�Basic Principle�</p>
    <p num="40">
      FIG. 1A shows the main part of the optical system of a fingerprint input apparatus according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 1A and 1B, reference symbol A-B denotes the fingerprint collection ad surface of a prism 1; C'-D', a pinhole plate surface having a pinhole PH formed in its center; and O, the center of the pinhole PH.
      <br/>
      For the sake of descriptive convenience, in the arrangement shown in FIG. 1A, the prism 1 is assumed to have the same refractive index as that of air.
      <br/>
      Although not shown, an LED is placed on the lower surface side of the prism 1 such that light from the LED is irradiated on the fingerprint collection surface A-B through the prism 1.
      <br/>
      Note that this LED may be a laser beam radiator.
      <br/>
      Light emitted from an LED or laser beam radiator has a single wavelength and is less in optical irregularity than light from an incandescent lamp.
      <br/>
      Owing to such characteristics, the LED allows a high resolution, and has a long service life.
      <br/>
      In addition, the heat generated by the LED exerts little influence on the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In this optical system, the light reflected by the fingerprint surface of the finger placed on the fingerprint collection surface A-B and emerging from the prism 1 passes through the pinhole PH and is formed into an image on an imaging plane I-J.
      <br/>
      In this case, if the fingerprint collection surface A-B of the prism 1 and the imaging plane I-J are set to be parallel to each other, the optical path ratio is made constant (AO:OJ=BO:OI), and no fingerprint image distortion occurs.
      <br/>
      In addition, since one point on the fingerprint collection surface A-B is imaged on one point on the imaging plane I-J, no fingerprint image blur occurs.
      <br/>
      That is, both distortion and a blur can be prevented at once.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      In the arrangement shown in FIG. 1A, the prism 1 is assumed to have the same refractive index as that of air.
      <br/>
      In practice, however, the refractive index of the prism 1 differs from that of air.
      <br/>
      For this reason, as shown in FIG. 1B, a surface equivalent to the fingerprint collection surface A-B when the prism 1 is substituted by air is set as an optical fingerprint collection surface A'-B' (a curved surface A'-B' indicated by the dotted line in FIG. 1B), and this optical fingerprint collection surface A'-B' and the imaging plane I-J are set to be parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      In this case, since it is difficult to form the imaging plane I-J into a curved surface in terms of techniques and cost, the straight line A'-B' and the imaging plane I-J are set to be parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      In other words, a triangle A'OB' and a triangle JOI are set to be similar to each other.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, the optical path ratio is made constant (A'O:OJ=B'O: OI), and hence fingerprint image distortion can be suppressed.
      <br/>
      In addition, since one point on the straight line A'-B' is imaged on one point on the imaging plane I-J, a fingerprint image blur can be suppressed.
      <br/>
      That is, both the blur and the distortion can be greatly reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The position and size of the fingerprint image on the imaging plane I-J can be adjusted by adjusting the position of the pinhole PH in the back-and-forth direction (Z direction), the lateral direction (X direction), and the vertical direction (Y direction).
      <br/>
      With the use of this scheme, an increase in parts assembly tolerance and reductions in cost, weight, and size can be attained as compared with the scheme using the lens.

      FIG. 2 shows the arrangement of a fingerprint collation system using a fingerprint input apparatus based on the principle described above.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 2, reference numeral 10 denotes a fingerprint input apparatus; and 20, a processing section.
      <br/>
      The fingerprint input apparatus 10 includes a ten-key pad 10-1, a display (LCD) 10-2, and a fingerprint input section 10-3.
      <br/>
      The processing section 20 includes a control section 20-1 having a CPU, a ROM 20-2, a RAM 20-3, a hard disk (HD) 20-4, a frame memory (FM) 20-5, an external connection section (I/F) 20-6, and a Fourier transform section (FFT) 20-7. Registration and collation programs are stored in the ROM 20-2.
    </p>
    <p num="46">In the fingerprint input apparatus 10, as shown in the enlarged view in FIG. 3A, the fingerprint input section 10-3 includes a light source (LED) 10-31, a diffusion plate 10-32, a prism 10-33, a pinhole plate 10-34, a pinhole position adjusting mechanism 10-35, and a light-receiving unit 10-36.</p>
    <p num="47">
      In this case, a total reflection method is used for the fingerprint input section 10-3 such that the LED 10-31 is placed on the left side of the lower surface side of the prism 10-33, and light from the LED 10-31 is irradiated on a fingerprint collection surface A-B of the prism 10-33 through the prism 10-33.
      <br/>
      In this arrangement, as is obvious, a surface equivalent to the fingerprint collection surface A-B when the prism 10-33 is substituted by air is set as an optical fingerprint collection surface A'-B' (a curved surface A'-B' indicated by the dotted line in FIG. 3A), and this optical fingerprint collection surface A'-B' and an imaging plane I-J of the light-receiving unit 10-36 are set to be almost parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      That is, the straight line A'-B' and the imaging plane I-J are set to be parallel to each other.

      When an optical path separation method is to be used for the fingerprint input section 10-3, as shown in FIG. 4A, the LED 10-31 is placed on the right side of the lower surface side of the prism 10-33, and a black coating (or light-shielding plate) 10-37 is formed on the left-side surface of the prism 10-33 so that light from the LED 10-31 is irradiated on the fingerprint collection surface A-B through the prism 10-33.

      In this case as well, as is obvious, a surface equivalent to the fingerprint collection surface A-B when the prism 10-33 is substituted by air is set as an optical fingerprint collection surface A'-B' (a curved surface A'-B' indicated by the dotted line in FIG. 3A), and this optical fingerprint collection surface A'-B' and the imaging plane I-J of the light-receiving unit 10-36 are set to be almost parallel to each other.

      That is, the straight line A'-B' and the imaging plane I-J are set to be parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      The formation of the black coating (or light-shielding plate) 37 on the left-side surface of the prism 10-33 can prevent externally incident disturbance light from influencing the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Since the principles of the total reflection method and the optical path separation method are described in detail in reference 1 (THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF ELECTRONICS, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERS, 85/3, Vol.

      J68-D, No. 3, pp. 414-415), a detailed description thereof will be omitted.
      <br/>
      In the total reflection method, total reflection is caused on a non-contact portion of a fingerprint surface, while total reflection is prevented on a contact portion, and the difference between the light from the non-contact portion and that from the contact portion is detected.
      <br/>
      In the optical path separation method, only light from the contact portion of a fingerprint surface is detected without any light from the non-contact portion.
      <br/>
      For reference, FIGS. 3B and 4B respectively show the conventional arrangements of fingerprint input sections using the total reflection method and the optical path separation method.
      <br/>
      Each conventional arrangement uses an incandescent lamp 10-31' as a light source and a lens Ln for a light-receiving unit 10-36'.

      In this fingerprint collation system, the fingerprint of a user is registered in the following manner.
      <br/>
      The user inputs an ID number assigned to him/her by using the ten-key pad 10-1 before using the system (step 101 in FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      The user then puts his/her finger on the upper surface UP (fingerprint collection surface A-B) of the prism 10-33 along the guide 10-41 of the fingerprint input apparatus 10.
      <br/>
      Light from the LED 10-31 has been irradiated on the fingerprint collection surface A-B of the prism 10-33, so the light from the LED 10-31 is totally reflected by the recess portions (groove portions) of the skin surface which are not in contact with the fingerprint collection surface A-B.
      <br/>
      In contrast to this, at the projection portions (ridge portions) of the skin surface which are in contact with the fingerprint collection surface A-B, the total reflection conditions are not satisfied, so the light from the LED 10-31 is scattered.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The light reflected by the skin surface of the finger placed on the fingerprint collection surface A-B and emerging from the prism 10-33 passes through the pinhole PH and is formed into an image on the imaging plane I-J of the light-receiving unit 10-36.
      <br/>
      As a result, the fingerprint portion corresponding to the groove portions becomes bright, and the fingerprint portion corresponding to the ridge portions becomes dark.
      <br/>
      That is, a fingerprint image with a contrast is collected.
      <br/>
      The pattern of the collected fingerprint (registration fingerprint) is supplied as gray scale image data to the processing section 20.

      The user then adjusts the angular positions of the three-axis position adjusting knobs Cx, Cy, and Cz to adjust the position of the pinhole plate 10-34 in the X, Y, and Z directions, i.e., the position of the pinhole PH in the X, Y, and Z directions, through the pinhole position adjusting mechanism 10-35, thereby setting the fingerprint image on the display 10-2 to a desired position in a desired size (steps 102 to 104).

      In this fingerprint collation system, collation of the fingerprint of the user is performed as follows.

      During the operation of the system, the user inputs an ID number assigned to him/her by using the ten-key pad 10-1 (step 201 in FIG. 8), and then puts his/her finger on the upper surface UP (fingerprint collection surface A-B) of the prism 10-33 along the guide 10-41 of the fingerprint input apparatus 10.

      With this operation, the pattern of the collected fingerprint (collation fingerprint) is supplied as halftone image data to the processing section 20 in the same manner as in the case of the registration of the fingerprint.

      The control section 20-1 also loads the image data of the collation fingerprint from the fingerprint input apparatus 10 through the frame memory 20-5 (step 204), and displays it on the display 10-2 while superimposing it on the fingerprint image of the registration fingerprint (step 205).
      <br/>
      FIG. 6B shows a display sample in this case.
      <br/>
      The user sees this superimposed state of the fingerprint image of the registration fingerprint and the fingerprint image of the collation fingerprint displayed on the display 10-2 to determine whether to change the position of the pinhole PH.

      <br/>
      The user then adjusts the angular positions of the three-axis position adjusting knobs Cx, Cy, and Cz to adjust the position of the pinhole plate 10-34 in the X, Y, and Z directions, i.e., the position of the pinhole PH in the X, Y, and Z directions, through the pinhole position adjusting mechanism 10-35, thereby setting the fingerprint image of the collation fingerprint on the display 10-2 to a desired position in a desired size (steps 204 to 206).

      The fingerprint image of the confirmed collation fingerprint is collated with the fingerprint image of the previously readout registration fingerprint (step 208).

      In this embodiment, a blur and distortion can be greatly reduced according to the above basic principle.

      In addition, the position and size of an input fingerprint image in a registration process can be set to a desired position and a desired size by manually adjusting the position of the pinhole PH with the three-axis position adjusting knobs Cx, Cy, and Cz.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the positional offset between the input fingerprint images in registration and collation processes can be absorbed, and the difference between the sizes of the input fingerprint images can also be coped with.

      Note that if a collected fingerprint image is small, the area of the background becomes large, resulting in a deterioration in collation precision.
      <br/>
      Such a deterioration in collation precision can be prevented by moving the pinhole PH in the Z direction (in which the pinhole PH moves apart from the imaging plane I-J) to increase the collected fingerprint image.

      The fingerprint collection surface A-B of the first prism 1 is set to be parallel to the imaging plane I-J, and the fingerprint collection surface A-B of the first prism 1 is set to be parallel to a surface L-M of the second prism 4 on the imaging plane side.
      <br/>
      An exit surface C-D of the first prism 1 with respect to the pinhole PH is set to be parallel to an incident surface K-M of the second prism 4 with respect to the pinhole PH.

      In this case, the surface L-M of the second prism 4 is placed above the imaging plane I-J.

      With this arrangement, the optical system on the first prism 1 side is set to be similar to the optical system on the second prism 4 side with the pinhole PH (point O) being the center, thereby perfectly eliminating the distortion.

      That is, the blur and the distortion can be eliminated at once.

    <p num="96">
      In Embodiment 1 (see FIG. 1A), the diameter of the pinhole PH must be decreased to some degree to increase the resolution of a fingerprint image.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the light intensity of a fingerprint image formed on the imaging plane I-J decreases.
      <br/>
      To compensate for this, the intensity of light from a light source which is irradiated on the fingerprint collection surface A-B must be increased.
      <br/>
      As a result, the service life of the light source itself is shortened because of the heat generated by the light source, or the light transmitted through the prism 1 is too bright for the user, thus posing new problems.
      <br/>
      To solve such problems, a near infrared light-emitting diode may be used as a light source.
      <br/>
      In this case, although glaring can be suppressed, the problem of the generation of heat cannot be solved.

    <p num="97">
      The present applicant, therefore, has proposed an arrangement in which a lens 5-2 is placed near the rear surface of a pinhole plate 5-1, as shown in FIG. 17, to increase the light intensity of a fingerprint image formed on an imaging plane 5-3 without increasing the intensity of light from a light source 6.
      <br/>
      In this arrangement, when a straight line connecting the center of a fingerprint collection surface 1-1 and the center of the imaging plane 5-3 is an optical axis, the central axis of the lens 5-2 is made to coincide with the optical axis.
      <br/>
      In addition, since a blur occurs owing to the lens 5-2, the inclination of the imaging plane 5-3 with respect to the optical axis is adjusted to prevent the blur.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 17, reference numeral 1-2 denotes a black coating (or light-shielding plate) formed on the left-side surface of a prism 1.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      In this arrangement, however, trapezoidal distortion occurs at the imaging plane 5-3.
      <br/>
      More specifically, if an object in the form of a square lattice, like the one shown in FIG. 18A, is placed on the fingerprint collection surface 1-1, the resultant image on the imaging plane 5-3 has trapezoidal distortion like the one shown in FIG. 18B. Referring to FIG. 19, letting A-B be the fingerprint collection surface, O be the center of the pinhole, a-b be the imaging plane, X be an arbitrary point on the fingerprint collection surface A-B, and x be the point at which the point X is projected on the imaging plane a-b, an image magnification m at the point x is given by m=Ox/OX.
      <br/>
      That is, the image magnification is determined by the ratio of a line segment Ox to a line segment OX.
      <br/>
      In this case, since a triangle OAB is not similar to a triangle Oab, and a line segment OA is shorter than a line segment OB, the image on the point A side becomes large, whereas the image on the point B side becomes small.
      <br/>
      This trapezoidal distortion increases as the ratio of OA:OB increases.
      <br/>
      As the size of the fingerprint input apparatus decreases, the distance between the fingerprint collection surface and the lens must be decreased.
      <br/>
      If this distance is decreased, the ratio of OA:OB increases, resulting in greater trapezoidal distortion.
    </p>
    <p num="99">In Embodiment 2, therefore, the light intensity of a fingerprint image formed on the imaging plane 5-3 can be increased without increasing the light intensity of the light source 6, and the occurrence of trapezoidal distortion is greatly suppressed under the condition in which a blur is suppressed, thereby obtaining a high-quality fingerprint image.</p>

      A central axis LC of the lens 5-2 is inclined, by  THETA 1, to the B point side on the fingerprint collection surface A-B side with respect to an optical axis LO (a straight line connecting a center Xo of a fingerprint collection surface A-B and a center xo of an imaging plane a-b).
      <br/>
      In addition, to prevent a blur, the inclination of the imaging plane a-b with respect to the optical axis LO is adjusted.

    <p num="103">
      In this case, since the light intensity of a fingerprint image formed on the imaging plane a-b by the lens 5-2 is increased, the intensity of light from a light source 6 need not be increased, thereby preventing shortening of the service life of the light source 6 due to the generation of heat and glaring of light transmitted through a prism 1.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a blur is suppressed by adjusting the inclination of the imaging plane a-b with respect to the optical axis LO, and trapezoidal distortion under the condition in which this blur is suppressed is suppressed by inclining the central axis LC of the lens 5-2 by  THETA 1 with respect to the optical axis LO, thereby obtaining a high-quality fingerprint image.

      <br/>
      Furthermore, a blur is suppressed by adjusting the inclination of the imaging plane a-b with respect to the optical axis LO, and trapezoidal distortion under the condition in which this blur is suppressed is suppressed by inclining the central axis LC of the lens 5-2 by  THETA 2 with respect to the optical axis LO, thereby obtaining a high-quality fingerprint image.

    <p num="108">
      As described above, there are two types of distortion, i.e., barrel distortion and pincushion distortion.

      In this embodiment, the pinhole serves to increase the degree of freedom in design.
      <br/>
      That is, since the pinhole is formed in front of the lens, the depth of focus of the lens increases, and a tolerance can be ensured for the angle defined by the imaging plane and the optical axis that causes no blur, thereby satisfactorily increasing the degree of freedom in design.

      5 While the inclination angle of the imaging plane with respect to the optical axis is changed so as not to cause a blur, operations 3 and 4 are repeated, thereby selecting a lens, positioning the lens, selecting a pinhole, and positioning the pinhole.

      6 An angle at which trapezoidal distortion is minimized is determined by changing the lens angle.

    <p num="112">
      Prior to a description of the ninth to 15th aspects of the present invention, the techniques on which these aspects are based will be described.
      <br/>
      A fingerprint input apparatus includes an optical system as a constituent, and a reduction in the size of the apparatus is required in consideration of the installation place, operability, and the like.
      <br/>
      The size of this fingerprint input apparatus can be effectively reduced by forming an optical system according to the optical path separation method and placing a light source and a prism close to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      FIG. 23 shows the main part of a conventional fingerprint input apparatus using the optical path separation method.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 23, reference numeral 1 denotes a prism; 3, a light-receiving unit; and 6, a light source.
      <br/>
      The light source 6 is placed on the right side of the lower surface side of the prism 1.
      <br/>
      A black coating (or light-shielding plate) 1-2 is formed on the left-side surface of the prism 1 to irradiate light from the light source 6 on a fingerprint collection surface 1-1 through the prism 1.
      <br/>
      In this arrangement, light from the light source 6 is reflected by the pattern surface of a finger placed on the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 and emerges from the prism 1 to be formed into an image on an imaging plane (CCD) 3-2 through a lens 3-1.
      <br/>
      With the use of the optical separation method, the size of the fingerprint input apparatus can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      FIG. 24 shows the main part of a fingerprint input apparatus using the total reflection method.
      <br/>
      In this fingerprint input apparatus, a light source 6 is placed on the left side of the lower surface side of a prism 1, and light from the light source 6 is irradiated on a fingerprint collection surface 1-1 through a diffusion plate 7 and the prism 1.
      <br/>
      In this arrangement, as is apparent from comparison with FIG. 23, since the space for the light source 6 must be ensured on the left side of the lower surface side of the prism 1 (at the opposite position to the light-receiving unit 3), a reduction in the size of the apparatus is limited.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      In contrast to this, the fingerprint input apparatus using the optical path separation method has an advantage in terms of a reduction in size.
      <br/>
      If, however, the light source 6 and the prism 1 are brought close to each other to further reduce the size, the incident angle on the illumination light incident surface of the prism 1 increases, and light is refracted and diffused.
      <br/>
      As a result, the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 of the prism 1 partly decreases in illuminance, leading to illuminance irregularity.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      More specifically, as shown in FIG. 25, when the position of the light source 6 is a point O near the prism 1, the incident angle of light from the light source 6 with respect to a prism surface (illumination light incident surface) B-E increases with distance.
      <br/>
      As a result, the diffusion angle of light due to refraction increases, and the illuminance decreases toward a point B side on a prism surface (fingerprint collection surface) A-B.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      The collation precision of a fingerprint collation system greatly depends on whether a fingerprint image can be properly input.
      <br/>
      To properly input a fingerprint image, uniform illuminance must be ensured throughout the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 of the prism 1, and illuminance irregularity must be prevented.
      <br/>
      If illuminance irregularity occurs on the fingerprint collection surface 1-1, the quality of an obtained fingerprint image deteriorates, and the collation precision deteriorates.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      In Embodiment 3, therefore, the light source 6 and the prism 1 are placed close to each other to attain a reduction in size without causing any illuminance irregularity on the fingerprint collection surface 1-1.
      <br/>
      That is, both a reduction in the size of the apparatus and an improvement in the quality of a fingerprint image are attained at once.

      In this embodiment, a cut surface 1-3 is formed at a distance from the vertex (a point E in FIG. 23) of a prism 1 which opposes a fingerprint collection surface 1-1.
      <br/>
      A light source 6 is placed to oppose the cut surface 1-3 of the prism 1.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, light from the light source 6 enters the prism 1 through the cut surface 1-3 to be irradiated on the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 with an almost uniform diffusion angle.

      As a result, an almost uniform illuminance can be obtained on the fingerprint collection surface 1-1.

      1 The imaging optical path from the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 to an imaging plane 3-2 should not be obstructed;
      <br/>
      2 An image of the light source 6 should not be projected on the imaging plane 3-2; and
      <br/>
      3 Light from the light source 6 should not be totally reflected by the fingerprint collection surface 1-1.

    <p num="123">�Condition 1�</p>
    <p num="124">
      FIG. 27 shows a region satisfying condition 1, which is indicated by hatching.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 27, if the region of the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 (A-B) is projected on the imaging plane 3-2 (a-b), light emerging from a point A is incident on the imaging plane 3-2 through the optical path "A --&gt;  ALPHA  --&gt; O1 --&gt; a".
      <br/>
      Light emerging from a point B is incident on the imaging plane 3-2 through the optical path "B --&gt; O1 --&gt; b".
      <br/>
      The hatched region located under a plane A- ALPHA  in FIG. 27 is a region, in the prism 1, which does not obstruct the imaging optical path from the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 to the imaging plane 3-2.
      <br/>
      If the imaging optical path from the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 to the imaging plane 3-2 is obstructed, a fingerprint image on the imaging plane 3-2 deteriorates, resulting in a deterioration in collation precision.
    </p>
    <p num="125">�Condition 2�</p>
    <p num="126">
      According to Fresnel's formulas, light is reflected by the interface between media having different refractive indexes.
      <br/>
      Letting n1 and n2 be the refractive indexes of the media, a reflectance R in the case of vertical incidence is given by R=�(n1-n2)/(n1+n2)�2. If the refractive index n1 is the refractive index of air (n1=1.0), and the refractive index n2 is the refractive index of glass used for the prism (n2=1.5), 4% of light is reflected according to the above equation.
      <br/>
      As is obvious from this, when light from the light source 6 is incident on the prism 1, the light is reflected by the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 owing to the position of the light source 6, and an image of the light source 6 is projected on the imaging plane 3-2.
      <br/>
      As a result, a fingerprint image on the imaging plane 3-2 deteriorates, leading to a deterioration in collation precision.
    </p>
    <p num="127">In the case shown in FIG. 28, for example, the condition in which an image of the light source 6 is not projected on the imaging plane 3-2 is that the light source 6 is located in the hatched region under a straight line extending from a point B to a point O. Letting  BETA  be the angle defined by points A, B, and E of the prism 1,  PSI  be the incident angle of light from a point O to a point B with respect to a surface A-B, and  THETA  be the angle at which light reflected at the point B is refracted on a surface B-E of the prism and emerges to an end point b of the imaging plane 3-2, a reflected image of the light source 6 is not projected on the imaging plane 3-2 as long as the light source 6 is located at a position within the range of  PSI  &lt;=  BETA -sin-1 (sin THETA /n2) (the hatched region in FIG. 28).</p>
    <p num="128">�Condition 3�</p>
    <p num="129">
      In the case shown in FIG. 29, when light is incident from the n2 side of n1&lt;n2 at the incident angle  PSI , all the incident light is reflected when incident angle satisfies sin PSI  &gt;= n2/n1.
      <br/>
      This phenomenon is called total reflection.
      <br/>
      Even if the light source 6 is at a position where total reflection occurs, no influence is theoretically exerted on a fingerprint image on the imaging plane 3-2 as long as condition 2 is satisfied.
      <br/>
      However, since light from light source 6 is totally reflected, stray light may become a flare or the like and affect a fingerprint image.
      <br/>
      When the light source 6 is to be placed to oppose the cut surface 1-3, the condition for the cut surface 1-3 is that light from the light source 6 is not totally reflected by the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 regardless of the position of the light source 6.
      <br/>
      Note that condition 3 is not an absolutely necessary condition, and the cut surface 1-3 may be formed under conditions 1 and 2 alone.
    </p>
    <p num="130">�Embodiment 3-2: 12th Aspect�</p>
    <p num="131">
      In Embodiment 3-1, when at least conditions 1 and 2 are to be satisfied, the cut surface 1-3 decreases in size, and the light source 6 may not be positioned.
      <br/>
      In this case, as shown in FIG. 30, an inclined surface may be formed as a cut surface 1-3 to increase its size, as shown in FIG. 30. In this case, however, the cut surface 1-3 is excessively inclined with respect to a fingerprint collection surface 1-1.
      <br/>
      As a result, the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 cannot be uniformly illuminated.
      <br/>
      That is, the left end of the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 is mainly illuminated by a light source 6, and hence the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 cannot be uniformly illuminated.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      In contrast to this, if the distance from the vertex of the prism which opposes the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 and at which the cut surface 1-3 is formed is increased, as shown in FIG. 31, condition 1 is satisfied, but 2 is not satisfied (reflection condition based on Fresnel's formulas).
      <br/>
      That is, a region C-F on the cut surface 1-3 becomes a region which does not satisfy condition 2.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, therefore, a black coating (or light-shielding plate) 1-2 is formed on the area C-F which does not satisfy condition 2.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      In the case shown in FIG. 31, if the light source 6 is placed at a region, on the cut surface 1-3, which satisfies condition 2, any light shield may not be required for the region which does not satisfy condition 2.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 32A, however, if a wall 8 is provided to prevent disturbance light from entering the optical system, stray light propagating from the light source 6 to the wall 8 may be incident on an imaging plane 3-2 through the optical path "G --&gt; H --&gt; I --&gt; J".
      <br/>
      In contrast to this, if light shielding is provided for the region C-F which does not satisfy condition 2, as shown in FIG. 32B, the region C-F is shielded against stray light emitted from the light source 6 and reflected by the wall 8, and no stray light is incident on the imaging plane 3-2.

      In this case, light from the light source 6 is refracted by the cut surface 1-3, and the directivity increases.
      <br/>
      Strictly speaking, therefore, the peripheral portion of the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 becomes darker than the central portion.
    </p>
    <p num="136">In Embodiment 3-3, therefore, a cut surface 1-3 is formed into a concave surface, as shown in FIG. 33A. The curvature of this concave surface is matched with the directivity of a light source 6 so as to uniformly illuminate the fingerprint collection surface 1-1.</p>

    <p num="139">In Embodiment 3-4, therefore, the outer periphery of a concave cut surface 1-3 is formed into a convex surface, as shown in FIG. 33B.

      In each of Embodiments 3-1 to 3-4, the cut surface 1-3 is formed on the prism 1 to improve illumination irregularity on the fingerprint collection surface 1-1.

      In contrast to this, in Embodiment 3-5, as shown in FIG. 34A, a light source 6 is placed close to a prism surface B-E through a matching member 9 having a high refractive index.
      <br/>
      No cut surface 103 is formed on a prism 1.
      <br/>
      With this structure, a light beam is not refracted by the prism surface B-E, and light from the light source 6 can be irradiated on a fingerprint collection surface 1-1 with the diffusion angle being kept almost uniform.

      As a material for the matching member 9, a refractive index matching solution is known.
      <br/>
      However, a material other than this solution, e.g., an epoxy-based adhesive, may be used as long as the difference between the refractive indexes of the prism 1 and the material does not greatly influence the uniformity of illumination on the fingerprint collection surface 1-1.

    <p num="146">
      Prior to a description of the 16th to 18th aspects of the present invention, the techniques on which these aspects are based will be described.
      <br/>
      A fingerprint input apparatus includes an optical system as a constituent, and a reduction in the size of the apparatus is required in consideration of the installation place, operability, and the like.
      <br/>
      To realize such a compact fingerprint input apparatus, a surface-mounting type LED is often used as a light source.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      FIG. 35 shows the main part of a conventional fingerprint input apparatus.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 35, reference numeral 6 denotes a light source (LED); 11, a substrate having a front surface 11F on which the LED 6 is mounted; 1, a prism; and 3, a light-receiving unit.
      <br/>
      This apparatus uses the optical path separation method.
      <br/>
      The substrate 11 having the LED 6 mounted thereon is placed on the right side of the lower surface side of the prism 1, and a black coating (or light-shielding plate) 1-2 is formed on the left-side surface of the prism 1.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, light from the LED 6 is irradiated on the a fingerprint collection surface A-B through the prism 1.
      <br/>
      In this arrangement, light reflected by the pattern surface of a finger placed on the fingerprint collection surface A-B and emerging from the prism 1 is formed into an image on an imaging plane (CCD) 3-2 through a lens 3-1 of the light-receiving unit 3.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      In this fingerprint input apparatus, however, a large amount of light leaks on the side and rear surfaces of the LED 6.
      <br/>
      That is, since light from the side and rear surfaces of the LED 6 is not incident on the prism 1, the illumination efficiency for the fingerprint collection surface A-B is poor.
      <br/>
      The collation precision of a fingerprint collation system greatly depends on whether a fingerprint image can be properly input.
      <br/>
      If, therefore, the illumination efficiency for the fingerprint collection surface A-B deteriorates, the quality of a fingerprint image deteriorates, resulting in a deterioration in collation precision.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      In addition, light which is transmitted through the side surfaces of the LED 6 and the substrate 11 and leaks out from a rear surface 11R becomes stray light, which then enters, as noise, a fingerprint image formed on the CCD 3-2.
      <br/>
      As a result, the quality of the fingerprint image deteriorates, and the collation precision deteriorates.
    </p>
    <p num="150">
      Note that a reflecting mirror 12 like the one indicated by the dotted lines in FIG. 35 may be placed on the rear surface side of the substrate 11 to cause light transmitted through the side surfaces of the LED 6 and the substrate 11 and leaking out from the rear surface 11R to be incident on the prism 1.
      <br/>
      In this method, however, the number of parts increases, leading to an increase in cost and interfering with a reduction in size.
      <br/>
      In this case, since light transmitted through the substrate 11 and leaking out from the rear surface 11R is transmitted through the substrate 11 and incident on the prism 1, i.e., the light passes through the substrate 11 twice, the light intensity decreases.
    </p>
    <p num="151">In Embodiment 4, therefore, a high-quality fingerprint image is obtained at a low cost without interfering with a reduction in size.</p>

    <p num="154">In Embodiment 4-1, a film (reflecting film) 11-1 having a high reflectance is formed on a front surface 11F of a substrate 11, i.e., the front surface 11F of the substrate 11 on which an LED 6 is mounted.</p>
    <p num="155">
      FIGS. 37A and 37B show how the reflecting film 11-1 is formed on the substrate 11.
      <br/>
      Power supply electrode pads PA and PB and LED electrode pads P11, P12, P21, P22, P31, P32, P41, P42, P51, P52, P61, and P62 are formed on the front surface 11F of the substrate 11 by etching a metal film.
      <br/>
      The reflecting film 11-1 is formed on the entire region of the substrate except for the portions where these electrode pads are formed.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      A coating method, a printing method, or the like may be used to form the reflecting surface 11-1.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the reflecting film 11-1 is formed on the front surface 11F of the substrate 11 by a screen printing method using a white coating material.
      <br/>
      Since the reflectance of the white coating material for screen printing is 80%, light can be efficiently reflected.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the white coating material diffuses/reflects light, a uniform light intensity distribution with little directivity can be realized.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, element numbers and the like are printed on the substrate 11 by screen printing, and the reflecting film 11-1 can be formed in the same process as this printing process, this method is advantageous in terms of cost.
    </p>
    <p num="157">As shown in FIGS. 38A and 38B, after the reflecting film 11-1 is formed on the substrate 11, an LED 6-1 is connected to the LED pads P11 and P12 through solder portions F, an LED 6-2 is connected to the LEDs P21 and P22 through solder portions F, an LED 6-3 is connected to the LED pads P31 and P32 through solder portions F, an LED 6-4 is connected to the LED pads P41 and P42 through solder portions F, an LED 6-5 is connected to the LED pads P51 and P52 through solder portions F, and an LED 6-6 is connected to the LED pads P61 and P62 through solder portions F.</p>
    <p num="158">
      With this structure, light leaking from the side and rear surfaces of the LEDs 6-1 to 6-6 is reflected by the reflecting film 11-1 of the front surface 11F of the substrate 11 and incident on a prism 3.
      <br/>
      As a result, the illumination efficiency for the fingerprint collection surface A-B improves, and the collation precision at a low cost without interfering with a reduction in size.

    <p num="159">�Embodiment 4-2: 17th Aspect�</p>
    <p num="160">In Embodiment 4-2, a film (light-shielding film) 11-1' for shielding light is formed on a front surface 11F of a substrate 11 on which an LED 6 is mounted.</p>
    <p num="161">
      In this embodiment, as in Embodiment 1, the light-shielding film 11-1' is formed by screen printing.
      <br/>
      Note, however, that a black coating material for screen printing is used for the light-shielding film 11-1'. Since the light-shielding film 11-1' is black, light is absorbed into the coating material, thus preventing the light from passing through a rear surface 11R of the substrate 11.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      With this structure, light leaking from the side and rear surfaces of LEDs 6-1 to 6-6 is shielded by the light-shielding film 11-1' of the front surface 11F of the substrate 11 to prevent the light from pass through the substrate 11 and leaking from the rear surface 11R.
      <br/>
      As a result, the amount of stray light entering, as noise, a fingerprint image formed on a CCD 3-2 decreases, and the quality of the fingerprint image improves.
      <br/>
      The collation precision can therefore be improved at a low cost without interfering with a reduction in size.
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      Similar to the reflecting film 11-1, the light-shielding film 11-1' is formed on the entire region of the substrate except for the portions where electrode pads P are formed.
      <br/>
      If, however, the print portion overlaps the pad portions to such an extent that no influence is exerted on bonding of the LEDs 6-1 to 6-6, leakage of light can be prevented more effectively.
      <br/>
      That is, the light-shielding characteristics improve.
    </p>
    <p num="164">�Embodiment 4-3: 18th Aspect�</p>
    <p num="165">In Embodiment 4-3, a film (reflecting/light-shielding film) 11-1" having a high reflectance and serving to shield light is formed on a front surface 11F of a substrate 11 on which an LED 6 is mounted.</p>
    <p num="166">
      In this embodiment, as in Embodiment 1, the reflecting/light-shielding film 11-1" is formed by screen printing.
      <br/>
      Note, however, that a white coating material for screen printing is used for the reflecting/light-shielding film 11-1", and the film is formed thick.
      <br/>
      Since the white coating material is printed thick, light is diffused/reflected by the front surface 11F of the substrate 11.
      <br/>
      Although the absorbance of the white coating material is low, a larger amount of light can be absorbed with an increase in the thickness of the film.
      <br/>
      Even a white coating material can shield light depending on the film thickness.
    </p>
    <p num="167">
      With this structure, light leaking from the side and rear surfaces of LEDs 6-1 to 6-6 is reflected by the reflecting/light-shielding film 11-1" on the front surface 11F of the substrate 11 to be incident on a prism 1.
      <br/>
      As a result, the illumination efficiency for a fingerprint collection surface A-B improves, and the collation precision improves.
      <br/>
      In addition, light leaking from the side and rear surfaces of the LEDs 6-1 to 6-6 is shielded by the reflecting/light-shielding film 11-1" on the front surface 11F of the substrate 11 to prevent the light from passing through the substrate 11 and leaking out from a rear surface 11R of the substrate.
      <br/>
      As a result, the amount of stray light entering, as noise, a fingerprint image formed on a CCD 3-2 decreases, and the quality of the fingerprint image improves, thus improving the collation precision.
    </p>
    <p num="168">In Embodiment 4-3, as in Embodiment 4-2, if the print portion overlaps the pad portions to such an extent that no influence is exerted on bonding of the LEDs 6-1 to 6-6, leakage of light can be prevented more effectively, and the light-shielding characteristics improve.</p>
    <p num="169">�Embodiment 4-4: 18th Aspect�</p>
    <p num="170">
      In Embodiment 4-3, the reflecting/light-shielding film 11-1" is formed by screen printing.
      <br/>
      In contrast to this, in Embodiment 4-4, a reflecting/light-shielding film 11-1" is formed by using a metal film.
    </p>
    <p num="171">
      In this case, when electrode pads PA, PB, P11, P12 to P61, and P62 are to be formed on a front surface 11F of a substrate 11 by etching, gaps are ensured around the respective electrode pads P, and a metal film is left outside the gaps (see FIG. 39A).
      <br/>
      This left metal film is the reflecting/light-shielding film 11-1".
    </p>
    <p num="172">
      The surface of the metal film reflect light efficiently.
      <br/>
      In addition, since light is not transmitted through the film, a light-shielding effect can be ensured.
      <br/>
      In Embodiment 4-4 using the metal film as the reflecting/light-shielding film 11-1", the same effects as those of Embodiment 4-3 can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="173">
      Referring to FIG. 39A, relatively thick white coatings are formed on gaps G (GA, GB, G11, G12 to G61, and G62) ensured around the respective pads P by screen printing.
      <br/>
      With these coatings, the respective pads P can be reliably insulated from each other, and the light-shielding characteristics can be improved.

      In Embodiments 4-1 to 4-4 described above, the present invention is applied to the fingerprint input apparatuses using the optical separation method.

      However, the present invention can also be applied to fingerprint input apparatuses using the total reflection method.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 40, a fingerprint input apparatus using the total reflection method is designed such that a substrate 11 having an LED 6 mounted thereon is placed on the left side of the lower surface side of a prism 1, and light from the LED 6 is irradiated on a fingerprint collection surface A-B through a diffusion plate 7 and the prism 1.
      <br/>
      In this arrangement, a reflecting film 11-1, a light-shielding film 11-1', or a reflecting/light-shielding film 11-1" is formed on a front surface 11F of the substrate 11 having the LED 6 mounted thereon in the same manner as in the case of the fingerprint input apparatuses using the optical separation method.

    <p num="177">
      Prior to a description of the 19th to 24th aspects of the present invention, the techniques on which these aspects are based will be described.
      <br/>
      The collation precision of a fingerprint collation system greatly depends on whether a fingerprint image can be properly input.
      <br/>
      For example, disturbances affecting a fingerprint image input operation include dust and the like adhering to an optical system including a prism and a lens and disturbance light entering the imaging plane of a CCD.
      <br/>
      If disturbance light enters the imaging plane, a fingerprint image is made dim.
      <br/>
      A clear, high-contrast fingerprint image cannot therefore be obtained.
      <br/>
      Conventionally, a main body case for covering the overall fingerprint input apparatus is made to have a hermetic structure to protect the apparatus against such disturbances.
    </p>
    <p num="178">
      FIG. 41 shows the main part of a conventional fingerprint input apparatus.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 41, reference numeral 6 denotes a light source; 1, a prism; 13, a prism holder; 3, a light-receiving unit; and 14, a main body case.
      <br/>
      The light source 6 is placed on the right side of the lower surface side of the prism 1.
      <br/>
      The prism 1 is held by the prism holder 13.
      <br/>
      The prism holder 13 is fixed to the main body case 14 such that a fingerprint collection surface 1-1 of the prism 1 opposes a finger mount portion opening 14-1 of the main body case 14.
      <br/>
      The light-receiving unit 3 includes a lens 3-1, an imaging plane (CCD) 3-2, and an imaging plane case 3-3.
      <br/>
      The main body case 14 has a hermetic structure.
    </p>
    <p num="179">
      In this fingerprint input apparatus, light from the light source 6 is irradiated on the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 through the prism 1.
      <br/>
      The light is reflected by the pattern surface of a finger placed on the fingerprint collection surface 1-1, emerges from the prism 1, and is formed into an image on the imaging plane 3-2 through the lens 3-1 of the light-receiving unit 3.
      <br/>
      In this case, the main body case 14 having a hermetic structure prevents dust and the like from adhering to the optical system including the lens 3-1 and the like, and also prevents external light (disturbance light 1) from entering the imaging plane 3-2.
    </p>
    <p num="180">
      In this conventional fingerprint input apparatus, however, light (disturbance light 2) emitted from the light source 6 and detouring the prism 1 to enter the imaging plane 3-2 cannot be prevented.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the main body case 14 has a hermetic structure, it is difficult to dissipate heat generated by the light source 6 and the circuits inside the case.
      <br/>
      The apparatus tends to deteriorate owing to this heat.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, since the main body case 14 is heavy, a reduction in the weight of the apparatus is interfered.
    </p>
    <p num="181">Embodiment 5 is therefore designed to reliably prevent dust and the like from adhering to an optical system and prevent disturbance light from entering the imaging plane 3-2 without making the main body case 14 have a hermetic structure, thereby obtaining a high-quality fingerprint image.</p>

      In Embodiment 5-1, a light-shielding cover 15 is placed between a prism I and a light-receiving unit 3' to cover an imaging optical path between an exit surface 1-4 of the prism 1 and an imaging plane 3-2 while isolating the optical path from the outside.
      <br/>
      In this case, a prism holder 13' for holding the prism 1 has openings 13-1 and 13-2 formed in surface portions opposing the exit surface 1-4 of the prism 1 and an incident surface 1-5 on which light from a light source 6 is incident (see FIG. 43).
      <br/>
      An opening 15-1 of the light-shielding cover 15 on one end side is coupled to the opening 13-1 of the prism holder 13' with a fitting structures An opening 15-2 of the light-shielding cover 15 on the other side is also coupled to an opening 3-3a of an imaging plane cover 3-3' with a fitting structure.

      Note that many air holes 14-2 are formed in a body case 14'.

    <p num="185">
      In this fingerprint input apparatus, light from the light source 6 is irradiated on the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 through the prism 1.
      <br/>
      The light is reflected by the pattern surface of a finger placed on the fingerprint collection surface 1-1, emerges from the exit surface 1-4 of the prism 1, and is formed into an image on the imaging plane 3-2 through a lens 3-1.
      <br/>
      In this case, the light-shielding cover 15 prevents dust and the like from adhering to the optical system including the lens 3-1 and the like; external light (disturbance light 1) from entering the imaging plane 3-2 through the air holes 14-2; and light (disturbance light 2) emitted from the light source 6 from detouring the prism 1 and entering the imaging plane 3-2.
    </p>
    <p num="186">
      In this fingerprint input apparatus, heat generated by the light source 6 and the circuits inside the body case 14' is dissipated through the air holes 14-2 formed in the body case 14'. With the formation of the air holes 14-2 in the body case 14', the weight of the body case 14' is decreased, and hence a reduction in the overall weight of the apparatus can be attained.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the light-shielding cover 15 serves as a reinforcing member, the positional relationship between the components of the optical system can be reliably maintained against vibrations and external forces, thereby preventing offsets (size, position, and distortion) of a formed image, and allowing a fingerprint image to be stably input.
    </p>
    <p num="187">
      In this embodiment, an optical noise process is performed for the surface of the inner wall of the light-shielding cover 15.
      <br/>
      More specifically, a black matte coating is formed on the surface of the inner wall of the light-shielding cover 15 to prevent disturbance light 3 emerging from the prism 1 from entering the imaging plane 3-2 as optical noise.
      <br/>
      In the absence of the light-shielding cover 15, disturbance light 3 emerging from the prism 1 does not enter the imaging plane 3-2.
      <br/>
      In the presence of the light-shielding cover 15, however, the light is repeatedly reflected by the surface of the inner wall of the light-shielding cover 15 to enter the imaging plane 3-2.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the black matte coating is formed on the surface of the inner wall of the light-shielding cover 15 to prevent disturbance light 3 from entering the imaging plane 3-2.
      <br/>
      Note that an optical noise process may be performed by a method of forming a velvety coating surface by electrostatic coating, a method of forming the surface of the inner wall into an uneven surface, and the like as well as the method of forming a black matte coating.
      <br/>
      That is, entrance of light 3 into the imaging plane 3-2 is prevented by absorbing or diffusely reflecting the light incident on the surface of the inner wall of the light-shielding cover 15.
    </p>
    <p num="188">
      In this embodiment, a film having a high reflectance is formed on the surface of the outer wall of the light-shielding cover 15.
      <br/>
      With this structure, light which is not directly irradiated from the light source 6 onto the prism 1 is reflected by the high-reflectance film on the surface of the outer wall of the light-shielding cover 15 to be incident on the prism 1, thereby improving the illumination efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="189">
      In this embodiment, since the light-shielding cover 15 is coupled to the main body by a fitting structure, an optical system positioning effect can be obtained.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the frame and the cover are tightly coupled to each other without any gap, the light-shielding effect and the dustproof effect improve.
      <br/>
      In this case, if the light-shielding cover 15 is temporarily secured to the main body with a fitting structure, and is fastened to the main body with screws or the like afterward, the reinforcing effect improves.

      In this embodiment, as in Embodiment 5-1, an optical noise process is performed for the surface of the inner wall of the light-shielding cover 15, a film having a high reflectance is formed on the surface of the outer wall of the light-shielding cover 15 or the light source cover 16, and the integrally formed light-shielding cover 15 and light source cover 16 are coupled to the main body with a fitting structure.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, if a film having a high reflectance is formed on the surface of the inner wall of the light source cover 16, the reflectance increases, and the illumination efficiency improves.

      In each of Embodiments 5-1 and 5-2, the lens 3-1 is used to form a fingerprint image on the imaging plane 3-2.
      <br/>
      However, a pinhole may be used in place of the lens 3-1.
    </p>
    <p num="195">
      In Embodiment 5-1 (FIG. 42), the optical system is arranged according to the optical path separation method, but may be arranged according to the total reflection method.
      <br/>
      According to the total reflection method, the light source 6 is placed on the left side of the lower surface side of the prism 1, and light from the light source 6 is irradiated on the fingerprint collection surface 1-1 through the prism 1.
      <br/>
      In this arrangement, however, since the space for the light source 6 must be ensured on the left side of the lower surface side of the prism 1 (on the opposite side to the light-receiving unit 3'), a reduction in the size of the apparatus is limited.
      <br/>
      Embodiment 5-2 (FIG. 44) is suited for a case in which the optical system is arranged according to the optical path separation method.

      As is obvious from the above description, according to the first aspect and the second, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh aspects associated with the first aspect, light reflected by the pattern surface of a finger placed directly or indirectly on the fingerprint collection surface and emerging from the prism passes through the pinhole to be formed into an image on the imaging plane almost parallel to the optical fingerprint collection surface of the prism.
      <br/>
      In this arrangement, since the optical path ratio is made constant, and one point on the fingerprint collection surface is imaged at one point on the imaging plane, a blur and distortion can be greatly reduced, and a high-quality fingerprint image can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="197">
      According to the third aspect and the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh aspects associated with the third aspect, the optical system on the first prism side and the optical system on the second prism side are set to be similar to each other.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, light reflected by the pattern surface of a finger placed directly or indirectly on the fingerprint collection surface and emerging from the first prism passes through the pinhole to be formed into an image on the imaging plane through the second prism.
      <br/>
      A blur and distortion can be eliminated at once, and hence a high-quality fingerprint image can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="198">
      According to the eighth aspect, the imaging plane is inclined with respect to the optical axis to prevent a blur, and the central axis of the lens is inclined with respect to the optical axis to prevent trapezoidal distortion.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, the light intensity of a fingerprint image formed on the imaging plane can be increased without increasing the intensity of light from the light source, and the occurrence of trapezoidal distortion can be greatly suppressed under the condition in which a blur is suppressed, thereby obtaining a high-quality fingerprint image.
    </p>
    <p num="199">
      According to the ninth aspect, light from the light source is incident on the prism through the cut surface and irradiated on the fingerprint collection surface with an almost uniform diffusion angle.
      <br/>
      The light can therefore be placed near the prism to realize a compact structure without causing illumination irregularity on the fingerprint collection surface.
      <br/>
      That is, both a reduction in the size of the apparatus and an improvement in the quality of a fingerprint image can be realized at once.
    </p>
    <p num="200">
      According to the 10th aspect, the imaging optical path of light propagating from the fingerprint collection surface to the imaging plane is not shielded within the prism, and an image of the light source is not projected on the imaging plane.
      <br/>
      For this reason, both a reduction in the size of the apparatus and an improvement in the quality of a fingerprint image can be realized at once.
    </p>
    <p num="201">
      According to the 11th aspect, the imaging optical path of light propagating from the fingerprint collection surface to the imaging plane is not shielded within the prism, and an image of the light source is not projected on the imaging plane.
      <br/>
      In addition, light from the light source is not totally reflected by the fingerprint collection surface.
      <br/>
      In addition to the effects of the 10th aspect, therefore, the effect of preventing total reflection from adversely affecting a fingerprint image can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="202">
      According to the 12th aspect, the imaging optical path of light propagating from the fingerprint collection surface to the imaging plane is not shielded within the prism, and there is no possibility that an image of the light source is projected on the imaging plane owing to the light-shielding effect provided for the cut surface.
      <br/>
      The size of the apparatus can therefore be further reduced by increasing the cut surface.
    </p>
    <p num="203">
      According to the 13th aspect, light from the light source is incident on the prism through the concave cut surface.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, illumination to the fingerprint collection surface can be made uniform as compared with a case in which a flat cut surface is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="204">
      According to the 14th aspect, light from the light source is diffused by the concave inner surface of the cut surface and is focused by the convex surface of the outer periphery of the cut surface to be irradiated on the fingerprint collection surface.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, the light intensity distribution on the imaging plane can be made uniform.
    </p>
    <p num="205">
      According to the 15th aspect, light from the light source is incident on the prism through the matching member to be irradiated on the fingerprint collection surface with an almost uniform diffusion angle.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, both a reduction in the size of the apparatus and an improvement in the quality of a fingerprint image can be realized at once.
      <br/>
      In this arrangement of the apparatus, the prism need not have a cut surface.
      <br/>
      In addition, since heat generated by the light source is radiated to the prism through the matching member, perspiration of the finger is stimulated.
      <br/>
      As a result, an additional effect of obtaining a clear fingerprint image can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="206">
      According to the 16th aspect, light leaking from the side and rear surfaces of the light source is reflected by the reflecting film on the substrate surface and incident on the prism.
      <br/>
      As a result, the illumination efficiency for the fingerprint collection surface improves, and hence a high-quality fingerprint image can be obtained at a low cost without interfering with a reduction in size.
    </p>
    <p num="207">
      According to the 17th aspect, light leaking from the side and rear surfaces of the light source is shielded by the light-shielding film on the substrate surface to be prevented from passing through the substrate and leaking out from the rear surface.
      <br/>
      As a result, the amount of stray light entering, as noise, a fingerprint image formed on the imaging plane decreases, and hence the quality of a fingerprint image can be further improved at a low cost without interfering with a reduction in size.
    </p>
    <p num="208">
      According to the 18th aspect, light leaking from the side and rear surfaces of the light source is reflected by the reflecting/light-shielding film on the substrate surface to be incident on the prism.
      <br/>
      In addition, the light leaking from the side and rear surfaces of the light source is shielded by the reflecting/light-shielding film on the substrate surface to be prevented from passing through the substrate and leaking out from the rear surface.
      <br/>
      The effects of both the 16th and 17th aspects can therefore be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="209">
      According to the 19th aspect, the light-shielding cover for covering the imaging optical path between the exit surface and imaging plane of the prism while isolating the optical path from the outside is used to reliably prevent dust and the like from adhering to the optical system; and disturbance light (disturbance light 1 and 2) from entering the imaging plane, thereby obtaining a high-quality fingerprint image.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the light-shielding cover serves as a reinforming member, the positional relationship between the components of the optical system can be reliably maintained against vibrations and external forces.
      <br/>
      Offsets (size, position, and distortion) of a formed image can therefore be prevented, and a fingerprint image can be stably input.
    </p>
    <p num="210">According to the 20th aspect, since an optical noise process is performed for the surface of the inner wall of the light-shielding cover in the 19th aspect, disturbance light (disturbance light 3) emerging from the prism can be prevented from entering, as optical noise, the imaging plane.</p>
    <p num="211">
      According to the 21st aspect, since the high-reflectance film is formed on the surface of the outer wall of the light-shielding cover in the 19th or 20th aspect, light which is not directly irradiated from the light source onto the prism is reflected by the high-reflectance film to be incident on the prism.
      <br/>
      As a result, the illumination efficiency improves.
    </p>
    <p num="212">
      According to the 22nd aspect, since the light source cover covers the light source except for the exit surface side with respect to the prism, the illumination efficiency for the prism improves.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the light-shielding cover and the light source cover are integrally formed, the number of parts decreases.
      <br/>
      As a result, a reduction in cost can be attained.
    </p>
    <p num="213">
      According to the 24th aspect, the opening of the light-shielding cover on one end side is coupled to the opening of the prism holder which opposes the exit surface of the prism with the fitting structure, and the opening of the light-shielding cover on the other side is coupled to the opening of the imaging plane case with the fitting structure.
      <br/>
      When, therefore, these member are to be completely assembled with screws or the like, the three members, i.e., the prism (prism holder), the light-shielding cover, and the imaging plane cover, can be easily secured temporarily.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the coupling portions have no gaps, the light-shielding effect and the dustproof effect can be improved as well as the optical system positioning effect.
