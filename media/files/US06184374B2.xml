      Doxorubicin is, at this time, the most widely used, and very potent anticancer agent.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="29">
      The compounds of the invention are novel, targeted cytotoxic peptide hormones comprising an anthracycline cytotoxic agent, such as DOX or DM-DOX, conjugated to a peptide hormone, such as analogs of LH-RH, bombesin, and somatostatin.
      <br/>
      These cytotoxic peptide hormone conjugates are designed for the treatment of tumors bearing specific receptors for the conjugate, such as breast cancer, ovarian, cancer, endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, and lung cancer.
      <br/>
      Certain of these (unconjugated) anthracycline cytotoxic agents utilized herein are per se novel, and are highly potent, their level of toxicity however is too high for them to be used in unconjugated form.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Daunosamine modified DOX analogs presented in this invention were developed during a search for new, highly active, non-cross resistant analogs of DOX suitable for the formation of covalent conjugates with peptide carriers.</p>
    <p num="31">
      The formation of stable, covalently linked conjugates with fully retained biological activities of their components was achieved by using a dicarboxylic acid spacer, like glutaric acid.
      <br/>
      One carboxyl group of the spacer forms an ester bond with the 14-OH group of DOX or DM-DOX and the other carboxyl group of the spacer forms a carboxamide bond with a well chosen free amino group of the peptide carrier.

    <p num="34">wherein: Q14 signifies a Q moiety with a side chain at the 14 position, R-- is H or --C(O)--(CH2)n --C(O)-- and n=0-7,</p>
    <p num="35">R' is NH2 or an aromatic, saturated or partially saturated 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic compounds having at least one ring nitrogen and optionally having a butadiene moiety bonded to adjacent carbon atoms of said ring to form a bicyclic system,</p>
    <p num="36">
      P is H or a peptide moiety, suitably an LHRH, somatostatin or bombesin analogs, but not excluding other physiologically active peptides.
      <br/>
      Particularly desirable are those LHRH analogs having affinity for neoplastic cell receptors, especially those analogs having a D-Lys moiety at the 6 position, as well as shortened somatostatin and bombesin analogs.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless where R' is NH2 then R and P are other than H. When R and P are H, then R' is other than NH2.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      A novel synthetic reaction has been discovered in the course of this work.
      <br/>
      Not only was it found that doxorubicin and its derivatives can be coupled via a dicarboxylic moiety at the 14 position to yield novel pharmacologically effective conjugates but a novel way was provided to form partially saturated heterocyclic moieties from vicinal and disjunct i.e.,  ALPHA ,  BETA  or  ALPHA ,  GAMMA  hydroxy primary amines.
      <br/>
      The particular application in the present invention was the formation of 2"-pyrollinyl and 1",3"-tetrahydropyridinyl moieties on the daunosamine sugar.
      <br/>
      However, this reaction has broader applicability. 5 and 6 membered partially saturated heterocyclic moieties may be formed when a vicinal or disjunct hydroxy amine is reacted with a halo-substitued aldehyde having 2 or 3 moieties between the aldehyde carbon and the carbon atom having the halo group.
      <br/>
      These moieties may all be methylene, or a hetero atom such as oxygen may be involved.
      <br/>
      The reaction takes place in three stages.
      <br/>
      A very large excess of the haloaldehyde is reacted with the acid salt of the hydroxy amine, suitably in a polar inert anhydrous organic solvent.
      <br/>
      There is thus formed a five membered oxazolidine ring (or a six-membered 1,3-tetrahydrooxazine ring) by condensation of the aldehyde group with the hydroxyl and the amine groups.
      <br/>
      This product is treated with a organic base, suitably a tertiary amine, whereby the elements of hydro-halic acid are eliminated between the halo moiety of the former halo aldehyde and the secondary amino group of the oxazolidine or 1,3-tetrahydrooxazine ring to form a fused ring structure by the addition of a 5 or 6 membered ring.
      <br/>
      The base is then neutralized with a weak acid suitably an organic acid such as glacial acetic acid.
      <br/>
      Treatment with aqueous acid, suitably an organic acid opens the oxazolidine or 1,3-tetrahydrobxazine portion of the fused ring.
      <br/>
      It will be understood by those skilled in the art that depending on the starting aldehyde, the final nitrogen containg ring may contain at least one additional hetero atom as mentioned above.
      <br/>
      The general reaction may be illustrated as follows:  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Wherein X' is halo, suitably bromo or iodo, preferably iodo,
      <br/>
      Y is CH2, OCH2, CH2 -CH2,
      <br/>
      Z is nil or CH2
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      When Z is nil, the aldehyde moiety forms a 5-membered oxazolidine ring as the first step of the reaction.
      <br/>
      When Z is CH2, the aldehyde moiety forms a 6-membered 1,3-tetrahydrooxazine ring.
      <br/>
      While such ring formations are well known, in combination with the ring closure effected by the haloalkane side chain in a basic medium such as a tertiary amine in an anhydrous medium, the reaction is new and surprising.

    <p num="72">Synthesis of Peptide Carriers</p>
    <p num="73">
      The peptides of the invention are often administered in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic salts, such as acid additional salts.
      <br/>
      Illustrative of such acid addition salts are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, phosphate, fumarate, glyconate, tannate, maleate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, citrate, benzoate, succinate, alginate, pamoate, malate, ascorbate, tartrate, and the like.
      <br/>
      If the active ingredient is to be administered in tablet form, the tablet may contain a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent which includes a binder, such as tragacanth, corn starch or gelatin, a disintegrating agent, such as alginic acid and a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate.
    </p>
    <p num="74">If administration in liquid form is desired, sweetening and/or flavoring may be used as part of the pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent, an intravenous administration in isotonic saline, phosphate buffer solutions or the like may be effected.</p>
    <p num="75">
      The pharmaceutical compositions will usually contain the peptide in conjunction with a conventional, pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier.
      <br/>
      Usually, the dosage will be from about 1 to about 100 micrograms of the peptide per kilogram of the body weight of the host when given intravenously; oral dosages will be much higher.
      <br/>
      Overall, treatment of subjects with these peptides is generally carried out in the same manner as the clinical treatment using other analogs of LHRH, somatostatin and analogs of doxorubicin.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      These peptides can be administered to mammals intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, orally, intranasally or intravaginally to achieve biological hormonal effects through binding to specific receptors.
      <br/>
      In the case of LHRH analogs, these effects may include reversible suppression of gonadal activity, and in the case of somatostatin analogs, inhibition or gastrointentinal function.
      <br/>
      Effective dosages will vary with the form of administration and the particular species of mammal being treated.
      <br/>
      An example of one typical dosage form is a physiological saline solution containing the peptide which solution is administered to provide a dose in the range of about 0.1 to 2.5 mg/kg of body weight.
      <br/>
      Oral administration of the peptide may be given in either solid form or liquid form.

      In order to compare the tumor inhibitory activity of cytotoxic doxorubicin derivative, Q6 and its targeted cytotoxic peptide conjugate, Q614 gL as well as the well known antineoplastic agent, DOX and to determine the optimal way of administration and the nontoxic doses, LH-RH receptor positive MXT (3.2) ovex tumor pieces (1 mm3) were implanted s. c. in female B6 D2 F1 mice.

      Higher efficacy of Q614 gL over Q6 can also be demonstrated by comparing the average final tumor volumes in Group 2 (1065 mm3 at day 16) and in Group 6 (863 mm3 at day 31).

      In order to determine the maximum tolerated doses and compare the effects, MXT (3.2) ovex tumor pieces (1 mm3) were implanted s.c. in female B6 D2 F1 mice.

      As shown in Table 25-1 and FIG. 2, T-107, (�D-Lys6 �LH-RH linked to N-glutaryl-DOX) is completely ineffective in inhibiting the growth of this tumor at a dose of 850 nmol/20 g mouse.
      <br/>
      In contrast, Q114 gL, (�D-Lys6 �LH-RH linked to 14-O-glutaryl-DOX) exerted strong suppression of tumor growth (Figure) at a nontoxic dose of 650 nmol/20 g mouse.

      DOX alone was highly toxic (average survival time: 13.6 days) at a single dose of 650 nmol/20 g mouse and significantly less effective, than Q114 gL (FIG. 2).

      In an earlier experiment, Q2 at 20 nmol daily dose for 17 days had only a moderate inhibitory effect on tumor growth, and it was toxic at 40 nmol dose (mean survival was 14.6 days).
      <br/>
      A daily dose of 30 nmol was chosen for the present experiment, which compared the efficacy and toxicity of Q214 gL (Q2 coupled to �D-Lys6 �LH-RH), Q2 (pyrrolidino-doxorubicin), �D-Lys6 �LH-RH, and �D-Lys6 �LH-RH+Q2.

      The treatment started one day after transplantation and was continued for 12 days by i.p. injections once a day.
      <br/>
      All groups received equimolar amounts of the compounds as shown in Table 26-1.
      <br/>
      Tumors were measured on days 10, 14 and 18, and tumor volume was calculated.

      The data are shown in Table 26-1 and in FIG. 3.

    <p num="217">
      Treatment with a daily dose of 30 nmol of daunosamine modified doxorubicin analog Q2 (pyrrolidino-DOX) resulted in strong inhibitory effect on tumor growth (tumor volume: 144 mm3 at day 14 vs. 1391 mm3 for the control group), but exerted severe toxicity killing all the animals before the end of the experiment (mean survival 17.9 days).
      <br/>
      Similarly, Q2 combined (mixture) with �D-Lys6 �LH-RH resulted in strong tumor inhibitory effect (tumor volume: 80 mm3 at day 14) but the mean survival (18.5 days) was significantly shorter than that of the untreated control group (23.1 days).
      <br/>
      As a result of the treatment with Q214 gL, (Q2 covalently linked to �D-Lys6 �LH-RH) two animals died, one at day 16 and another at day 26.
      <br/>
      From the 8 surviving animals only one developed tumors at the last measurement at day 18 and they all looked healthy, but later on all of them started to develop the tumors.
      <br/>
      The mean survival for this group was significantly longer (28.3 days), than that of the control group.
      <br/>
      Treatment with �D-Lys6 �LH-RH alone did not affect tumor growth.
    </p>
    <p num="218">This experiment demonstrates that the higher efficacy and the lower peripheral toxicity of Q214 gL over the cytotoxic radical Q2 is attributable to the covalent conjugation of the cytotoxic radical to the targeting carrier LH-RH analog.</p>
