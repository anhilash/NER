      The present invention relates to a voltage-gated sodium channel present in peripheral nerve tissue that is tetrodotoxin-resistant.
      <br/>
      One aspect of the present invention is purified and isolated DNA encoding this sodium channel.
      <br/>
      Another aspect of the present invention is the recombinant protein expressed by this DNA, expression vectors comprising the DNA sequence, and host cells transformed with these expression vectors.
      <br/>
      Another aspect of this invention is the use of this voltage-gated, tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channel as a therapeutic target for compounds to treat disorders of the peripheral nervous system.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The basic unit of information transmitted from one part of the nervous system to another is a single action potential or nerve impulse.
      <br/>
      The "transmission line" for these impulses is the axon, or nerve fiber.
      <br/>
      The electrical excitability of the nerve membrane has been shown to depend on the membrane's voltage-sensitive ionic permeability system that allows it to use energy stored in ionic concentration gradients.
      <br/>
      Electrical activity of the nerve is triggered by a depolarization of the membrane, which opens channels through the membrane that are highly selective for sodium ions, which are then driven inward by the electrochemical gradient.
      <br/>
      Of the many ionic channels, the voltage-gated or voltage-sensitive sodium channel is one of the most studied.
      <br/>
      It is a transmembrane protein that is essential for the generation of action potentials in excitable cells.

      The cDNAs for several Na+ channels have been cloned and sequenced.
      <br/>
      These studies have shown that the amino acid sequence of the Na+ channel has been conserved over a long evolutionary period.
      <br/>
      These studies have also revealed that the channel is a single polypeptide containing four internal repeats, or homologous domains (domains I-IV), having similar amino acid sequences.
      <br/>
      Each domain folds into six predicted transmembrane a-helices or segments: five are hydrophobic segments and one is highly charged with many lysine and arginine residues.
      <br/>
      This highly charged segment is the fourth transmembrane segment in each domain (the S4 segment) and is likely to be involved in voltage-gating.
      <br/>
      The positively charged side chains on the S4 segment are likely to be paired with the negatively charged side chains on the other five segments such that membrane depolarization could shift the position of one helix relative to the other, thereby opening the channel.
      <br/>
      Accessory subunits may modify the function of the channel.

      There is a significant therapeutic utility in recombinant materials derived from the DNA of the numerous sodium channels that have been discovered.
      <br/>
      For example, the recombinant protein can be used to screen for potential therapeutics that have the ability to inhibit the sodium channel of interest.
      <br/>
      In particular, it would be useful to inhibit selectively the function of sodium channels in nerve tissues responsible for transmitting pain and pressure signals without simultaneously affecting the function of sodium channels in other tissues such as muscle, heart and brain.
      <br/>
      Such selectivity would allow for the treatment of pain without causing side effects due to cardiac, central nervous system or neuromuscular complications.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it would be useful to have DNA sequences coding for sodium channels that are selectively expressed in peripheral sensory nerve tissue.
      <br/>
      Though cDNAs from rat skeletal muscle, heart and brain are known, identification and isolation of cDNA from peripheral sensory nerve tissue, such as dorsal root ganglia, has been hampered by the difficulty of working with such tissue.

      Tetrodotoxin ("TTX"), a highly potent toxin from the puffer or Fugu fish, blocks the conduction of nerve impulses along axons and in excitable membranes of nerve fibers, which leads to respiratory paralysis.

      TTX also binds very tightly to the Na+ channel and blocks the flow of sodium ions.

      The positively charged group of the toxin interacts with a negatively charged carboxylate at the mouth of the channel on the extracellular side of the membrane, thus obstructing the conductance pathway.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="23">
      The present invention relates to sodium channel proteins present in peripheral nerve tissue.
      <br/>
      Specific embodiments include such sodium channels that are TTX-resistant and are expressed exclusively in sensory neurons.
      <br/>
      Degenerate oligonucleotide-primed RT-PCR analysis was performed on RNA from the rat central and peripheral nervous systems, in particular from rat dorsal root ganglia ("DRG").
      <br/>
      The  ALPHA -subunit of a voltage-gated, TTX-resistant sodium channel from rat DRG has been cloned and functionally expressed in Xenopus oocytes.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In particular, the present invention relates to a purified and isolated DNA sequence encoding for a rat peripheral nerve TTX-resistant sodium channel.
      <br/>
      The term "purified and isolated DNA" refers to DNA that is essentially free, i.e. contains less than about 30%, preferably less than about 10%, and even more preferably less than about 1% of the DNA with which the DNA of interest is naturally associated.
      <br/>
      Techniques for assessing purity are well known to the art and include, for example, restriction mapping, agarose gel electrophoresis, and CsCl gradient centrifugation.
      <br/>
      The term "DNA" is meant to include cDNA made by reverse transcription of mRNA or by chemical synthesis.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Specifically, the invention relates to DNA having the nucleotide sequence set forth in FIG. 1 (SEQ ID NO: 1).
      <br/>
      More generally, the DNA sequence comprises a cDNA sequence that encodes the  ALPHA -subunit of a voltage-gated TTX-resistant sodium channel, specifically the amino acid sequence set forth in FIG. 2 (SEQ ID NO: 2).
      <br/>
      DNA sequences encoding the same or allelic variant or analog sodium channel protein polypeptides of the peripheral nervous system, through use of, at least in part, of degenerate codons are also contemplated by this invention.
      <br/>
      The DNA sequence of FIG. 1 corresponds to the cDNA from rat.
      <br/>
      However, it is believed that a voltage-gated TTX-resistant sodium channel is also expressed in peripheral nerve tissue of other mammalian species such as humans, and that the corresponding gene is highly homologous to the rat sequence.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the invention includes cDNA encoding a mammalian voltage-gated, TTX-resistant sodium channel.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The present invention also relates to a purified and isolated DNA sequence encoding a human peripheral nerve TTX-resistant sodium channel.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the invention includes DNA having the nucleotide sequence set forth in FIG. 5 (SEQ ID NO: 9), which sets forth the human PN3, assembled from cDNA and PCR fragments.
      <br/>
      More generally, the DNA sequence comprises a sequence that encodes the  ALPHA -subunit of a voltage-gated TTX-resistant sodium channel, specifically the amino acid sequence set forth in FIG. 6 (SEQ ID NO: 10).
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The 1956-amino acid protein encoded by the cDNA of the invention is designated herein as peripheral nerve sodium channel type 3 ("PN3").
      <br/>
      The DNA sequence in FIG. 1 is the cDNA sequence that encodes PN3, and the deduced amino acid sequence is set forth in FIG. 2 (SEQ ID NO:2).
      <br/>
      Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ("RT-PCR") analysis of RNA from selected rat tissues indicates that PN3 expression is limited to sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system.
      <br/>
      A preferred aspect of this invention are cDNA sequences which encode for mammalian TTX-resistant sodium channel proteins that are expressed exclusively in the sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous-system.
      <br/>
      The term "exclusively expressed" means that the sodium channel mRNA is found in dorsal root ganglia, nodose ganglia and sciatic nerve but not in brain, spinal cord, heart, skeletal muscle or superior cervical ganglia when assayed by the methods described herein, such as RT-PCR. cDNA sequences which encode for TTX-resistant sodium channel proteins that are predominantly expressed in the sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system are also contemplated by this invention.
      <br/>
      The term "predominantly expressed" means that greater than 95% of the expression of the sodium channel occurs in the particular tissue cited.
      <br/>
      In situ hybridization to rat DRG demonstrated that PN3 mRNA is present primarily in small DRG neurons.
      <br/>
      In addition, PN3 was shown to be a voltage-gated sodium channel with a depolarized activation potential, slow inactivation kinetics, and resistant to a high concentration of TTX.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The term "cDNA" or complementary DNA refers to single-stranded or double-stranded DNA sequences obtained by reverse transcription of mRNA isolated from a donor cell.
      <br/>
      For example, treatment of mRNA with a reverse transcriptase such as AMV reverse transcriptase or M-MuLV reverse transcriptase in the presence of an oligonucleotide primer will furnish an RNA-DNA duplex which can be treated with RNase H, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase to generate double-stranded cDNA.
      <br/>
      If desired, the double-stranded cDNA can be denatured by conventional techniques such as heating to generate single-stranded cDNA.
      <br/>
      The term "cDNA" includes cDNA that is a complementary copy of the naturally occurring mRNA as well as complementary copies of variants of the naturally occurring mRNA, that have the same biological activity.
      <br/>
      Variants would include, for example, insertions, deletions, sequences with degenerate codons and alleles.
      <br/>
      An example of an insertion is a single additional Gln codon between the Pro584 and Ala585 codons of the full-length cDNA sequence of PN3, found in several clones.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The term "cRNA" refers to RNA that is a copy of the mRNA transcribed by a cell.
      <br/>
      CRNA corresponding to mRNA transcribed from a DNA sequence encoding the  ALPHA -subunit of a mammalian peripheral nerve TTX resistant sodium channel protein is contemplated by this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      As mentioned above, it is believed that homologs of the rat TTX-resistant sodium channel described herein are also expressed in other mammalian peripheral nerve tissue, in particular, human tissue.
      <br/>
      The rat sodium channel cDNA of the present invention can be used as a probe to discover whether a voltage-gated TTX-resistant sodium channel exists in human peripheral nerve tissue and, if it does, to aid in isolating the cDNA for the human protein.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The human homologue of the rat TTX-resistant PN3 can be cloned using a human DRG cDNA library.
      <br/>
      Human DRG are obtained at autopsy.
      <br/>
      The frozen tissue is homogenized and the RNA extracted with guanidine isothiocyanate (Chirgwin, et al.
      <br/>
      Biochemistry 18:5294-5299, 1979).
      <br/>
      The RNA is size-fractionated on a sucrose gradient to enrich for large mRNAs because the sodium channel ( ALPHA -subunits are encoded by large (7-11 kb) transcripts.
      <br/>
      Double-stranded cDNA is prepared using the SUPERSCRIPT CHOICE cDNA kit (GIBCO BRL) with either oligo(dT) or random hexamer primers.
      <br/>
      EcoRI adapters are ligated onto the double-stranded cDNA which is then phosphorylated.
      <br/>
      The cDNA library is constructed by ligating the double-stranded cDNA into the bacteriophage-lambda ZAP II vector (Stratagene) followed by packaging into phage particles.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Phage are plated out on 150 mm plates on a lawn of XLI-BLUE MRF1 bacteria (Stratagene) and plaque replicas are made on HYBOND N nylon membranes (Amersham).
      <br/>
      Filters are hybridized to a rat PN3 cDNA or CRNA probe by standard procedures and detected by autoradiography or chemiluminescence.
      <br/>
      The signal produced by the rat PN3 probe hybridizing to positive human clones at high stringency should be stronger than obtained with rat brain sodium channel probes hybridizing to these clones.
      <br/>
      Positive -plaques are further purified by limiting dilution and rescreened by hybridization or PCR.
      <br/>
      Restriction mapping and polymerase chain reaction will identify overlapping clones that can be assembled by standard techniques into the full-length human homologue of rat PN3.
      <br/>
      The human clone can be expressed by injecting CRNA transcribed in vitro from the full-length cDNA clone into Xenopus oocytes, or by transfecting a mammalian cell line with a vector containing the cDNA linked to a suitable promoter.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The human homologue of the rat TTX-resistant PN3 was cloned using the procedure outlined above.
      <br/>
      From human DRG, RNA was extracted and used to prepare cDNA and the cDNA library.
      <br/>
      The human PN3 was then obtained using a PN3 probe, and expressed as described above.
      <br/>
      A comparison of the human PN3 sequence (SEQ ID NO: 10) to other known human and rat voltage-gated sodium channels revealed that the greatest homology is with the rat PN3 channel, where the corresponding human gene is 83% homologous to the rat sequence.
      <br/>
      The most closely related human channel is the heart I channel, having 64% identity for the amino acid sequence.
      <br/>
      A similar relationship was observed for rat PN3 in that the most closely related channel was the rat heart channel.
      <br/>
      A variant of rat PN3 was detected in which an extra Gln residue was present in the interdomain I/II loop, however, no such variant was found in the human DRG.
      <br/>
      The PN3 and SNS rat DRG sodium channels are very closely related and differ by only seven residues.
      <br/>
      Six of these seven residues are identical in the human PN3 and rat PN3, so that the human PN3 is more similar to the rat PN3 than to the SNS channel.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Analysis of the open reading frame revealed that the human PN3 sequence has all the hallmark structural features of sodium channels that are predicted from the amino acid sequence: 24 transmembrane segments, charged residues in the S4 transmembrane segments, and the IFM sequence within the highly conserved interdomain II-IV region which constitutes the fast inactivation gate.
      <br/>
      In addition the human PN3 channel had the identical sequence as rat PN3 for the TTX-sensitivity site within the domain I S5-S6 loop, where there is a Ser in position 357 in human PN3 and position 356 in rat PN3, rather than a Cys residue which is present in all other, that is non-PN3 type, TTX-insensitive/resistant channels.
      <br/>
      The human and rat channels also shared N-glycosylation consensus sites and cAMP-dependent kinase sites which included several unusual sites in domain II and interdomain II-III.

      <br/>
      Suitable vectors include, but are not limited to, plasmids, bacteriophages and cosmids.
      <br/>
      Vectors will contain polynucleotide sequences which are necessary to effect ligation or insertion of the vector into a desired host cell and to effect the expression of the attached segment.
      <br/>
      Such sequences differ depending on the host organism, and will include promoter sequences to effect transcription, enhancer sequences to increase transcription, ribosomal binding site sequences and transcription and translation termination sequences.

      <br/>
      They also include transiently expressing cells which express the inserted DNA or RNA for limited periods of time.
      <br/>
      The transformation or transfection procedure depends on the host cell being transformed.
      <br/>
      It can include packaging the polynucleotide in a virus as well as direct uptake of the polynucleotide, such as, for example, lipofection or microinjection.
      <br/>
      Transformation and transfection can result in incorporation of the inserted DNA into the genome of the host cell or the maintenance of the inserted DNA within the host cell in plasmid form.
      <br/>
      Methods of transformation are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, viral infection, electroporation, lipofection and calcium phosphate mediated direct uptake.

    <p num="46">
      The polypeptides of the invention are highly useful for the development of antibodies against PN3.
      <br/>
      Such antibodies can be used in affinity chromatography to purify recombinant sodium channel proteins or polypeptides, or they can be used as a research tool.
      <br/>
      For example, antibodies bound to a reporter molecule can be used in histochemical staining techniques to identify other tissues and cell types where PN3 is present, or they can be used to identify epitopic or functional regions of the sodium channel protein of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The antibodies can be monoclonal or polyclonal and can be prepared by techniques that are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Polyclonal antibodies are prepared as follows: an immunogenic conjugate comprising PN3 or a fragment thereof, optionally linked to a carrier protein, is used to immunize a selected mammal such as a mouse, rabbit, goat, etc.
      <br/>
      Serum from the immunized mammal is collected and treated according to known procedures to separate the immunoglobulin fraction.
      <br/>
      Monoclonal antibodies are prepared by standard hybridoma cell technology based on that reported by Kohler and Milstein in Nature 256:495-497 (1975): spleen cells are obtained from a host animal immunized with the PN3 protein or a fragment thereof, optionally linked to a carrier.
      <br/>
      Hybrid cells are formed by fusing these spleen cells with an appropriate myeloma cell line and cultured.
      <br/>
      The antibodies produced by the hybrid cells are screened for their ability to bind to expressed PN3 protein.
      <br/>
      A number of screening techniques well known in the art, such as, for example, forward or reverse enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay screening methods may be employed.
      <br/>
      The hybrid cells producing such antibodies are then subjected to recloning and high dilution conditions in order to select a hybrid cell that secretes a homogeneous population of antibodies specific to the PN3 protein.
      <br/>
      In addition, antibodies can be raised by cloning and expressing nucleotide sequences or mutagenized versions thereof coding at least for the amino acid sequences required for specific binding of natural antibodies, and these expressed proteins used as the immunogen.
      <br/>
      Antibodies may include the complete immunoglobulin or a fragment thereof.
      <br/>
      Antibodies may be linked to a reporter group such as is described above with reference to polynucleotides.

      Accordingly, the invention encompasses a rat peripheral nerve TTX-resistant sodium channel  ALPHA -subunit encoded by the cDNA set forth in FIG. 1, and fragments thereof.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the invention includes the sodium channel  ALPHA -subunit having the amino acid sequence set forth in FIG. 2, and fragments thereof.

      The sodium channel comprises an  ALPHA - and a  BETA -subunit.
      <br/>
      The  BETA -subunit may modulate the function of the channel.

      However, since the  ALPHA -subunit is all that is required for the channel to be filly functional, the expression of the cDNA in FIG. 1, will provide a fully functional protein.
      <br/>
      The gene encoding the  BETA -subunit in peripheral nerve tissue was found to be identical to that found in rat heart, brain and skeletal muscle.

      The cDNA of the  BETA -subunit is not described herein as it is well known in the art, Isom, et al., Neuron 12:1183-1194 (1994).
      <br/>
      However, it is to be understood that by combining the known sequence for the  BETA -subunit with the  ALPHA -subunit sequence described herein, one may obtain the complete rat peripheral nerve, voltage-gated, TTX-resistant sodium channel.

      Functional expression in Xenopus oocytes shows that PN3 is a voltage-gated sodium channel with a depolarized activation potential, slow inactivation kinetics, and resistant to a high concentration of TTX.
      <br/>
      PN3 may correspond to the sodium channel mediating TTX-resistant currents in small neurons of the DRG, that have been described in the literature.
      <br/>
      See for example, Kostyuk, et al., Neurosci. 6:2423-2430 (1981); McLean, et al., Molec. Cell. Biochem. 80:95-107 (1988); Roy, et al., supra; Caffrey, et al., Brain Res. 592:283-297 (1992); Elliott, et al., J. Physiol. 463:39-56 (1993); and Ogata, et al., J. Physiol. 466:9-37 (1993).

    <p num="51">
      Northern blot analysis indicates that PN3 is encoded by an .about.7.5 kb transcript and nucleotide sequence analysis of the PN3 cDNA identifies a 5868-base open reading frame, shown in FIG. 1.

      The deduced amino acid sequence of PN3, shown in FIG. 2 exhibits the primary structural features of an  ALPHA -subunit of a voltage-gated sodium channel.

      The present invention also includes the use of the voltage-gated, TTX-resistant sodium channel  ALPHA -subunit as a therapeutic target for compounds to treat disorders of the peripheral nervous system including, but not limited to, allodynia, hyperalgesia, diabetic neuropathy, traumatic injury and AIDS-associated neuropathy.
      <br/>
      The invention allows for the manipulation of genetic materials by recombinant technology to produce polypeptides that possess the structural and functional characteristics of the voltage-gated, TTX-resistant sodium channel  ALPHA -subunit found in peripheral nerve tissue, particularly in sensory nerves.
      <br/>
      Site directed mutagenesis can be used to provide such recombinant polypeptides.
      <br/>
      For example, synthetic oligonucleotides can be specifically inserted or substituted into the portion of the gene of interest to produce genes encoding for and expressing a specific mutant.

      Random degenerate oligonucleotides can also be inserted and phage display techniques can be used to identify and isolate polypeptides possessing a functional property of interest.

      Sodium channels in peripheral nerve tissue play a large role in the transmission of nerve impulses, and therefore are instrumental in understanding neuropathic pain transmission.
      <br/>
      Neuropathic pain falls into two categories: allodynia, where a normally non-painful stimulus becomes painful, and hyperalgesia, where a usually normal painful stimulus becomes extremely painful.
      <br/>
      The ability to inhibit the activity of these sodium channels, i.e., reduce the conduction of nerve impulses, will affect the nerve's ability to transmit pain.
      <br/>
      Selective inhibition of sodium channels in sensory neurons such as dorsal root ganglia will allow the blockage of pain impulses without complicating side effects caused by inhibition of sodium channels in other tissues such as brain and heart.
      <br/>
      In addition, certain diseases are caused by sodium channels that produce impulses at an extremely high frequency.
      <br/>
      The ability to reduce the activity of the channel can then eliminate or alleviate the disease.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, potential therapeutic compounds can be screened by methods well known in the art, to discover whether they can inhibit the activity of the recombinant sodium channel of the invention.

      The sodium channel of the present invention has the most restrictive tissue distribution of the channels that have been studied.
      <br/>
      This is of significant value to develop therapeutics that will have a specific target, i.e., that will not inhibit a particular channel in a wide range of tissues.
      <br/>
      Seven main tissue types were screened by RT-PCR for expression of the unique 410 base amplicon corresponding to positions 5893-6302 of SEQ ID NO:1.
      <br/>
      PN3 was present in three of the tissues studied: DRG, nodose ganglia and sciatic nerve tissue.
      <br/>
      PN3 was not present in the remaining tissues studied: brain, spinal cord, heart or skeletal muscle tissue.
      <br/>
      In view of the previous detection of a sodium channel PN1 mRNA in the peripheral nervous system, (D'Arcangelo et al) other tissues were screened by RT-PCR for the presence of PN1.
      <br/>
      PN1 was detected in brain, heart, spinal cord and superior cervical ganglia, under conditions in which PN3 was not detected.
      <br/>
      A tissue distribution profile of human PN3 was determined by analysis of RNA from selected human tissues and commercially available cDNA libraries by RT-PCR. hPN3 was present in two of the tissues studied: DRG and sciatic nerve tissue. hPN3 was not present in the remaining tissues studied: brain, spinal cord, heart, or skeletal muscle tissue.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      This invention is directed to inhibiting the activity of PN3 in DRG, nodose ganglia and sciatic nerve tissues.
      <br/>
      However, it is to be understood that further studies may reveal that PN3 is present in other tissues, and as such, those tissues can also be targeted areas.
      <br/>
      For example, the detection of PN3 mRNA in nodose ganglia suggests that PN3 may conduct TTX-resistant sodium currents in this and other sensory ganglia of the peripheral nervous system.
      <br/>
      In addition, it has been found that proteins not normally expressed in certain tissues, are expressed in a disease state.
      <br/>
      Therefore, this invention is intended to encompass the inhibition of PN3 in tissues and cell types where the protein is normally expressed, and in those tissues and cell types where the protein is only expressed during a disease state.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Another significant characteristic of PN3 is that it is TTX-resistant.
      <br/>
      It is believed that TTX-resistant sodium channels play a key role in transmitting nerve impulses relating to sensory inputs such as pain and pressure.
      <br/>
      This will also facilitate the design of therapeutics that can be targeted to a specific area such as the peripheral nerve tissue.
      <br/>
      Studies of the TTX-resistant site on the protein will facilitate the development of a selective inhibitor.
      <br/>
      This site is shown in FIG. 2 (.diamond-solid.).

      It is believed that key amino acid residues in certain domains of the sodium channel are critical for TTX resistance.

      In the cardiac sodium channel, mutation of Cys374 --&gt; Phe or Tyr rendered the channel TTX sensitive.
      <br/>
      This position corresponds to Ser356 in PN3 (SEQ ID NO: 2), and Ser357 in hPN3 (SEQ ID NO: 10) It is believed that non-aromatic residues at this site confer TTX resistance to the sodium channel.
      <br/>
      Peripheral nerve sodium channels mutated at positions analogous to amino acid residue 356 and DNA sequences encoding therefor are also contemplated by this invention.
      <br/>
      Specific embodiments include the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 in which Ser356 is replaced by a non-aromatic residue, and DNA sequences encoding therefor.
      <br/>
      Typical aromatic residues are phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan.
      <br/>
      Typical non-aromatic residues are threonine, valine, cysteine, aspartate and arginine.
      <br/>
      Site directed mutagenesis can identify additional residues critical for TTX resistance and provide targets for new therapeutic compounds.

      The invention also pertains to an assay for inhibitors of peripheral nerve TTX-resistant sodium channel protein comprising contacting a compound suspected of being an inhibitor with expressed sodium channel and measuring the activity of the sodium channel.

      The compound can be a substantially pure compound of synthetic origin combined in an aqueous medium, or the compound can be a naturally occurring material such that the assay medium is an extract of biological origin, such as, for example, a plant, animal, or microbial cell extract.
      <br/>
      PN3 activity can be measured by methods such as electrophysiology (two electrode voltage clamp or single electrode whole cell patch clamp), guanidinium ion flux assays and toxin-binding assays.
      <br/>
      An "inhibitor" is defined as generally that amount that results in greater than 50% decrease in PN3 activity, preferably greater than 70% decrease in PN3 activity, more preferably, greater than 90% decrease in PN3 activity.

Potential therapeutic compounds are identified based on their ability to inhibit the activity of PN3.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the aforementioned assay can be used to identify compounds having a therapeutically effective IC50.

      The deduced amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:2) of PN3 is shown in FIGS. 2A-2X. PN3 contains four homologous domains, represented as the regions marked I-IV.

      FIG. 4 (a) shows the currents produced by step depolarizations of an oocyte injected with 18 ng of PN3 cRNA from a holding potential of -100 mV to -30 mV through + 50 mV.
      <br/>
      No inward current was observed in oocytes injected with water.
      <br/>
      Data were collected using the GENECLAMP hardware leak subtraction, filtered at 5 kHz with a 4-pole Bessel filter, and sampled at 50 kHz.
      <br/>
      Expression of PN3 produced an inward current with slow inactivation kinetics, similar to that of the rBIIa (Patton, et al., Neuron 7:637-647 (1991)) and rSkMI  ALPHA -subunits expressed in the absence of the  BETA 1-subunit.
      <br/>
      However, coinjection of 1.3 ng of human sodium channel  BETA 1-subunit (hSCN BETA 1, as described by McClatchey, et al., Hum. Molec. Gen. 2:745-749 (1993)) cRNA with PN3 cRNA did not accelerate the inactivation kinetics; coexpression of this quantity of hSCN BETA 1 cRNA with rBIIa cRNA was sufficient to accelerate maximally the inactivation kinetics of rBIIa.
      <br/>
      Therefore, PN3 may possess inherently slow kinetics.

      Examination of the current/voltage relationship reveals a strikingly depolarized channel activation potential, as can be seen in FIG. 4(b).

      In this expression system, PN3 exhibits little or no activation at 0 mV, whereas most cloned sodium channels generally begin to activate between -60 and -30 mV.

      To demonstrate the sodium dependence of these induced currents, the extracellular sodium concentration was reduced from .about.91 mM to .about.50 mM by substituting N-methyl-D-glucamine.
      <br/>
      The resulting inward current was reduced and the reversal potential was shifted from + 43 mV to + 12 mV.

      Further reduction of the extracellular sodium concentration to -21 mM shifted the reversal potential to -22 mV.

      Sodium channels are distinctively sensitive or insensitive to neurotoxins such as TTX.
      <br/>
      The TTX-sensitive brain and skeletal muscle sodium channels are blocked by nanomolar TTX concentrations, whereas the TTX-insensitive cardiac sodium channels are blocked by micromolar TTX concentrations.
      <br/>
      In rat heart sodium channel 1 (RH1), Cys374 is a critical determinant of TTX-insensitivity, as shown in Satin, et al., Science 256:1202-1205(1992); in the TTX-sensitive rBI, RBII, RBIII, and rSkMl, the corresponding residue is either Phe or Tyr.
      <br/>
      In PN3, this position is occupied by a Ser residue (Ser356).
      <br/>
      When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the PN3 sodium current is highly resistant to TTX (IC50 &gt;100  MU M).

      FIG. 4(c) shows the concentration dependence for TTX blockage of PN3 sodium current (mean and range; n=2).
      <br/>
      For this experiment, the oocytes were depolarized from -100 mV to + 20 mV for approximately 10 ms at 0.1 Hz; P/-4 leak subtraction was used (Bezanilla, et al., J. Gen. Physiol. 70:549-566 (1977)).
      <br/>
      There was a slow "rundown" of the current with time, and a correction was made for the resulting sloping baseline.
      <br/>
      Varying concentrations of TTX in bath solution were perfused over the oocyte and the current amplitude was allowed to attain steady-state before the effect was recorded.

      A 15-mer peptide(CDPNLPNSNGSRGNC) was synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin prior to injection into rabbit.

      The sequence of the peptide corresponded to residues 1679-1693 of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Out of the two rabbits injected with the antigen only one yielded antiserum that is useful in characterizing the PN3 ion channel protein.
      <br/>
      The antiserum was then affinity purified by passage through a peptide affinity column.
      <br/>
      Immunohistochemical experiments substantiated earlier observations using PN3 antisense oligonucleotide probe(in situ hybridization) that PN3 was largely localized in the small sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG).
      <br/>
      In addition to the sensory neurons of DRG, a small number of transmission neurons in lamina 10 of the spinal cord showed immunoreactivity with the PN3 antibody.
      <br/>
      Because only a subset of neurons were positive for PN3 expression, PN3 mRNA could have been undetectable by RT-PCR assays using the entire spinal cord (dilution effect).
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that PN3 expressing Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells had a .about.250 kD protein which corresponds to the  ALPHA -subunit.
      <br/>
      Since the peptide sequence does not match with any other protein, particularly other sodium channels, the antibody could be very specific reagent to characterize the PN3 protein.
      <br/>
      In addition, the antibody could be used as a tool to understand the role of PN3 in nociceptive pathways.
      <br/>
      By infusing the antibody in rats so that it `soaks-up` all available PN3 protein and testing the rats in pain models one could begin to investigate the role of PN3 function in pain pathways.

    <p num="122">
      A variant of PN3, PN3a has been identified by sequencing a full-length cDNA clone.
      <br/>
      The sequence of PN3a is identical to that of PN3, including the 5'-and 3'-UTR, except for an additional amino acid, Gln, at Pro584 of PN3 set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2.
      <br/>
      The insertion of Gln in this region was previously reported from RT-PCR experiments.
      <br/>
      PN3a expressed at a higher level than PN3 in Xenopus oocytes and exhibited otherwise the same characteristics as PN3, such as resistance to high concentrations of TTX and depolarized activation potential.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      Another cDNA clone had the same sequence as PN3 in the coding region, but the 5'-UTR sequence diverged 33bp upstream of the start codon, ATG.
      <br/>
      Another cDNA clone had a longer 3'-UTR with an additional .about.1 KB and a second polyadenylation signal.
      <br/>
      These sequence differences in the noncoding region indicate that regulation of the use of different polyadenylation signal and/or interaction with different transcription elements of the 5'-UTR could play a role in expression of PN3 in distinct subsets of sensory neurons.
