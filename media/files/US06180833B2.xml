    <p num="2">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates generally to stable 1,2-dioxetanes and compositions which can be triggered by chemical reagents, including enzymes, to generate chemiluminescence.
      <br/>
      The dioxetanes contain more than one ionizable group which are part of an alkoxy substituent.
      <br/>
      The dioxetanes further contain a fluorine atom or lower alkyl group substituted for one of the hydrogen atoms on the alkoxy substituent which improve the storage stability of the dioxetane.
      <br/>
      The present invention, in particular, further relates to methods of synthesis of such dioxetanes.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The dioxetanes which are prepared by the synthetic processes of the present invention are useful in compositions containing the dioxetane, a cationic surfactant and optionally a fluorescer which enhance the amount of chemiluminescence which is produced.
      <br/>
      Dioxetanes and enhanced compositions of the present invention are useful in methods for generating light (chemiluminescence) and in methods of analysis for detecting the presence or amount of an analyte.
      <br/>
      Importantly, the ionizable groups afford a more water soluble dioxetane and solve an unexpected chemical carryover problem in capsule chemistry analytical systems, while the presence of the fluorine atom or lower alkyl group improves the storage stability of the dioxetane.

      a.
      <br/>
      Enzymatically Triggerable Dioxetanes.
      <br/>
      The first examples of enzymatic triggering of dioxetanes are described in a U.S. patent application (A. P. Schaap, U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 887,139) and a series of papers (A. P. Schaap, R. S. Handley, and B. P. Giri, Tetrahedron Lett., 935 (1987); A. P. Schaap, M. D. Sandison, and R. S. Handley, Tetrahedron Lett., 1159 (1987) and A. P. Schaap, Photochem.
      <br/>
      Photobiol., 47S, 50S (1988)).
      <br/>
      The highly stable adamantyl-substituted dioxetanes bearing a protected aryloxide substituent are triggered to decompose with emission of light by the action of both an enzyme and aqueous buffer to give a strongly electron-donating aryloxide anion which dramatically increases the rate of decomposition of the dioxetane.
      <br/>
      As a result, chemiluminescence is emitted at intensities several orders of magnitude above that resulting from slow thermal decomposition of the protected form of the dioxetane. U.S. Pat. No. 5,068,339 to Schaap discloses enzymatically triggerable dioxetanes with covalently linked fluorescer groups decomposition of which results in enhanced chemiluminescence via energy transfer to the fluorescer. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,112,960 and 5,220,005 and a PCT application (WO88/00695) to Bronstein disclose triggerable dioxetanes bearing substituted adamantyl groups. U.S. Pat. No. 4,952,707 to Edwards discloses phosphate-substituted dioxetanes.
      <br/>
      A PCT application (WO94/26726) to Bronstein discloses adamantyl dioxetanes bearing a phenyl or naphthyl group substituted at a non-conjugated position with an enzyme labile OX group and with an additional group on the aryl ring.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Other triggerable dioxetanes are disclosed in a PCT application (WO94/10258) to Wang.
      <br/>
      The dioxetanes disclosed in Wang contain an alkoxy group which may be mono-substituted and a substituted phenyl-OX group wherein one or more non-hydrogen groups are present on the benzene ring substituent in addition to the triggerable OX group.

      b. Surfactant Enhancement of Chemiluminescence from Triggerable Dioxetanes.
      <br/>
      Enhancement of chemiluminescence from the enzyme-triggered decomposition of a stable 1,2-dioxetane in the presence of water-soluble substances including an ammonium surfactant and a fluorescer has been reported (A. P. Schaap, H. Akhavan and L. J. Romano, Clin.
      <br/>
      Chem., 35(9), 1863 (1989)).
      <br/>
      Fluorescent micelles consisting of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and 5-(N-tetradecanoyl)amino-fluorescein capture the intermediate hydroxy-substituted dioxetane and lead to a 400-fold increase in the chemiluminescence quantum yield by virtue of an efficient transfer of energy from the anionic form of the excited state ester to the fluorescein compound within the hydrophobic environment of the micelle.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,959,182 and 5,004,565 to Schaap describe additional examples of enhancement of chemiluminescence from chemical and enzymatic triggering of stable dioxetanes in the presence of micelles formed by the quaternary ammonium surfactant CTAB.
      <br/>
      Fluorescent micelles also enhance light emission from the base-triggered decomposition of hydroxy- and acetoxy-substituted dioxetanes.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,772 to Voyta discloses enhancement of enzymatically generated chemiluminescence from 1,2-dioxetanes in the presence of polymers with pendant quaternary ammonium groups alone or admixed with fluorescein.
      <br/>
      Other substances reported to enhance chemiluminescence include globular proteins such as bovine albumin and quaternary ammonium surfactants.
      <br/>
      Other cationic polymer compounds were marginally effective as chemiluminescence enhancers; nonionic polymeric compounds were generally ineffective and an anionic polymer significantly decreased light emission.
      <br/>
      A PCT application (WO 94/21821) to Bronstein describes the use of mixtures of the aforementioned polymeric quaternary ammonium surfactant enhancers with enhancement additives.

      c. Triggerable Dioxetanes with Improved Water Solubility.
      <br/>
      The enzymatically triggerable dioxetanes are now undergoing widespread use as substrates for marker enzymes in numerous applications including immunoassays, gene expression studies, Western blotting, Southern blotting, DNA sequencing and the identification of nucleic acid segments in infectious agents.
      <br/>
      Despite the growing use of these compounds, there are limitations to there use in some assay methods.
      <br/>
      Triggerable dioxetanes whose hydroxy dioxetane deprotected form are more water-soluble are desirable.
      <br/>
      As shown in the structures below, it is especially desirable that the hydroxy dioxetane formed by the dephosphorylation of a phosphate dioxetane by alkaline phosphatase be highly soluble in aqueous solutions and in compositions containing chemiluminescence enhancing substances.
      <br/>
      Such dioxetanes and compositions are of importance in certain solution assay methods for detecting hydrolytic enzymes or conjugates of hydrolytic enzymes.  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      As further background of the present invention and as more fully explained in the examples below, it has been found that use of conventional chemiluminescent dioxetane reagents in assays performed on automated instrumentation based on the principles of capsule chemistry analysis results in carryover of reagent from one fluid segment to another, resulting in potentially inaccurate measurements, erroneous results, and imprecision due to non-reproducibility.
      <br/>
      Capsule chemistry analysis is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,497, which is fully incorporated by reference herein.
      <br/>
      It has been postulated that, among other possible means for overcoming the carryover problem, improved water solubility of the hydroxy dioxetane, in particular, might eliminate or minimize carryover of this luminescent reaction intermediate into adjacent fluid segments of a capsule chemistry analysis system.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Dioxetane compounds in commercial use do not incorporate any solubilizing groups which are appended to an alkoxy group.
      <br/>
      As such, these dioxetanes are unsuitable for use in assay methods requiring zero carryover.
      <br/>
      A suggestion of incorporating a solubilizing group into a dioxetane has been made (U.S. Pat. No. 5,220,005).
      <br/>
      A dioxetane with a carboxyl group substituted on an adamantyl substituent is claimed, however, the preparation of such a dioxetane is not described.
      <br/>
      Significantly, there is no disclosure of what effect the addition of a carboxyl group had, if any, on solubility and other properties of the dioxetane.
      <br/>
      There is no teaching in the art of how many solubilizing groups are required or what particular advantage might be conferred.
      <br/>
      Use of solubilizing groups which interfere with the removal of the protecting group which initiates light emission or which otherwise interfere with light production would be of no value.
      <br/>
      Solubilizing groups which would be removed during the luminescent reaction likewise would not be useful.

    <p num="19">
      In Applicant's co-pending '305 application it was demonstrated that incorporation of one ionic solubilizing group was insufficient to eliminate the carryover problem associated with the hydroxy dioxetane produced by dephosphorylation of a phosphate dioxetane.
      <br/>
      Phosphate dioxetanes whose hydroxy dioxetane product is highly water soluble and enhanced compositions containing such phosphate dioxetanes were provided to solve this problem.
      <br/>
      It was subsequently discovered that dioxetanes which provided the solution to the carryover problem, exhibited insufficient storage stability at room temperature.
      <br/>
      Thus, no dioxetanes known in the art possessed both high solubility of the hydroxy dioxetane and long term storage stability.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="23">
      The present invention relates to dioxetanes with improved storage stability and whose hydroxy dioxetane product formed upon action of a triggering enzyme is highly soluble in aqueous solution and which are triggerable by an enzyme to produce chemiluminescence.
      <br/>
      Such triggerable dioxetanes eliminate or minimize carryover of the luminescent hydroxy dioxetane into adjacent segments in capsule chemistry analytical systems as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,497. Carryover can result from solubilization, deposition or precipitation of light-emitting material of low water solubility into the fluorocarbon oil which serves as the isolating fluid in capsule chemistry systems.
      <br/>
      Reagent carryover can lead to inaccurate measurements, erroneous results and imprecision due to irreproducibility.

    <p num="28">Definitions</p>
    <p num="29">
      Storage stability is related to the rate of decomposition of the dioxetane due to spontaneous reaction and is an intrinsic property.
      <br/>
      Decomposition of triggerable dioxetanes can also be induced by the presence of trace quantities of agents which catalyze the removal of a protecting group and thus initiate the decomposition.
      <br/>
      Storage stability of a dioxetane can be assessed by measuring the quantity of dioxetane present in a known sample at periodic intervals.
      <br/>
      The measurement can take any form known which measures a property relatable to the quantity of dioxetane.
      <br/>
      Techniques such as spectrophotometry, NMR spectrometry and the like are exemplary.
      <br/>
      A convenient means is to measure the amount of light produced by reacting a known quantity of dioxetane with a triggering agent under a standard set of conditions.
      <br/>
      A decrease in the amount or intensity of light emitted signals a loss of dioxetane compound.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Storage stability refers to stability of the dioxetane in both the pure form and as a solution or formulation in a buffer solution.
      <br/>
      The formulation can also contain various additives for increasing the amount of light produced or for improving the activity of an enzymatic triggering agent.
      <br/>
      It is desirable that the dioxetane in a formulation not undergo significant decomposition at ambient temperature for a reasonable period of time.
      <br/>
      Compositions to be used with automated analyzers should desirably be stable for at least 1 week.
      <br/>
      Upon refrigeration at 0-5 (degree)  C., it is desirable that no significant decomposition is observed for at least 2-3 months.
      <br/>
      More desirably, compositions to be used with automated analyzers should show not more than 2-3% change in the observed indicator of storage stability in about 2-4 weeks.

      For example, a ketone and ester having the formulas below wherein RG is a replaceable atom or group and X' is a replaceable atom or group such as a hydrogen or an alkyl group or a trialkylsilyl group can be coupled by a low-valent titanium reagent to form an intermediate vinyl ether.
      <br/>
      Removable groups include leaving groups such as halogen atoms selected from Cl, Br and I, sulfates, sulfonates such as tosylate, mesylate and triflate, quaternary ammonium groups, and azide.  (Chemical Structure image '11' not included in text)

      The intermediate vinyl ether is converted in a process of one or more steps to a precursor vinyl ether phosphate salt.

      It may be desired for synthetic convenience to replace one removable group with another removable group.
      <br/>
      The group RG is replaced by a CZ(COOM)2 fragment by reaction with a Z-substituted malonate ester and later saponification of the ester groups.

      The group X' is converted to the group X in the case where X and X' are not identical by removing X' and reacting with a reagent which adds the X group or a protected form of the X group.
      <br/>
      For example when X' is H and X is PO3 Na2, treatment with base to deprotonate followed by reaction with a phosphorylating agent produces a phosphate triester-protected vinyl ether which is converted to the phosphate salt by hydrolysis of the triester to the disodium salt.

      A fluoro-substituted analog of dioxetane 1, identified as 3, a chloro-substituted analog 4 and a methyl-substituted analog 5 have been prepared and their storage stability evaluated over several weeks.
      <br/>
      Storage stability of a solution of 1 was measured for comparison.
      <br/>
      All solutions were prepared with the same composition, differing only in the identity of the dioxetane.
      <br/>
      Stability was evaluated by chemiluminescent enzyme assay with a fixed volume of test solution and fixed limiting amount of alkaline phosphatase and measuring the plateau light intensity at 25 (degree)  C. Unexpectedly, aqueous solutions containing dioxetanes 3 and 5 were substantially more stable than 1, while dioxetane 4 was not.
      <br/>
      Solutions of dioxetanes 3 or 5 underwent essentially no decomposition after four weeks at 25 (degree)  C. Surprisingly, the storage stability of dioxetane 4 was actually worse than that of 1.  (Chemical Structure image '37' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The reasons for this difference in the properties of these four dioxetanes are not presently understood.
      <br/>
      It is particularly significant that dioxetanes 3 and 4 should show such marked difference in storage stability when they differ structurally only by having different halogen substituents.
      <br/>
      Applicants are aware of no teachings in the art of dioxetane chemistry to explain or predict these results.

      Dioxetanes such as 3 and 5 bearing a substituent containing two carboxylate groups and either a fluorine atom or a lower alkyl group and compositions containing such dioxetanes are therefore superior to other known dioxetanes and compositions for use in capsule chemistry analysis systems.

      The present invention, therefore, also relates to compositions comprising a cationic enhancer and a stable 1,2-dioxetane as described above having increased storage stability which can be triggered to generate chemiluminescence.

    <p num="122">
      The experiments described below were performed on a prototype capsule chemistry analysis system essentially as described by Kumar et al in U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,497, with the detection system configured to measure light emission (luminescence).
      <br/>
      The method and apparatus comprises feeding a stream of fluid segments through a Teflon tube, where the tube has an isolating layer of fluorocarbon oil on the inner surface.
      <br/>
      Sample and reagents are aspirated into this tube, and the resulting liquid segments are moved through the tube.
      <br/>
      Separation steps and washing steps which are required by heterogeneous immunoassay methods were facilitated by means of magnets, which transferred magnetic particles from one aqueous segment to another.
      <br/>
      The detection system was comprised of a photon counter and a fiber optic read head, in which the fibers were radially arranged around the Teflon tube to maximize the efficiency of light collection.

    <p num="123">
      The TECHNICON IMMUNO 1.RTM. TSH method (Bayer Corporation, Tarrytown, N.Y., USA) was used as a representative immunoassay method for the testing of luminogenic reagents.
      <br/>
      The method principle involved incubation of a specimen containing the antigen TSH with a first reagent (R1), which contained a fluorescein-labeled antibody, and simultaneously with a second reagent (R2), which contained an antibody-alkaline phosphatase (ALP) conjugate.
      <br/>
      Each antibody was specific for a different epitope on the TSH antigen, so that formation of a "sandwich" was promoted between these two antibodies and the TSH antigen.
      <br/>
      Magnetic particles containing bound anti-fluorescein were used to capture the sandwich, and the particles were subsequently washed to remove unbound reagents.
      <br/>
      The particles were then exposed to the luminogenic reagent, which contained a substrate for ALP, and luminescence was measured.
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      The luminogenic R3 reagent was comprised of 0.2 mM CSPD (disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro+1,2-dioxetane-3,2'-(5'-chloro)tricyclo�3.3.1.13,7 �decan}-4-yl)phenyl phosphate, (Tropix, Inc., Bedford, Mass., USA), 3 mM pyranine (hydroxypyrenesulfonic acid), 1 mM MgCl2, 1 M diethanolamine buffer (pH 10.0), 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% NaN3. The sequence of events on the capsule chemistry analysis system is depicted in FIG. 1 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      The fluid capsule or test package was comprised of six liquid segments, each of which had a volume of 28  MU l. Magnetic particles (1.4  MU l of the magnetic particle reagent used in the TECHNICON IMMUNO 1 system were aspirated into the first segment (MP), with the remainder of fluid being particle wash buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 and preservative).
      <br/>
      R1 (10.4  MU l of serum-based solution containing fluorescein-labeled antibody to TSH), R2 (10.4  MU l of serum-based solution containing antibody to TSH conjugated with ALP) and S (7.2  MU l of serum sample) were aspirated into the second segment.
      <br/>
      The next two segments (W1 and W2) were comprised of the same wash buffer used above in the MP segment.
      <br/>
      The fifth segment was R3, of the composition described above, with the key elements being the luminogenic substrate and the luminescence enhancer.
      <br/>
      The sixth segment was an inter-test buffer (same as the particle buffer described above), which was used to isolate adjacent tests.
      <br/>
      Magnetic transfers are depicted by the arrows in the FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      These transfers were facilitated by one of two magnetic transfer assemblies (M1 or M2).
      <br/>
      After an incubation of 13 minutes, during which sandwich formation occurred, M1 transferred the magnetic particles into the R1+R2+S segment to initiate capture.
      <br/>
      After an additional period of 6 minutes, M2 transferred the particles into the first wash segment.
      <br/>
      After an additional period of 12 seconds, M2 transferred the particles into the second wash segment.
      <br/>
      After another period of 12 seconds, M2 transferred the particles into the R3 segment, and light emission from this segment was detected as the stream of aqueous segments passed back and forth through the luminometer readhead.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      Since the Teflon tube is transparent to light, a problem with light piping (or "optical carryover") was expected.
      <br/>
      Specifically, some of the photons emitted from the R3 segment of an adjacent test could enter the Teflon material, propagate down the length of the tube and be scattered into the detector during the measurement of the signal of the test of interest.
      <br/>
      However, while a signal was detected in the adjacent tests, it did not occur in the expected manner.
      <br/>
      Instead of declining rapidly with distance from test N, peaks of light output were observed centered around the R3 segments of the adjacent test packages, as shown in FIG. 2 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, test N produced a high level of luminescence, approximately 7.5 million counts per seconds (cps).
      <br/>
      Tests N-1 and N-2 were aspirated into the tube before test N and preceded this test through the luminometer, and tests N+1 and N+2 followed after test N. The analysis system recorded photons counted for each individual air and liquid segment in the stream.
      <br/>
      The profile in FIG. 2 represents the average of 10 replicate panels of 5 tests each corrected for background luminescence signal produced in the absence of ALP.
      <br/>
      The reagent blank values subtracted from each data point were an average obtained from 10 replicate panels of 5 tests each.
      <br/>
      The magnitude of the carryover signal was computed by dividing the peak cps in each adjacent test by the peak cps in test N, expressed in parts per million (ppm).
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      Another possible explanation for this behavior was physical carryover of ALP from test N into the neighboring tests in an unintended manner.
      <br/>
      This could happen, for example, if the tube contained particulate materials deposited on the walls, which could disrupt the smooth motion of the liquid segments through the tube.
      <br/>
      However, placement of 10 mM inorganic phosphate in the R3 segments of the adjacent tests had no effect on the magnitude of the signals in the adjacent tests.
      <br/>
      Since this amount of phosphate would have inhibited ALP by at least 90% under these test conditions, the possibility of physical carryover was ruled out.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      To further rule out optical carryover, the fluorescent enhancer pyranine was omitted from test N only, but present in the adjacent tests.
      <br/>
      As a result, the magnitude of the signal in test N was lower by a factor of approximately 10.
      <br/>
      However, as shown in FIG. 3 of the drawings, the height of the peaks in the adjacent tests did not change significantly.
      <br/>
      The fact that the carryover signal did not change in the adjacent tests proportionately clearly demonstrated that this carryover was not optical.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      An additional and unexpected type of carryover was the cause of the carryover problem.
      <br/>
      It was found that the hydroxy dioxetane intermediate was sufficiently soluble in the fluorocarbon oil used to coat the inner wall of the Teflon tube, such that the carryover was due to transfer of dissolved hydroxy dioxetane intermediate via the oil into the R3 segments of the neighboring tests.
      <br/>
      This process was tested by changing the buffer of the R3 segments in the adjacent tests from 1 M DEA at pH 10 to 1 M Tris at pH 7.
      <br/>
      At pH 7, dissolved hydroxy dioxetane intermediate in these R3 segments is stable and does not emit light.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4 of the drawings, this change in pH resulted in the complete elimination of the side bands of luminescence.
      <br/>
      The residual minor carryover in the N+1 and N-1 tests was due to the anticipated optical carryover.
      <br/>
      These results verified that the source of light emission in the peaks in the neighboring tests was "chemical carryover" of the hydroxy dioxetane derived from CSPD into the R3 segments of adjacent tests.

      <br/>
      The ppm column is the signal for the N+1 test, which represents worst case behavior.
      <br/>
      The carryover of the unmodified parent compound, PPD, was found to be more than twice as high as that observed with CSPD.
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, the monocarboxylic acid derivative, dioxetane 3, showed a reduction of only 84% in the magnitude of the chemical carryover.
      <br/>
      This indicated that a single charged group was insufficient to completely prevent solubilization of the reaction intermediate in the fluorocarbon oil.
      <br/>
      However, the dicarboxylic acid derivative was 100% effective, indicating that two charged groups were fully adequate to achieve the desired behavior.

      As part of the optimization of a reagent based on dioxetane 1, a number of enhancer materials was examined.
      <br/>
      At pH 9.6, Enhancer A (1-trioctylphosphoniummethyl-4-tributylphosphoniummethylbenzene dichloride) increased the luminescent signal by a factor of 6.2, and Enhancer B (poly(vinylbenzyltributylphosphonium chloride)) increased the signal by a factor of 19.7. At pH 10.0, Enhancer A increased the signal by a factor of 4.8, and Enhancer B increased the signal by a factor of 18.9.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      Despite the fact that Enhancer B achieved higher light intensities, Enhancer A was preferred for use on the analysis system since it is a low molecular weight monomeric compound.
      <br/>
      Polymeric compounds, especially if they are polycationic, interact with serum components, causing precipitation, which would pose significant problems for the operation of the analysis system.
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      Both fluorescein and pyranine were found to be effective as supplementary fluorescers in combination with Enhancer A. Alone, these fluorescers must be used at relatively high concentrations (3 mM) in order to achieve an enhancement of about ten-fold.
      <br/>
      However, in combination with Enhancer A, a synergistic effect was observed, in which a comparable enhancement resulted at 100-fold lower concentrations of fluorescer than needed in the absence of the enhancer.

      The above described observations have led to the development of an optimized formulation for the capsule chemistry analysis system.
      <br/>
      This formulation is comprised of 0.1-1 mM dioxetane 1, 0-0.05 mM pyranine, 0.1-5 mg/mL Enhancer A, 0-1 mM Mg+2, 0.1-1 M 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (pH 10.0) and 0.01-1% Triton X-100.
      <br/>
      Use of this formulation results in complete elimination of the chemical carryover problem and enhanced performance.

      Formulations comprising 0.1 mg/mL Enhancer A, 0.88 mM Mg+2, 0.2 M 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, pH 10, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 mM dioxetane 1, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, were prepared and stored in opaque polyethylene bottles at 4 (degree)  C., 25 (degree)  C. and 40 (degree)  C. Twenty four 100  MU L aliquots from each bottle were pipetted into the wells of a 96 well plate and the solutions incubated at 37 (degree)  C. Into each well 10  MU L solutions containing 8 * 10-17 moles of AP were injected and light intensity integrated over five hours.
      <br/>
      Data are the average of all 24 wells.
      <br/>
      The experiment was repeated at the indicated time intervals for each dioxetane.
      <br/>
      The results in FIG. 5 show the comparative stability of the three formulations at 25 (degree)  C. As shown in FIG. 5, fluoro-substituted dioxetane 3 was found to exhibit substantially better storage stability than chloro-substituted dioxetane 4 and non-halo-substituted dioxetane 1.
      <br/>
      Dioxetanes 3 and 5 were also substantially more stable than 1 or 4 at 40 (degree)  C.
