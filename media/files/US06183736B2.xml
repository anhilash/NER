    <p num="7">
      Bacillus ssp is known to produce a variety of peptide antibiotics that are antibacterial and/or antifungal.
      <br/>
      Although the peptides antibiotics are composed of amino acids, they often differed from gene-encoded polypeptides in their structure and mechanism of biosynthesis.
      <br/>
      Some are gene-encoded and synthesized ribosomally, but these often undergo posttranslational processing and modifications.
      <br/>
      Antibiotics produced non ribosomally are composed of 2 to 20 amino acids organized in a linear, cyclic or branched cyclic structure.
      <br/>
      Bacillus subtilis produced gene-encoded antibiotics and a variety of small antibiotic peptides with a molecular weight less than 2000 daltons, synthesized non-ribosomally.
      <br/>
      Subtilin is one gene-encoded lantibiotic peptide synthesized by B. subtilis as a prepropeptide that undergoes posttranslational processing (1).
      <br/>
      Among the antibiotics synthesized non ribosomally are two family: the lipopeptides including iturin, surfactin, fengycin, plistatin and the small hydrophilic di- and tripeptides.
      <br/>
      Iturin is a group of cyclic lipopeptides produced by Bacillus subtilis including iturin A, C, D and E (2,3), bacillomycin D, F and L (4), Bacillopeptin (5) and mycosubtlin (6).
      <br/>
      All contains a  BETA -amino fatty acid linked by amide bonds to the constituent amino acid residues of the iturin group.
      <br/>
      Iturin lipopeptide share a common sequence � BETA -hydroxy fatty acid-Asx-Tyr-Asx� and show variation at the other four positions.
      <br/>
      Surfactin is also a cyclic lipopeptide containing seven residues of D- and L-amino acids and one residue of a  BETA -hydroxy fatty acid (7) with an amino acid sequence completely different from the iturin group.
      <br/>
      It is a powerful surfactant and has been described as an antifungal agent.
      <br/>
      Fengycin (8) and plipastatin (9) are lipopeptide with ten amino acid and a lipid attached to the N-terminal end of the molecule.
      <br/>
      They differed from iturin and surfactin by the presence of unusual amino acid such as ornithine and allo-threonine.

      Iturin exhibit a restricted antibacterial activity and a broad range of antifungal activity against fungi and yeast but none of them has been shown to have antifungal activity against A. flavus although iturin A has already been patented for control of aflatoxin (10).
      <br/>
      Culture filtrate from B. subtilis were described in 1948 as antifungal against important dermatophytes and systemic fungi, and the undescribed antibiotic was named "Bacillomycin" (11).
      <br/>
      Since then 3 class of bacillomycin D (12), F (13) and L (14), have been characterized according to their amino acid sequence.
      <br/>
      Among each class, different antibiotics have been reported such as bacillomycin Fa, Fb, Fc, and Lc.
      <br/>
      Bacillomycin Fb and Fc differ from bacillomycin Fa by the presence of one or two carboxyl group respectively instead of carboxamide groups and bacillomycin Lc from bacillomycin L only by the sequence positions of a side chain amide and a carboxylic acid (15).
      <br/>
      An exhaustive study of the literature show that bacillomycin F has been tested against a wide range of fungi and bacteria (Table II).

      Bacillomycin Lc has been described as a new antibiotic of the bacillomycin family with antifungal activity against phytopathogenic fungi such as Ophiostoma ulmi, Verticillium dahliae, Ceratocystis fagacearum and Cryphonectria parasitica the causal agents of Dutch elm disease, Verticillium wilt of maples, oak wilt and chestnut blight respectively.

      Mycosubtlin, iturin A and bacillomycin L inhibited the growth of Micrococcus luteus, their activity are different upon Micrococcus luteus protoplast.

      Mycosubtlin and Iturin A are able to lyse Micrococcus luteus protoplast and bacillomycin L has no effect (18).
      <br/>
      Even a slight modification of the molecule as the methylation of the aspartyl residues of bacillomycin L gives a strong lytic activity while natural bacillomycin L has no lytic activity (19).
      <br/>
      The phenolic group of the tyrosine residue has been shown to be essential for the antifungal activity, when the tyrosine residue was substituted no activity was observed (20).

    <p num="14">Aflatoxin Problem</p>
    <p num="15">
      The invention relates and contributes to solve an important scientific problem of serious economic and business consequences in the United States and in the world.
      <br/>
      To date, there is no acceptable and effective way and means to control aflatoxin on plants susceptible to aflatoxin-producing fungi.
      <br/>
      There are no known aflatoxin-resistant plants, genetically transformed or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Drought stress and high temperatures at critical times during kernel or seed development and/or insect injury of crops can contribute heavily to aflatoxin contamination of corn by the aflatoxin-producing fungi, A. flavus and A. parasiticus.
      <br/>
      The aflatoxin-producing fungi, A. flavus and A. parasiticus, present health hazards to humans and animals through the toxic and carcinogenic properties of their secondary products.
      <br/>
      Even a very low level of aflatoxin contamination can lead to severe economic losses in the peanut industry.
      <br/>
      To control this problem, breeding peanut varieties resistant to Aspergillus sp. or which support less aflatoxin production has been attempted with limited success.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      No commercial corn hybrids with high resistance to either infection by A. flavus or to aflatoxin accumulation are currently available.
      <br/>
      Aflatoxin detected at levels of 20 parts per billion (ppb) (established by the FDA) or above can make the crop unsalable.
      <br/>
      Aflatoxin is considered to be toxic to livestock being fed contaminated grain and to be a carcinogen, correlated with liver cancer, in certain human populations around the world.
      <br/>
      Cottonseed grown in the Yuma Valley, Ariz., corn grown in certain states of the southern U.S. and peanuts grown in certain regions of Georgia are chronically contaminated with aflatoxins resulting in direct losses by farmers amounting to tens of millions of dollars annually.
      <br/>
      Corn grown in the mid western states are contaminated with aflatoxin on a sporadic basis.
      <br/>
      Exact economic losses due to sporadic or limited aflatoxin outbreaks are difficult to determine, particularly in terms of detrimental impact at each of the various steps in the marketplace (including foreign markets).
      <br/>
      However, during drought years (1983 and 1988) in the mid west corn belt, which led to large aflatoxin outbreaks, losses were estimated to total in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      A major outbreak of aflatoxin in Southern Grown Corn, occurred recently in 1998.
      <br/>
      Aflatoxin contamination of corn in Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas in 1998 was one of the worst ever recorded.
      <br/>
      A potentially record number of grain-load rejections, due to aflatoxin levels in excess of FDA limits, occurred in some southern states.
      <br/>
      The aflatoxin outbreak in 1998 has additional significance since corn production in certain southern states has probably tripled in the past three years.
      <br/>
      It is certainly no coincidence that continuous days of 90(+) F temperatures and low or no rainfall dominated weather conditions for significant portions of the 1998 growing season in Southern states.
      <br/>
      The literature indicates that these conditions are highly conducive, even necessary for large aflatoxin outbreaks in susceptible crops.
      <br/>
      Insect injury is often suggested to be the major mode of entry by aflatoxin producing fungi.
      <br/>
      However, insect injury apparently does not account for the enormity of the aflatoxin outbreak experienced this past year in the South.
      <br/>
      Thus, controlling insects (e.g. cultivation of transgenic corn containing Bt, an insect toxin), although an essential part of good management practices, would not necessarily have been effective in reducing aflatoxin levels in Southern-grown corn in 1998.
      <br/>
      Some observations suggest that the fungus gained entry by some other, little understood means associated with high temperature and drought conditions.
      <br/>
      This highlights the need for extensive research on drought and temperature effects on plant health and physiology and fungal virulence and to find a solution to these problems.

      The invention provides microorganisms of the Bacillus ssp, especially B. subtilis preferably B. subtilis AU 195 which is effective to control plant pathogens both fungi and bacteria.
      <br/>
      An important embodiment provides the control of aflatoxin in plants susceptible to aflatoxing-producing fungi.
      <br/>
      The treatment of the plant can be carried out at anytime, e.g. prior to, or after the onset of the infection.
      <br/>
      The control can be effectuated with the B. subtilis with which synthesizes the antifungal peptides or by the peptides themselves, one at a time or together.
      <br/>
      Several methods and means of control of aflatoxin producing fungi are provided.
      <br/>
      Any part of the plant, including the seeds can be treated.

    <p num="24">
      The present invention provides B. subtilis, which shows high antifungal activity against A. flavus and also shows antibacterial activity against certain bacteria.
      <br/>
      The B. subtilis strain AU195 produces two small cyclic peptides exhibiting a range of antifungal activity against plant pathogenic fungi.
      <br/>
      Both peptides have a spectrum of activity against plant fungi and against bacteria heretofore not reported, which make these peptides, very valuable in the control of plant pathogens on plants susceptible to infection caused by pathogens, particularly to aflatoxin-producing fungi like A. flavus and A. parasiticus.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="36">
      The family of peptides, which have antifungal and antibacterial activity against a spectrum of fungi and bacteria include two small peptides designated herein as a1 and a2.
      <br/>
      These peptides were found to be associated and isolated from B. subtilis AU195.
      <br/>
      They were characterized as iturin and belong to the bacillomycin D family.
      <br/>
      Although as has been reported above, bacillomycin D peptides have been found to have antifungal activity, no peptide has been reported to date to have antifungal activity against certain specific fungi, to which plants are susceptible, specifically Alternaria solani, Fusarium monoliforme, Pythium aphanidermatum, and especially A. flavus.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Other pathogenic fungi to which plants are known to be susceptible include Puccinia ssp., Phytophthora ssp., Peronospora ssp., Rhizoctonia ssp., Botrytis ssp., Sclerotinia ssp. and Colletotrichum ssp, which can be controlled with the peptides of the invention.</p>
    <p num="38">
      Further, as has been reported, certain peptides which were isolated from bacteria, have been found to have antibacterial activity, which are human pathogens.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the peptides of the invention have been found to be effective against plant pathogenic bacteria such as, Xanthomonas campestris (X. campestris) is known to be pathogenic, for instance on cabbage plants and is responsible for black rot disease.
      <br/>
      Further, the peptides are effective against certain bacteria-like Clavibacter michiganensis and B. cereus.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The composition of the invention comprises one or more of the principal two peptides discovered namely a1 and a2 in a mixture with conventional biologically acceptable inert or active carriers.
      <br/>
      The peptides can be used together or administered to the plant, or to the animal sequentially, or only one of the fungal peptides need to be used.
    </p>
    <p num="40">The amount in which the peptide is used in a minimum amount effective to control or inhibit the target fungi or bacteria to a maximum as may be needed for control.</p>
    <p num="41">
      Instead of the isolated peptide, the microorganism, the B. subtilis can be used by itself or in the composition, preferably with an appropriate ingredient that promotes the release of the peptide(s).
      <br/>
      It is not excluded that the spores of B. subtilis (e.g. B. subtilis AU 195) may be used.
      <br/>
      These would be allowed to grow on the plant and release the peptides.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The peptides a1 and a2 of the invention have been characterized as described hereafter.
      <br/>
      They have, respectively, a 1045 Da and 1059.5 ba molecular weight, determined by mass spectroscopy.
      <br/>
      It is believed that a1 has a  BETA -amino fatty acid of 15 carbons and that a2 has a  BETA -amino fatty acid of 16 carbons.
      <br/>
      The tandem mass spectrometry of a2 indicated a sequence very similar to a1 with an additional CH2 at some point other than the Glu residue.
      <br/>
      It is not excluded that the length of these amino acids vary each by 1-3 carbons, i.e., be shorter or longer accordingly.
      <br/>
      The mass shift of a2 may be accountable by a homoserine for the serine residue or a fatty acid modifier one carbon longer than a1 or a single amino acid substitution of some type.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The target plant or mammal, which can be treated is any plant susceptible to the fungal or microbial infection to be controlled, like the major crops, whether monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous, like cereals, legumes, tubers, solanaceous plants, cucurbits, fibrous plants, corn, peanut, rice, wheat, etc.
      <br/>
      Of particular interest at this time in the treatment of peanut plants which are susceptible to aflatoxin-producing fungi.
      <br/>
      Peanut plants including the seeds can be treated in accordance with the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="44">Any mammal especially animals susceptible to A. flavus or and/or A. parasitus can also be treated with the compositions including the peptides of the invention.</p>
    <p num="45">
      The peptides of the inventions are generally obtained as a mixture of isomers in a mixture with other peptides that do not interfere with the activity of the peptides of the invention.
      <br/>
      The isomeric mixture can be separated into the respective isomers by know inventions.
    </p>
    <p num="46">Upon isolation and sequencing of the gene(s) which codes the peptides of the invention, the plants like corn, soybeans, peanut and other crops can be readily transformed (either by nucleus or chloroplast transformation) to produce plants resistant to the target infection, and likewise produce progeny (and maternally inherited) generations, that are likewise stably resistant to the target pathogen(s).</p>
    <p num="47">Any mammal, especially animals susceptible to A. flavus and/or A. parasiticus can be treated on accordance with the invention.</p>
    <p num="48">The peptides can be used for prophylactic control and/or therapeutic control.</p>
    <p num="49">Other embodiments of the invention will become apparent from the description herein.</p>

    <p num="85">
      Antimicrobial activity of the crude fraction 3 or 5 ml of bacterial cell suspension (from 104 to 108 cells/ml) was widespread at the surface of LB plate and the excess was withdrawn.
      <br/>
      After 15 min dessication of plates under the hood, 4 discs were distributed containing different amount of the ammonium sulfate precipitate fraction.
      <br/>
      Plates were incubated for 48 hours at 27 (degree)  C. and the inhibition zone was observed after 24 and 48 hours.
