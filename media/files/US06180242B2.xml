    <p num="41">
      The plasticizer content of the adhesive composition of the present invention has an unexpectedly dramatic effect on the viscosity of the adhesive composition, that is, the viscosity of the adhesive composition made by adding a relatively small amount of plasticizer to an emulsion of the above disclosed polymer is dramatically higher, for example, a factor of 3 to 10 times higher than the initial viscosity of the emulsion.
      <br/>
      In contrast, an analogous adhesive composition based on a polymer having a Tg below -15 (degree)  C. would be expected to exhibit a viscosity that is higher than the initial viscosity of the polymer emulsion by a factor of less than 3.
    </p>
    <p num="42">The dramatic viscosity response of the adhesive composition of the present invention is beneficial in that the composition provides equivalent performance at a lower solids level, that is, can be applied in a state wherein the composition is more highly diluted with water, than an adhesive composition based on an analogous polymer having a Tg less than -15 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="43">In a preferred embodiment, the adhesive composition of the present invention has a viscosity of from about 100 cP to about 10,000 cP, and, more preferably, of from about 200 cP to about 7,500 cP.</p>

      A line of polymer emulsion (about 5 g adhesive) was applied along one of the 2 inch wide ends of each of the wax-coated coupons and then drawn down the length of the coupon using a notched stainless steel blade (5 notches per inch, with each notch being about 1/32 inch wide by 1/16 inch deep).
      <br/>
      A coupon of virgin cardboard, that is, a cardboard coupon having no wax coating and having no emulsion coating, was applied to the wet emulsion-coated side of the coated coupon and a 1 kilogram weight was applied for 4 minutes to compress the combined coupons and adhesive composition.
