      A silane or carbosilane dendrimer is modified with bridge moieties and polymer arms attached to the bridges to form hybrid dendrimer-star polymers.
      <br/>
      The bridge moieties are attached via Si-C bonds to the silane or dendrimer.
      <br/>
      The bridge has one or more reactive groups to which polymer arms are attached.
      <br/>
      Selected reactive groups on the bridge may serve as initiator sites for in situ polymerization of the arms.
      <br/>
      The polymer arms are of the polyether, polysulfide or polyester type.
      <br/>
      These arms may have functional groups which allow further modification and attachments.
      <br/>
      For this type of star polymer, the bridge has been found to increase resistance to hydrolysis at the silane- or dendrimer-arm junction.
      <br/>
      These star polymers are useful e.g. as viscosity modifiers, component in molding resins, water solubilizer for hydrophobic molecules, surfactants and as carriers for drugs, prodrugs and other biological agents.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to silane and carbosilane dendrimers having bridge moieties at the periphery, and to star polymers formed by attaching arms to sites on the bridge.
      <br/>
      The arms are polymers formed in situ from monomers at initiator sites on the bridge, or preformed polymer attached at reactive sites on the bridge.
      <br/>
      The bridge may be selected alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl, small polyether or small polysulfide groups.
      <br/>
      The arms may be polyethers, polysulfides or polyesters.
      <br/>
      Copolymers of these polymer types may be used.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="2">Recently polyethers of the type of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) have found application in biological and pharmaceutical contexts because of properties including water solubility, biocompatibility e.g. non-thrombogenic, and terminal hydroxy groups to attach various entities including drugs, prodrugs and other biological agents.</p>
    <p num="3">
      These polyethers (PEO, PEG) have been used as outer arms in star polymers where the cores have been divinylbenzene (may be cross-linked), poly(ethylene imine), poly(amidoamines) and heptaphenyl.

      Polyester arms formed by ring-opening polymerization of lactones, lactides and glycolides have been used with cores of polyesters, sugar type molecules or inositol, to form star polymers.

      Carbosilane dendrimers have been used as cores in hybrid dendrimer-star polymers.
      <br/>
      These dendrimers provide a non-polar and chemically inert scaffold that is advantageous when thermal and hydrolytic stability is required, and in hydrophobic environments.
      <br/>
      See for example:
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="7">
      When these carbosilane dendrimers, having peripheral silane termini, were used as cores with arms of poly(alkylene oxide), it was found that the core-arm interface was unduly susceptible to hydrolysis in some applications.
      <br/>
      It would be desirable to reconfigure this interface in order to reduce susceptibility to hydrolysis.

      The periphery of carbosilane dendrimers having outer allyl silane groups, has been modified to introduce hydroxy groups by controlled oxidation.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      It has now been found that by inserting selected bridge molecules at the core-arm interface (when the core is silane or carbosilane and the arm is polyether, polysulfide or polyester) the susceptibility to hydrolysis is reduced significantly.
      <br/>
      In this context by hydrolysis is meant the breaking of chemical bonds at the dendrimer periphery and the release of functional groups or polymer chains from the dendrimer-polymer hybrid.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The invention includes a silane- or carbosilane-based, periphery-modified dendrimer, adapted to serve as core in hybrid dendrimer-star polymers, comprising:
      <br/>
      a) an inner structure having a central silane nucleus and, optionally, multiple carbosilane branches extending outwardly from the nucleus in a repetitive generational manner yielding silane termini;
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      - and, attached to the silane or silane termini by a hydrolysis-resistant bond;
      <br/>
      b) bridge moieties comprising groups selected from alkyl of at least 4 C atoms, cycloalkyl, aryl including aralkyl and alkaryl, and polyether and polysulfide of up to about 6 repeating units, the moieties having reactive groups enabling attachment of polymer arms thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The invention also includes a hybrid dendrimer-star polymer, comprising:
      <br/>
      (i) the modified dendrimer described in the previous paragraph except that the alkyl bridge moiety has at least 2C atoms, and
      <br/>
      (ii) outer arms comprising polymer chains selected from polyethers, polysulfides, polyesters and copolymers thereof, the arms being attached to the dendrimer at the sites of the bridge reactive groups.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The invention further includes a process of preparing a hybrid dendrimer-star polymer including a modified silane or carbosilane dendrimer and selected polymer outer arms, comprising:
      <br/>
      a) attaching bridge moieties to reactive silane sites in a silane or carbosilane dendrimer, the bridge comprising a group selected from alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, small polyether and small polysulfide, the bridges having reactive groups thereon; and
      <br/>
      b) reacting a selected form of the bridge reactive groups with one of:
      <br/>
      - (i) monomer selected from alkylene oxide, alkylene sulfide, alkylene glycol, alkylene dithiol, and hydroxyalkanoic acid and lactone thereof, under polymerization conditions, said selected form serving as initiator, to form polymer arm attached to the bridge; and
      <br/>
      - (ii) functionalized prepolymer selected from polyether, polysulfide, polyester and copolymers thereof, to attach prepolymer to the bridge, thereby to form the star polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="15">A primary aspect of the invention may be defined as: in a star polymer having a silane or carbosilane core and outer arms comprising polymer selected from polyether, polysulfide, polyester and copolymers thereof, the improvement comprising selected bridge inserts positioned between the core and the arms, with the bridge attached to silicon atoms in the core or dendrimer by a Si--C bond, the length and type of the bridge and of the arm being selected to give desired properties e.g. hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance or solubility, to the polymer-dendrimer hybrid.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      The silane or carbosilane core has a regular usually dendritic structure and is built up in stages or generations from a central silane or disilane nucleus e.g. by alternating hydrosilylation and vinylation or allylation reactions.
      <br/>
      Various dendritic carbosilanes are known and any would be operative provided that the bridges can be formed at the peripheral silane group.
      <br/>
      The core size can range from generation zero to generation 5 or even higher e.g. to 8.
      <br/>
      For generation zero, one or up to 5 silicon atoms can suffice.
    </p>
    <p num="17">The carbosilane dendrimers provide a non-polar and relatively inert scaffold that can be used under various reaction conditions including anionic polymerization conditions.</p>
    <p num="18">The bridge moiety is bonded to silane or to peripheral silane sites in the carbosilane dendrimer by a hydrolysis-resistant Si--C bond.</p>
    <p num="19">
      Preferably the bridge moiety is selected from
      <br/>
      (1) --R--X; where R is selected from alkyl and cycloalkyl having from 4 to 18 C atoms; aryl, aralkyl and alkaryl having from 6 to 18C atoms; and X is hydroxyl, thiol, amine, carboxyl, aldehyde, halide or a protecting group therefor;
    </p>
    <p num="20">and  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="21">where R' is alkyl having from 2 to 4C atoms, Y is oxygen or sulfur and n is 2 to 6, and the bridge-core attachment comprises the hydrolysis-resistant bond Si--C.</p>
    <p num="22">Preferred bridge members include (C4 -C9 alkyl)--Z, cyclohexyl, phenyl or benzyl or para-methylenephenyl)--Z, and  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="23">
      H where Z is a reactive group such as OH, --NH2 or --COOH and n=2-6, as well as the corresponding thiols and thioethers.
      <br/>
      In the aryl, aralkyl and alkaryl bridge moieties the aryl may be phenyl or lower alkyl-substituted phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl (may be alkyl-substituted) or pyridine, and the alkyl may be C1 to C6 straight chain or branched.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Where the bridge is cycloalkyl or aryl it is possible to have two reactive groups at selected locations on the ring or rings.
      <br/>
      This allows for doubling the number of arms and facilitates masking or isolation of the core, reduction of influence of core properties and/or increasing the number of modifiable functional groups.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Suitable protecting groups for the reactive groups on the bridge moiety are illustrated as follows:</p>
    <p num="26">
      --
      <br/>
      --         Reactive Group       Protecting Group
      <br/>
      --         hydroxyl             tetrahydropyran,
      <br/>
      --         thiol                (S) -benzyl
      <br/>
      --         amino                2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-aza-2,5-
      <br/>
      --                              disilacyclopentane
      <br/>
      --         carboxylic acid      4,4'-dimethyl-2-oxazoline
      <br/>
      --         aldehyde             acetal such as 1,3-dioxolane
    </p>
    <p num="27">These are typical protecting groups; however many others are known and may be used.</p>
    <p num="28">Where the bridge moiety is a polyether or polysulfide it should be attached to the (peripheral) silane site by a Si--C bond and be of low molecular weight e.g. not more than 6 repeating units.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Any suitable process may be used to attach the bridge moiety to the silane sites.
      <br/>
      A preferred process consists of two steps.
      <br/>
      In the first step a Grignard reagent of the (protected) bridge moiety is reacted with a hydrosilane

      The derived hydrosilane, containing from 1 to 3 bridge moieties, is then reacted with peripheral vinyl or allyl groups of the carbosilane dendrimer in a hydrosilylation reaction catalyzed e.g. by platinum (this latter reaction gives high yields e.g. 99%).
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The dendrimer-star polymer is a hybrid of this bridge-modified silane or dendrimer and selected types of star-forming polymer arms.
      <br/>
      These outer polymer arms may be formed either by:
      <br/>
      (i) polymerizing selected monomer in situ with the silane or dendrimer serving as initiator, or by
      <br/>
      (ii) attaching selected preformed polymer chains at the reactive group sites.
      <br/>
      Preferably the polymer arms have terminal modifiable functional groups selected from hydroxyl, aldehyde or keto, amino, carboxyl and thiol.
      <br/>
      These terminal groups may have protecting groups as outlined above.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In the case of polymerization in situ of the polymer arms suitable monomers are:
      <br/>
      a) for polyether arm: alkylene oxide, alkylene glycol,the alkylene have 2-4 C atoms;
      <br/>
      b) for polysulfide arm: alkylene sulfide, alkylene dithiol(analogous to the polyether); and
      <br/>
      c) for polyester arm: glycolic acid lactone (glycolide),lactic acid lactone occurring in L-, D-, DL-forms and racemic mixtures (lactide) and -caprolactone.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      These monomers may be used alone, consecutively, or as mixtures.
      <br/>
      Copolymers (including block copolymers) of these types of monomers can be used as arms.
    </p>
    <p num="34">The polymerization of the alkylene oxides is carried out in general by anionic polymerization.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The bridge reactive groups for the alkylene oxide or glycol type monomers are selected to be hydroxyl and transformed into alkoxide initiator sites by alkali metal (preferably K).
      <br/>
      In the case of the glycol-type monomer, the polymerization may be carried out by mineral acid catalysis.
      <br/>
      These polyether chains will have terminal hydroxyl or alkoxide groups.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      For polymerization of the thio monomers, similar conditions as for the alkoxide and glycol type monomers may be used.
      <br/>
      These polysulfide chains will have terminal thiol or alkali metal (thiol) groups.
      <br/>
      Suitable initiator sites on the bridge for the thio monomers are the thiols and their alkali metal salts.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The polymerization of the lactone-type monomers is carried out, in general, by coordination polymerization.
      <br/>
      Typical catalysts are tin octoate and trialkyl aluminum.
      <br/>
      For this type the initiator site usually is the hydroxyl group.
      <br/>
      These polyester chains typically will have terminal hydroxyl groups formed from alkoxide groups by acid treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The in situ polymerizations preferably are of the ring-opening type in which monomers polymerize end-to-end and form straight chains with minimal or no branching or cross-linking.
      <br/>
      This is desirable in this star polymer context because soluble polymers are obtained of controlled architecture and molecular weight.
      <br/>
      This type of straight chain is desired in the preformed polymer arms as well.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In the case of preformed chains, the polymerizations may be conducted in any suitable manner yielding a substantially straight chain with a reactive group at one end (which will serve or can be activated to serve, to attach the chain to the bridge reactive groups) and preferably a functional group at the other end.
      <br/>
      These polymerizations usually are selected from the following types: anionic (living) and coordination.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Attachment to the bridge may be carried out by any of the following procedures inter alia.
      <br/>
      Examples for each type of arm are summarized as follows:
      <br/>
      a) Preformed polyether and preformed polysulfide:
      <br/>
      - Williamson ether formation;
      <br/>
      b) Preformed polyester: ester formation activated by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.
    </p>
    <p num="41">Copolymers of any of these types can be preformed and used as arms.</p>
    <p num="42">
      We have found the in situ polymerization route to form the arms preferred over the preformed polymer attachment because of the reduced number of reaction steps, the larger molecular weight range obtainable, and the large number of arms that can be grown from a single core dendrimer.
      <br/>
      The resulting polymers(in situ type) are essentially free of contamination whereas the preformed route usually requires purification steps to recover the product.
    </p>
    <p num="43">Preferably the polymer arms have modifiable functional groups which can be modified to attach e.g. entities of the following types: bioactive agents including polypeptides, drugs and prodrugs, affinity ligands, polymerizable groups (e.g. (meth)acryl, styryl) and oligosaccharides.</p>
    <p num="44">
      Most suitably these functional groups are selected from hydroxyl, thiol, amine, carboxyl, halide and aldehyde with optional protecting groups therefor.
      <br/>
      Depending on the group present, it can be modified to form inter alia various ethers, sulfides, amides, esters and salts.
      <br/>
      The optional protective groups may be chosen from those mentioned previously.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The molecular weight of the polymer arms may range from about 500 up to about 100,000 or more, depending on the amount of monomer used, relative to the number of initiator sites present.
      <br/>
      For these polymer arms water solubility will tend to increase with increasing molecular weight, and within limits, this can be used to control the solubility of the star polymer.
      <br/>
      For many bio applications arm molecular weights within about 2000 to about 20,000 will be most suitable (assuming a core size of up to G3 or G4).
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Controlling water solubility is important for applications such as drug carriers and conjugates with protein.
      <br/>
      The following variables affect the water solubility: dendrimer generation (G), type and length of the bridge, type and length of the polymer arm and nature of terminal groups.
      <br/>
      Selecting and adjusting one or more of these variables enables good control over solubility, especially water solubility.
    </p>
    <p num="47">The polyester star-dendrimer hybrids are advantageous for their low water solubility, biocompatibility, for their drug carrying properties and their propensity to slow degradation when in contact with biological fluids.</p>
