      <br/>
      The invention is directed to a self supporting cantilever support apparatus for mounting a satellite dish antenna to a building having a sidewall.
      <br/>
      The apparatus consists of a square, steel receiver tube having a foot plate mounted on one end and a square, steel telescope tube inserted and adjustably mounted within the receiver tube.
      <br/>
      The satellite dish is screwed onto the hour glass shaped plate affixed to the telescope tube.
      <br/>
      Slotted holes formed in the hour glass shaped plate to accommodate the many different types of satellite dishes.
      <br/>
      The co-axial cable is threaded through a hole in the telescope tube, through the two tubes and out through a hole formed in the bottom of the receiver tube.

      <br/>
      The mast has an upper end for attachment to the dish and a lower end for anchoring to a rigid type structure.
      <br/>
      The structure also has a bent strut having a lower end for anchoring to a rigid-type structure and an upper end for attachment to the mast.

      It is important that a satellite dish, whatever the size, have an unobstructed view of the sky in the direction of the location of a broadcasting satellite.
      <br/>
      To achieve this unobstructed southern exposure, the manufacturer's mounting recommendations for these small satellite dish systems are limited to three choices: strapped to a chimney; mounted on top of a pitched roof; or positioned adjacent to the southern wall of a building.
      <br/>
      Another method of mounting the satellite dish is mounting the dish to the eave of the building.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, a problem arises due to the inherent structural weakness of a typical household eave.
      <br/>
      Even the manufacturer's of the small dish antenna specifically advise users to avoid mounting on the eave of a house because of the eave's lack of rigidity.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      The instant invention, is a self supporting cantilever support arm which gets the satellite dish above the roof line without attaching the dish directly to the roof, fascia, or soffit, thus eliminating pathways for water penetration into the roof system.
      <br/>
      The arm consists of a square receiver tube having a wall mount plate affixed to one end, three screw nuts mounted on one side of the arm, two for holding set screws and the third for mounting a ground screw.
      <br/>
      The locations of the holes in the foot plate make it possible to mount the wall mount plate on all types of structure walls such as concrete block, frame with various veneers, etc.
      <br/>
      At the wall mount plate end of the receiver tube, a bolt is provided to attach a ground wire for the dish.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      A telescope tube, having a dish assembly foot plate, is fit into the receiver tube and the required length is set.
      <br/>
      The dish assembly foot plate has slotted holes to accommodate all major brands of satellite dishes.
      <br/>
      At the front bottom of the telescope tube, a hole is provided for routing the dish hookup co-axial cable through the arm assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      With the mounting of the instant invention, a greater versatility in choosing dish mounting locations is provided.
      <br/>
      The arm adjusts to an overhang with or without a gutter.
      <br/>
      The arm is made of heavy gauge steel with all stainless hardware and is completely assembled ready for installation.
      <br/>
      It is universal and will accept all major brands of satellite dishes and mounts to solid concrete, concrete block, brick, stone or framed wall with suitable veneer.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="18">
      Referring now to the drawings wherein like numerals designate like and corresponding parts throughout the several views, in FIG. 1 the wall mounted cantilevered telescoping arm 10, which supports small TV satellite dishes 11 and other small data receiver dishes mounts to a suitable structure walls 12 of concrete block, frame with various veneers, etc.
      <br/>
      The arm 10 will hold dish assemblies 11 to soffit, fascia, or any other part of a roof structure, without bracing.
      <br/>
      The arm 10 locates the dish assembly 11 above the roof line.
      <br/>
      The arm 10 eliminates the use of a pole mounting, and will adjust to clear the eave 13 or irregular jogs in walls.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The arm 10 is universal and will fit all major brands of dish assemblies; RCA Types, SONY, Hughes, Panasonic, etc.
      <br/>
      The arm 10 consists of the following: the fixed receiver 14 with wall mounting plate 15, and the telescoping dish mount assembly 16.
      <br/>
      The fixed receiver 14, with wall mounting plate 15, consists of a steel, square receiver tube 18 which is attached plumb to a generally square foot plate 15.
      <br/>
      Square, threaded nuts 30 are welded to a side of the receiver 14.
      <br/>
      At the plate 15 end of receiver tube 18, a bolt 22 is threaded into threaded nut 30 to attach a ground wire for the dish 11.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      As shown in FIG. 6, a round hole 23 is formed for routing dish 11 hookup co-axial cable through the arm 10 assembly.
      <br/>
      At the front of receiver tube 18, bottom and right sides, are two each, respectively, set/adjusting screws 24 for adjusting the length of telescope tube 17.
      <br/>
      The two sets of screws 24, reach into receiver tube 10 to press against the telescope tube 18 to provide a firm contact between the receiver tube 18 and the telescope tube 17 to prevent any play between the two parts and the firm contact between the walls of the two parts provides greater strength to resist wind forces.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      As shown in FIG. 2, the telescoping dish mount assembly 16 consists of a square, steel, telescope tube 17 which is attached plumb to the center of a generally hour glass shaped steel plate 25.
      <br/>
      The plate 25 is for attaching the satellite dish assembly 11 at the foot 19 with bolts 40, washers 41 and nuts 42 as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      Slotted holes 26 are formed at the top end and bottom end of plate 25 to accommodate the different hole locations in the existing dish antennas.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The foot plate 15 is mounted to the exterior structure wall 12.
      <br/>
      The holes 20, 21 in the mounting plate 15 are for mounting to concrete block, brick veneer, and the like.
      <br/>
      The attachment would be with concrete screws or anchor sleeves with anchor bolts.
      <br/>
      A spirit level is used to level the foot plate 15.
      <br/>
      It is important to assure that the self supporting cantilevered telescoping arm 10 is both level with respect to the top or bottom edge of the foot plate 25 and plumb with respect to the face of the foot plate 25 in order to permit the precise tuning and pointing of the dish 11 according to instructions printed on the dish 11.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      As shown in FIG. 4, the telescope tube 17 is inserted into the receiver tube 18 and adjusted to the desired unit length.
      <br/>
      The set/adjustment screws 24 are then tightened to push the telescope tube 17 firmly to the top and left side of the receiver tube 18.
      <br/>
      Jamb nuts 31 are tightened to assure that adjusting screws 24 are firmly set.
      <br/>
      The slotted holes 26 at the top and bottom of the foot plate 25 will accommodate all major brands of satellite dishes.
      <br/>
      The co-axial cable is then fed through the hole 32, through the telescope tube 17, through the receiver tube 18 and out through hole 23 in the receiver tube 18.
      <br/>
      A ground wire for the dish 11 may then be attached to bolt 22.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Thus it will be appreciated that the present invention provides a novel telescoping satellite dish mount that may be used whenever a satellite dish is mounted.
      <br/>
      It is contemplated that other embodiments and/or modifications may be made in the present invention without departure from inventive concepts manifested by the disclosed embodiments.
      <br/>
      It is expressly intended, therefore, that the foregoing description is illustrative only of preferred embodiments, not limiting, and that the true spirit and scope of the invention be determined by reference to the appended claims.
