    <p num="1">This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 10-310502, filed Oct. 30, 1998.</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention concerns a stamp pad which contains an ink vessel.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Traditionally, stamp pads are widely used for rubber stamp affixation.
      <br/>
      Stamp pads are of various sizes and shapes to accommodate various sizes of rubber stamps.
      <br/>
      One example is shown below.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      FIG. 7 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a traditional stamp pad.
      <br/>
      As shown in the figure, the traditional stamp pad consists of a pad base 21, an ink pad 22, which is made of such ink-absorbing materials as sponge, felt, etc., soaked with pigment ink or dye ink, and a cap 23 which covers said ink pad 22.
      <br/>
      The circumference of said pad base 21 has notches made with which the tip of the circumference of said cap 23 engages so that the lid can be opened and closed freely.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 is a schematic oblique view of a stamp pad with its lid removed, showing pad base 21 and ink pad 22.
    </p>
    <p num="5">More recently, stamp pads have become colorful and stamp pads with various colors of stamp ink are available in the market.</p>
    <p num="6">In using a stamp pad for rubber stamp affixation, rubber stamp 24 is lightly pressed on ink pad 22 of stamp pad, as shown in FIG. 9, to obtain ink on the rubber stamp for affixation thereof on the proper place for stamp affixation on paper, cloth, leather, plastic, etc.</p>
    <p num="7">Repeated use of a stamp pad by removing and replacing cap 23 from and back on pad base 21 as described above may cause the soiling with ink of the interior of cap 23 as a result of its contact with ink pad 22.</p>
    <p num="8">In addition, repeated rubber stamp affixation as described above will gradually decrease and use up the ink absorbed in stamp pad, necessitating the replenishment of ink.</p>
    <p num="9">Traditionally, ink replenishment was accomplished either by purchasing an ink vessel which contains the ink of the same color or purchasing in advance and storing an ink vessel which contains replenishment ink and using such ink in such ink vessel to soak the stamp pad.</p>
    <p num="10">The purchasing of ink has caused inconvenience at times, however, because the ink of the same color could not be found or only a small amount of additional ink was needed because of less frequent use of the ink or because ink was needed immediately.</p>
    <p num="11">The inconvenience on the part of stamp pad manufacturers included the costliness of stocking and making available many different kinds of replenishment ink and the difficulty in keeping the inventory of less frequently used types of ink for a long period of time, resulting in the out-of-stock status for certain types of ink.</p>
    <p num="12">Furthermore, stamp pads were often disposed of once ink ran out, resulting in a wasteful, uneconomical practice, which also contributed to the increase of garbage to be processed.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">This invention is made to improve such shortcomings of the prior art as described above and is intended to provide a stamp pad which makes it easy to replenish ink when it runs out by storing a replenishment ink vessel in the stamp pad in such manner as to make it easy to remove the ink vessel.</p>
    <p num="14">This invention is also intended to provide a stamp pad which prevents the soiling with ink of the interior of a cap as the stamp pad is used repeatedly.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">An embodiment of this invention concerns an ink vessel-containing stamp pad characteristic of having an ink pad saturated with ink, the main body which has an ink storage area for storing an ink vessel, a cap which covers said ink pad and is designed for free placement on and removal from the main body, an ink vessel stored in said ink storage area and a bottom plug which covers the exterior of the ink storage area which stores said ink vessel and is designed for free placement on and removal from the main body.</p>
    <p num="17">Desirably, the aforesaid cap and main body can be independent of each other so that the cap is separated from the main body when removed.</p>
    <p num="18">Desirably, the aforesaid cap can have fitting notches which slidably fit the protrusions made on the main body, and said cap can be placed on and removed from the main body while said fitting notches and the protrusions are connected with each other.</p>
    <p num="19">An embodiment of this invention also concerns an ink vessel-containing stamp pad characteristic of having an ink pad saturated with ink, the main body which has an ink storage area for storing an ink vessel, a cap which covers said ink pad and is designed for free placement on and removal from the main body, an ink vessel stored in said ink storage area and a bottom plug which connects to said ink vessel and covers the exterior of the ink storage area which stores the ink vessel and is designed for free placement on and removal from the main body, and is characteristic of having the ink vessel together with the bottom plug freely placeable on and removable from the main body.</p>
    <p num="20">Desirably, the aforesaid bottom plug can serve as the lid for said ink vessel and is connected to said ink vessel.</p>
    <p num="21">Desirably, the aforesaid bottom plug and ink vessel can be tightly connected to each other at the interior of such bottom plug and the opening of such ink vessel.</p>
    <p num="22">Desirably, the aforesaid bottom plug and ink vessel can be connected at the interior of said bottom plug and the opening of said ink vessel by way of threading.</p>
    <p num="23">Desirably, the aforesaid cap and main body can be independent of and separable from each other so that the cap is freely placed on and removed from the main body.</p>
    <p num="24">Desirably, the aforesaid cap can have fitting notches which slidably fit the protrusions made on the main body and is placed on and removed from the body while said fitting notches and said protrusions are kept connected.</p>
    <p num="25">
      An embodiment of the ink vessel-containing stamp pad of the present invention is characteristic of containing an ink vessel inside which contains replenishment ink.
      <br/>
      More specifically, it is characteristic of having an ink pad saturated with ink, the main body having an ink storage area which stores an ink vessel, a cap which covers said ink pad and is freely placeable on and removable from the main body, an ink vessel stored in said ink storage area and a bottom plug which covers the exterior of said ink storage area which stores said ink vessel and is freely placeable on and removable from the main body.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The cap of the ink vessel-containing stamp pad of the present invention is designed to cover an ink pad saturated with ink.
      <br/>
      The manner of installing said cap may be one of the following methods: (1) said cap and the main body are independent of each other, and after said cap is installed on the main body, the main body and the cap are separated when the cap is removed; or (2) fitting notches are made on said cap and the fitting notches slidably fit the protrusions made on the main body, and the cap and the main body are kept connected at such fitting notches and the protrusions and are not separated when the cap is placed on and removed from the main body, and when the cap is removed from the main body after it is placed on the main body, the main body and the cap are not separated.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The ink vessel filled with replenishment ink of the ink vessel-containing stamp pad of the present invention is stored in the ink storage area in the main body.
      <br/>
      Said ink vessel and the bottom plug covering the exterior of such ink storage area of the main body may be parts separate and independent of each other, or the opening of the ink vessel and the bottom plug may be fastened with each other by way of threading or by way of close engagement.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      As described above, the ink vessel-containing stamp pad of the present invention enables immediate replenishment of ink while in use when the ink in the ink pad runs out because the stamp pad contains an ink vessel inside which contains replenishment ink, hence eliminating the necessity of purchasing and storing a separate ink vessel which contains the ink of the same color.
      <br/>
      Also eliminated is the disposal of a stamp pad after one time use because the replenishment ink of the same color cannot be found, thus achieving better economy and contributing to the decrease in garbage to be processes.
    </p>
    <p num="29">The difficulty and inconvenience in the inventory management associated with the manufacturing and selling of stamp pads, i.e., it is costly and burdensome to prepare and stock each and every different kind of ink and particularly to stock for a long period of time certain kinds of ink which are used less frequently, resulting at times in the out-of-stock status of certain colors, will be eliminated by the stamp pad of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="30">
      The repeated use of a stamp pad with a cap which separates from the main body when removed may cause the interior of the cap to be soiled with ink as a result of the contact with the ink pad.
      <br/>
      The use of the stamp pad of the present invention which has a cap equipped with fitting notches which slidably fit the protrusions made on the main body and which does not separate from the main body as the cap and the main body maintain the engagement between the fitting notches and the protrusions makes it easier to place and remove the cap because the orbit of the cap movement is restricted by the fitting notches and the protrusions, and prevents the soiling with ink of the interior of the cap because the cap does not contact the ink pad when placed on and removed from the main body.
    </p>
    <p num="31">Examples of the embodiment of the present invention are explained in concrete terms based on figures given below.</p>
    <p num="32">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 1 is a schematic front view of an embodiment of the stamp pad of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 shows an A to A cross-sectional view.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows a B to B cross-sectional view.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      As shown in the figures, the ink vessel-containing stamp pad of the present invention 20 has main body 1, cap 2, ink vessel 3 and bottom plug 4.
      <br/>
      Main body 1 has ink pad 5 saturated with ink and ink storage area 6 to store ink vessel 3, and cap 2 which covers said ink pad 5 and can be freely placed on and removed from main body 1.
      <br/>
      Stored in the ink storage area 6 is ink vessel 3 which has vessel lid 16.
      <br/>
      Covering the exterior of said ink storage area 6 which stores said ink vessel 3 is bottom plug 4 which can be freely placed on and removed from main body 1.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Cap 2 and main body 1 are formed so as to cover ink pad 5 which is placed on main body 1.
      <br/>
      The tip 14 of the circumference of cap 2 is formed so as to engage with the recessed area 10 made on the circumference of main body 1 for capping purposes, and can be freely engaged and disengaged.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      FIGS. 1 through 3 show the design where cap 2 and main body 1 are fitted to each other; cap 2 has 2 flaps 8 and each of said 2 flaps has fitting notch 7; said fitting notch 7 freely slidably fits protrusion 9 made on main body; cap 2 and main body 1 maintain the fitted status of fitting notch 7 and protrusion 9 and do not separate from each other.
      <br/>
      When cap 2 is placed on and removed from main body 1, the orbit of the movement of cap 2 is restricted by fitting notch 7 and protrusion 9, making cap placement and removal easy, and keeping the cap from contacting the ink pad at placement and removal, preventing the soiling with ink of the interior of the cap.
      <br/>
      As is shown in FIG. 4, the angle  THETA  between cap 2 and main body 1 when cap 2 is fully open is at least 90 degrees and, desirably, 108 degrees.
    </p>
    <p num="37">There is no particular restriction on the material to be used for the main body or the cap, but plastic, either colored or transparent, is desirable.</p>
    <p num="38">
      Main body 1 has an ink storage area 6; ink storage area 6 stores ink vessel 3.
      <br/>
      There is no particular restriction on the size of ink vessel 3, but desirably, it should have the capacity to store the quantity of ink which enables at least 3 to 6 times of replenishment.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Covering the exterior of ink storage area 6 which stores ink vessel 3 is bottom plug 4 on the main body.
      <br/>
      Bottom plug 4 and main body 1 are formed so as to be freely engaged with and disengaged from each other by way of the engagement of the recessed area 11 made in the circumference of main body 1 with the tip 15 of bottom plug 4.
    </p>
    <p num="40">As described above, because the ink vessel-containing stamp pad of the present invention contains an ink vessel 3 which contains replenishment ink, ink vessel 3 can be removed from main body 1 by opening bottom plug 4 to replenish ink of the same color when ink in ink pad runs out while in use.</p>
    <p num="41">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="42">FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view showing another example of the stamp pad of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="43">
      The stamp pad shown in the figure has the opening 12 of ink vessel 3 and bottom plug 4a connected with each other by way of threading or by way of close engagement with each other with bottom plug 4a serving as the lid 13 for ink vessel 3.
      <br/>
      The remaining has the configuration similar to that of Embodiment Example 1.
    </p>
    <p num="44">With this embodiment example, ink vessel 3 can be removed from main body 1 together with bottom plug 4.</p>
    <p num="45">EXAMPLE 3</p>
    <p num="46">FIG. 6 is a cross-sectional view showing another example of the stamp pad of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="47">
      The stamp pad shown in the figure has cap 2a and main body 1 independent of each other and separable and removable from each other.
      <br/>
      The remaining has the configuration similar to that of Embodiment Example 1.
    </p>
    <p num="48">EXAMPLE 4</p>
    <p num="49">
      FIG. 10 is a side isometric view of a stamp pad 100 in accordance with another embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      The stamp pad 100 has a body 101 with a cavity 106 in which an ink vessel 103 is removably disposed.
      <br/>
      A bottom plug 104 covers the cavity 106 and can also seal the vessel 103, in a manner generally similar to the bottom plug 4a discussed above with reference to FIG. 5.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The stamp pad 100 can also include an ink pad 105 and a cap 102 that is removably coupled to the body 101 to cover the stamp pad 105.
      <br/>
