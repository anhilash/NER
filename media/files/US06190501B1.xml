      An electric double-layer capacitor includes a casing, a pair of porous electrodes disposed within the casing, a permeable separator sandwiched between both the porous electrodes, and an electrolytic liquid formed of an organic solvent, injected into the casing and permeating the porous electrodes and the separator.
      <br/>
      The separator is formed from an aggregate of cellulose fiber having a surface modified by an organic solvent thereby.
      <br/>
      A method of making a separator for an electric double-layer capacitor includes producing a cellulose fiber aggregate, forming a sheet of the cellulose fiber aggregate, modifying a surface of the cellulose fiber aggregate sheet by immersing the sheet in an organic solvent for a predetermined time period, drying the modified sheet, and cutting the dried sheets to form the separator of a desired size and shape.
      <br/>
      The cellulose fiber aggregate sheet may also be pretreated by immersing the sheet in an amphipathic solvent.
      <br/>
      Since the wettability of the cellulose fiber to the electrolytic liquid is improved, the permeation of the electrolytic liquid into the separator is improved, whereby a reduction in internal resistance of the electric double-layer capacitor is achieved.

      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to an electric double-layer capacitor.
      <br/>
      The present invention also relates to a separator for an electric double-layer capacitor and a method of making such a separator.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Double-layer electrochemical capacitors are energy storage devices.
      <br/>
      Charge storage in double-layer electrochemical capacitors is a surface phenomenon that occurs at the interface between electrode and electrolyte.
      <br/>
      Because such double-layer capacitors have an extremely large capacitance on the order of several Farads or more, there has been considerable interest in improving their other properties to make a commercially viable energy storage device.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Double-layer capacitors typically utilize a pair of electrodes having a separator interposed therebetween.
      <br/>
      The separator absorbs and retains the electrolyte thereby maintaining close contact between the electrolyte and the electrodes.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The most common type of separator material for such capacitors is paper.
      <br/>
      Conventional paper separators have particle impurities and void defects that may lead to poor DC leakage characteristics or failure of the capacitor.
      <br/>
      Conventional paper separators also have poor mechanical properties and are prone to tearing during manufacture of the capacitor.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Polymers are common alternatives to paper separators.
      <br/>
      Polymer separators, however, generally have an unacceptably high electrical resistance.
      <br/>
      The separator is typically the largest contributor to the capacitors internal series resistance between the anode and cathode.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a need for a separator having low series resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      There is, a conventional electric double-layer capacitor including a separator made of a non-woven fabric formed from a polypropylene fiber that is sandwiched between a pair of porous electrodes formed essentially of activated carbon.
      <br/>
      In this conventional double-layer capacitor, the electrodes and the separator are impregnated with an electrolytic liquid comprised of an organic solvent (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.63-187614, hereby incorporated by reference).
    </p>
    <p num="10">The reason why the organic solvent is used for the electrolytic liquid is that when the electric double-layer capacitor is used under a high voltage, electrolysis occurs especially when an aqueous electrolytic liquid such as sulfuric acid is used.</p>
    <p num="11">
      Another desirable property of separators is inhibiting self-discharge of the electric double-layer capacitor.
      <br/>
      More specifically, separators should obstruct the electrophoretic migration of charged carbon particles released from one of the electrodes toward the other electrode to reduce the electric neutralization.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, separators should be permeable to the electrolytic liquid to permit the migration of charged ions and have heat and chemical resistances.
    </p>
    <p num="12">However, known separators suffer from various problems and are susceptible to heat and chemicals especially when formed with polypropylene fibers.</p>
    <p num="13">
      Therefore, the present inventors have developed an electric double-layer capacitor including a separator which is formed from an ultra thin cellulose fiber, e.g., a bacterial cellulose aggregate (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.9-129509, hereby incorporated by reference).
      <br/>
      This separator has heat and chemical resistances because it is formed from the cellulose fiber.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      The present inventors have made further investigations concerning the electric double-layer capacitor.
      <br/>
      As a result, the inventors have found that the permeation of the electrolytic liquid into the separator is lower when an organic solvent is used as the electrolytic liquid as compared with other aqueous electrolytic liquids.
      <br/>
      This is because the organic solvent is hydrophobic, as compared with the aqueous electrolytic liquid, e.g., sulfuric acid, while a large number of OH groups on the surface of the cellulose fibers are hydrophilic.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Moreover, the degree of permeation of the electrolytic liquid into the separator is an important factor governing the resistance value of the separator because the electrolytic liquid is a medium for charged ions.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a need for increasing the permeation of the organic solvent into the separator when utilizing an organic solvent as the electrolytic liquid.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an electric double-layer capacitor, having an increased permeation of an organic solvent electrolyte into the separator as compared with the conventional art.</p>
    <p num="17">Another object of the present invention is to reduce the internal resistance of electric double-layer capacitors utilizing an organic solvent as the electrolyte.</p>
    <p num="18">Still another object of the invention is to improve the manufacturing methods for constructing a separator for use in a double-layer capacitor.</p>
    <p num="19">These objects are achieved by forming the separator with cellulose fibers having a modified surface.</p>
    <p num="20">These objects are further achieved by modifying the surface of a separator with an organic solvent.</p>
    <p num="21">To still further achieve the above objects, according to a first aspect and feature of the present invention, there is provided an electric double-layer capacitor including a casing, a pair of porous electrodes disposed within the casing, a permeable separator sandwiched between both the porous electrodes, and an electrolytic liquid which is formed of an organic solvent and which is provided in the casing and which permeates the porous electrodes and the separator, the separator being formed from an aggregate of cellulose fibers having a surface modified by an organic solvent.</p>
    <p num="22">
      With the above construction, the wettability of the cellulose fiber in the electrolytic liquid is improved, leading to excellent permeation of the electrolytic liquid into the separator, whereby a reduction in internal resistance of the electric double-layer capacitor is achieved.
      <br/>
      In addition, the separator is microporous and obstructs the electrophoretic migration of charged carbon particles as described above.
      <br/>
      Hence, the self-discharging of the electric double-layer capacitor is considerably inhibited.
      <br/>
      This is remarkable in a separator formed from bacterial cellulose.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The objects of the invention are even further achieved by providing a method of making a separator for an electric double-layer capacitor, including the steps of producing a cellulose fiber aggregate, forming a sheet of the cellulose fiber aggregate, modifying a surface of the cellulose fiber aggregate sheet by immersing the sheet in an organic solvent for a predetermined time period, drying the modified sheet, and cutting the dried sheets to form the separator of a desired size and shape.</p>
    <p num="24">The objects are still further achieved by pre-treating the cellulose fiber aggregate sheet by immersing the sheet in an amphipathic solvent.</p>
    <p num="25">
      Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter.
      <br/>
      However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="26">
      The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed description given hereinbelow and the accompanying drawings which are given by way of illustration only, and thus are not limitative of the present invention, and wherein:
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is an enlarged vertical sectional front view of an essential portion of an electric double-layer capacitor according to an embodiment of the invention; and
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a photomicrograph showing a state in which micro-fibrils of a bacterial cellulose are interlaced to form a mesh-like structure.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="27">
      In an electric double-layer capacitor 1 shown in FIG. 1, a metal casing 2 is formed of aluminum and includes a short cylindrical body 3 having a bottom and a lid plate 4 which closes an opening in the body 3.
      <br/>
      An elastic seal ring 5 made of e.g. rubber, a synthetic resin or the like is disposed between an end face of the opening in the body 3 and the lid plate 4, thereby sealing the opening in the body 3 and electrically insulating the body 3 and the lid plate 4 from each other.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The lid plate 4 is attached to the body 3 with a plurality of screws 6.
      <br/>
      An electrically insulating skin film 9 made of e.g. a synthetic resin is formed on an inner peripheral surface of each of screw-penetrating bores 7 in the lid plate 4 and an open peripheral edge of each of the screw-penetrating bores 7 which is to be in contact with a screw head 8.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Placed in the body 3 are a pair of disk-shaped porous electrodes 12 and 13 made essentially of activated carbon, and a quadrilateral separator 11 sandwiched between both the electrodes 12 and 13.
      <br/>
      A disk-shaped current collector 14 made of e.g. aluminum is superposed on the electrode 12 on the side of the lid plate 4.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The lamination of the electrodes 12 and 13 and the separator 11 is maintained by a conductive spring member 15 mounted between the current collector 14 and the lid plate 4.</p>
    <p num="31">An electrolytic liquid 16 preferably formed with an organic solvent is injected into the body 3 and impregnated into both the electrodes 12 and 13 and the separator 11.</p>
    <p num="32">The separator 11 has an outer peripheral surface which is formed so that it is in close contact with an inner surface of a bottom wall 10 of the body 3, to prevent electrophoretic migration of charged carbon particles released from one of the electrodes 12 or 13 to the other electrode 13 or 12.</p>
    <p num="33">
      In the casing 2, the lid plate 4 is connected to an anode of a power source, and the body 3 is connected to a cathode of the power source (or to a ground such as the earth).
      <br/>
      Therefore, the electrode 12 on the side of the lid plate 4 is an anode, while the electrode 13 on the side of the bottom wall 10 of the body 3 is a cathode.
    </p>
    <p num="34">The separator 11 is formed of a cellulose fiber aggregate having a surface modified by an organic solvent.</p>
    <p num="35">If the electric double-layer capacitor is formed in the above manner, the wettability of the cellulose fiber to the organic solvent electrolytic liquid 16 is improved and hence, the permeation of the electrolytic liquid 16 into the separator 11 is improved, whereby a reduction in internal resistance of the electric double-layer capacitor 1 is achieved.</p>
    <p num="36">
      A bacterial cellulose comprised of extremely thin micro-fibrils (e.g., having a diameter of 0.1  MU m or less) is most suitable as the cellulose fiber.
      <br/>
      The bacterial cellulose is produced as a gelled thick film on a surface of a culture medium by a bacterium of a strain that metabolizes ethanol to acetic acid (commonly known as an acetic acid bacterium).
      <br/>
      A preferred bacterium is at least one of bacterium strains each belonging to a genus related to the following group: Acetobacter, Rhizobium, Agrobacterium, Pseudomonas, Alcaligenes, Sarcina, Achromobacter, Aerobacter, and Azotobacter and variant strains induced from the bacterium strains.
    </p>
    <p num="37">The bacterial cellulose has the following characteristics: (1) It is a substantially pure cellulose having a purity of 95% or more and has heat and chemical resistances; (2) It can absorb an extremely large amount of a liquid as large as 60 to 700 times the dry weight; (3) It has an extremely wide surface area (as large as 200 times that of a wood pulp); (4) It has a strong adsorbability to fine particles; (5) It has a high moldability and an excellent shape retention; (6) It has a very high elastic modulus and a very high tensile strength (wherein the elastic modulus is of about 30 GPa, which is 4 times that of a usual organic fiber, and the tensile strength is 5 times that of a polyethylene and a polyvinyl chloride), and the like.</p>
    <p num="38">
      As shown in FIG. 2, the separator 11 has a mesh-like structure in which micro-fibrils of the bacterial cellulose are interlaced at random.
      <br/>
      In this mesh-like structure, the diameter d of each of mesh openings is smaller than each of the charged carbon particles and therefore, is in a range of d &lt;= 1  MU m, preferably, in a range of d &lt;= 0.5  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The preferred thickness t of the separator 11 formed of the bacterial cellulose is in a range of 1  MU m &lt;= t &lt;= 100  MU m, and even more preferably, in a range of 5  MU m &lt;= t &lt;= 20  MU m. If the thickness t is smaller than 1  MU m, the mechanical strength of the separator is decreased, resulting in a possibility that the separator 11 may be damaged during handling thereof.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if t&gt;100  MU m, the distance of migration of the charged ions is increased and hence, the internal resistance of the electric double-layer capacitor 1 is increased.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The production of the bacterial cellulose is carried out according to a common bacteria-cultivating process.
      <br/>
      More specifically, at least one of the above-described bacterium strains are sown on a synthetic culture medium including a carbon substrate, a nitrogen source, an organic trace-nutrient and minerals, and left to stand or gently agitated and shaken.
    </p>
    <p num="41">Glucose, sucrose, maltose, starch hydrolyzate, molasses or the like may be used as the carbon substrate, and ethanol, acetic acid, citric acid or the like may be used alone or along with such saccharide.</p>
    <p num="42">The nitrogen source may be an ammonium salt such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride and ammonium phosphate; an inorganic nitrogen source, such as nitrate; or an organic nitrogen source such as a protein decomposition product (e.g., a polypepton and a bactopepton) or urea.</p>
    <p num="43">
      An amino acid, vitamin, a fatty acid, nucleic acid or the like may be used as the organic trace-nutrient, and peptone, Casamino acids, yeast extract, soybean protein hydrolyzate or the like which contain them may be also used.
      <br/>

    <p num="44">A phosphate, a magnesium salt, a calcium salt, an iron salt, a manganese salt or the like may be used as the mineral.</p>
    <p num="45">The culturing conditions may be those for the usual process, and for example, at pH of 5 to 9, at a temperature of 20 to 40 (degree)  C., and for 4 to 7 days.</p>
    <p num="46">The bacterial cellulose produced in the above-described manner is a hydrogel in the form of a thick film (or a pellet).</p>
    <p num="47">In addition to the bacterial cellulose, a plant cellulose fiber such as wood pulp may be used as the cellulose fiber.</p>
    <p num="48">
      To produce the separator 11, a process is employed which involves first subjecting a cellulose fiber aggregate in a water-absorbed state or in a hydrated state (e.g. a hydrogel of a bacterial cellulose or the disintegrated product thereof or a vegetable cellulose fiber aggregate in a water-containing state) to a substituting treatment using an organic solvent to exchange the water and the organic solvent, thereby modifying the surface of the cellulose fiber.
      <br/>
      The aggregate is then dried, while at the same time, forming it into a sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The organic solvents which may be used for the substituting treatment include methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol, ethyl acetate, acetone, benzene, toluene, diethyl ether, n-hexane, n-propanol, n-butanol, propylene carbonate, acetic acid, carbon tetrachloride, N-methylacetoamide, ethylene carbonate and the like.
      <br/>
      They may be used alone or in the form of a mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      In order to further reduce the internal resistance of the electric double-layer capacitor 1, the organic solvent should have a relative dielectric constant .di-elect cons. &lt;= 80, that is smaller than the relative dielectric constant .di-elect cons. of water (equal to 80.10).
      <br/>
      Even more preferable is an organic solvent that has a relative dielectric constant .di-elect cons. &lt;= 10.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The substituting treatment is carried out by immersing the cellulose fiber aggregate in the water-absorbed state or the like into the organic solvent for a predetermined time.
      <br/>
      In this case, when the hydrophobic nature of the organic solvent for the substituting treatment is strong, the cellulose fiber aggregate may be pre-treated by immersing it in an amphipathic solvent such as acetone, ethanol and the like prior to the substituting treatment.
      <br/>
      With such a pre-treatment, the substituting treatment with such organic solvents can be more readily achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="52">To improve the moldability of the separator 11, a disintegrated or homogenized product of the bacterial cellulose may be obtained by disintegrating and dispersing the hydrogel with a high-speed homogenizer.</p>
    <p num="53">
      It should be noted that even if the cellulose fiber aggregate in the dried state is subjected to the substituting treatment with the organic solvent, the surface of the cellulose fiber is not modified.
      <br/>
      However, if the dried cellulose fiber aggregate is subjected to a water absorbing treatment, the modification of the surface of the cellulose fiber by such substituting treatment can be achieved.

      (3) 40 ml of synthetic culturing medium was placed into a petri dish having a diameter of 9 cm and a depth of 2 cm. 10% by volume of an acetic acid bacterium strain (e.g. Acetobacter xylinum, IFO13693 strain) grown at 30 (degree)  C. for 7 days on a culturing medium similar to the above-described synthetic culturing medium was added to the synthetic culturing medium.
      <br/>
      (4) The settled culture was carried out at 30 (degree)  C. for 7 days to proliferate the acetic acid bacterium and to secrete a hydrogel of a bacterial cellulose in the form of a thick film.
      <br/>
      (5) The hydrogel was subjected to a cleaning treatment by immersing it into a 5% solution of NaOH at room temperature for 24 hours.

      The substituting treatment was carried out under conditions where the sheet was immersed in the organic solvent at room temperature for about 30 minutes.

      In this case, the organic solvents for the examples 3 and 10 to 15 have a strong hydrophobic nature and hence, a pretreatment which involves immersing each of the sheets in acetone at room temperature for 30 minutes was carried out prior to the substituting treatment with the organic solvent.

      <br/>
      To produce the electrodes 12 and 13, steps of kneading a mixture for one hour by a two-screw kneading machine, rolling the mixture and molding the mixture were sequentially used.

      In table 5, if the dried sheet is subjected to the water absorbing treatment as in the examples 1 to 6, a modification effect can be achieved by the subsequent organic solvent treatment.
      <br/>
      In this case, it can be mentioned that in order to provide a decrease in internal resistance of the electric double-layer capacitor, acetone, the organic solvent should contain no water.
      <br/>
      If the water absorbing treatment is not carried out prior to the organic solvent treatment, as in the example 7, the modification effect by the organic solvent treatment cannot be achieved and hence, the internal resistance of the electric double-layer capacitor 1 is higher than that of the example 8 made by the dried sheet.

      With the inventive separator, the wettability of the cellulose fiber to the electrolytic liquid is improved and hence, the permeability of the electrolytic liquid into the separator is improved.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to lower the internal resistance of the electric double-layer capacitor.
