    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a roof for general house using combination solar battery and roof members and to a mounting method thereof.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to a roof constructed by mounting roof panels in the vertical direction, for example, like a roof of the batten seam structure (a vertical-roofing roof) and to a mounting method thereof and presents proposals on a vertical-roofing roof to solve specific problems arising in the combination structure of solar battery and roof panel and on a mounting method thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">There are mainly two ways for placing a solar battery on a roof: one of them is a method for mounting the solar battery on an existing roof; the other is a method for laying the solar battery itself as a roof.</p>
    <p num="5">
      In the former, the solar battery is installed by use of some frame on the existing roof, and conventional solar battery modules can thus be used as they are.
      <br/>
      However, the installation cost is high and the appearance is poor.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the latter method is drawing attention recently.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      As for the latter method, a variety of mounting methods of roof are known for long in general.
      <br/>
      The conventional mounting methods are classified roughly into flat roofing, standing seam roofing, batten seam roofing, corrugated sheet roofing, folded sheet roofing, horizontal roofing, tile roofing, weld roofing, and so on.
      <br/>
      Among these, the folded sheet roofing and corrugated sheet roofing are normally used for factories and warehouses, and most of mounting methods for general house are tile roofing (including plain tile roofing), batten seam roofing, horizontal roofing, and modifications thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Prior art examples of such methods using the solar battery for general house include Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 5-55618 (tile roofing), Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 59-152670 (horizontal roofing), Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 7-302924 (horizontal roofing), Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 7-211932 (batten seam roofing), U.S. Pat. No. 5,092,939 (batten seam roofing), and U.S. Pat. No. 4,189,881 (vertical roofing).</p>
    <p num="8">
      FIG. 13 and FIG. 14 show the batten seam roof structure described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 7-211932, which is called batten seam roofing with batten, because a batten is interposed between roof panels.
      <br/>
      The roofing method is carried out as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="9">(1) Rafters not illustrated are mounted on purlins not illustrated.</p>
    <p num="10">(2) Sheathing roof boards 101 are placed on and/or between the rafters and are fixed to the rafters by nails or the like.</p>
    <p num="11">(3) Underlayment 102 is laid over the sheathing roof boards.</p>
    <p num="12">(4) Spacers S are fixed onto the underlayment 102 with nails N.</p>
    <p num="13">(5) Battens M are fixed onto the spacers S with nails N.</p>
    <p num="14">(6) Then combination solar battery and roof panels 103, processed by folding, are placed on steps of the battens M and spacers S and the wiring work is carried out with connection connectors 106 on the back surface side.</p>
    <p num="15">(7) After completion of wiring, caps 107 are put over the battens M so as to pinch the head of each batten M and the upright portions of the folded portions of the roof panels on the both sides thereof.</p>
    <p num="16">(8) Then the combination solar battery and roof panels 103, together with the caps 107, are fixed to the battens M by use of tacks R as shown in FIG. 14.</p>
    <p num="17">The foregoing is the batten seam roofing method with batten.</p>
    <p num="18">FIG. 15 shows another typical roof structure of batten seam roofing, as also described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,189,881, which is called batten seam roofing without batten, because the battens are excluded from the above-stated batten seam roofing.</p>
    <p num="19">(1) The rafters not illustrated are mounted on the purlins not illustrated.</p>
    <p num="20">(2) The sheathing roof boards 101 are placed on (between) the rafters.</p>
    <p num="21">(3) The underlayment not illustrated is laid over the sheathing roof boards 101.</p>
    <p num="22">(4) Roof panels 103 with the respective solar batteries mounted thereon are fixed by use of through retaining clips 104 in such a way that while each retaining clip catches the upright portions of the roof panels, it is fixed to the sheathing roof board with nails N.</p>
    <p num="23">(5) Wires C guided from the back surfaces of the roof panels are set in spaces in the through retaining clips 104.</p>
    <p num="24">(6) Caps 107 are put over the through retaining clips 104 to be fixed.</p>
    <p num="25">The foregoing is the batten seam roofing without batten.</p>
    <p num="26">
      The mounting methods of roof materials as described above, however, require the wiring work in addition to the laying work of roof materials conventionally conducted, which complicates the mounting work and which thus poses a problem of increase in the construction cost.
      <br/>
      In the case of the mounting as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 7-211932, there is no way for measuring the output of each solar battery.
      <br/>
      If some of solar batteries became faulty, it would not be easy to find out the faulty batteries.
      <br/>
      Even if they were found out, replacement of individual solar batteries would involve great difficulties, thus posing a problem in maintenance.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In contrast with it, in the batten seam roofing without batten as illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,189,881, the wiring can be put between the retaining clip and the cover and even after completion of mounting, the wiring part can be exposed by removing the cover.
      <br/>
      It thus has a merit of easy maintenance.
      <br/>
      However, the roof mounting construction also involves the wire connection work and the mounting is also complicated.
      <br/>
      Especially, since the work on the roof costs high, simplification of work has been demanded in order to realize the reduction of cost.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,092,939 discloses a roof structure in which individual roof panels 103 are fixed on roof frame members H shown in present FIGS. 16 and 17. Wiring parts C are laid below the roof panels 103.
      <br/>
      Such wiring complicates the mounting process and impedes maintenance.
      <br/>
      Unlike the present invention, the roof structure of U.S. Pat. No. 5,092,939 exhibits poor wind endurance.
    </p>
    <p num="29">The present invention presents a further progress in the above-stated ideas in view of these problems and thus provides a practical vertical-roofing roof and a mounting method thereof to simplify the work at a working site, that are low in the construction cost, that can reduce work errors, that permit measurement or replacement of each module unit after mounted, and that are excellent in maintainability and in wind endurance.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="30">For achieving the above object, the present invention employed the following means.</p>
    <p num="31">(1) A plurality of combination solar battery and roof panels are fixed onto a fixing member by fixtures with clearance between the plurality of combination solar battery and roof panels.</p>
    <p num="32">(2) A roof structural member is used as the fixing member.</p>
    <p num="33">(3) Output terminals of solar batteries of the combination solar battery and roof panels are connected with each other in the clearance.</p>
    <p num="34">The following functional effects can be expected by the above means according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="35">
      (1) By employing the arrangement of assembly unit, the installation work and the electric wiring work, which was conventionally conducted at the working site, can be carried out in the factory, which can greatly decrease the expensive mounting work at the working site.
      <br/>
      Despite the assembly structure, the individual combination solar battery and roof panels can be removed easily even after mounted, by removing the fixtures to the stationary members, which thus enhances maintainability.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The problem of poor wind endurance arising with such mounting and with enlargement of roof member is also solved by the assembly unit according to the present invention, because the assembly unit can be fixed to the roof structural member in the clearance between the combination solar battery and roof panels.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the wind endurance can be maintained at the same level as before.
    </p>
    <p num="37">(2) By the arrangement wherein the assembly unit is integrally coupled with the roof structural member, no new members are necessary in the building for forming the roof, and thus the roof can be constructed at low cost.</p>
    <p num="38">
      (3) By the arrangement wherein the wiring members are collected in the clearance between the vertical-roofing roof panels, maintainability after mounting is enhanced.
      <br/>
      In addition, since electric wires are preliminarily connected in the factory, no electric connection member is necessary between the combination solar battery and roof panels, which can decrease the number of wiring members.

    <p num="50">(3) The underlayment 102 is laid over the sheathing roof boards 101.</p>
    <p num="51">(4) The first unit 100 is temporarily placed near the edge of roof on the underlayment, using a lifting device such as a crane.</p>
    <p num="52">(5) The caps 107 of the unit 100 thus mounted are removed and long drill screws 108 or the like are screwed from the top of the joining/fixing members 105 into the rafters 110 below the sheathing roof boards 101.</p>
    <p num="53">(6) After the unit 100 is fixed, the caps 107 are again put and fixed there.</p>
    <p num="54">(7) For interconnection between units 100, another unit 100 to be coupled is fixed in the same procedure as in (5) while adjusting the clearance by the retaining clips 104 for use in interconnection between units 100.</p>
    <p num="55">(8) After fixation, the coupling part is fixed by the retaining clips 104 and wiring is made at the coupling part.</p>
    <p num="56">(9) The coupling part is fixed to the rafter 110 below the sheathing roof board 101 in the same procedure as in (5) from the top of the coupling part.</p>
    <p num="57">(10) The cap 107 is put and fixed onto the coupling part.</p>
    <p num="58">(11) The procedures of (7) to (10) are repeated, thereby successively mounting the vertical-roofing roof.</p>
    <p num="59">(12) After the mounting, the horizontal beams are removed, thus completing the mounting of the vertical-roofing roof.</p>
    <p num="60">For connection between units 100, an output portion of each unit 100 has a connection connector 106, as before, and the wiring work can be conducted without any Jig by interconnecting the connectors 106 on the roof.</p>
    <p num="61">
      Since the present embodiment can greatly decrease the work at the working site, the construction cost can be reduced remarkably.
      <br/>
      After the roof is constructed, the roof panels can be replaced one by one in the same manner as in the conventional roof constructed of single roof panels.
      <br/>
      As for replacement of roof panel due to failure of solar battery, the entire roof does not have to be removed, different from the conventional assembly panel (U.S. Pat. No. 5,092,939).
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Further, since the units 100 are directly fixed onto the roof structural members from the top of the joining/fixing members 105 of unit 100, the problem of poor wind endurance, which has been the problem in the conventional assembly panels, does not arise, because the strength comparable to that of the conventional roofs is achieved.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the present embodiment realizes highly practical roof mounting.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      In addition, by the arrangement wherein the wire members are collected in the clearance between adjacent roof panels 103, maintainability after mounting is enhanced.
      <br/>
      Since the electric wires are preliminarily wired in the factory, no electric connection member is necessary between roof panels 103, which decreases the number of wiring members, thus achieving an extra effect to realize low cost.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The vertical-roofing combination solar battery and roof unit according to the present embodiment was described as to the mounting method thereof, based on the premise that the roof is one of a house constructed by the framework construction method, but the present invention is not limited to the framework construction method.
      <br/>
      It is needless to mention that the present invention can also be applied, for example, to houses constructed by the two-by-four construction method, prefabricated houses using light-weight steel frames, buildings using reinforced concrete, and so on.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      The present invention is ready for the maintenance specific to the solar battery.
      <br/>
      The present invention also has the effect of preventing errors upon mounting, which could occur because of the complicated wiring work, and the effect of reducing the material cost because of the decrease in the number of wiring members.
    </p>
    <p num="66">Application to Air Circulation System</p>
    <p num="67">
      Since the present invention can be realized in the structure having a draft layer capable of introducing the air to between the sheathing roof boards 101 and the roof panels 103, it can be applied to an air circulation system of house as shown in FIG. 12. In FIG. 12, arrows indicate the flow of air.
      <br/>
      In the cold season, the air taken through the eaves 150 flows through the draft layer 151 to be heated by thermal conduction from the roof panels 103 of roof unit 100 and the heated air is taken into room 153 via the ridge 152 to be used for heating.
      <br/>
      A heat accumulating device may be provided below the floor.
      <br/>
      For forcing the air to circulate, a fan F is provided midway of the air flow passage.
      <br/>
      In the hot season the air taken through the eaves 150 is discharged from exhaust port 154 to the outside to enhance the heat insulating function of roof, thereby keeping the environment in the room 153 comfortable.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Power generated in the roof units 100 is supplied through DC combiner box C to inverter I. A solar electric power generation system is constructed in this way.
      <br/>
      The power converted by the inverter I is supplied to the fan F or to the other loads 155 in the home.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      In the present embodiment the clearance exists between the roof panels 103 and the sheathing roof boards 101, and horizontal beams thinner than the clearance space may thus be provided in the clearance.
      <br/>
      Since the horizontal beams can prevent deformation of unit 100, the removable beams employed in the present embodiment thus become unnecessary.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the work on the roof can be decreased further.
      <br/>
      It is also needless to mention that the removable beams are not necessary as long as the fixing members alone can assure the strength enough to resist deformation upon carriage and mounting.
    </p>

    <p num="71">
      FIG. 5 shows an example of electric wiring in the case of use of the roof units of the present invention.

      <br/>
      A breaker is provided before the connection point of the parallel connection of each solar battery string.
      <br/>
      If a certain solar battery string becomes faulty, the solar battery string will be electrically disconnected and maintenance can be made.
      <br/>
      In practice the junction boxes are located on the flanges of roof panel 103.
      <br/>
      If the junction boxes are arranged in symmetry with respect to a vertical line, serial or parallel connection can be selected freely depending upon the arrangement of roof panels, which is useful.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 140 denotes the conventional roof panels, called dummy panels, and the dummy panels are mounted in incomplete portions, which cannot be divided by the dimensions of roof and the dimensions of unit, whereby the appearance and the flashing process of edge can be achieved.

    <p num="131">
      The fabrication method of the combination solar battery and roof unit of the present embodiment will be described referring to FIG. 6 and FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment the sheathing roof board 101 of a flat plate shape is used as the joining/fixing member.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      In the factory two or more combination solar battery and roof panels 103 are fixed to the sheathing roof board 101 of a fixed size with underlayment 102 thereon with clearance by use of through retaining clips 104 and screws 111, thus forming an assembly.
      <br/>
      Next, the connectors 106 of lead wires 121 taken out of the junction boxes 120 are connected in the clearance between adjacent roof panels 103.
      <br/>
      Finally, the caps 107 are laid thereon, thus completing the unit.
    </p>
    <p num="133">Mounting Method</p>
    <p num="134">The units are carried all together on a truck or the like to the working site and are mounted in the following procedures.</p>
    <p num="135">(1) The rafters 110 are attached to the purlins 109.</p>
    <p num="136">(2) On the rafters 110, the first unit is temporarily placed at the edge of roof by use of the lifting device such as the crane.</p>
    <p num="137">(3) The caps 107 of the unit thus mounted are removed and long drill screws 108 or the like are screwed from the top of the sheathing roof board 101 into the rafters 110 to directly secure the unit to the rafters 110.</p>
    <p num="138">(4) After fixation of unit, the caps 107 are again put in position and fixed there.</p>
    <p num="139">(5) For connection between units, the upright portion of roof panel 103 of the unit to be joined is fixed in the same procedure as in (3) while adjusting the clearance by the through retaining clips 104 used for coupling between units.</p>
    <p num="140">(6) After the fixation, the area below the coupling part is again covered by underlayment 102.</p>
    <p num="141">(7) The roof panel 103 at the edge of each unit adjacent to the pertinent unit is coupled and fixed by the through retaining clips 104.</p>
    <p num="142">(8) The roof panel is fixed to the rafter 110 from above the coupling part in the same procedure as in (3).</p>
    <p num="143">(9) The cap 107 is laid over the coupling part and fixed there.</p>
    <p num="144">(10) Mounting of the vertical-roofing roof is completed by repeating the procedures of (5) to (9).</p>
    <p num="145">
      In the present embodiment, since the sheathing roof board 101 is also included in the unit, the finish work of roof mounting can be carried out immediately after mounting of rafters 110.
      <br/>
      This can further decrease the work at the working site and can decrease the construction cost more remarkably.
    </p>
    <p num="146">Although the present embodiment is described in the arrangement that the underlayment 102 preliminarily laid in the unit has the same size as the sheathing roof board 101, the underlayment 102 may be set a little larger than the sheathing roof board 101, which allows the underlayment 102 newly added in the step (6) to be omitted.</p>
    <p num="147">
      Further, if the rafters 102 are also incorporated in the unit and if the joint portions between the purlins 109 and the rafters 110 are located in the clearance, the steps can be decreased further.
      <br/>
      In further expansion, it is also possible to incorporate the purlins 109 in the unit and to fix the unit to pole plates.
    </p>
    <p num="148">Embodiment 3</p>
    <p num="149">
      The fabrication method of the combination solar battery and roof unit of the present embodiment will be described referring to FIG. 8 and FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      The present embodiment is an example in which the present invention is applied to modified vertical roofing from the conventional batten seam roofing, and the present embodiment enhances flashing by employing the cross-sectional shape of retaining clip 104 and roof panel 103 as shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      In addition, the roof panel 103 is provided with horizontal ribs 132, thereby enabling to realize enhancement of wind endurance and the appearance in the design like tile roofing.
      <br/>
      The ribs 132 may not be formed only in the horizontal direction, but may also in the vertical direction.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment the connecting part of sheathing roof board 101 is provided with a tenon for coupling, which increases the connecting force between sheathing roof boards 105 and which facilitates installation of unit.
    </p>
    <p num="150">
      In FIG. 9, each connector is drawn out from the junction box 121 on the bottom of roof panel 103, is guided through a through hole 133 of retaining clip 104, and is connected with another connector of adjacent roof panel 103 in the clearance between the roof panels.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 111 designates a screw for fixing the retaining clip 104 to the sheathing roof board 101.
      <br/>
      Numeral 112 denotes an opening portion for a drill screw to pass in fixing the unit to the rafter.
      <br/>
      When the unit is mounted, the drill screw serves as a cap to again effect flashing of the opening portion.
      <br/>
      Since the roof panel 103 of the present embodiment is joined to the retaining clip 104 preliminarily screwed to the sheathing roof board 101 with a single motion, there is an effect of increasing the productivity of assembly unit.
    </p>
    <p num="151">Embodiment 4</p>
    <p num="152">
      FIG. 10 and FIG. 11 show a modification of Embodiment 3, which uses combination solar battery and caps 107' in addition.
      <br/>
      In a combination solar battery and cap 107' solar battery elements 135 are placed in the top surface and electric contacts 134 in the bottom surface.
      <br/>
      In correspondence thereto, the roof panels 103 also have electric contacts 134.
      <br/>
      Since electric connection is completed by snapping the cap 107' onto the roof panels, the present embodiment has a merit of greatly simplifying the wiring work and realizes a deeper design to make the appearance of design or the like look like a corrugated sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      By also providing the cap 107' with solar batteries, the light receiving area of solar batteries can be increased and there is thus an effect of increasing the quantity of power generation of roof.
      <br/>
      In addition, a design of expanding the width of through retaining clip 104 can be realized without decrease in the quantity of power generation, which improves the workability during fixing of the unit to the roof.
