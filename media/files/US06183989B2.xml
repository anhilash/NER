    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a process for making desired polypeptides in yeast by expressing fusion polypeptides containing a monobasic protease processing site.</p>
    <p num="3">Background of the Invention</p>
    <p num="4">
      Yeast organisms produce a number of proteins synthesized intracellularly, but having a function outside the cell.
      <br/>
      These extracellular proteins are referred to as secreted proteins.
      <br/>
      Initially the secreted proteins are expressed inside the cell in the form of a precursor or a pre-protein containing a pre-peptide sequence ensuring effective direction of the expressed product (into the secretory pathway of the cell) across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
      <br/>
      The pre-sequence, normally referred to as a signal peptide, is generally cleaved off from the desired product during translocation.
      <br/>
      Once having entered the secretory pathway, the protein is transported to the Golgi apparatus.
      <br/>
      From the Golgi apparatus the proteins are distributed to the plasma membrane, lysosomes and secretory vesicles.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Several approaches have been suggested for the expression and secretion in yeast of proteins heterologous to yeast.
      <br/>
      European published patent application No. 116 201 describes a process by which proteins heterologous to yeast are expressed, processed and secreted by a yeast host transformed by an expression vehicle harboring DNA encoding the desired protein, a leader sequence and a processing signal, preparing a culture of the transformed organism, growing the culture and recovering the protein from the culture medium, the leader sequence being a yeast  ALPHA -factor leader sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The Saccharomyces cerevisiae MF ALPHA 1 ( ALPHA -factor) is synthesized as a pre-pro form of 165 amino acids comprising a signal or prepeptide of 19 amino acids followed by a "leader" or propeptide of 64 amino acids, encompassing three N-linked glycosylation sites followed by (LysArg((Asp/Glu)Ala)2-3  ALPHA -factor)4 (Elements et al., Gene, 106, 1991, pp. 267-272).
      <br/>
      This publication describes certain modifications of the KEX2 site with the purpose of improving the KEX2 processing.
    </p>
    <p num="7">The signal-leader part of the pre-pro MF ALPHA 1 has been widely employed to obtain synthesis and secretion of heterologous proteins in S. cerevisiae.</p>
    <p num="8">
      European published patent application No. 301 669 describes a process by which leader-sequences, in particular  ALPHA -factor leaders, are directing the secretion of expressed heterologous polypeptides in yeast.
      <br/>
      EP 324 274 discloses an improvement in the efficiency of expression and secretion of heterologous polypeptides by truncating the glycosylated a-factor leader sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The secreted polypeptides are routed so as to be exposed to a proteolytic processing system which cleaves the peptide bond at the carboxy end of two consecutive basic amino acid residues.
      <br/>
      This enzymatic activity is in S. cerevisiae encoded by the KEX2 gene (Julius, D. A. et al., GENE, 37, 1884b, pp. 1075).
      <br/>
      Processing of the product by the KEX2 protease is necessary for the secretion of active S. cerevisiae mating factor  ALPHA 1 (MF ALPHA 1 or  ALPHA -factor) whereas KEX2 is not involved in the secretion of S. cerevisiae mating factor a.

    <p num="10">

    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In Applied Microbiological Biotechnology 35 (1991) 771-776, Seeboth et al., describes a mechanism by which a-leader bound polypeptides in yeast are processed by soluble KEX2 in vitro, wherein KEX2 was made soluble by modifying the KEX2 gene, and thereby presenting a method of increasing the site-specific processing in vitro.
      <br/>
      In GENE, 170 (1996) 107-112, Kjeldsen et al. describe that insertion of a spacer peptide following the dibasic KEX2 site, creating a N-terminal extension of the polypeptide precursor, greatly facilitates the KEX2 processing and subsequently improves the yield of the polypeptide precursor.
    </p>
    <p num="12">A recognized problem with the above described processes is that the level of secretion may be too low or the proteolytic processing may be incorrect or incomplete resulting in lower yields of the desired product.</p>

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      This invention relates to a process for making a desired polypeptide in yeast by expressing and secretion of a leader bound polypeptide which does not contain a KEX2 processing site.

      The leader bound polypeptide comprises the native a-factor leader peptide and the desired polypeptide linked by a monobasic processing site and possibly a spacer peptide.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="29">
      The leader peptide (LP) used in the present invention is preferably the native  ALPHA -factor leader peptide, that is the propeptide of MF ALPHA 1(1-83) (SEQ ID NO: 1).
      <br/>
      In MF ALPHA 1 (1-83), residues 1-19 form the so-called pre sequence or signal peptide and residues 20-83 form the so-called pro sequence or leader peptide.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The native  ALPHA -factor leader peptide may by slightly modified by well known techniques whereby a few amino acid residues are deleted or substituted with other amino acid residues.
      <br/>
      The leader may thus be modified at the C terminal end where from 2 to 5 amino acid residues may be substituted with other amino acid residues to improve processing at the processing site PS.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the modified leader sequence will be more than 85% homologous and more preferably more than 90% homologous to the native a-factor leader peptide based on amino acid composition.
    </p>
    <p num="31">In a preferred embodiment the last two amino acid residues at the C terminal end of the  ALPHA -factor leader peptide are substituted with Met-Ala.</p>
    <p num="32">
      The signal peptide used in the present invention can be any peptide ensuring safe and efficient guidance of the expressed polypeptide when entering the secretory pathway.
      <br/>
      The term "signal peptide" must be understood as a pre-peptide sequence having the function of safely directing the expressed polypeptide across the membrane of the endoplasmatic reticulum where the signal peptide is cleaved off during translocation.
      <br/>
      The signal peptide may be homologous to yeast or it can be heterologous to yeast.
      <br/>
      It may be a naturally occurring or synthetic signal sequence.
      <br/>
      The signal peptide is situated N-terminally of the leader sequence and is predominantly hydrophobic in nature.
      <br/>
      Preferably SP is a DNA sequence encoding a a-factor signal peptide.
      <br/>
      Suitable other signal peptides are the yeast aspartic protease 3 signal peptide, the mouse salivary amylase signal peptide, the carboxypeptidase signal peptide and the yeast BAR1 signal peptide.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      According to present invention cleavage of the leader bound polypeptide at the processing site PS is done by means of a protease specific for monobasic processing sites (Lys, Arg).
      <br/>
      Examples of such proteases are trypsin, Achromobacter lyticus protease I, Enterokinase, and Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease.
      <br/>
      A preferred protease is yeast aspartyl protease 3 (YAP3).
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The cleavage of the leader bound polypeptide from the leader peptide may be conducted in vitro after secretion of the leader bound polypeptide.
      <br/>
      The cleavage may be conducted by addition of a suitable protease to the culture medium followed by isolation of the desired polypeptide.
      <br/>
      As an alternative, the leader bound polypeptide may be isolated from the culture medium and cleaved after isolation.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Alternatively, the cleavage takes place in vivo by co-expression of a protease specific for the monobasic protease site PS.</p>
    <p num="36">
      The desired polypeptide may be any polypeptide capable of being expressed in a yeast cell and may be selected from the group consisting of aprotinin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor or other protease inhibitors, Insulin-like growth factor I or II, human or bovine growth hormone, Interleukin, tissue plasminogen activator, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1, Factor VII, Factor VIII, Factor XIII, platelet-derived growth factor and industrial enzymes, and any functional analogue thereof.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the polypeptides are insulin, insulin analogues, precursors of insulin and insulin analogues, insulin like growth factors, or functional analogues thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="37">The polypeptides may also be the smaller human peptides of the proglucagon family, such as glucagon GLP-1, GLP-2 and GRPP including truncated forms, such as GLP-1 (7-37) and GLP-1 (7-36) or functional analogues thereof, such as GLP1*.</p>
    <p num="38">The term "functional analogue" indicates a polypeptide functionally equivalent to the native polypeptide, but having a modification compared to the native polypeptide.</p>
    <p num="39">
      The functional analogue may differ from the native polypeptide by having one or more amino acids deleted, truncated, substituted, or inserted.
      <br/>
      Amino acids may be deleted, truncated, substituted, or inserted within the sequence, or at the C-terminal end, or at the N-terminal end, or at both, or all of the above sites.
    </p>
    <p num="40">An example of an insulin precursor is MI3 with the structure B(1-29)-Ala-Ala-Lys-A(1-21) where B(1-29) is the B chain of human insulin lacking the amino acid residue in position B(30) and A(1-21) is the A chain of human insulin.</p>
    <p num="41">
      The function of the spacer peptide X is to optimize the cleavage of the leader from the desired polypeptide at the processing site PS.
      <br/>
      It is of importance that neither the leader peptide (LP) nor the spacer peptide (X) contain a KEX2 processing.
      <br/>
      Without being bound by theory it is believed that the presence of a KEX2 site in the leader peptide or in the spacer peptide would reduce the yield of secreted product due to premature cleavage in the secretory pathway.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The spacer sequence X may be any polypeptide sequence with up to 10 amino acid residues (n=10) as long as it does not contain a KEX2 site or together with the monobasic processing site PS or the leader peptide LP forms a KEX2 site.
      <br/>
      X will preferably contain 7 (n=7) and more preferably 2 (n=2) amino acid residues.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment X is Lys-Glu-Ala-Glu-Ala-Glu-Ala (SEQ ID NO: 8) or Lys-Glu.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      In another preferred embodiment n is zero meaning that there is no spacer sequence between the leader (LP) and the monobasic processing site (PS).
      <br/>
      In that case, the C terminal end of the leader peptide must not constitute a KEX2 site or a KEX2 like site nor must the C-terminal amino acid residue together with PS form a KEX2 site.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The yeast cell used in the present process may be selected from the group consisting of Saccharomyces uvae, Saccharomyces kluyveri, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces uvarum, Kluyveromyces lactis, Hansenula polymorpha, Pichia pastoris, Pichia methanolica, Pichia kluyveri, Yarrowia lipolytica, Candida sp., Candida utilis, Candida cacaoi, Geotrichum sp. and Geotrichum fermentans.
      <br/>
      The preferred yeast strain is Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
    </p>
    <p num="45">The yeast cell may be transformed with a gene encoding a protease specific for monobasic processing sites, thereby obtaining a co-expression of protease and the desired polypeptide.</p>
    <p num="46">
      In accordance with the present invention there may be employed conventional molecular biology, microbiology, and recombinant DNA techniques within the skill of the art.
      <br/>
      Such techniques are explained fully in the literature.
      <br/>
      See, e.g., Sambrook, Fritsch &amp; Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. The DNA constructs may be prepared synthetically by established standard methods, e.g., the phosphoamidite method described by S. L. Beaucage and M. H. Caruthers, Tetrahedron Letters 22, 1981, pp. 1859-1869, or the method described by Matthes et al., EMBO Journal 3, 1984, pp. 801-805. According to the phosphoamidite method, oligonucleotides are synthesized, e.g., in an automatic DNA synthesizer, purified, duplexed and ligated to form the synthetic DNA construct.
      <br/>
      A currently preferred way of preparing the DNA construct is by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), e.g., as described in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989).
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The expression vector which may be linear or circular will comprise the DNA sequence encoding the desired polypeptide operably linked to additional segments that provide for its transcription.
      <br/>
      Such additional segments may include promoter and terminator sequences, and optionally one or more origins of replication, one or more selectable markers, an enhancer, a polyadenylation signal, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Suitable yeast promoters are the MF ALPHA 1 promoter, galactose inducible promoters such as GAL1, GAL7 and GAL10 promoters, glycolytic enzyme promoters including TPI and PGK promoters, TRP1 promoter, CYCI promoter, CUP1 promoter, PHO5 promoter, ADH1 promoter, and HSP promoter.
      <br/>
      Other useful promoters for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et al., 1992, Yeast 8:423-488.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The expression vector will also typically contain a terminator operably linked to the 3' terminus of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the desired polypeptide.
      <br/>
      Any terminator which is functional in the yeast cell may be used in the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Preferred terminators will be derived from the genes encoding Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome C (CYC1), or Saccharomyces cerevisiae glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triosephosphate isomerase and mating factor MF ALPHA 1, or from S. kluyveri glycolytic and respiratory genes.
      <br/>
      Other useful terminators for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et al., 1992, supra.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The vector will preferably contain one or more selectable markers which permit easy selection of transformed cells.
      <br/>
      A selectable marker is a gene the product of which provides for biocide or viral resistance, resistance to heavy metals, prototrophy to auxotrophs, and the like.
      <br/>
      Suitable markers for yeast host cells are ADE2, HIS3, LEU2, LYS2, MET3, TRP1, URA3, TPI1, PGK and geneticin G418R by the KANE.c. gene.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      For autonomous replication, the vector will further comprise an origin of replication enabling the vector to replicate autonomously in the yeast host.
      <br/>
      Examples of origin of replications for use in a yeast host cell are the 2 micron origin of replication, the combination of CEN6 and ARS4, and the combination of CEN3 and ARS1.
      <br/>
      The origin of replication may be one having a mutation which makes its functioning temperature-sensitive in the host cell (see, e.g., Ehrlich, 1978, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 75:1433).
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The preferred yeast expression vectors are plasmids characterized by the presence of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe triose phosphate isomerase (POT) gene.
      <br/>
      The POT gene is used for the selection of transformants and will also ensure maintenance of the plasmids in a triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) negative Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain.
    </p>
    <p num="54">The procedures used to ligate the elements described above to construct the recombinant expression vectors of the present invention are well known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, supra).</p>
    <p num="55">The yeast strain may be transformed using the procedures described by Becker and Guarente, In Abelson, J. N. and Simon, M. I., editors, Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology, Methods in Enzymology, Volume 194, pp 182-187, Academic Press, Inc., New York; Ito et al., 1983, Journal of Bacteriology 153:163; and Hinnen et al., 1978, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 75:1920.</p>
    <p num="56">The transformed yeast host cells are then cultured for a sufficient time and under appropriate conditions known to those skilled in the art in view of the teachings disclosed herein to permit the expression and secretion of the desired product.</p>
    <p num="57">
      The product is isolated and purified by methods well known within the art.
      <br/>
      If the secreted and isolated product is a precursor for an active polypeptide, such as an insulin precursor, the precursor is converted into the active polypeptide by known means such as enzymatic conversion.

      ALP cleaves at the internal lysine-residues at B29 and the connecting Ala-Ala-Lys bridge.

      If present, ALP furthermore cleaves unprocessed leader/MI3 fusion at the lysine-residue separating the leader and MI3.
      <br/>
      Thus, the total yield of processed and unprocessed MI3 can be measured as the amount of desB30 insulin in the A-samples.
      <br/>
      The yield of unprocessed (leader-bound) MI3 can be measured indirectly by subtracting the yield of leader-free product (obtained from the B-sample) from the total yield of ALP processed product.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      The yield of secreted leader-bound polypeptide could not be quantified by HPLC analysis of the sample.
      <br/>
      This was due to high amount of glycosylation (hyperglycosylation) of the pro-leader part.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      However, in case of the reference-plasmid of MI3-related products, pMT742, the yield of unprocessed pro leader/MI3 fusion in the A-samples was determined directly by quantifying the amount of desB30 having an extra N-terminal arginine residue at the B-chain ("B0Arg-desB30").
      <br/>
      B0Arg-desB30 insulin originates from a cleavage between Lys and Arg at the unprocessed kEX2 processing site.

      <br/>
      Moreover since leader bound MI3 (except for leader bound Arg-desB30) can be converted into desB30 insulin by ALP digestion, the yields of desB30 insulin ready to be used for the production of human insulin are thus even higher for these constructs (290%, 220% and 265%) than for the pMT742 construct.

      This is also true for the other constructs depicted in Table 2 (i.e. "total"=desB30 amounts).
