    <heading>RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention is related to and claims priority from commonly assigned Provisional Application 60/073,284, filed on Jan. 31, 1998, and is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates generally to pulse data recovery in optical media disk drive data storage systems.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention relates to data recovery systems that rely on recovering stored data from pulse waveforms having varied peak amplitude and/or varying peak instances relative to a known time base.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Disk data storage systems generally use either magneto-inductive, magneto-resistive, magneto-optical or purely optical data recording/reading techniques with the appropriate media.
      <br/>
      Data is stored on the disk media in an organized manner designed to cooperate with the electrical and mechanical control components of the disk drive system.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In optical and magneto-optical disks the areas on the disks are typically organized or formatted with different areas dedicated to different functions.
      <br/>
      A central portion of the disk may contain a start up zone which is used to calibrate the system when it is initialized.
      <br/>
      User data is arranged in a number of spaced apart data sectors extending radially outward from the start up zone to the disk outer diameter.
      <br/>
      User data sectors are typically separated by servo sectors.
      <br/>
      The servo sectors contain information used by the system to identify particular data storage locations by some reference coordinate system, typically radial and circumferential measures relative to some reference origin location.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Radial bars of data bits on the disk can be used to define circumferential position, (i.e., index sector number, e.g., sector 1, 2, . . . , recoverable by a read/write head and processed by a disk drive control system).
      <br/>
      Magnetic disks are commonly written with similar servo sectors defined in magnetic form.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Servo patterns are generally of constant angular spacing for good reason; it greatly simplifies reading the circumferential position at any radius.</p>
    <p num="7">
      User data is typically stored in a plurality of semi circular arc segments of contiguous data bit locations concentrically disposed about the disk center.
      <br/>
      The user data arc segments are disposed between semi circular arc segments of data bit locations that include servo sector data bits and may include other system information.
      <br/>
      The servo sector data bits may include a servo timing mark, or STM.
      <br/>
      The STM can be encoded to provide coarse disk position information to the system; for example to define which of the radially spaced semicircles is under the read/write head.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Magnetic recording and reading of data patterns typically results in a recovered data signal having two immediately adjacent pulses of opposite sign indicating the transition between two adjacent and oppositely magnetized magnetic domains.
      <br/>
      The transition from one magnetization to the other can be used to indicate a change in stored user data from one binary logic value to its opposite.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Magneto-resistive, optical and magneto-optical data recording and reading generally results in a unipolar pulse indicating the presence of a binary logic value and the absence of the unipolar pulse indicating the opposite logic value.
      <br/>
      The unipolar pulse results from an increase (or decrease) in amplitude of a returned signal picked up by the read/write head from the disk.
      <br/>
      The returned signal is generally a response to a constant intensity source signal directed at the recording area (the data bits) of the disk by the read/write head as the disk surface passes thereunder.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In the unipolar data pulse case, typical of optical and magneto-optical drives, timing of the pulses (and their absence) becomes very important in order to properly recognize the logic value associated with pulse presence/absence.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished by a writing means for writing data into data bit locations of the disk system and a reading means for reading data pulses from data bit locations having stored data.
      <br/>
      This is nearly always associated with a fixed system clock associated with the reading device, which may be different from a fixed clock provided by the data writing device.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In magneto-optical drives, advantage can be had by making the servo sector data writing/reading means orthogonal to the user data reading/writing means.
      <br/>
      For example the servo sector data bits can be read by a photosensitive device as attenuated reflection of an incident laser beam from pits written by laser pulses from a master writer device on an otherwise uniformly reflecting disk surface.
      <br/>
      Conversely the user data can be read by a polarization sensitive device from polarized reflected light from user data locations on the uniformly reflecting surface written by magneto-optic polarization shifting effects (the Kerr effect).
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In the unipolar data pulse environment provided by a magneto-optical drive, radial bars (i.e., pits formed in contiguous overlapping radial alignment) in the servo sector may be used to aid the disk system in identifying circumferential position of data sectors.
      <br/>
      An index or reference origin sector can be defined with the following sectors, sector number 0, sector one, sector two, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      One example of an architecture for a disk format is the NOID system from IBM (TM).
      <br/>
      One purpose of the NOID system is to encode a coordinate system (radial and angular position) on the disk without the use of gross physical elements.
      <br/>
      Radial and angular position coordinates on the disk are described by the data architecture or format of the servo sectors.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In magnetic disk technology, this information is written magnetically on the disk.
      <br/>
      In optical or magneto-optical disk technology the servo sector data information may be molded or embossed permanently into the recording surface.
      <br/>
      Typically a master disk is written with a formatted system data pattern (servo sector data and the like) using a precise laser beam master writing system to expose a photo resist coated master disk.
      <br/>
      A photolithographic development and etching process then leaves micro pits or indentations that form the embedded servo information.
      <br/>
      Currently master disks having servo data bits with about two nm position accuracy can be made commercially by firms having suitable master disk laser writing equipment.
      <br/>
      Daughter disks containing the embedded servo and coordinate system data can then be printed from the master disk for use in end-user systems.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Servo sector data patterns are typically written with constant angular spacing between adjacent bit locations.
      <br/>
      This simplifies servo data recognition although this causes lower servo data density toward the outer perimeter of the disks.
      <br/>
      Thus, careful attention to the architecture of the servo data is important to insure efficient use of costly disk area.
      <br/>
      If the servo sector data bit locations were not of constant angular spacing, the disk system would have to recognize variable frequency encoded data in the servo sector.
      <br/>
      Doing this by using pulse data decoding channels incorporating variable frequency oscillators (VFO's) is possible.
      <br/>
      VFO's however, typically take a long time to synchronize, i.e., taking up many bits, so a servo sector data field for use with a variable frequency oscillator data retrieval channel would be too long for efficient formatting.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The read/write head of the disk drive system is positioned on the disk surface by a read/write head servo system.
      <br/>
      The read/write head is typically positioned approximately radially along the disk surface by an actuator arm having a rotary base assembly mounted adjacently to the disk outer perimeter.
      <br/>
      The designer of the servo system driving the actuator arm, having knowledge of the geometry of the system can design the system to use the present track number information obtained from the servo sector data, to move the head rapidly to the radial position where the next target track is located.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      By reading the STM and encoded system coordinate information of each sector as it passes under the read/write head, a disk drive control system (DDCS) may derive the ID number and relative arrival timing of the servo sectors.
      <br/>
      The DDCS is typically provided with means to synchronize read and write commands to the read/write head to access the recorded user data bits at a desired data track segment following thereby.
      <br/>
      It is important that the read/write commands be properly synchronized to the position of the data sectors under the head, otherwise, incorrect data could be read from or written to the wrong data sectors.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      One key parameter for synchronizing the beginning and ending of read/write commands to the head is the relative timing of the data pulses derived from the embedded data bits in the servo sector.
      <br/>
      The DDCS must not only decode the servo sector ID data therefrom but must precisely locate the STM and yet have time to set up a time delay to apply the read/write commands to the selected user data segment that follows.
      <br/>
      A system clock of fixed frequency is generally used to provide a known time base to use in the control of read/write command timing.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The variability of media characteristics, laser power, disk rotational speed and the radial position variation of a specific data track on a rapidly rotating disk poses significant challenges to designing data retrieval systems.
      <br/>
      The eccentricity of the disk caused by mounting tolerances and the like, causes data tracks passing under the read/write head to wander in and out radially as the disk rotates.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Spindle motor speed variations from the nominal design value cause the arrival time and/or spacing of the data bits of the servo segments and data segments passing under the head to vary correspondingly from nominal expected values.
      <br/>
      The servo system of the DDCS that controls the read/write head position and the read/write electronics that control the timing of read/write commands therefore must follow these eccentricities and speed variations to avoid misinterpreting the servo sector data and consequently reading or writing data to an incorrect user data segment or bit.
      <br/>
      Providing a pulse data recovery system that is insensitive to the speed variations of the disk for the length of the data patterns comprising the servo sectors is therefore very important.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The variability of laser power, media non-uniformity, and laser pulse energy density variation between inner and outer radial positions can also cause variability in the size and shape of the data bits that are read.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the data pulses retrieved from the varying data bits may have considerable variability in amplitude and pulse width.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      If there is uncertainty in timing, the system could miss one servo sector because it was not decoded properly due to speed variation of the disk, e.g., too fast or too slow.
      <br/>
      The system could miss one or more of the pulses read from an STM if the data rate varied enough to cause a cycle slip relative to the system clock.
      <br/>
      Thus, there could be uncertainty in the timing of where the data sector starts.
      <br/>
      If data is to be written into two adjacent data sectors, the system must not mistakenly write over one sector and erase the sector in front of it.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In some cases, if tolerances are held close enough, that cycle slip correction does not have to be done.
      <br/>
      However, tighter tolerances require more expense.
      <br/>
      Tradeoffs must be made between the costs of holding closer tolerances and the costs of paying for synchronization provided by a more precise controller.
    </p>
    <p num="24">Incorporating a VFO to lock the system clock to the data by sensing the servo sector frequency is undesirable since lengthy VFO fields would increase the loss of data bit positions at the outer edge, aggravating data packing capacity on the disk.</p>
    <p num="25">
      Methods are known which provide for read/write heads to follow eccentric data tracks.
      <br/>
      System data patterns having position error signal (PES) codes can be permanently encoded as part of the master pattern in the servo sectors.
      <br/>
      This enables an appropriately configured DDCS servo system to follow the centerline of the radially eccentric data tracks.
      <br/>
      PES code data typically is written on the disk, offset from the data track nominal centerline.
      <br/>
      It is known that detection of the position error code data with a known offset relative to one side or the other of the center line, can be processed and used to re-center the disk drive read/write head over the desired data track center line.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Some PES position correcting methods depend on integrating the amplitude of multiple pulses offset on either side of the data track center line, e.g., A pulses on one side and B pulses on the other.
      <br/>
      The difference between the two integrals of A pulse amplitude and B pulse amplitude can be used to re-center the read/write head over the data track.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The data architecture of the servo sector is an important element of the overall system architecture.
      <br/>
      The coding methods, error correction methods, data bit detection method and the like, affects the number of bit locations required for the servo sector and the number of bit locations available for user data, i.e., the format efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      These features are influenced by the various system tolerances, e.g., disk motor speed variations, which primarily affects the over all data efficiency related to the data structure.
      <br/>
      Data bit gaps or spaces may be required between servo sectors and data sectors.
      <br/>
      Depending on the relative size of servo and data sectors and motor speed tolerances, format efficiency can be adversely influenced
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      To accommodate the differences in timing between the clock and the media speed, the data sectors may be moved farther apart.
      <br/>
      Then, when a write pulse comes early, it does not write over the end of the previous data sector.
      <br/>
      However, this reduces format efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      As drives of higher density are developed, much better control of the system clocking is required.
      <br/>
      Even with improved clocking there is not much improvement in the problem of reading PES pulse amplitude and timing position.
      <br/>
      The first requisite when the drive comes on, is to read the servo timing mark.
      <br/>
      A good clock synchronized to the disk cannot necessarily be assumed at that time, because the servo must be read first.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Methods are also known for processing pulse data trains having pulse arrival times, amplitudes and widths that vary from nominal values.
      <br/>
      Generally, the design of such systems is relatively difficult.
      <br/>
      These systems tend to be complex and cost significantly more than desired.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The pulse data retrieved from the encoded pits in a magneto-optical (MO) disk drive system contain two types of information; pulse position (relative to a fixed clock), and pulse amplitude.
      <br/>
      Since the embedded and permanently written system data is encoded under very tightly controlled conditions, it is inherently more uniform than the user data.
      <br/>
      This uniformity of the pulse amplitude and pulse position of the servo sector data can be used to compensate for variability in user data pulse amplitude and position.
      <br/>
      Being able to read both pulse position and pulse amplitude of the STM marks and PES codes is very important to be able to take maximum advantage of sophisticated servo positioning and dynamic system calibration methods.

    <p num="33">
      Some known analog and digital signal processing techniques for processing high data rate, variable pulse position and amplitude signals are: threshold detection, peak detection, envelope detection, synchronous detection, and pulse integration.
      <br/>
      These are ranked generally with increasing cost and performance.
      <br/>
      The tradeoffs between better signal sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratios, timing and amplitude precision is generally inversely related to cost.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Today, threshold and peak detection are rarely, if ever, used in high performance disk drives because of their limitations.
      <br/>
      Designers are turning instead to various detection techniques using envelope, integration or synchronous detection.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Integration detection over an extended portion of a pulse includes signal values that are at or close to zero values.
      <br/>
      Signal points near zero have almost no information about the peak amplitude or location in time but do contribute noise, thereby introducing more uncertainty about the signal peak amplitude and location in time.
      <br/>
      Signal points close to the peak have lower noise contribution than points far from peak.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      A matched filter, i.e., synchronous detection, can contribute even lower noise than integration.
      <br/>
      For example, a sine wave signal with noise, if rectified and integrated, has a certain signal level and a certain noise level.
      <br/>
      If the same signal is multiplied by a detector sine wave of the same period, the high values of the sine wave signal will be weighted by high values of the detector sine wave and all the low values of the signal by low values of the detector sine wave.
      <br/>
      The output will be a constant, plus a series of AC terms; i.e., the signal has been heterodyned down to DC.
      <br/>
      The noise contribution at low signal levels has been de-emphasized compared with integration detection thereby yielding an improved signal-to-noise ratio.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Previous implementations of synchronous and integration detectors however, have depended on sophisticated (and therefore expensive) analog and/or digital signal processing techniques.
      <br/>
      Previous detectors using threshold/peak/envelope detection have been cheaper but have marginal or inadequate performance compared with synchronous detection and pulse integration detection.
      <br/>
      However, for new drives and new drive architectures, size, weight and cost of these known techniques make it difficult to achieve desired performance levels within the limited budget parameters.
    </p>
    <p num="38">Synchronous detection and integration detection of pulses is also more difficult to implement in the disk drive environment because of the variation of servo sector data pulse spacing in time from the inner to an outer radius and the variability of pulse width and amplitude.</p>
    <p num="39">
      Referring to FIG. 10 there are shown two representative pulse shapes that should be detectable.
      <br/>
      A first pulse plsn1 is illustrated to have a relatively larger amplitude and wider pulse width Wn1 relative to a pulse width Wn2 of a second pulse plsn2 when measured at its Full-Width-Half-Magnitude (FWHM) or 50% point.
      <br/>
      Plsn1 may represent pulses from servo data bits near the center of an optical disk in an optical disk drive system where pulse plsn2 may represent servo data bits near the outer diameter (OD).
    </p>
    <p num="40">The problem of variability can be lessened by tightening the manufacturing and assembly tolerances of the master disks, the mechanical and electrical components of the hardware assemblies and by controlling temperature, humidity and the like, again at higher cost and possibly with lower reliability.</p>
    <p num="41">Therefore, one challenge for a high performance disk drive system is to detect the variations in pulse amplitude and pulse position of data bits at high data rates with low cost and low complexity.</p>

      The media itself presents a different problem.
      <br/>
      Optical media can be either first surface optical media, or second surface optical media.
      <br/>
      A second surface media has a transparent coating, e.g., polycarbonate, over the recording medium below.
      <br/>
      This is used in CD-ROM or DVD.
      <br/>
      These methods focus light through the polycarbonate to the media below.
      <br/>
      Any dirt on the surface will be slightly out of focus so is less likely to be recognized as data.
      <br/>
      This does cut down the intensity of light from the laser source, and consequently decreases the signal-to-noise ratio of the data retrieval channel.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      In high performance optical disk drives, first surface recording is more commonly used.
      <br/>
      That is, there is no over coat, consequently any particle present will be recognized as a signal.
      <br/>
      A dirt particle will typically be larger than two adjacent data bits.
      <br/>
      An encoding system which uses threshold detection is likely to interpret a dirt particle as multiple adjacent data bits.
    </p>
    <p num="44">Dirt on the disk surface can be of sufficient size and density to a false attenuation of reflected light, thereby appearing to the read/write head and detection electronics as a false data bit or bits.</p>
    <p num="45">
      One method of reducing the effect of particles in data retrieval channels is to use pulse position coding and pulse position modulation (PPM).
      <br/>
      The PPM method can detect the presence of a large dirt particle in that each data bit will not appear to be a clearly defined pulse.
      <br/>
      A PPM modulation and coding system can discriminate an NRZ data structure created by dirt particles since the faulty signal does not return to 0 between adjacent pulse positions as would two adjacent actual pulses.
      <br/>
      PPM modulation allows recognition of a dirt particle which can enable the system to ignore faulty sectors and thereby provide enhanced user data integrity.
      <br/>
      System design can accommodate such events by ignoring the data segment with such a data pattern.
      <br/>
      Still, there is some chance, though small, that a dirt particle could represent a single bit or succession of single bits.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Sophisticated signal processing techniques that rely on reading the variability of signal level and timing are of little use during the initialization of the systems described above.
      <br/>
      Until the system can recognize the servo sectors, no data can be accumulated to compensate for variability.
      <br/>
      The first thing the disk drive system must do is to read the servo sectors to initialize the system: then special techniques can be used, e.g. locking on to the STMs.

      A servo sector encoded with an appropriate servo timing mark using pulse position modulation encoding can provide superior performance over that of threshold detection.

      However, this places significant challenges to the design of such system to keep cost low and performance high.
      <br/>
      Three of the most important areas to be addressed in such high performance and constrained budget data storage systems are: 1) detection of the peak amplitude of data pulses retrieved from the disk. 2) detection of the STM patterns, and 3) accounting for the synchronism of the instances of servo data pulses and the frequency (or period) of a system clock over the data pattern comprising the servo sector.

    <p num="50">
      In embodiments of disk drives incorporating the present Peak Detection Channel invention (PDC) an important feature is the ability to locate the data on the disk.
      <br/>
      The servo timing sectors for each data track are recognized by the embodiments of the invention cooperating with system electronics at start up of the disk drive system.
      <br/>
      Variation of data pulse heights, widths and shapes over a broad range are accommodated.
      <br/>
      The invention takes advantage of the fact that typical pulse shapes (e.g. Gaussian or cosine-squared) can be closely approximated near their peak by a parabolic curve.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The present invention first detects that instance of occupance of a unipolar data pulse having a quasi-Gaussian envelope characterized by a single amplitude peak Ap and a Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM) pulse width Pw.
      <br/>
      The detection of the instance of data pulse occupance is achieved by sampling the data pulse amplitude regularly with a sample period at least less than about 1/3, but preferably more than about 1/5  of the data pulse width Pw.
      <br/>
      In addition, a pulse detect signal is enabled following the condition that the magnitude of a center sample of three consecutive samples is greater than or equal to the magnitude of one of the two adjacent samples and is greater than the magnitude of the other adjacent sample.
    </p>
    <p num="52">Second, a preferred embodiment of the invention provides that the unipolar pulse has a peak amplitude which has occurred within a period of no more than one-half the sample period on either side of the center sample.</p>
    <p num="53">Third, a preferred embodiment of the invention provides an estimate of the unipolar pulse peak amplitude.</p>

      Each pulse Pj is sampled asynchronously with a high frequency sample clock having a sampling period Tclk more than about 1/5 and less than about 1/3 a nominal minimum pulse period Tpsmin.
      <br/>
      The Tclk provided in the system 100 is at such a rate that several consecutive samples hit each pulse at an amplitude above a threshold value.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      A peak, Apj occurs in an interval of plus or minus half of a sample period, Tclk, from the center sample x2 when:

    </p>
    <p num="59">that is when the middle sample of three consecutive pulse samples is greater in magnitude than the sample before and greater than or equal to the magnitude of the sample after the middle sample.</p>
    <p num="60">
      The parabolic estimate of the time offset Toffset, of the peak Apj from the second sampling instant is:

      In a particular embodiment of the invention, the pulse waveforms' amplitudes are sampled at about 50 MHz.
      <br/>
      The amplitudes are sampled with a high-speed 8-bit flash A to D converter (ADC).
      <br/>
      The sampled amplitude values and identifying sample clock ticks are processed by subsystems of the invention to determine the accurate time instance of a data pulse relative to the timing of a system logic bit frame.
      <br/>
      Further processing of sampled data pulse amplitudes and identifying sample clock ticks by embodiments of this invention provide accurate estimates of the instances of the pulsed data peak occurrences and estimates of the pulsed data peak amplitudes.
      <br/>
      These estimates are provided for use by the detection and control electronics of the disk drive system to enable system performance enhancements, e.g. PES processing and the like.

      A digital peak instance detection embodiment is also an invention in itself.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      In a disk drive embodiment of the invention, following the detection of a first pulse of an STM, succeeding pulses are evaluated until the detector determines an STM is present.
      <br/>
      Once an STM is detected, which determines where the data in the servo sector is located relative to the system logic bit time, the system can process the following values of pulse peak instance and amplitude, e.g. process the PES data pulses to follow the data track's eccentric movement.
      <br/>
      Each time a pulse peak instance and amplitude is provided by the invention, it is stored; then when other predetermined conditions are met, the system processes the stored pulse data to take corrective action.

      Referring to FIG. 1 there is shown an example of a disk drive system 100.
      <br/>
      A plurality of disks 102 having respective center holes Do are mounted on a drive spindle 104 therethrough.
      <br/>
      The disks 102 rotate counter clockwise (indicated by the arrow M) with a rotating speed (rpm).
      <br/>
      A set of actuator arms 106 have distal ends that carry flying read/write heads 108 above a surface 103 of respective storage disks 102.
      <br/>
      A rotary actuator assembly 110 is connected to a proximal end of actuator arms 106.
      <br/>
      The rotary actuator assembly 110 supports and positions the actuator arms 106 and heads 108 across the surface of disks 102 by rotary motion thereabout.
      <br/>
      Data pulse signals (discussed below) are retrieved from each respective disk surface 103 and transferred to a disk drive control system (DDCS) comprising respective signal processing electronics 114.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the signal processing electronics 114 may be located at some remote distance from the head 108.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the signal processing electronics 114 may be located on the head 108.

      Referring now to FIG. 2, there is shown a plan view of one surface 103 of the disk 102.
      <br/>
      For the purposes of describing an embodiment of the present invention, a particular data architecture of the surface 103 of the disk 102 is described.
      <br/>
      The surface 103 includes an inner startup zone 202 uniformly surrounding the center hole Do and extending radially outward to an inner diameter ID.
      <br/>
      An outer zone 204 extends from the inner diameter ID to an outer diameter OD.
    </p>
    <p num="72">The inner startup zone 202 and the outer zone 204 are circumferentially divided respectively into a plurality of uniformly and circumferentially spaced apart wedge shaped servo sectors 212 extending contiguously outward from the center hole Do.</p>
    <p num="73">
      A corresponding plurality of wedge shaped, spaced apart data sectors 216 are interposed circumferentially between and adjacent to each of a respective pair of servo sectors 212 within the outer zone 204.
      <br/>
      The data sector 216 comprises a plurality of data bits separated by a constant linear spacing along the data tracks 220.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The actuator arm 106 moves the head 108 when positioned by the actuator assembly 110 for retrieving data pulse signals from a plurality of radially spaced apart, concentric, circular data tracks 220 centered about the center hole Do.
      <br/>
      The data tracks 220 are spaced apart radially with a nominal constant data track pitch Tp beginning in the start up zone 202 and extending towards the outer diameter OD.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      Referring now to FIG. 3, there is shown a highly magnified portion 300 of a typical servo sector 212 of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In embodiments of the present invention, an important feature is the ability to access data locations on the disk 102.
      <br/>
      The servo sectors 212 comprise encoded information including a coordinate reference system that furthers of this ability.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the data tracks 220 spanning each servo sector 212 contains three kinds of encoded information: servo timing marks (STM) 310, data track address marks 332, and fine circumferential position error signal (PES) servo burst marks 302.
      <br/>
      The encoded information in the servo sectors 212 may be written by a master laser writer in the form of embedded pits 303.
      <br/>
      A representative embedded pit is indicated by 303.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the embedded pits 303 are written along certain ones of a plurality of master tracks 310m, 310m+1, 310m+2 . . . . The master tracks are concentrically disposed and centered around Do, and equally spaced and separated by a track pitch Tp/2, wherein the data tracks 220 comprise alternate ones of the plurality of master tracks.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The servo timing marks 310 comprise a first pattern of embedded pits 303 that are written from the OD to the ID and the certain ones of the master tracks 310m, 310m+1, 310m+2 . . . to form continuous radial lines.
      <br/>
      The disk drive control system DDCS of the disk drive 100 may be configured to recognize the first pattern as marking the start of the servo sector 212 each time the first pattern is detected, regardless of the radial position of the read/write head 108 relative to the disk surface 103.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      In the preferred embodiment, the data track address marks 332 comprise a second pattern of individual embedded pits 303.
      <br/>
      The second pattern is decoded by the DDCS and used as address pointers for identification of particular data tracks 220.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      In the preferred embodiment, the position error marks 302 comprise a third pattern of individual embedded pits 303.
      <br/>
      The third pattern comprises four concentrically disposed segments 311, 312, 313, 314.
      <br/>
      The third pattern is used to derive position error signals for performing position adjustments of the read/write head 108 over a particular data track 220 during track seeking and following as is well known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      Each embedded pit 303 is characterized by three dimensions that are carefully controlled by the master laser writer during the master writing process: an elliptical radial pit width (erpw) 340, an elliptical circumferential pit width (ecpw) 342 and an embedded pit depth (epd) 344 (not shown).
      <br/>
      The control and uniformity of embedded pit position, and dimensions establish a basis for the DDCS to compensate for variability of user recorded data by appropriate control algorithms.

      Ticks k are enumerated along the time axis of the FIG. 4, starting with a reference numeral 0 and cycling repetitively from 0 to 4.
      <br/>
      Preferably, each cycle of 5 clock ticks k represent a sample Frame, e.g., Frame1, Frame2, Frame3, Frame4, etc.
      <br/>
      Each pair of clock ticks k, k+1 represent a sample clock period or phase; i.e. sample tick k=0 to k=1 is phase 0; sample tick k=1 to k=2 is phase 1; etc.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      In FIG. 4 the pulses Ps1, Ps2, Ps3 are sampled at ticks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and have respective amplitude at x(k=0), x(k=1), x(k=2), x(k=3), x(k=4).
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4, the pulses Ps1, Ps2, Ps3 are illustrated to comprise respective pulse peaks that occur within phase 2 of corresponding Frames1, Frames3, Frames 4.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the pulse peaks are preferably recognized by the signal processing electronics 114 as logic one, conversely if no pulse peak is found, a logic zero will be recognized.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      It is apparent that the detection process must not only recognize the presence (or absence) of a data pulse Ps1, Ps2, . . . Psj in each Frame1, Frame2, . . . Framej but must also synchronize the particular Framej with the expected data positions on the disk as well.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides an efficient, high speed and cost effective solution for both these requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      In the present invention, detection of the pulse peaks depends on a Tclk that is faster than the maximum frequency of the data pulses Ps1, Ps2, . . . Psj. For the preferred embodiment under discussion, the Tclk is about 5 times the fastest expected pulse rate; accordingly, the Tclk is about one fifth the minimum nominal pulse period, Tpsmin.
      <br/>
      An exemplary minimum pulse period Tpsmin is defined in FIG. 4 between the peak of Ps2 and the peak of Ps3.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      In the present invention, each pulse peak occurs at a peak time instances tpj within a Framej.
      <br/>
      The amplitudes of pulse peaks and peak time instances tpj may exhibit variations caused by variations in: the power of the laser; recorded pit size, shape and position on the disk 102; the disk 102 rotational speed, eccentricity; and alignment offset between the read/write head 108 and the data tracks 220 (i.e. center line of the recorded data pits 303), and the like.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that the variation of the actual peak time instance tpj for each pulse Psj may cause time variations relative to the instances of the SYSCLK and ticks k and because the ticks, k, k+1, k+2, . . . and the recovered data pulses Ps1, Ps2, . . . Psj occur asynchronously, there may be precession of the data pulses Ps1, Ps2, . . . Psj with respect to Frame1, Frame2, . . . Framej. For example, in FIG. 4 if the waveform Dps1 precesses long enough, succeeding pulses Ps1, Ps2, -Psj may drift out of corresponding Frames, causing false data corresponding to these pulses to be detected by the system 100 (i.e., the waveform Dps1 may shift, say toward the right, wherein the pulse peak of Ps3 may occur in phase 1 rather than phase 2).
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      In the present invention, when a pulse peak of a particular data pulse Psj slips by a phase, a counter is changed by one count to re-center the next data pulse.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 5, by changing the count of the counter, an additional tick is inserted in Frame3 so that the tick k on which the pulse peak of Ps5 is measured is tick 3 not tick 2.
      <br/>
      In this manner, as will be described below in further detail, the present invention provides that the pulse peaks of the data pulses Ps1, Ps2, -Psj may be found in about the same phase of a corresponding Framej such that succeeding pulses Psj that drift out of the corresponding Frame do not cause false data to be received by the system 100.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The present invention provides cycle slip correction between the phase of pulse peak instances Apj and the phase of a Framej derived from the fixed system clock such that asynchronous servo timing mark (STM) detection is accomplished.
      <br/>
      In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention which includes a 50 MHz SYSCLK the read time of a servo sector 212 (FIG. 2) is 3.6 ns long.
      <br/>
      With a spindle motor 104 speed control specified at +/-0.5%; an 18 ns slip, nearly an entire clock cycle, from the beginning of the servo sector to the end of the servo sector is possible.

      The pulse peak-synchronizing feature of the present invention corrects for the single clock phase slip automatically.
      <br/>
      Even greater phase slip can be accommodated by embodiments of this invention.

      <br/>
      If a peak is detected (PKDET=1) and the DRUN 870 latch is high, the Search-STM input 890 resets the run latch DRUN 870 when the STM was not found (Search-STM=0 and Read_Data, Read_PES are low).
      <br/>
      When the DRUN latch 870 is reset, the counter count5 850 is loaded with the value 3 920 when a peak is detected independent of the previous counter state.
      <br/>
      This means that the counter count5 850 started at count two when the peak occurred.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      This ensures a peak of a pulse Psj is centered in a Framej (refer to FIGS. 4 and 5) when a peak is detected while still searching for the servo timing mark.
      <br/>
      When the first peak occurs the DRUN latch 870 is set.
      <br/>
      When the DRUN latch 870 is set the counter only loads itself with 3 if the peak was detected and the count is 1, 2, or 3.
      <br/>
      Thus the counter count5 850 is allowed to adjust its count or phase plus one or minus one count from the phase of the last peak detect in normal operation when reading a servo sector.
      <br/>
      With regard to FIG. 5, it can be seen that a peak will be detected on clock phase3 of Frame3.
      <br/>
      In normal operation the PPS circuit will load the value 3 and reset the phase count, adding another clock phase to Frame3.
      <br/>
      It can be seen then, that the PPS circuit adjusts the clock phase in the Frame3 to re-center the peak of pulse Psj, j=3 at the clock 2.
      <br/>
      This ensures that each pulse detected remains within the logic bit frame expected.
      <br/>
      Logic operations performed by the system 100 on the recognized pulses will be synchronized thereby to the proper data bit Framej.

    <p num="126">
      Referring now to FIG. 8, the present invention further includes a Servo Timing Mark Detector (STMD) circuit.
      <br/>
      In the present invention when a servo timing mark is first detected, succeeding values of pulse peak and amplitudes of the pulses Psj within corresponding Framej may preferably be processed accurately, for example even with the eccentric movement of the disk 102.
      <br/>
      The values are stored, and when other predetermined conditions are met, the signal processing electronics 114 processes the values to take corrective action.
      <br/>
      The location of the servo timing mark is used for maintaining the alignment of the pulses Psj relative to a Framej.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      FIG. 8 shows an implementation of the STMD circuit of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The STMD circuit receives the sampling clock SYSCLK at 628 from the system 100 and the inputs DataD0 854, Enable-Data 905, and the DRUN0 921 from the PPS circuit.
      <br/>
      The signal Enable_Data 905 comes from the signal Enable_Data 905 in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      Each clock input c of four D flip flops Dp1 1000, Dp2 1010, Dp3 1015, Dp4 1020 is connected to SYSCLK at 628.
      <br/>
      Each enable input e 1025 of the four D flip-flops Dp1 1000, Dp2 1010, Dp3 1015, Dp4 1020 is common to the Enable_Data input 905.
      <br/>
      Propagation of the signal run through the 4 flip flops will be disabled when signal Enable_Data 905 is low.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      Twelve other D flip flops Dd0, Dd1, - - - Dd11 1025, each having their own data input Ddd 854, delayed output dbO 1030, enable input Dee 905, and clock input Dcc 629 are connected in a chain, the output O-k from Dd(k) connects to the input d of Dd((k+1)), 0&lt;k&lt;10.
      <br/>
      Each clock input Dcc 629 of each flip flop Dd(k) 1025 is connected to SYSCLK and each enable input Dee of each flip-flop Dd(k) 1025 is connected to signal Enable_Data 905.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      The input Ddd 854 of Do in FIG. 8 is connected to the output 854 of FIG. 7, i.e. signal DDATA 910.
      <br/>
      Each flip flop Dd0 through Dd11 1025 form the respective data bit Db0 though Db11 1030 from which the system 100 derives sector address (and part of the PES values).
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      Each instance of a pulse on Enable_Data 905, (that is 5 SYSCLK ticks or one Frame) loads the current value of DDATA 910 into the first bit of the shift register Dd0-Dd11 1025 and shifts the last stored value of each bit to the next bit location.
      <br/>
      If a peak has been detected within the logic frame, a one will be loaded, otherwise a zero.
    </p>
    <p num="131">Outputs of the STMD circuit (FIG. 8) are output search-STM 890, output Read_PES 900, output Read_Data 895, and 12 bits of data Db0 through Db11 1030.</p>
    <p num="132">
      Input Run feeds a first data input d 921 of the string of four D flip-flops: Dp1 1000, Dp2 1010, Dp3 1015, Dp4 1020.
      <br/>
      Each of these flip-flops have respective SYSCLK input c 629, data input d 921, enable input e 1025 and output O 950.
      <br/>
      Flip-flop Dp1 1000 feeds Dp2 1010 which feeds Dp3 1015 which feeds Dp4 1020 to create a 4 SYSCLK delay between the input Run 921 at Dp1 and the output O of Dp4 950.
      <br/>
      Dp4 1020 feeds an input 950 of inverter INVp 953.
      <br/>
      INVp 953 has an output 952 (INVpO) which forms the signal Search_STM, i.e. the input search_STM 890 of FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      That is, search_STM 890 is the inversion of the signal RUN 921 and delayed by four clocks of SYSCLK 628.
    </p>
    <p num="133">In this embodiment, this enables a four bit servo timing mark pattem 310 (refer to FIG. 3) to be detected before negating the search-STM signal 890 when the four bits of the servo timing mark pattern are loaded in Dd0-Dd3 1025, and have been preceded by three 0's loaded in Dd4-Dd6 1025.</p>
    <p num="134">
      The data pattern on the disk (refer to FIG. 1) is arranged to precede the servo timing mark pattern with several zeros, in this case 3.
      <br/>
      The three preceding zeros prevent dirt particles from inadvertently being interpreted as a servo timing mark.
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      The outputs of Dd0 and Dd3 1025 are respectively connected to inverters ID0 1005, ID3 1006.
      <br/>
      Inverters ID0 1005, ID3 1006 have respective outputs Id0.backslash. 1007, Id3.backslash. 1008 connected to inputs 0 and 3 of 7-input OR gate 955.
      <br/>
      Inputs 1,2,4,5,6, of 955 are connected to respective outputs Dd1, Dd2, Dd4, Dd5, Dd6 1025.
      <br/>
      Output 956 of OR 955 is connected to inverter 960.
      <br/>
      Inverter 960 supplies output 962 to a data input 964 of a 12-bit counter 966.
      <br/>
      Counter 966 has clock input 976 connected to SYSCLK and an enable input 968 connected to the Enable-Data signal 905.
      <br/>
      Counter 966 has an output 972 which is delayed by 12 clocks of SYSCLK 628 pulses when enabled by a logic true on 968.
      <br/>
      Since pulses of Enable-Data 905 are ticks of SYSCLK divided by 5, counter 966 will delay the output 972 until all 12 bits of the sector address are loaded into the flip-flops Dd0-Dd11 1025.
      <br/>
      When all sector address bits are loaded into Dd0-Dd11 1025, output 972 (Read_Data) goes high, indicating to the system 100 to access the sector address.
      <br/>
      This also sets the DRUN latch 870 when enabled by ANDR 880.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      Read_Data 895 also is connected to input 974 of a 20-bit counter 975.
      <br/>
      Counter 975 has a clock input 976 connected to the system sample clock SYSCLK and an enable input 978 connected to Enable_Data 905.
      <br/>
      Once the servo timing mark has been detected, Read_Data 895 goes high, triggering the counter 975.
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      Twenty successive Enable_Data 905 pulses increment counter 975 until Read_PES 900 goes high indicating to the system 100 to gate the corresponding 20 DDATA 854 values from the PPS circuit to position error signal (PES) generation circuitry (not shown).
      <br/>
      Output 900 of counter 975 is the Read_PES signal 900.
      <br/>
      Read_PES 900 enables the ANDR 880 (see FIG. 8) AND gate to set the run latch DRUN 870 when O2o 886 is true.
      <br/>
      Read_PES 900 also provides a signal to the system 100 indicating availability of the 20 bits of PES data (refer to FIG. 3).
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      Thus, the PPS circuit in combination with the PDC and STMD circuits provide the system 100 with an efficient self synchronizing pulse data detection method, keeping pulse peaks within a logic bit frame, while allowing for disk speed variations within the desired system tolerances.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished with the use of simple, low cost logic and analog components with minimal component count.
    </p>
    <p num="139">Alternative embodiments of this invention can be implemented with straight forward scaling of servo timing mark (STM) bit patterns, bit pattern lengths and additions to or deletions of the following address and position error signal (PES) data structures.</p>
    <p num="140">
      Although not described here in detail, the values of the estimated peaks Epj and peak instances Tpj of detected pulses Psj may be calculated from the PV values output by the REGp 661 register of the PDC circuit by computing components of the system 100 using the Equations 1-4 presented above.
      <br/>
      These estimated values may be used by the system 100 and alternative systems for the improvement of system performance.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      It is anticipated that alternative systems may have some portions of the logic of the PDC, PPS, and STMD circuits may be implemented in parallel rather that pipelined logic for higher performance at slightly higher cost.
      <br/>
      The transformation of the logic from pipelined to parallel is within the capability of a skilled logic designer.
    </p>
    <p num="142">The number of phases in the logic frame may also be selected (e.g. more phases or less) in response to differing system signal to noise ratios and disk speed tolerances.</p>

      It is to be understood that the above description is illustrative only and not limiting of the disclosed invention.
