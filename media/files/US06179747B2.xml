    <heading>BACKGROUND--FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a one piece exercise configuration for toning the muscles of the face and neck regions.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND--DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In recent years, there have been a number of innovations in exercising equipment to enable people to utilize various body muscles in a capacity in which they would otherwise not be exercised.
      <br/>
      However, very little has been done in this area in order to permit people to exercise facial and neck muscles.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      It has been recognized for many years that the facial and neck muscles like those of the rest of the human body, can improve in tonicity by exercise practiced over a long period of time and on a consistent basis.
      <br/>
      It has also been recognized that exercising jaw muscles and other facial muscles will have a tendency to decrease fat beneath the skin of the human being.
      <br/>
      Consequently, facial muscles exercising has a tendency to actually improve the appearance of an individual's face and neck by decreasing fat in these areas.
      <br/>
      Even more so, it has been found that the muscles which are strained by movement of the jaw when properly exercised, will decrease wrinkles around the eyes, due to the fact that it will cause a conditioning of the skin in the area around the eyes.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Various devices have been devised to strengthen or improve face and neck muscles through exercise.
      <br/>
      Generally, these comprise means of compression.
      <br/>
      The following U.S. patents show various devices for exercising specific facial, neck and chin muscles: U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,507,617; 3,571,930; 4,195,833; 4,650,182; 4,666,148; and 5,366,139.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,650,182, to Ross, is designed particularly for the exercise of the jaw, specifically designed to exercise the muscles of mastication and their auxiliaries.
      <br/>
      A headband is connected to a chin strap by flexible strips.
      <br/>
      One moves or opens his/her jaw against the elastic resistance force of the elastic resistance coupling members, thus strengthening the muscles of mastication and auxiliaries.
      <br/>
      The primary purpose of this device is to supplement therapeutic modality for relief of temporamandibular joint and/or myo-facial pain symptoms.
      <br/>
      The disadvantages of this device are: (1) Its use is intended for the medical profession and not the general public. (2) It does not tone the forehead because the upper head band is a flexible strip which does not provide resistance against the movement of the forehead muscles. (3) When closing the mouth the muscles of mastication are not being toned because this device does not provide any resistance coming from beneath the mandible. (4) The device is not made to tone the muscles of the neck. (5) Its parts are not contiguous, therefore, the user must connect the parts together each time the device is used.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The inventor has personally used for more than a year a device sold under the trademark Facial-Flex exerciser.
      <br/>
      This device is purported to provide the effects of a face lift without surgery.
      <br/>
      With this device, two U-shaped portions are wedged in the corners of the mouth, then the user forms an "O" by pressing and releasing the mouth.
      <br/>
      The mouth is moved such that the interconnecting rods expand and contract linearly.
      <br/>
      Disadvantages of the Facial-Flex exerciser are: (1) It is difficult to keep the accumulation of saliva from coming out of the mouth when using the device. (2) The Facial-Flex exerciser is designed to target the chin, cheeks, and neck muscles, it does not target the masseter and the temporal muscles.
      <br/>
      These two muscles are very important when toning facial muscles because they are the only muscles in the face which greatly influence surface form. (3) This device tones the targeted muscles only when the mouth is pressed together, there is no toning when the mouth is released, therefore, the antagonistic muscles to the chin, cheeks and neck are not being toned. (4) This device does not tone the forehead. (5) This device utilizes metal rods which may present a safety problem while driving or engaging in athletic activity and an accident occurs. (6) The use of this device does not provide any support for retaining the shape of the lips, and therefore, deep wrinkles extending perpendicularly from the lips, which are often called "whistle-marks" may form with extended use of this device.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The inventor has also used the Chin Gym exerciser U.S. Pat. No. 4,744,556, to Shaffer, this is an isometric chin, neck and jaw exerciser it targets the masseter, mylohyoid, and platysma muscles.
      <br/>
      The Chin Gym exerciser is a C-shaped structure having two free ends.
      <br/>
      One free end is adapted to fit within the mouth of the user, and the second free end fits under the chin.
      <br/>
      Weights are added to the structure to cause the second free end to press upward against the lower jaw and chin muscles, while at the same time exerting a resistance against the upper jaw muscles.
      <br/>
      The Chin Gym exerciser workout is a gradual progression.
      <br/>
      The user begins slowly and gradual increase the workout time.
      <br/>
      Once the user is able to hold the Chin Gym exerciser in the mouth, without removing it for 15 minutes, additional weights can be added.
      <br/>
      The workouts should have little to no movement.
      <br/>
      Disadvantages of the Chin Gym exerciser are: (1) Saliva accumulation in the mouth. (2) It depends on an isometric response, which is a force against an unmovable source.
      <br/>
      Therefore, other than reading a book or watching TV while in a setting position the Chin Gym exerciser does not allow a person to engage in other activities. (3) It does not tone the forehead. (4) It may damage bridge-work or dentures, and teeth that have been weakened by periodontal disease.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Objects and Advantages</p>
    <p num="9">Accordingly, several objects and advantages of the present invention are:</p>
    <p num="10">

    </p>
    <p num="50">Operation</p>
    <p num="51">
      In use, the head band 12 is attached to the upper portion of the user's head above the ears by means of the velcro fasteners 34 and 36 and or similar fastening means, the neck band 57 is attached to the neck by means of the velcro fasteners 78 and 80 and or similar fastening means, and the chin cup 38 is then positioned on the user's chin.
      <br/>
      The purpose of the head band 12 is to provide resistance from above, the purpose of the neck band 57 is to provide resistance from below.
      <br/>
      One of the main purposes of the chin cup 38, is to provide the means whereby the present invention 10 is configured into a one piece exercise device, when the head attachment ends 96 on the beginners head resistance bands 88, and the neck attachment ends 112 on the beginners neck resistance bands 104 are permanently attached to the chin cup 38.
      <br/>
      The chin attachment knob 45 holds the head attachment ends 96, and neck attachments ends 112 permanently in place, while allowing for adjustment and positioning of the device 10.
      <br/>
      Use of the head fastening means 18 protruding from the head band 12 eliminates the head resistance bands 86 from rubbing against the facial skin.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Once in position, the user uses the one piece face and neck exerciser 10 by moving the mouth, neck, and chin, in various directions against the resistance of the resistance bands 86 and 102.
      <br/>
      To tone the forehead the velcro fasteners 34 and 36 must be secured tightly behind the head and then the user simply raises the eyebrows up and down.
    </p>
    <p num="53">The muscles of the face are usually described as arising from the bones and inserted into the nose, lips, and corners of the mouth, they have fibres inserted into the skin of the face along their whole extent, so that almost every point of the skin of the face has its muscular fibre to move it.</p>
    <p num="54">
      When the device 10 is in operation, any movement caused by the user, such as blinking, closing the lips as if to kiss, compressing cheeks to whistle, opening the mouth, closing the mouth, protruding the lips to pout, laterally moving the lip to grimace, raising the edge of the mouth to smile, raising the upper lip to show disgust, moving the jaw from side to side, rotating the head, flexing the head and extending the head, is affected by the restraint effect of the resistance bands, thereby accomplishing an isotonic type of resistance for building facial, neck, and chin muscles.
      <br/>
      This device 10 also tones the muscle of the forehead by raising the eyebrows up and down against the resistance of the headband 12.
    </p>
    <p num="55">Once the muscles have begun to develop some tone the intermediate head resistance bands 90 and or advanced head resistance bands 92, the intermediate neck resistance bands 106 and or advanced neck resistance bands 108, can be attached to the head band 12 and neck band 57, thereby requiring more force on the part of the jaw, neck and chin muscles.</p>
    <p num="56">
      Resistance may be varied by increasing the number of resistance bands 86 and 102.
      <br/>
      The additional resistance is a very important preferred feature of the present invention 10.
      <br/>
      This is important because as soon as the user starts to perform the exercises and does them regularly, the muscles will quickly become stronger in the face, chin, and neck areas each time additional resistance is added.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The exercise device 10 of the present invention may be used in special exercise routines to exercise the muscles in the face and neck so that lines, crevasses and folds in the skin will be smoothed out or completely eliminated, enhanced cheek bones will be achieved, eyebrows will have a pronounced arch, eyes will appear larger and younger, the jaw line will be cleaner, the chin line will be more distinct and the corners of the mouth will no longer droop.
      <br/>
      Persons with facial structure beginning to slacken with age will slow down this process of wrinkling, jowls, pouches, and sagging neck skin with the one piece face and neck exercise device 10.
      <br/>
      The sagging caused by weight loss will be reduced as will double chins and jowls be toned up using this invention 10.
    </p>
    <p num="58">Use of this device 10 is not limited to any age group for even the muscular structure of the face and neck of persons still young will be enhanced and the facial firmness retained far longer into the advanced years.</p>
    <p num="59">
      The face and neck muscles are sensitive to movement, therefore, the benefits will be seen within a few weeks if performed regularly.
      <br/>
      Early and regular use of the exercise device 10 and a system of exercise will produce the best results for the longest time.
      <br/>
      The early morning and late evening when the face is cleaned is advised for circulation is improved by the exercises and the benefits of facial creams would also be enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="60">The construction of the present invention over comes the following disadvantages of some prior art: possible damage to the teeth, saliva accumulation, inability to tone major facial muscles groups simultaneously, limited activity while the device is being used.</p>
    <p num="61">Conclusion, Ramifications, and Scope</p>
    <p num="62">
      I have shown the invention as having four main parts: a head band, a chin cup, a neck band, and a pair of resistance band for the head and.
      <br/>
      The head band is permanently connected to the chin cup with a right and left resistance band, and the neck band is permanently connected to the chin cup with a right and left resistance band.
      <br/>
      The frontal and lateral side of the head band is made of a hard material.
      <br/>
      Extending from the right and left lateral sides of the head band are protrusions for the permanent resistance band to connect to.
      <br/>
      Made into the protrusions are three slanting grooves which are used for additional resistance bands for intermediate users and advanced users, the grooves are also used to adjust the one piece device to fit the average head size.
      <br/>
      The posterior part of the head band is made of velcro, to allow for sizing, and fastening.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      Due to its design and materials used, the present invention is not only different from prior art, it also overcomes the drawbacks of prior art.
      <br/>
      This is a one piece facial and neck exerciser that does not go into the mouth, it tones major facial muscles groups simultaneously, it can be used while doing other activities, and it tones the forehead.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      It will be apparent that these parts may be of other materials, instead of using grooves for the resistance band to fit into, hooks could be used, instead of velcro as a fastening means we could use snaps, buckles etc.
      <br/>
      Rather than the resistance bands being made of a resilient material, a spring coil could be used.
      <br/>
      The head band and neck band could be made of plastic, rubber, metal, styrofoam, or fiberglass.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the head band, chin cup, and neck band could be padded with a soft material.
      <br/>
      The construction of the one piece exercise device is merely for the purpose of illustration, it being obvious that other arrangement are possible.
    </p>
    <p num="65">Modifications and alterations in the form and arrangement of parts will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art and it is to be understood that such different forms of construction are contemplated as forming a part of this invention in so far as they fall within the scope of the following claims.</p>
    <p num="66">Thus the scope of the invention should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalents, rather than by the examples given.</p>
