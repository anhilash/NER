      A quenchant management system having a quenchant separation module for separating a heavy phase polymer such as polyalkylene glycol (PAG) from water.
      <br/>
      The quenchant separation module includes a heating section for elevating the temperature of the fluid to be separated to provide initial thermal separation.
      <br/>
      The quenchant separation module also includes a coalescer for further separating the heavy phase from the light phase of the input fluid.
      <br/>
      In order to obtain a predetermined polymer concentration and the heavy phase, the output flow rate of the coalescer is varied in accordance with the concentration and flow rate of the input fluid.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to separation of light and heavy phase liquids and, more particularly, to varying the output flow of a separation apparatus in order to separate light and heavy phase liquids so that the heavy phase liquid is separated to a predetermined concentration.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Discussion</p>
    <p num="4">
      In metal fabrication systems, it is often desirable to heat treat the metals to be fabricated.
      <br/>
      Heat treatment typically involves controlled heating and cooling of the metal in the solid state in order to obtain specific, desired properties.
      <br/>
      The particular type of heat treating process depends upon the desired result and characteristics of the metal.
      <br/>
      One operation performed in the heat treatment process involves rapidly cooling metal in order to fabricate hard metal.
      <br/>
      This process is referred to as quenching.
      <br/>
      Quenching involves cooling the metal at a rate sufficient to form the desired metallurgical properties while minimizing residual stresses, distortion, and the possibility of cracking.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      One particular quenching operation utilizes polymer quenchants.
      <br/>
      Polymer quenchants include solutions of organic polymers and water.
      <br/>
      The organic polymers contain corrosion inhibitors, as well as other additives, to produce a concentrated solution which is further diluted into a suitable quench solution.
      <br/>
      Examples of organic polymers used in polymer quenching operations include polyalkylene glycol (PAG), sodium polyacrylate (ACR), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVC), and other polymers.
      <br/>
      Because various polymer quenchants possess different properties, the selection of a particular polymer depends upon the desired quenching characteristics.
      <br/>
      The quenching characteristics can further be varied by selection of polymer concentration, temperature of the polymer, and the degree of agitation.
      <br/>
      Factors considered when selecting polymer quenchants include hardenability of the metal, thickness, and surface finish of the quenched metal, as well as other properties.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Polymer quenchants provide numerous advantages.
      <br/>
      Polymer quenchants are non-flammable, thereby significantly reducing the risk of fire and eliminating the need for expensive fire extinguishing systems.
      <br/>
      Polymer quenchants also provide a safer working environment by eliminating smoke and fumes during the quenching process and by eliminating the oily environments resulting from the use of more commonly used quenching oils.
      <br/>
      Polymer quenchants also provide numerous other technical advantages, as are known to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      One particular advantage of polymer quenchants is that varied concentrations of the polymer quenchant provide flexibility of the quenching process to achieve a particular, desired result.
      <br/>
      Recently, some quenchant installations have included forms of quenchant management systems for varying the concentration of quenchant in the quench tank in order to vary the properties of the quenching operation.
      <br/>
      The quenchant management system receives fluid from the quench tank and recovers heavy and light phase components from the liquid received from the quench tank.
      <br/>
      The heavy phase component comprises the polymer quenchant in predetermined concentrations, and the light phase component comprises substantially water with a typical low level polymer quenchant concentration.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Existing quenchant management systems recover the polymer quenchants through thermal separation or through reverse osmosis.
      <br/>
      In thermal separation, the polymer quenchant is heated within a tank to cause separation into a heavy phase and a light phase which are then individually removed.
      <br/>
      While thermal separation may be relatively inexpensive, thermal separation does not provide the desired accuracy in the concentrations of the heavy and light phase components, requiring additional apparatus and operations to verify the concentrations of the recovered polymer.
      <br/>
      Reverse osmosis, on the other hand, is more accurate in the recovery of heavy and light phase components than thermal separation, but is much more expensive to manufacture and maintain.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a quenchant management system which allows for accurate recovery of polymer quenchant in predetermined concentrations.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      This invention is directed to an apparatus for separating an input fluid into a first phase liquid and a second phase liquid, the first phase liquid having a desired concentration of a selected component.
      <br/>
      The apparatus includes a device for measuring a concentration of the component in the input fluid and a flow meter for determining an input flow rate of the input fluid.
      <br/>
      A separator separates the input fluid into a first output fluid comprising the first phase liquid and a second output fluid comprising the second phase liquid, each output fluid having a flow rate from the separator.
      <br/>
      A first flow meter determines the flow rate of one of the first or second output fluids, and a first flow valve varies the flow rate of the first output fluid.
      <br/>
      A controller adjusts the first flow valve in accordance with the input flow rate, the input fluid concentration, and the desired concentration of the selected component.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      This invention is also directed to a method for separating an input fluid into a first phase liquid and a second phase liquid, where the first phase liquid has a desired concentration of a selected component.
      <br/>
      The method includes the steps of determining a flow rate of the input fluid and determining the concentration of the selected component in the input fluid.
      <br/>
      The input fluid is passed through a separator to separate first phase liquid from the second phase liquid to provide a first output flow.
      <br/>
      The first output flow is made up of the first phase liquid, and a second output flow makes up the second phase liquid.
      <br/>
      A flow rate of one of the first or second output flows is determined.
      <br/>
      The flow rate of the first output flow is controlled in accordance with the concentration of the selected component in the input fluid, the flow rate of the input fluid, and the desired concentration of the selected component in the first phase liquid.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      FIGS. 1, 2a, and 2b depict the quenchant management system 10 arranged in accordance with the principals of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Quenchant management system 10 includes a quench tank system 12 which holds quenchant solution in which a particular material is immersed in order to effect the quench process.
      <br/>
      Preferably, quench tank system 12 contains a solution of polymer quenchant, such as polyalkylene glycol (PAG).
      <br/>
      However, one skilled in the art will recognize that other organic polymers such as sodium polyacrylate (ACR), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), and polyethyl oxazoline (PEO) may be readily substituted for PAG.
      <br/>
      The present invention is particularly directed to a method and apparatus for separating PAG from quench and rinse solutions in predetermined concentrations.
      <br/>
      The purpose of this recovery process is to reuse the resultant products, i.e., PAG solution and water solution in various future quenching processes.
      <br/>
      Quench tank system 12 communicates with other modules and storage tank systems in the quenchant management system 10 through a plurality of fluid transmission lines.
      <br/>
      In particular, a process line 14 enables transfer of the quench solution between quench tank system 12 and process storage tank system 18 and transfer of rinse solution between rinse tank system 16 and process storage tank system 18.
      <br/>
      Rinse tank system 16 preferably contains a solution of less than 2% PAG and primarily contains water.
      <br/>
      In operation, the metal component immersed in and removed from quench tank system 12 is next immersed in rinse tank system 16 to rinse quench solution from the metal component.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Process storage tank system 18 receives via process line 14 quench solution removed from quench tank system 12 and rinse tank system 16.
      <br/>
      Process storage tank system 18 contains PAG solution received from the respective tanks for input to quenchant separation module 20 for recovery of a solution containing a predetermined concentration of PAG and a water solution containing less than approximately 2% by volume PAG which is stored in water storage tank system 22.
      <br/>
      Quench tank system 12, rinse tank system 16, process storage tank system 18, and water storage tank system 22 are interconnected by a water line 24 to enable transfer of water therebetween.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Quenchant separation module 20 outputs preferably a 50% by volume solution of PAG to PAG storage tank system 26 via PAG return line 27 and outputs preferably an approximately 2% by volume or less solution of PAG to water storage tank system 22 on water return line 25.
      <br/>
      Quench tank system 12, and PAG storage tank system 26 are interconnected by a PAG line 28 to enable transfer of PAG therebetween.
      <br/>
      Process storage tank system 18 outputs process fluid to quenchant separation module 20 via feed line 30, and quenchant separation module 20 outputs fluid to process storage tank system 18 via a purge line 32, as will be described in detail further herein.
      <br/>
      As will also be described further herein, a plurality of valves are arranged in each of the fluid transfer lines 14, 24, and 28 in order to enable to transfer of a selected fluid from a first selected tank system to a second selected tank system.
      <br/>
      A controller 34 is electronically connected to several electronic sensors, valves, and the like in order to receive and process electrical signals as input data and output control signals for controlling quenchant management system 10.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Referring to FIG. 2a, quench tank system 12 and rinse tank system 16 are shown in detail.
      <br/>
      Quench tank system 12 includes a quench tank 36 containing a PAG quench solution 40 of a predetermined concentration.
      <br/>
      An agitator 38 agitates quench solution 40 in order to maintain a homogeneous concentration.
      <br/>
      A level sensor 41 outputs to controller 34 an electrical signal that varies in accordance with the level quench solution 40 to indicate the level within the quench tank 36.
      <br/>
      Quench tank system 12 includes an input and recirculation circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The input and circulation circuit includes a quench tank pump 42 which circulates fluid from quench tank 36 through a check valve 44, a filter 46, a process refractometer 48, a heat exchanger 50, and a check valve 52.
      <br/>
      The input and recirculation circuit also includes a flow block valve 54 which receives a control signal from controller 34 to enable or disable fluid flow through flow block valve 54.
      <br/>
      A pair of flow block valves 56 and 60 receives electrical signals from controller 34 in accordance with an output signal from a thermocouple 58.
      <br/>
      Thermocouple 58 outputs an electrical signal that varies in accordance with the temperature of quench solution 40.
      <br/>
      Flow block valves 56 and 60 operate in a complimentary manner based on the temperature of quench solution 40.
      <br/>
      When the temperature of quench solution 40 falls below a predetermined threshold, controller 34 outputs signals to close flow block valve 56 and open flow block valve 60 to bypass heat exchanger 50.
      <br/>
      Conversely, when the temperature of quench solution 40 rises above a predetermined threshold, controller 34 outputs control signals to open flow block valve 56 and close flow block valve 60 to circulate quench solution 40 through heat exchanger 50.
      <br/>
      Heat exchanger 50 reduces the temperature of quench solution 40.
      <br/>
      Heat exchanger 50 receives cooling water through cooling water pipes 62.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      With respect to other components of the input and recirculation circuit, differential pressure switch 54 monitors the pressure differential between the input and output of filter 46.
      <br/>
      Differential pressure switch 54 provides a bypass of filter 46 when the pressure drop across filter 46 exceeds a predetermined threshold, indicating that filter 46 may require maintenance.
      <br/>
      Process refractometer 48 measures the concentration of fluid flowing through process refractometer 48 and outputs a signal to controller 34 in accordance with the concentration.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The input and recirculation circuit for quench tank system 12 enables the input of PAG solution from PAG line 28 or water from water line 24.
      <br/>
      The input and recirculation system also enables quench tank 36 to receive fluid from or drain fluid to process line 14.
      <br/>
      To receive PAG solution fluid from PAG line 28, PAG solution of a predetermined concentration flows from PAG storage tank system 26 through a plurality of flow valves, all to be described in detail herein, through a first check valve 66 and a second check valve 68.
      <br/>
      During this operation, Controller 34 outputs a control signal to open flow block valve 54.
      <br/>
      Similarly, water may be input to quench tank 36 from water storage tank system 22 through a plurality of flow valves, all to be described further herein, flow block valve 70, and check valve 68.
      <br/>
      During this operation, electrical controller 34 generates an output signal to open flow block valve 70.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      It will be noted by one skilled in the art that fluid flow along PAG line 28 and water line 24 may only be into quench tank 36.
      <br/>
      With regard to process line 14, process line 14 can transfer fluid to quench tank 36 or receive fluid from quench tank 36.
      <br/>
      To input fluid to quench tank 36 from process line 14, controller 34 outputs control signals to open flow block valve 54 and flow block valve 74, thereby enabling fluid flow to quench tank 36 from process line 14.
      <br/>
      To drain fluid from quench tank 36 to process line 14, controller 34 outputs control signals to activate quench tank pump 42 and open flow block valve 103, thereby enabling fluid flow from quench tank 36 to process line 14.
      <br/>
      A check valve 76 prevents fluid from process line 14 from flowing to rinse tank system 16.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      FIG. 2a also depicts rinse tank system 16.
      <br/>
      Rinse tank system 16 includes a rinse tank 82 which preferably contains a solution 86 comprised of water and minimal amounts of PAG.
      <br/>
      Rinse tank 82 includes air inlets 84 to enable air agitation of solution 86 in rinse tank 82.
      <br/>
      A level sensor 88 outputs a signal to controller 34 in accordance with the level of solution 86 in rinse tank 80.
      <br/>
      Similar to quench tank system 12, rinse tank system 16 includes an input and recirculation circuit.
      <br/>
      The input and recirculation circuit enables rinse tank system 16 fluid to drain rinse to process line 14 and to receive water from water line 24.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The input and recirculation circuit includes a rinse tank pump 90 which receives as input fluid drained from rinse tank 82.
      <br/>
      During recirculation, rinse tank pump 90 outputs fluid through check valve 92, filter 94, check valve 96, flow block valve 100, and rinse tank 82.
      <br/>
      Filter 94 includes a differential pressure switch 98 which operates as described with respect to differential pressure switch 64 quench tank system 12.
      <br/>
      To initiate recirculation, controller 34 outputs control signals to activate rinse tank pump 90 and open flow block valve 100, causing circulation through the recirculation circuit described above.
      <br/>
      To input fluid from water line 24 to rinse tank 82, controller 34 outputs control signals to open flow block valve 72 and flow block valve 100 to enable water flow into rinse tank 82 from water line 24 through check valve 102, filter 94, check valve 96, and flow block valve 100.
      <br/>
      In order to drain fluid from rinse tank 82 to process line 14, controller 34 outputs control signals to activate rinse tank pump 90 and open flow block valve 104, as well as other flow block valves in process storage tank system 18, as will be described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring to FIG. 2b, the process storage tank system 18 will be described herein.
      <br/>
      Prior to describing process storage tank system 18 in detail it should be noted that process storage tank system 18 is described herein as a pair of process storage tanks which are interconnected but effectively function as one process storage tank.
      <br/>
      Utilization of a pair of process storage tanks interconnected depends upon specific design considerations, such as tank size requirements, which may dictate that a pair of process storage tanks should be used rather than one large process storage tank.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Process storage tank system 18 includes a pair of process storage tanks 110a, 110b which store process fluid 112 drained from quench tank 36 and rinse tank 82.
      <br/>
      Process storage tanks 110a, 110b include a respective pair of level sensors 132a, 132b which output electrical signals to controller 34.
      <br/>
      Process fluid 112 is output from and received by process storage tanks 110a, 110b via process line 14.
      <br/>
      During an input operation, controller 34 generates control signals to open flow block valves 114, 116, and 118.
      <br/>
      Fluid flow into process storage tank 110a occurs through flow block valves 114 and 116 via process line 14.
      <br/>
      Similarly, fluid flow into process storage tank 110b occurs through flow block valves 114 and 118 via process line 14.
      <br/>
      A check valve 120 prevents back flow into process storage tank pump 122.
      <br/>
      During fluid transfer from quench tank system 12 to process storage tank system 18, controller 34 outputs control signals to activate quench tank pump 42 and open flow block 74 to provide fluid flow into process line 14.

      Of particular interest in the present invention is obtaining predetermined PAG concentrations in the heavy phase and light phase liquids outputs by coalescer 202.

      As is known to those skilled in the art, the following equations describe a relationship between the concentration by percentage and volumetric flow rate in gallons per minute (GPM) of the fluid incoming to quenchant separation module 20, the heavy phase liquid, and the light phase liquid:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)  QL =QI -QH  (2)

      CH =heavy phase concentration (%), and
      <br/>
      CL =light phase concentration (%).

    <p num="44">
      From Equation 1, it can be seen that because the heavy phase CH and light phase CL concentrations are predetermined based on the desired concentration, both can be treated effectively as constants.
      <br/>
      The incoming concentration CI is input to controller 34 from process refractometer 124.
      <br/>
      The volumetric flow rates QI, QH, and QL are input to controller 34 from flow meters 182, 210, and 220.

      Referring to Equation 1, because all variables on the right side of Equation 1 are either predetermined as constants or measured and input to controller 34, the desired heavy phase volumetric flow rate QH can be determined.

      Controller 34 outputs control signals to flow valve 212 in order to adjust the heavy phase volumetric flow rate output by coalescer 202 to equal the calculated QH.

      As seen from Equation 2, the light phase volumetric flow rate QL is simply the difference between the incoming volumetric flow rate QI and the heavy phase volumetric flow rate QH.

      From Equations 1 and 2, one skilled in the art will recognize that the input flow QI is related to the light phase flow rate QL and the heavy phase flow rate QH.
