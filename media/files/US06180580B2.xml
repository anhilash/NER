    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to the cleaning of fabrics in soaking conditions, i.e., in conditions where the fabrics are left to soak in a soaking liquor comprising water and detergent ingredients, typically without undergoing any mechanical agitation, either as a first step before a typical washing operation, or as a single step.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Fabric soaking operations have been described in the art.
      <br/>
      In such soaking operations, fabrics are left in contact with a soaking liquor for a prolonged period of time typically ranging from a few minutes to overnight or even 24 hours.
      <br/>
      This laundering process has the advantage that it maximises the contact time between the fabrics and the key active ingredients of the soaking liquor.
      <br/>
      It also has the advantage that it reduces or eliminates the need for a typical laundering operation involving the need for mechanical agitation, or that it improves the efficiency of the subsequent typical laundering operation.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Such soaking operations are typically desirable to remove tough outdoor dirt from fabrics, such as particulate soil like mud, silt and/or clays.
      <br/>
      For example, clays usually have a microcrystalline mineral structure (e.g., hydrous aluminium silicate like illite, montmorillonite, kaolinite and the like) with the presence of an organic fraction.
      <br/>
      The organic fraction can contain a variety of compounds (e.g., humic acid, fulvic acid, plant/animal biomass and the like).
      <br/>
      Clays can also contain several kinds of metals (e.g., magnesium, calcium, potassium, iron and the like).
      <br/>
      However, such particulate soil is particularly difficult to remove from fabrics.
      <br/>
      Indeed, it is believed that the very fine dirt grains like clays or silt, typically below 0.002 mm in size, can insert among fabric fibers and steadily stick to the surface of the fibers.
      <br/>
      This problem is particularly acute with socks which are most exposed to silt and clay pick-up.
      <br/>
      Also such soaking operations are not fully satisfactory regarding the stain removal performance delivered on enzymatic stains or even on bleachable stains.
      <br/>
      Enzymatic stains are typically composed of carbohydrates and proteinaceus soil, like blood.
      <br/>
      It has now been observed that enzymatic stains may act as a glue for particulate soil on fabrics, thus removing such enzymatic stains may facilitate the removal of particulate soil from fabrics.
    </p>
    <p num="4">It is thus an object of the present invention to improve the stain removal of particulate soils, mud and/or clay, as well as of enzymatic stains and bleachable stains.</p>
    <p num="5">
      It has been found that this object can be met by soaking fabrics in an aqueous soaking liquor comprising an effective amount of a granular soaking detergent composition comprising an oxygen bleach, an anionic surfactant of the formula R-SO3M, wherein R is a substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched hydrocarbon chain having from 6 to 40 carbon atoms and M is H or a cation, and a sorbitan ester, as described herein after.
      <br/>
      Indeed, it has been found that by combining sorbitan ester and such an anionic surfactant as described herein, on top of an oxygen bleach, in a soaking composition, improved stain removal performance is delivered on stains like tough outdoor dirt like particulate soil, bleachable stains as well as enzymatic stains, when used under soaking conditions (i.e., when left in contact for prolonged period of time typically up to 24 hours), as compared to the stain removal performance delivered with the same composition being free of such a sorbitan ester and/or anionic surfactant as described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      An advantage of the present invention is that not only improved particulate soil removal performance is delivered but also that the soil redeposition on fabrics in prolonged soaking condition is prevented.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the soaking compositions of the present invention comprising sorbitan ester, such an anionic surfactant and oxygen bleach also provide effective stain removal performance on other types of stains like greasy stains, e.g., dirty motor oil, spaghetti sauce.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      An advantage of the present invention is that the stain removal performance, when soaking a fabric in presence of a soaking composition comprising an oxygen bleach, such an anionic surfactant and a sorbitan ester, is improved even in the presence of relatively high levels of hardness ions.
      <br/>
      Indeed, the presence of hardness ions (calcium or magnesium ions), which occur naturally in the soaking liquor, in particular, can reduce surfactant performance and eventually precipitate the surfactant from the soaking liquor as a calcium or magnesium salt.
      <br/>
      This phenomen occurs less when using a sorbitan ester together with an anionic sulphonate surfactant as defined herein.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the soaking detergent manufacturer may make use of builders which are not the more performing at sequestering free hardness ions, and thus may use less expensive builders in such a soaking composition.

      In the soaking process herein, a soaking composition described hereinabove is diluted in an appropriate amount of water to produce a soaking liquor.
      <br/>
      Suitable doses may range from 45 to 50 grams of soaking composition in 3.5 to 5 liters of water, down to 90 to 100 grams of soaking composition in 20 to 45 liters of water.
      <br/>
      Typically one dose is 45-50 grams in 3.5 to 5 liters for a concentrated soak (bucket/sink).
      <br/>
      For washing machine soaked, the dose is 90-100 grams in about 20 (Europe) to 45 (US) liters of water.
      <br/>
      The fabrics to be soaked are then immersed in the soaking liquor for an appropriate period of time.
      <br/>
      There are factors which may influence overall performance of the process on particulate dirt/soils.
      <br/>
      Such factors include prolonged soaking time.
      <br/>
      Indeed, the longer fabrics are soaked, the better the end results.
      <br/>
      Ideally, soaking time is overnight, i.e., 8 hours up to 24 hours, preferably 12 hours to 24 hours.
      <br/>
      Another factor is the initial warm or warmluke temperature.
      <br/>
      Indeed, higher initial temperatures of the soaking liquors ensure large benefits in performance.
    </p>
    <p num="94">The process herein is suitable for cleaning a variety of fabrics, but finds a preferred application in the soaking of socks, which are particularly exposed to silt and clay pick-up.</p>
    <p num="95">The Stain Removal Performance Test Method</p>
    <p num="96">
      The stain removal performance of a given composition on a soiled fabric under soaking conditions, may be evaluated by the following test method.
      <br/>
      Soaking liquors are formed by diluting for instance 45 g of the soaking compositions herein in 3.78 liter of water or 90 g of the soaking composition in 45 liters of water.
      <br/>
      Fabrics are then immersed in the resulting soaking liquor for a time ranging from more than 1 hour to 18 hours.
      <br/>
      Finally, the fabrics are removed from the soaking liquors, rinsed with water and washed with a regular washing process, handwash or washing machine wash, with a regular detergent, with or without re-using the soaking liquor, then said fabrics are left to dry.
    </p>
    <p num="97">For example, typical soiled fabrics to be used in this stain removal performance test may be commercially available from EMC (Empirical Manufacturing Company) Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, such as clay, grass, spaghetti sauce, gravy, dirty motor oil, make-up, barbecue sauce, tea, blood on two different substrates: cotton (CW120) and polycotton (PCW28).</p>
    <p num="98">
      The stain removal performance may be evaluated by comparing side by side the soiled fabrics treated with the soaking composition according to the present invention with those treated with the reference, e.g., the same soaking composition without such a sorbitan ester and/or anionic sulphonate surfactant according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      A visual grading scale may be used to assign differences in panel score units (psu), in a range from 0 to 4.
