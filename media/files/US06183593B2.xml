      An adhesive composition that contains cyanoacrylate monomers and cyclic or alkyl- or phenyl-terminated linear polydimethylsiloxane is particularly useful in applications requiring flexibility and elasticity.

    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="1">The invention relates to monomer and polymer adhesive and sealant compositions, and to their production and use for industrial and medical applications.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Monomer and polymer adhesives are used in both industrial (including household) and medical applications.
      <br/>
      Included among these adhesives are the 1,1-disubstituted ethylene monomers and polymers, such as the  ALPHA -cyanoacrylates.
      <br/>
      Since the discovery of the adhesive properties of such monomers and polymers, they have found wide use due to the speed with which they cure, the strength of the resulting bond formed, and their relative ease of use.
      <br/>
      These characteristics have made the  ALPHA -cyanoacrylate adhesives the primary choice for numerous applications such as bonding plastics, rubbers, glass, metals, wood, and, more recently, biological tissues.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      It is known that monomeric forms of  ALPHA -cyanoacrylates are extremely reactive, polymerizing rapidly in the presence of even minute amounts of an initiator, including moisture present in the air or on moist surfaces such as animal (including human) tissue.
      <br/>
      Monomers of  ALPHA -cyanoacrylates are anionically polymerizable or free radical polymerizable, or polymerizable by zwitterions or ion pairs to form polymers.
      <br/>
      Once polymerization has been initiated, the cure rate can be very rapid.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Medical applications of 1,1-disubstituted ethylene adhesive compositions include use as an alternate or an adjunct to surgical sutures and/or staples in wound closure, as well as for covering and protecting surface wounds such as lacerations, abrasions, burns, stomatitis, sores, minor cuts and scrapes, and other wounds.
      <br/>
      When an adhesive is applied to surfaces to be joined, it is usually applied in its monomeric form, and the resultant polymerization gives rise to the desired adhesive bond.
    </p>
    <p num="5">A concern in the use of adhesive compositions for treating wounds is the flexibility and elasticity of the cured adhesive, particularly in the face and body joint areas, such as hands, feet, elbows and knees.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Polymerized cyanoacrylate compositions are in general not flexible.
      <br/>
      Increased flexibility would improve the utility of cyanoacrylate compositions, particularly in body joint areas.
      <br/>
      Improved flexibility and elasticity would also make cyanoacrylate compositions better suited to use as drug delivery devices and the like under some circumstances.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Thus, a need exists for improved adhesive compositions, especially for medical uses, wherein the flexibility and elasticity of the adhesive is improved and the performance of the adhesive composition is not compromised.
      <br/>
      In particular, the need exists for a monomeric adhesive composition that possesses improved flexibility.
    </p>

      Polydimethylsiloxane (or PDMS) is a silicone compound that was developed for use as a dielectric coolant and in solar energy installations.
      <br/>
      However, it has also been used in other applications.

    <p num="9">
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,477,607, 4,533,422 and Re. 32,889, all to Litke, disclose cyanoacrylate compositions that employ fumed silicas treated with polydimethylsiloxane or trialkoxyalkylsilane to improve the thixotropic properties of the compositions.
      <br/>
      Likewise, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,764,545 and 4,686,247 to Yosida disclose an adhesive composition comprising an alpha cyanoacrylate and a silica surface-treated respectively with polydimethylsiloxane and with hexamethyldisilazane.
      <br/>
      Similarly, JP 06-122853 discloses an adhesive composition comprising an alpha cyanoacrylate and a hydrophobic silica surface-treated with dimethyldichlorosilane; U.S. Pat. No. 4,636,539 to Harris et al. discloses an adhesive comprising cyanoacrylate adhesive, fumed silica filler treated with polydialkylsiloxane, and calixarene compound; U.S. Pat. No. 4,180,911 to Bullock discloses a composition and method for use of a cyanoacrylate resin and a silane-treated inorganic powder in direct bonding of an orthodontic bracket structure to teeth and other dental applications; U.S. Pat. No. 4,713,405 to Koga et al. discloses an adhesive composition comprising an alpha cyanoacrylate and a fumed silica having a surface treated with a dimethyldichlorosilane and trialkyl borate; U.S. Pat. No. 5,373,035 to Uemura et al. discloses an adhesive composition comprising an alpha cyanoacrylate and a hydrophobic silica surface-treated with dimethyldichlorosilane; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,248,708 to Uemura et al. discloses an adhesive composition having a particular alpha cyanoacrylate, a fine silica and silanol group.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,214,093 to Nell et al. discloses an adhesive mixture for nonsurgical blepharoplasty.
      <br/>
      In the main embodiments, the base adhesive component is an oxygen permeable polysiloxane in a solvent.
      <br/>
      A less preferred embodiment includes a homogeneous mixture of cyanoacrylate adhesive and two separate miscible silicon oil components that are said to provide lubrication and breathability to the skin surface.
      <br/>
      These components are disclosed to be used in amounts of 50% cyanoacrylatc, 25% polydimethylsiloxane and 25% 3-methacryloxy propyltris (trimethoxysiloxy) silane, and can be applied serially or in a mixture.
      <br/>
      The patent states that the mixture adheres in approximately five minutes and remains somewhat flexible during that time.
      <br/>
      It provides no further detail about the PDMS other than to indicate that it is "very oily and will penetrate the surface of the tissue to some extent." It is noted that silanes as a general matter raise toxicity issues, although this is not discussed in the Nell patent.

      The polydimethylsiloxane suitable for use in the present invention can be alkyl- or phenyl-terminated linear or cyclic or a mixture thereof.
      <br/>
      Although not limited thereto, the PDMS used in the present invention is preferably a relatively short or small compound, as opposed to a long chain polymer.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, the PDMS compound preferably has a low molecular weight, e.g., has a small number of monomer units, and also a low viscosity.
      <br/>
      The PDMS compound is selected such that it is compatible with the monomer (i.e., does not adversely affect polymerization, cure properties, or shelf-life).
      <br/>
      Preferably, the polydimethylsiloxane is soluble (i.e., dissolves) in the monomer composition at room temperature (i.e., 20-25 (degree)  C.) so that it may be combined into the monomer composition without excessive heating of the monomer composition.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Solubility is preferred because a higher elongation effect can be provided by the agent upon polymerization of the adhesive composition when it is dispersed throughout the monomer composition in the form of a solution.
      <br/>
      In embodiments, the adhesive composition, including the polydimethylsiloxane, can provide an elongation at break of at least 100%, preferably 200-600%, 300-500% or 400-500%, of a polymerized film of the adhesive.
      <br/>
      If the polydimethylsiloxane is not in the form of a solution, then it is possible that it may settle or otherwise agglomerate, and thereby, upon subsequent polymerization of the composition, not provide the desired consistent elongation effect to the polymerized adhesive composition
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Thus, it is preferred in embodiments that the polydimethylsiloxane exhibits an at least substantially uniform concentration throughout the monomer composition.
      <br/>
      Where excess polydimethylsiloxane is added to the composition, i.e., an amount above the solubility point of the PDMS, it is acceptable that a portion of the PDMS remains undissolved in the composition so long as it does not act as two separate phases.
      <br/>
      Thus for example, in embodiments a stable microemulsion (with only microphases) may be acceptable.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The amount of polydimethylsiloxane that is added to the monomer composition can depend upon the selection of the specific PDMS and the specific monomer.
      <br/>
      For example, linear polydimethylsiloxane can often be included in a concentration of about 5-25 % by weight, preferably about 5-23% by weight, such as 10-15% by weight, of the adhesive composition relative to the total monomer and polydimethylsiloxane content.
      <br/>
      Cyclic polydimethylsiloxane can often be included in a concentration of about 5-50% by weight, preferably about 10-30% by weight, such as 10-15, 20 or 25% by weight of the adhesive composition.
      <br/>
      As noted above, however, contents above these ranges can also be used as desired.
      <br/>
      The amount of polydimethylsiloxane to be used can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using known techniques without undue experimentation in light of the present disclosure.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The polydimethylsiloxane preferably has a low weight average molecular weight.
      <br/>
      For example, suitable polydimethylsiloxanes preferably have a weight average molecular weight of from about 230 to about 1,500, more preferably from about 300 to about 1,000.
      <br/>
      Molecular weights outside of these ranges can also be used depending upon the specific polydimethylsiloxane and monomer composition so long as they are soluble or in a microemulsion in the adhesive composition as discussed above.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In exemplary embodiments, a linear polydimethylsiloxane averaging from two to ten, such as two to eight, for example, three, four, five or six monomer units, is preferred.
      <br/>
      One particularly preferred exemplary linear PDMS is a linear trimethylsiloxy terminated polydimethylsiloxane (TMDS) (CAS -9016-00-6), having a weight average molecular weight of 770, and a viscosity of about 5 centipoise at 25 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In other embodiments, the polydimethylsiloxane can be a cyclic polydimethylsiloxane.
      <br/>
      Such cyclic PDMS compounds are preferably also relatively small, having, for example, from two to ten, such as two to six, for example two to five monomer units.
      <br/>
      In an exemplary embodiment, a four monomer unit cyclic polydimethylsiloxane can be used.
      <br/>
      In embodiments, the cyclic PDMS can be selected from octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMTS), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (DMPS) and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (DMHS).
      <br/>
      One exemplary cyclic PDMS is a product of United Chemical Technologies Inc. that has the formula C8 H24 O4 Si4 (CAS -556-67-2) having a weight average molecular weight of 296.16, a density of 0.956 at 20 (degree)  C. and a viscosity of about 2.3 centipoise at 25 (degree)  C.

    <p num="27">
      The linear PDMS is terminated with alkyl or phenyl groups.

      The linear or cyclic PDMS can optionally include or be free of alkyl side chain groups.
      <br/>
      Terminal and side chain groups can include, but are not limited to, alkyl groups with one to twelve, preferably 1-8 such as 1-6 or 1-4, carbon atoms, including for example methyl, ethyl or propyl groups.

      Thus n may be, for example, 2 or 3 to 12, preferably 4 to 10 or 4 to 8.
      <br/>
      One or more of the methyl groups may be alkyl substituted.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The polydimethylsiloxane for use in the present invention preferably has a low viscosity, such as from about 1 to about 15 centipoise at 25 (degree)  C., as measured by a Brookfield Viscometer.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the polydimethylsiloxane has a viscosity of from about 2 to about 10 centipoise, such as from about 5 to about 7.5 centipoise at 25 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In embodiments, the polydimethylsiloxane is purified prior to mixing with the polymerizable monomer.
      <br/>
      A polydimethylsiloxane that is at least 98.5% by weight pure (i.e., containing 1.5% by weight or less impurities or ingredients other than polydimethylsiloxane) is preferred.
      <br/>
      Purification can be achieved, for example, by distillation.
    </p>
    <p num="33">A suitable procedure for selecting a polydimethylsiloxane involves selecting a group of potential polydimethylsiloxanes, assessing their solubility and stability in the monomer composition, and optionally testing for their compatibility with one or more sterilization procedures.</p>
    <p num="34">
      Potential polydimethylsiloxanes for testing can readily be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art from known sources in accordance with the disclosure herein.
      <br/>
      Once a potential agent is selected, it can be tested for solubility and stability in the monomer composition, such as by mixing an appropriate amount of the polydimethylsiloxane with a desired amount of the monomer composition and any other desired additives.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      It is important to maintain the stability of the monomer composition within acceptable levels, such as commercially acceptable levels whereby the composition is not prematurely polymerized prior to application of the monomer composition to a desired substrate.
      <br/>
      One measure of the stability of the composition, other than a visual examination of the properties of the composition, is a measure of any changes in viscosity of the composition from a time prior to adding the polydimethylsiloxane to a time after adding the polydimethylsiloxane.
      <br/>
      For example, dramatic increases or decreases in viscosity can indicate instability of the composition, such as premature polymerization or other chemical degradation of the monomer composition or components thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In embodiments of the present invention, it is preferred that the polydimethylsiloxane exhibit stability in the monomer composition for at least five minutes after mixing or dissolving the polydimethylsiloxane in the polymerizable monomer compound.
      <br/>
      More preferably, stability of the monomer composition is maintained for a time period sufficient to provide a commercially significant shelf-life to the monomer composition, such as 12, 18, or preferably 24 or more months.
      <br/>
      As used herein, "stability" refers to the composition maintaining a commercially acceptable form for the prescribed amount of time.
      <br/>
      That is, the composition does not prematurely polymerize or otherwise change form or degrade to the point that the composition is not useful for its intended purpose.
      <br/>
      Thus, while some polymerization or thickening of the composition may occur, such as can be measured by changes in viscosity of the composition, such change is not so extensive as to destroy or significantly impair the usefulness of the composition.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In embodiments, the adhesive composition has a viscosity of about 1-5000 centipoise, preferably 1-600 centipoise, more preferably 1-100 or 2-50 centipoise such as 2-18, 2-10 centipoise, or 30-500 such as 50-100 or 100-200 centipoise at 25 (degree)  C. The viscosity can be select according to the proposed use--e.g., 1-100 centipoise for certain uses and 100-200 centipoise for other uses.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the composition may be a gel, e.g., 50,000-500,000 centipoise at 25 (degree)  C. The viscosity of the adhesive composition can be measured with a Brookfield Viscometer.
      <br/>
      Additionally, in embodiments where a sterilization treatment is applied, the viscosity of the composition should preferably be maintained or increased by a controlled and acceptable amount after sterilization.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Compatibility of the polydimethylsiloxane-containing composition with one or more sterilization procedures is preferred in embodiments of the present invention because many uses of the polymerizable monomer compositions, such as many surgical and other medical applications, require sterilized products.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments, there is substantially no initiation of polymerization of monomeric liquid adhesive compositions that affects the utility of the monomer or monomers caused by the sterilization process.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Sterilization of the monomer composition and/or its packaging can be accomplished by techniques known to the skilled artisan, and is preferably accomplished by methods including, but not limited to, chemical, physical, and/or irradiation methods.
      <br/>
      Examples of chemical methods include, but are not limited to, exposure to ethylene oxide or hydrogen peroxide vapor.
      <br/>
      Examples of physical methods include, but are not limited to, sterilization by heat (dry or moist) or retoit canning.
