    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="13">
      A rechargeable flashlight including a body 10 which has a substantially regular first cross-sectional area as defined between the base 11 of the body 10 and the top portion of the body as defined in the area 12.
      <br/>
      The first cross-sectional area is defined on the outside by an octagonal configuration 13 and the internal configuration is formed substantially as a circular structure 14.
      <br/>
      The body 10 includes a barrel.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Above the body portion 10 there is an intermediate portion 15 defined by a second crosssectional area.
      <br/>
      The intermediate portion 15 is defined between the ends 16 and 17 of the arrows show in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Above the intermediate portion 15 there is a head portion 18 which is relatively enlarged.
      <br/>
      The intermediate portion includes a protrusion 60 on the side, namely on one of the octagonal sides of the flashlight.
      <br/>
      The protrusion is for housing, in part, a switching device.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The head portion 18 includes a lens 19 and within the lens a bulb 20.
      <br/>
      There is also located a shroud 21 which is over-molded on the lens 19.
      <br/>
      This provides increased protection to the lens 19.
      <br/>
      A lens O ring 100 is provided between the head 18 and the intermediate portion 15 to facilitate a tight fit and reduce moisture and dust ingress.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The body portion 10 outside surface octagonal configuration includes two circumferential lips 22 and 23.
      <br/>
      Lip 22 is located substantially at the uppermost portion of the body portion 10 around the outside.
      <br/>
      The lip 23 is located towards the base portion 11 around the outside of the body portion 10.
      <br/>
      These inset lips provide a receiving area 24 for receiving an extruded flexible and switchable sleeve 25 which can fit within the circumferential trough formed between the lips 22 and 23.
      <br/>
      The outside surface 26 of the sleeve 25 is substantially flush with the outside surface 27 of the body portion 10 when in position between the lips.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The intermediate portion 15 has a second cross-sectional area which is relatively larger than the first cross-sectional area of the body portion 10.
      <br/>
      The second cross-sectional area extends relatively to one side of the longitudinal axis 29 running through the body portion 10 and it is this extended portion 60 which acts to receive the switching device.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      At the intermediate portion 15 there is provided a transverse aperture 31 through which a manually operable movable switching arm and push button 32 of the switch device or assembly 33 is located.
      <br/>
      A switch pad button cover 132 is provided to the movable arm 32.
      <br/>
      The manually operable switch arm 32 can be depressed to activate a spring operated switch assembly 33 so as to close and open electrical contacts in the switch device 33.
      <br/>
      The opposite end of the switch device 33 is connected with electrical contacts 134, which arc mounted as a pair adjacent each other transversely in the extended portion 15 of the body, namely the intermediate portion below the head 18.
      <br/>
      Connecting the protrusion 60 of the extended intermediate portion 15 with the body portion 10, there is a relatively tapered zone 35.
      <br/>
      Connecting the extended intermediate portion 15 with the head potion 18, there is also a tapered zone 36.
      <br/>
      The head portion 18 is formed such as to have a relatively greater cross-section that the cross-section than the intermediate portion 15.
      <br/>
      The location of the enlarged portion 18 is relatively centrally formed relative to the longitudinal axis 29.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The trailing end of the switch device assembly 33 includes a rigid central stud-like contact 137, which is directed downwardly towards a top portion 38 of a battery pack 139.
      <br/>
      There is a helical spring 140 mounted at the base area 11 of the body and is directed to the base 41 of the battery pack 139.
      <br/>
      As such, the helical spring 140 and the central contact 137 in opposition to each other, and the battery pack 139 is biased towards to contact 137 by the helical spring in order to maintain electrical contact when subjected to an impact.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      There is also an elongated contact strip 141 which runs up the inside of the battery and connects the negative end of the lower battery cell with circular ring 142 at the top of the battery.
      <br/>
      The battery pack 139 connects with the switch assembly 33 appropriately through a leaf spring 242 mounted tangentially relative to the battery pack 139.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      When the operational arm and push button 132 of the switch 33 acts to press and depress the plunger mechanism 42 of the switch device assembly 33, the circuit connecting the battery pack 139 between the bulb 20 is made or broken as established through the switch device assembly 33 and electrical contacts within the switch device assembly 33.
      <br/>
      The operation of the switch assembly 33 is transverse or relatively radial to the longitudinal axis 29 of the body of the flashlight.
      <br/>
      The operational arm and push button 32 and the plunger 42 acts relatively radially low transversally and the operational arm and push button 32 is relatively located in a radially opposite position to the contacts 34 on the flashlight.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The switch assembly 33 include the plunger 42 which operates with one or more springs 45 which are helically and coaxially mounted around the plunger 42.
      <br/>
      Suitable contacts 45 are provided for opening and closing and making the flashlight circuit between the battery and the bulb.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A suitable button padding 132 is provided to the arm and push button 32 such as to provide for positive engagement by finger operation of a user.
      <br/>
      The outside of the flashlight therefore has the extruded sleeve 25, a suitable padding on the operational button and a shroud 21 around the lens.
      <br/>
      Thus, the outside of the flashlight is suitably protected for rugged use.
      <br/>
      Within the flashlight mechanism as indicated, the battery is suitably buffered for shock between the springs 37 and 140.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The operation of the switch assembly 33 in a manner transverse to the longitudinal direction of the flashlight also provides for effective and positive movement.
      <br/>
      By locating the switch 33 in the intermediate section of the flashlight, there is greater width and cross-sectional area to accommodate the switch device 33 in a convenient place.
      <br/>
      Having the location of the switch 33 radially opposite the contact also provides for an effective assembly and location of these two components.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      At the base 11 of the body 10, there is a cap 43 which fits over an aperture 44 in the base of the body 10 and is screw connected to the base of the body 10.
      <br/>
      The battery pack 139 fits into the base through the rear entry into the flashlight.
      <br/>
      The helical spring 140 is not in electrical with the battery pack 139.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      As can be seen in FIG. 2 the two contacts 134 are transversely located relative to each other on one face of the octagonal surface 13 of the body 10.
      <br/>
      The operating button 132 of the switch device 33 is shown in the front on the panel 45 of the body 10.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The charger device includes a mounting plate 46 which has two mounting holes 47, 48 for mounting the charger 46 on a suitable base.
      <br/>
      An LED 49 indicates the operational status of the charger 46.
      <br/>
      The charger 46 includes two articulating arms or jaws 50 and 51 which are pivotally mounted to articulate relatively above pivots 52 and 53.
      <br/>
      The mounting pivots 52 and 53 are of a spring nature and the tip 54 of arm 51 and tip 55 of arm 50 engage the outer surface of the body 10 of the flashlight.
      <br/>
      A suitable spring acts to cause the articulating arms 50 and 51 to be urged inwardly towards the engaging position as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      When the arms 50 and 51 are open as shown in FIG. 7, it is against the spring action and this allows the flashlight to enter into the position whereby the contacts 34 can engage mating contacts 56 which extend outwardly from the charger member.
      <br/>
      A back plate is held onto the front face of the charger 46 through screws in holes 147, 148 and 149.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The articulating arms 50 and 51 engage the body portion 10 below the intermediate section 15 of the flashlight.
      <br/>
      The contacts 56 are located on the charger 46 so they engage the contacts 134 which are also positioned below the intermediate section 15 of the flashlight.
      <br/>
      The contacts 56 are spring loaded to be urged outwardly to engage the contacts 34.
      <br/>
      The charger 46 includes conventional circuitry to act as a charger.
      <br/>
      It can be set up for connection with 120 volt main supply or 12 volt DC supply.
      <br/>
      LED 48 indicates the operational condition of the charger and flashlight.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      By having the tips 54 and 55 engage the body of the flashlight in the area 10, namely below the intermediate section 15, the tips and the respective arms 50 and 51 do not have to open and close unduly over a large diameter.
      <br/>
      The ends of the tips 54 and 55 are shaped to conform with a octagonal formation of the outside surface of the body 10.
      <br/>
      This permits for engagement in an embracing manner with the body 10.
      <br/>
      The inside surface 59 of the charger 46 also provides a mating interface with the hexagonal surface 13.
      <br/>
      As can be seen in FIG. 6, the combination of the mating surface 59 on the body of the charger 46 and the shapes of the arms 50 and 51 are such that seven sides of the octagonal formation 13 are embraced when the body 10 is in position properly in the charger 46.
      <br/>
      This permits for a firm location of the flashlight 10 in the charger 46 when recharging is to be affected.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Many other forms of the invention exist, each differing from the other in matters of detail only.</p>
    <p num="31">
      For instance, instead of having the contacts 34 located on the body portion 10, namely below the intermediate portion 15, it is possible to have a configuration where the contacts are on the greater cross-sectional area of the intermediate section 15.
      <br/>
      In other cases, the recharging device may be formed with a mechanism different to the articulating jaws.
      <br/>
      Only one jaw may articulate, and the other may be stationary in some situations.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In yet different configuration, instead of having the shock-absorbing sleeve extruded around the body 10, the body 10 itself may be formed from material sufficiently sturdy to be resilient to shock.
      <br/>
      Likewise, there can be situations without a shock-absorbing shroud around the lens.
      <br/>
      Instead of springs on either side of the rechargeable battery which can be of a nickel-cadmium configuration, there can be different spring formations to provide effective shock absorbing characteristics to either side of the battery.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      There is also provided a centering protrusion 200 in the face of the charger 46 for mating with a slot 201 running vertically in the flashlight.
      <br/>
      This slot and protrusion can be located between the respective contacts 34 and they facilitate alignment of the flashlight in the charger 46.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In FIGS. 14-19 there are shown different views of the flashlight body in accordance with the invention.
