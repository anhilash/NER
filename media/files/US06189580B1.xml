      The improved vial transfer assembly or vial transferset may be attached to a vial under sterile conditions and used to transfer fluid to or from a conventional vial.
      <br/>
      The transferset includes a tubular transfer member which is sealingly supported on the rim portion of a vial stopper, a piercing member having a piercing end reciprocally supported by an internal surface of the transfer member, a cap enclosing the tubular transfer member and a collar preferably formed of a malleable material which secures the assembly on the stopper, which is crimped beneath the vial rim.
      <br/>
      The piercing member has a generally longitudinal external channel which, upon piercing the planar portion of the stopper, establishes fluid communication with the vial through the tubular transfer member.
      <br/>
      The distal end of the tubular transfer member includes a Luer lock for establishing fluid communication to a syringe, IV set or the like.
      <br/>
      An annular lip on the proximate end of the tubular transfer member stretches and prestresses the central portion of the planar stopper rim and the piercing member is supported in the transferset such that the piercing end deforms the prestressed stopper rim portion.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to an improved vial connector assembly or transferset, a method of affixing a transferset to a vial and a method of establishing fluid communication between a vial and syringe, IV set or the like which permits the use of a conventional or standard vial and syringe or the like to transfer fluid from a syringe to a vial or withdraw liquid medicament, for example, from a vial to a syringe.
      <br/>
      The improved transferset and method of this invention results in improved aspiration or reaspiration of a vial and improved sealing of the communication between a vial and a syringe.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      It is now conventional to reduce certain drugs to a dry or powdered form to increase the shelf life of drugs and reduce inventory space.
      <br/>
      Such dry or powdered drugs are generally stored in a sealed vial and reconstituted into liquid form for administration to a patient by adding a diluent or solvent.
      <br/>
      A conventional vial includes an open end, a rim surrounding the open end and a reduced diameter neck portion adjacent the rim.
      <br/>
      The vial is conventionally sealed with an elastomeric stopper which includes a portion inserted into the neck of the vial and a planar rim portion which overlies the vial rim.
      <br/>
      The stopper is normally secured to the vial rim with an aluminum collar or cap.
      <br/>
      The aluminum collar includes a tubular portion which surrounds the rim portions of the stopper and vial, an inwardly projecting annular portion which overlies the rim portion of the stopper and a distal portion which is crimped into the vial neck beneath the vial rim portion.
      <br/>
      Because aluminum is malleable, the collar accommodates the buildup of tolerances of the dimensions of the stopper and vial rim.
      <br/>
      The dimensions and tolerances of standard vials and stoppers are set by the International Standards Organization (ISO).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A powdered drug is generally reconstituted by inserting the needle of a syringe through the pierceable stopper on the vial and injecting a diluent, such as water, or a solvent into the vial.
      <br/>
      The reconstituted drug is then reaspirated from the vial with the same or a different syringe after mining the diluent or solvent with the dry drug.
      <br/>
      As will be understood, this method exposes the healthcare worker to being pricked by the needle of the syringe and contamination of the needle or the drug
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The prior art has therefore proposed various fluid or liquid transfer assemblies which may be secured to a vial under sterile conditions and which may then utilized to transfer liquid, such as a diluent or solvent, from a syringe to a vial and reconstituted medicament from the vial to a syringe which prevent contamination of the liquid medicament.
      <br/>
      In the most preferred embodiments, the assembly is protected from contamination by a cap or cover which is removed only prior to use.
      <br/>
      In the embodiments disclosed in the prior art, the transfer assembly includes a needle which pierces the stopper of the vial and the liquid is transferred through the needle lumen as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,429,256. In other embodiments, the conventional vial stopper is eliminated in favor of a fluid transfer assembly having a rubber stopper which is inserted into the neck of the vial without a planar rim portion.
      <br/>
      The stopper remains within the vial until such time as reconstitution of the drug is required.
      <br/>
      When the transfer assembly is actuated, the stopper is urged toward the interior of the vial to open the neck, thereby permitting fluid flow through the transfer assembly into the vial body.
      <br/>
      Examples of such embodiments include the MONOVIAL.RTM. line of drug delivery devices manufactured and sold by Becton Dickinson Pharmaceutical Systems of Le Pont de Claix, France and exemplified by U.S. Pat. No. 5,358,501. Although this embodiment is an excellent drug reconstitution system having superior properties, particularly convenience of use and maintenance of the sterile conditions of the drug in the vial, particularly where the vial is of a relatively large size, typically twelve milliliters or more, pharmaceutical companies have expressed an interest in an approach where the vial may also be a smaller size.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The need therefore remains for a vial transferset which may be utilized with an ISO standard vial and stopper to transfer liquid from a conventional syringe to the vial or from a vial to a syringe after reconstituting a drug, for example, which is relatively simple in design and which reduces or eliminates contamination of the drug.
      <br/>
      It would also be desimble to eliminate the use of a conventional syringe needle to pierce the elastomeric stopper which seals the vial.
      <br/>
      As will be understood by those skilled in the art, a conventional syringe needle is thin and has an internal axial lumen or bore.
      <br/>
      The needle must therefore be withdrawn during aspiration of the vial or reaspiration where the medicament is reconstituted in the vial following delivery of a diluent or solvent to the vial.
      <br/>
      Where the needle is not substantially completely withdrawn during reaspiration of the vial, liquid medicament remains in the vial because the only liquid communication with the syringe is through the needle lumen.
      <br/>
      This may be a problem particularly where the vial is relatively small.
      <br/>
      For example, assuming a twenty millimeter long needle which pierces a two to three millimeter thick stopper, if the needle is pushed all the way through the stopper, there may be distance of as much as seventeen millimeters between the needle opening and the inner surface of the stopper.
      <br/>
      This amount below the needle lumen will not be reaspirated unless the needle is substantially withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p num="7">The vial transferset and method of this invention solves these problems by providing a relatively simple and efficient fluid transfer assembly which may be affixed to an ISO standard vial which assures complete reaspiration of the vial and which does not require accurate positioning of the needle during reaspiration.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The vial transferset or fluid transfer assembly of this invention is adapted to establish fluid communication between a syringe, intravenous (V) device or the like and a sealed vial.
      <br/>
      As set forth above, the syringe and vial may be conventional and manufactured according to ISO standards.
      <br/>
      A conventional vial as presently used by the pharmaceutical companies includes an open end, a rim surrounding the open end and a reduced diameter neck portion adjacent the rim.
      <br/>
      The vial is sealed with a pierceable resilient stopper generally formed of an elastomeric material and most commonly includes a portion which is inserted into the neck of the vial and a planar rim portion which is received over the vial rim.
      <br/>
      The central portion of the planar rim portion which overlies the opening through the neck portion of the vial generally has a thickness of about two to three millimeters and the portion of the stopper which is received in the neck portion of the vial is generally tubular having an external diameter which is slightly greater than the internal diameter of the vial neck portion to assure a secure seal.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The transferset or transfer assembly of this invention includes a generally tubular transfer member having an open proximate end which is sealingly supported on the stopper rim portion for example in general coaxial alignment with the vial open end and an opened distal end adapted to receive a syringe or the like in sealed communication.
      <br/>
      As used in this application, the proximate end of a component such as the tubular transfer member is the end closest to the planar rim portion of the stopper and the distal end is the end furthest from the rim portion of the stopper.
      <br/>
      As will be understood, these terms are used solely to simplify the explanation of the invention and are not intended to define structure.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The transferset of this invention further includes a piercing member which is received within the tubular transfer member and reciprocally supported within the tubular transfer member by an internal surface of the tubular transfer member.
      <br/>
      The piercing member includes a relatively sharp preferably pointed piercing proximate end opposite the stopper rim portion adapted to pierce the stopper and an opposed distal end.
      <br/>
      As discussed more fully hereinbelow, the tubular transfer member provides fluid communication between the vial and a syringe, although the vial transferset of this invention may also be used to transfer fluid or liquid from a vial to another container, such as a second vial or an intravenous set.
      <br/>
      In the most preferred embodiment of the transferset of this invention, the piercing member includes at least one external generally longitudinal channel or groove rather than an internal lumen, thereby eliminating the problems associated with a conventional needle.
      <br/>
      Although the channel may take various forms and may include an internal channel, in the most preferred embodiment the channel is an external channel which extends generally longitudinally along at least a portion of the piercing member.
      <br/>
      As will be understood, the external channel in the piercing member extends generally longitudinally along the piercing member, but may extend spirally around the piercing member or include external and internal channels or multiple channels.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the piercing member is driven through the rim portion of the stopper, the external channel in the piercing member provides full fluid or liquid communication between the vial and the tubular transfer member.
      <br/>
      Of course, when the tubular transfer member is sealingly connected to a syringe, IV or the like, the tubular transfer member then provides fluid communication between the vial and the syringe.
      <br/>
      The preferred embodiment of the tubular transfer member then includes an annular or circular projecting sealing lip which is biased against the planar rim portion of the stopper assuring sealed communication between the vial and the tubular transfer member.
      <br/>
      In the most preferred embodiment, the sealing lip includes a relatively sharp edge which bites into the resilient stopper.
      <br/>
      As discussed more fully hereinbelow, the sealing lip of the tubular transfer member is preferably biased against the rim portion of the stopper sufficiently to stretch or prestress the rim portion of the stopper which overlies the vial opening.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The preferred embodiment of the transferset of this invention further includes a cupshaped cap which encloses the assembly and maintains the sterility of the transferset assembly.
      <br/>
      The cupshaped cap preferably includes a radial rim portion adjacent an open end of the cupshaped cap which preferably sealingly engages the stopper rim portion, a tubular portion surrounding the tubular transfer member and a closed distal end enclosing the distal ends of the tubular transfer member and the piercing member.
      <br/>
      Although the cap may include a separate cover portion which is integral or separate from the remainder of the cap, in the most preferred embodiment, the cap is integrally formed, such that the distal end portion may be removed prior to use.
      <br/>
      In the disclosed embodiment, the tubular portion of the cap spaced from the rim portion includes a radial groove or grooves which weaken the tubular wall forming a frangible connection.
      <br/>
      The distal end of the cap portion may then be removed simply by twisting the distal end of the cap, thereby breaking the frangible connection.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The transfer assembly is secured to the vial by a generally tubular collar having a radially inwardly projecting portion or annular portion which is received over the cap radial rim portion, a tubular portion surrounding the cap radial rim portion and the vial rim and a distal radial rim portion which is received in the vial neck beneath the rim portion of the vial permanently securing the transfer assembly to the vial.
      <br/>
      In the most preferred embodiment of the transferset of this invention, the collar is formed of a malleable material such aluminum and the radial distal portion of the collar is then crimped into the neck portion of the vial beneath the vial rim portion.
      <br/>
      The collar of the transferset of this invention thus replaces the aluminum collar of a conventional vial and stopper assembly and easily accommodates the dimensional tolerances of the vial and stopper assembly.
      <br/>
      The vial is conventionally formed of glass or plastic.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      As described above, the planar radial rim portion of the vial stopper is preferably stretched and pressed over the open end of the vial during assembly of the transferset on the vial.
      <br/>
      The proximate end of the tubular transfer member includes a projecting sealing lip having a diameter less than the internal diameter of the vial open end.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment, the sealing lip has a relatively sharp edge which may also bite into the resilient stopper.
      <br/>
      In the most preferred embodiment, the piercing member is reciprocally supported by an internal surface of the tubular transfer member, such that the piercing member can move toward the stopper to pierce the stopper, but the piercing member is prevented from moving away from the stopper and the relatively sharp piercing proximate end of the piercing member extends beyond the proximate end of the tubular transfer member.
      <br/>
      Upon assembly of the transferset on the vial, the piercing end of the piercing member then deforms and, in one disclosed embodiment, partially penetrates the planar rim portion of the stopper which is preferably stretched and prestressed over the vial opening by the sealing lip of the tubular transfer member, as described above.
      <br/>
      This combination may reduce the force required for the piercing member to fully pierce the planar rim portion of the stopper upon activation which is another advantage of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In another disclosed embodiment, the piercing end of the piercing member is slightly rounded and the external channel does not extend through the proximate end, such that the relatively sharp piercing end does not initially penetrate the rim portion of the stopper, but stretches the stopper as described.
      <br/>
      This embodiment strengthens the piercing end.
      <br/>
      Further, deforming the stopper planar rim portion and stretching the planar portion over the open end of the vial, reduces the volume of elastomeric material deformed into the V-shaped groove or external channel in the piercing member following piercing of the stopper, thereby improving fluid flow through the channel.
      <br/>
      In the disclosed embodiment, the tubular transfer member includes an internal diameter adjacent its distal end which is smaller than the internal diameter adjacent its proximate end and the piercing member includes a radial lip having a diameter greater than the smaller internal diameter of the tubular transfer member adjacent its distal end.
      <br/>
      Stated another way, the tubular transfer member has a larger counter bore adjacent its proximate end.
      <br/>
      The piercing member is thus free to move telescopically in the tubular transfer member toward the stopper, but prevented from moving away from the stopper.
      <br/>
      In the most preferred embodiment, the piercing member has a reduced diameter portion adjacent its proximate end and a pointed piercing end further reducing the force required to drive the piercing member through the planar rim portion of the stopper.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The most preferred embodiment of the transferset of this invention further includes a second seal surrounding the seal provided by the sealing lip of the tubular transfer member.
      <br/>
      In this preferred embodiment, the second seal is provided by an annular or circular lip which projects from the radial rim portion of the cap.
      <br/>
      In the most preferred embodiment, the radial rim portion of the cap includes at least one relatively sharp sealing lip which bites into the planar rim portion of the stopper providing an improved seal which maintains the sterile condition of the content of the transferset and prevents contamination.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      As described above, the transferset of this invention may be affixed on a conventional vial and stopper assembly by the pharmaceutical companies under sterile conditions when the vial is filled and the transferset of this invention prevents contamination of the contents of the vial.
      <br/>
      The cap of the transferset seals the transfer assembly and the collar permanently secures the assembly on the vial, particularly where a malleable collar is utilized.
      <br/>
      The radially inwardly projecting or annular lip portion of the collar is preferably compressed against the radial rim portion of the cap as the distal end of the collar is crimped into the reduced diameter-neck portion of the vial beneath the vial rim during assembly.
      <br/>
      This compression against the resilient planar rim portion of the stopper compresses the sealing lips of the cap and the tubular transfer member against the rim portion of the stopper, such that the sealing lips bite into the rim portion of the stopper assuring sealed communication between the stopper and the tubular transfer member.
      <br/>
      In the most preferred embodiment, the piercing end of the piercing member is also partially driven into the prestressed rim portion of the stopper overlying the open end of the vial, reducing the stroke required to drive the piercing member through the rim portion of the stopper as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The method of assembling the improved transferset of this invention on a vial then includes inserting the elongated piercing member into the tubular transfer member, wherein the internal surface of the tubular transfer member telescopically supports the piercing member.
      <br/>
      Where the tubular transfer member includes an enlarged counterbore adjacent its proximate end and the piercing member includes a radial lip as described, the distal end of the piercing member is inserted through the proximate end of the tubular transfer member and the relatively sharp piercing end of the piercing member extends beyond the proximate end of the tubular transfer member.
      <br/>
      The method then includes inserting the distal end of the tubular transfer member into the open proximate end of the cupshaped cap.
      <br/>
      In the most preferred embodiment of the transferset, the proximate end of the tubular transfer member includes a radial lip portion which is received within a counterbore of the radial rim portion of the cap, fixing the tubular transfer member in the cap, such that the projecting sealing lip of the tubular transfer member engages the planar rim of the stopper as described.
      <br/>
      Further, the piercing member is preferably releasably retained in the tubular transfer member, such that the components of the transferset and the collar may be preassembled and delivered in bulk to a pharmaceutical company, for example, for sterile assembly on vials.
      <br/>
      Finally, the assembled piercing member, tubular transfer member and cap are assembled on the vial and affixed by the collar.
      <br/>
      As described, the collar is most preferably formed of a malleable material such as aluminum and the radial rim portion of the collar is compressed against the rim portion of the cap as the distal end of the generally tubular cap is crimped into the reduced diameter neck portion of the vial beneath the vial rim.
      <br/>
      The compression of the radial rim portion of the collar against the rim portion of the cap compresses the resilient planar rim portion of the stopper, compressing the sealing lips into the rim portion of the stopper, stretching and prestressing the central portion of the planar rim portion of the stopper, assuring sealed communication between the vial and the tubular transfer member.
      <br/>
      In the most preferred embodiment, the method of this invention further includes driving the piercing end of the piercing member simultaneously into the planar radial rim of the stopper, deforming and may partially penetrate the stopper radial rim to reduce the stroke required to drive the piercing member through the stopper.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The method of transferring fluid or liquid medicament from the vial to a syringe or other container then includes first removing the cover portion of the cap to provide access to the tubular transfer member and the piercing member.
      <br/>
      In the most preferred embodiment, a radial groove is provided in the tubular portion of the cap spaced from the radial portion of the cap providing a frangible connection, such that the cover portion can be removed from the rim portion of the cap simply by twisting the distal end of the cap, breaking the frangible connection and permitting removal of the cover portion which includes the distal end of the tubular portion of the cap the closed end.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The transferset and vial assembly is now ready for use.
      <br/>
      As set forth above, the transferset of this invention may be utilized to transfer fluid from a vial to a syringe or IV set or any container; however, the disclosed embodiment of the transferset is specifically adapted to transfer liquid from a vial to a syringe or IV set or from a syringe or IV set to a vial.
      <br/>
      The distal end of the tubular transfer member includes a connector adapted to connect the tubular transfer member to a syringe to establish fluid communication between the tubular transfer member and the interior of a syringe, such as a Luer lock or Luer connector.
      <br/>
      A conventional syringe includes a tubular portion, a plunger having a head or fluid piston reciprocally mounted in sealed relation within the tubular portion and a reduced diameter tubular nozzle portion opposite the plunger head.
      <br/>
      The inside diameter of the tubular transfer member of the transferset is preferably greater than the outside diameter of the tubular nozzle portion of the syringe and the outside diameter of the syringe nozzle portion is generally approximately equal to the diameter of the distal end of the piercing member.
      <br/>
      Thus, the syringe nozzle portion may be telescopically received within the distal end of the tubular transfer member, wherein it is driven against the distal end of the piercing member.
      <br/>
      The reduced diameter nozzle portion is generally recessed within the tubular portion of the syringe, such that the proximate end of the syringe tubular portion surrounds the nozzle portion forming a tubular collar.
      <br/>
      The proximate end of the tubular collar includes a connector, such as a female Luer lock.
      <br/>
      In the disclosed embodiment, the distal end of the tubular transfer member includes a male Luer lock connector adapted to mate with the female Luer lock of the syringe.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Following removal of the cover portion of the cap as described above, the connector on the syringe is connected to the connector on the distal end of the tubular transfer member which drives the reduced diameter nozzle portion of the syringe into the distal open end of the tubular transfer member and the free end of the syringe nozzle portion is then driven against the distal end of the piercing member, driving the piercing end of the piercing member through the planar rim portion of the stopper.
      <br/>
      In summary, the method includes connecting the syringe to the distal end of the tubular transfer member, establishing fluid communication between the syringe trough the nozzle portion and driving the piercing end of the piercing member through the rim portion of the stopper.
      <br/>
      Fluid communication is thus established between the inside of the vial and the syringe through the tubular transfer member.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In the most preferred embodiment of the transferset of this invention, wherein the piercing member includes an external generally longitudinal channel, this communication is established through the external generally longitudinal channel in the piercing member.
      <br/>
      In the most preferred embodiment, the channel in the piercing member extends from adjacent the piercing end to at least the enlarged portion of the piercing member and most preferably through at least an extended portion of the length of the piercing member.
      <br/>
      The connector on the syringe is most preferably a treaded connection, such as a Luer lock.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, this threaded connection has several turns whereby the proximate end of the piercing member is driven completely through the planar rim portion of the stopper by threading the threaded connection of the syringe on the distal end of the tubular transfer member.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the proximate end of the piercing member is driven through the stopper by fluid pressure from the syringe.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      As will now be understood, the piercing member in the transferset of this invention has several important advantages over the prior art.
      <br/>
      First, the piercing member is easy to manufacture.
      <br/>
      The longitudinal channel may be a V-shaped channel for example which extends the entire length of the piercing member.
      <br/>
      Such a channel is easier to manufacture than a needle having very small lumen as presently used.
      <br/>
      More importantly, in the transferset of this invention, a piercing member having an external channel assures complete aspiration or reaspiration of the vial without requiring partial withdrawal of the needle which exposes the healthcare worker to being pricked by the needle (if inadvertently fully withdrawn) and contamination of the liquid medicament.
      <br/>
      The external channel provides full communication of the liquid content of the vial, whereas a needle with a lumen requires substantial withdrawal of the needle from the vial to provide full communication through the stopper as described above.
      <br/>
      Fluid communication between the syringe and the vial is then provided by the tubular transfer member rather than the needle in the transferset of this invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, the described piercing member provides several important advantages in the transferset of this invention over the prior art.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As described, the transferset of this invention may be utilized to reconstitute dry or powdered drugs into liquid form with an appropriate diluent or solvent solution prior to administration to a patient.
      <br/>
      For example, the syringe may contain a solvent solution or diluent which is injected into the vial through the tubular transfer member and the external channel of the piercing member by depressing the plunger head of the syringe.
      <br/>
      The reconstituted drug or medicament may then be reaspirated from the vial to the same syringe by withdrawing the plunger head for administration to a patient.
      <br/>
      The healthcare worker is never exposed to a needle during this operation and the piercing member remains with the transferset and vial assembly because it is never connected to the syringe.
      <br/>
      The tubular transfer member is then removed from the syringe and replaced with a needle for application of the liquid medicament to a patient or connected directly to an IV line.

    <p num="23">
      As will be understood, the terms tubular and tubular portion are used herein to connote a generally tubular shape.
      <br/>
      Although the disclosed embodiments are generally cylindrical tubes which are more convenient to manufacture, the tubular portions may be of any convenient shape, including polygonal.

      Other advantages and meritorious features of the present invention will be more fully understood from the following description of the preferred embodiments, the claims and the appended drawings, a brief description of which follows.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="25">
      As described above, the fluid transfer assembly or transferset 20 of this invention is adapted for establishing fluid communication with a conventional sealed vial 22 as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The vial includes a side wall portion 24, a bottom wall portion 26, a reduced diameter neck portion 28 and a rim portion 30.
      <br/>
      The vial is conventionally formed of glass or plastic and includes an interior 32 for receipt for example of a dry or liquid medicament, such as a dry vaccine 33.
      <br/>
      The vial is sealed with an elastomeric stopper 34 which includes a tubular portion 36 and a planar rim portion 38.
      <br/>
      The tubular portion 36 of the stopper preferably has an external diameter slightly greater than the internal diameter 44 of the open end of the vial and, as will be understood by those skilled in the art, the end of the tubular portion may include axial slots 40 in order to perform freeze drying of liquid in the vial.
      <br/>
      As will be understood, the vial may also include a gas, for example, to protect the liquid content of the vial, and thus the transferset of this invention is referred to as a fluid, rather than liquid transferset.
      <br/>
      The central portion 42 of the planar rim portion 38 is flexible and thus may be resiliently biased into the tubular portion 36, prestressing the central portion 42 as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The transferset 20 of this invention preferably includes four components, including a tubular transfer member 46, a central piercing member 48 which is reciprocally supported in the tubular transfer member, a cup-shaped cap 50 which encloses and seals the assembly and a collar member 52 which secures the transferset to the vial as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The proximate end of the tubular transfer member 46 includes a circular or annular sealing lip 54 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, which preferably includes a sharp distal edge 56 as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      As will be understood, the proximate end of the tubular transfer member 46 may include a plurality of sealing lips, such as the concentric sealing lips 86 of the cap 50 described below.
      <br/>
      In the disclosed embodiment, the proximate end of the tubular transfer member 46 further includes a radial connector portion 58 as shown in FIG. 2 which is described more fully hereinbelow.
      <br/>
      A connector, such as a Luer lock 60, is provided adjacent the open distal end 62 of the tubular transfer member.
      <br/>
      The internal surface of the tubular transfer member 46 includes a first smaller preferably conical diameter 64 adjacent the distal end 62 and a second larger generally cylindrical diameter 66 or counterbore adjacent the proximate end.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The distal end 67 of the piercing member 48 includes a generally cylindrical barrel portion 68 having an external diameter generally equal to or slightly less than the internal diameter 64 of the tubular transfer member 46, such that the piercing member is telescopically supported in the tubular transfer member 46 for movement toward the stopper 34 as described below.
      <br/>
      The piercing portion 70 adjacent the proximate end of the piercing member 48 may also be generally cylindrical and preferably has a diameter substantially less than the diameter of the barrel portion 68.
      <br/>
      In the disclosed embodiment, the portion 73 of the piercing member between the radial rib 75 and the barrel portion 68 is conical.
      <br/>
      The proximate end of the piercing member 48 includes a relatively sharp, preferably pointed piercing end 72 and the piercing member 48 includes an external generally longitudinal channel 74 which provides communication between the interior 32 of the vial and the interior of the tubular transfer member 46 as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The piercing member 48 further includes a radial rib 75 which has a diameter greater than the inside diameter 64 of the tubular transfer member 46 adjacent its distal end and slightly smaller than the inside diameter 66 of the counter-bore, such that the piercing member 48 can move toward the planar radial rim portion 38 of the stopper for piercing of the stopper, but cannot move away from the stopper as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment of the transferset of this invention, the sharp piercing end 72 of the piercing member 48 is thus retained in the tubular transfer member 46, such that the relatively sharp piercing end portion 72 of the piercing member deforms the central portion 42 of the stopper and may partially penetrate the stopper as shown, thereby reducing the stroke required to drive the piercing member through the stopper as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The cap 50 includes a tubular portion 76 which surrounds the tubular transfer member 46 preferably is spaced relation, a radial rim portion 78 at its proximate end and a closed distal end portion 80 which encloses the distal ends of the tubular transfer member 62 and the piercing member 67.
      <br/>
      The cap 50 is thus generally described as "cupshaped"; however, the cap may have an open distal end which is closed by a separate removable closure, for example, such that the combination is cup-shaped.
      <br/>
      The tubular portion 76 of the cap includes a radial v-shaped external groove 82, such that the proximate end of the tubular portion 76 is retained to the distal portion by a relatively thin frangible connection 84 as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The groove 82 in the disclosed embodiment of the tubular portion 76 of the cap 50 is in the external surface as shown; however the groove may also be formed in the internal surface forming a frangible connection adjacent the external surface.
      <br/>
      The groove 82, whether internal or external, may also be continuous as shown or interrupted.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the cover portion may be connected to the remainder of the cap by spaced frangible connector portions.
      <br/>
      As described below, the distal portion of the cap or cover portion may then be removed by twisting the distal end of the cap for connection of the transferset to a syringe or the like.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment of the transferset, the radial rim portion 78 includes annular or preferably circular concentric sealing lips 86 which surround the sealing lip 54 of the tubular transfer member.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the circular lips 86 on the radial portion 78 of the cap surround the sealing lip 54 on the tubular transfer member, providing a safety seal primarily to maintain sterility inside the cap 50 prior to use, thereby extending the shelf life of the product.
      <br/>
      Although the disclosed embodiment includes two concentric sealing lips 86 on the cap, it will be understood that one sealing lip may be utilized or a plurality of nonconcentric lips.
      <br/>
      The sealing lips 86 preferably have a relatively sharp edge and are V-shaped, such that the lips 86 bite into the resilient planar rim portion 38 of the stopper.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The disclosed embodiment of the cap 50 further includes an outer longitudinal rim portion 88 having an inside diameter generally equal to or slightly smaller than the outside diameter of the planar rim portion 38 of the stopper as shown in FIG. 1, such that the transferset 20 is accurately located on the stopper 34 and the rim portion 30 of the vial 22 with the tubular transfer member 46 generally coaxially aligned with the opening 44 through the neck portion 28 of the vial.
      <br/>
      In the disclosed embodiment, the piercing member 48 is supported in the tubular transfer member 46 with its longitudinal axis X coincident with the longitudinal axis of the vial and stopper.
      <br/>
      It may be desirable, however, in certain applications to provide a nonconcentric arrangement and thus the present invention is not limited to the concentric arrangement shown.
      <br/>
      The tubular transfer member 46 is accurately located and supported within the cap 50 by a radial rim 90 on the radial connector portion 58 as shown in FIG. 2, which is received in a recess 92 in the cap.
      <br/>
      The cap further includes a V-shaped radially inwardly projecting rib 93, which is received in or snapped into a V-shaped groove 94 in the tubular transfer member as shown in FIG. 2, providing accurate secure location of the tubular transfer member 46 in the cap 50.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The V-shaped interlock further permits preassembly of the tubular transfer member 46 and piercing member 48 in the cap 50 for bulk supply of the transferset and collar 52 to pharmaceutical companies, for example, for attachment to a vial, following filling of the vial with medicament, using the collar 52.
      <br/>
      In an alternative embodiment (shown in FIGS. 16 to 18 described below), the tubular transfer member is retained in the cap 350 for bulk supply by an interlocking rib and depression on opposed surfaces of the tubular transfer member and the cap, preferably spaced inwardly or proximately from the frangible connection.
      <br/>
      Further, in the embodiment described below, the piercing member is releasably retained in the tubular transfer member for bulk assembly and supply to the applicator responsible for filling the container or vial 22.
      <br/>
      Thus, as will be understood, various embodiments or means may be provided to retain the tubular transfer member 46 in the cap for bulk supply to pharmaceutical companies for later assembly on a vial within the purview of this invention.
      <br/>
      In the disclosed embodiment, the piercing member 48 includes a small ramped radial rib 73, spaced distally from the radial rib 75, which provides an interference fit with the internal surface 64 of the tubular transfer member 46 as best shown in FIGS. 5, 6, 9 and 10.
      <br/>
      This interference fit releasably retains the piercing member 48 in the tubular transfer member 46 upon assembly of the piercing member in the tubular transfer member.
      <br/>
      Thus, the components of the transferset 20 are retained as an assembly for bulk sale and use as described.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As set forth above, the collar 52 is most preferably formed of a malleable material such as aluminum to accommodate the thickness tolerances of the stopper 34 and the rim portion 30 of the vial.
      <br/>
      The collar 52 includes a tubular portion 96 which surrounds the radial and longitudinal rim portions 78 and 88 of the cap 50, the planar radial rim portion 38 of the stopper and the rim portion 30 of the vial, a radially inwardly projecting portion 98 which overlies the radial rim portion 78 of the cap and a distal radial portion 100 which in the preferred embodiment is crimped into the reduced diameter neck 28 of the vial beneath the vial rim 30.
      <br/>
      In the disclosed embodiment, the collar 52 further includes a distal tubular portion 102 which surrounds the proximate end of the tubular portion 76 of the cap and the radial V-shaped external groove 82 as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      This tubular portion 102 reduces the likelihood of accidental removal of the distal portion of the cap 50 and the distal end of the tubular portion 102 includes a rounded bead 104 which prevents the healthcare worker from engaging a sharp metal edge when removing the distal end of the cap during use.
      <br/>
      The distal removable portion of the cap is referred to hereinafter as the cover portion.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the cover portion may be threaded onto the proximate end of the tubular portion 76 of the cap or connected by a "living hinge." However, the preferred embodiment of the cap 50 having a frangible connection 84 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 reduces the cost of the cap of the transferset and assures maintenance of the sterile conditions prior to use.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The method of assembling the transferset on a vial is best shown in FIGS. 9 and 10. The distal end 67 of the piercing member 48 is inserted into the proximate end of the tubular transfer member 46.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 10, the barrel portion 68 of the piercing member is first received in the larger internal diameter 66, wherein the radial rib 75 is generally equal to the diameter of the internal surface 66.
      <br/>
      The barrel portion 68 of the piercing member is then received in the smaller diameter surface 64 until the radial rib 75 engages the radial surface 65 between the internal surfaces 66 and 64 (FIG. 10) as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The distal ends 62 of the tubular transfer member and 67 of the piercing member are then received in the open proximate end of the cap 50 and the tubular portion 76 of the cap 50 is then received over the tubular portion 102 of the collar and the assembly is received over the radial planar rim portion 38 of the stopper 34 and the rim portion of the vial 22.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      As noted above, the tubular transfer member 46 is accurately aligned within and supported by the cap 50.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the radial rib 90 of the tubular transfer member is received within the radial groove 92 of the cap 50 and the V-shaped rib 93 on the cap snaps into the mating V-shaped groove 94 in the tubular transfer member.
      <br/>
      Further, the outer longitudinal rim 88 on the cap is received over the radial planar portion 38 of the stopper, such that the entire transferset assembly is accurately aligned on the stopper 34.
      <br/>
      Further, the piercing member 48 is accurately aligned and supported within the tubular transfer member 46, such that the relatively sharp piercing end 72 extends beyond the proximate end of the tubular transfer member 46 and the piercing member 48 is able to move toward the stopper, but is restrained from withdrawing from the stopper by the radial rib 75.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 9 and 10, the distal open end 100 of the tubular portion 96 is initially coincident with the tubular portion 76 as shown in phantom in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Upon assembly, however, the end 100 is deformed or crimped into the neck portion 28 of the vial beneath the rim portion 30, permanently securing the transferset 20 on the vial 22.
      <br/>
      The radial rim portion 78 of the cap 50 is simultaneously compressed against the planar rim portion 38 of the resilient stopper as the distal end 100 of the collar 52 is crimped, such that the piercing end 72 of the piercing member 48 is pressed into the central portion 42 of the stopper, which causes the piercing end 72 to resiliently deform the unsupported central portion 42 of the stopper and, in the embodiment disclosed in FIGS. 1 to 4, the piercing end 72 may partially penetrate the central portion 42 of the stopper as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      As will be understood, it may not be desirable in some applications for the piercing end 72 of the piercing member to partially penetrate the central portion 42 of the stopper when the transferset is assembled on the vial, particularly where the vial and transferset assembly of this invention is to be stored for an extended period of time.
      <br/>
      In the alternative preferred embodiment of the transferset 320 shown in FIGS. 16 to 18, the piercing end 372 of the piercing member 348 is slightly rounded to avoid prepenetration of the stopper.
      <br/>
      Thus, the relative sharpness of the piercing end 72 and 372 of the piercing member 48 and 348 may be selected to either stretch or deform and prestress the central portion 42 of the planar rim portion 38 of the stopper 34 or deform and partially penetrate the central portion 42 of the stopper, as shown in FIGS. 1 to 4.
      <br/>
      Further, the sharpness of the pointed end 72 and 372 of the piercing member will depend upon the material used to form the piercing member 48 and the material may be selected to either partially pierce the stopper or simply deform and stretch the central portion 42 of the stopper.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The annular sealing lip 54 of the tubular transfer member 46 is also simultaneously driven into the central portion 42 of the stopper, stretching and prestressing the central portion 42 of the stopper as shown in FIG. 2, and the sealing lips 86 of the cap 50 are driven into the resilient stopper providing an additional seal encircling the sealing lip 54.
      <br/>
      In the most preferred embodiment, the sharp piercing edge 56 of the sealing lip 54 of the tubular transfer member 46 slightly penetrates the central portion 42 of the stopper, providing an improved seal surrounding the communication between the interior 32 of the vial 24 and the tubular transfer member 46 when the piercing member 48 fully penetrates the stopper 34 as now described.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The transferset and vial assembly shown in FIG. 1 is now ready for use.
      <br/>
      As set forth above, the transferset 20 may be assembled on the vial 22 and stopper 34 by the pharmaceutical company when the vial 22 is filled under sterile conditions.
      <br/>
      In a typical application, the vial is filled with a dry or powdered medicament which may be reconstituted into liquid form with an appropriate diluent or solvent solution prior to administration to a patient.
      <br/>
      In such applications, the diluent or solvent solution is first injected into the vial by a syringe, such as the conventional syringe 110 shown in FIGS. 4 to 6 and 9.
      <br/>
      A conventional syringe includes a tubular body portion 112, a tubular nozzle portion 114 which extends beyond the tubular body portion 112, a plunger 116 having a head portion 118 having external seals 120, such as the O-ring seals shown in FIGS. 4 to 6.
      <br/>
      The plunger shaft 122 is generally cruciform in shape and may be integral with the head 118.
      <br/>
      The plunger 116 may be driven through or reciprocate through the interior 128 of the tubular body portion 112 to eject or withdraw liquid through the nozzle portion 114.
      <br/>
      A collar portion or tubular extension 129 of the tubular body portion 112 extends beyond the distal portion of the nozzle 114, the interior surface of which includes a female Luer lock or female threads which are normally used to connect a needle to the syringe.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 9, the shaft 122 of the plunger 116 generally includes a thumb or push button 132 and the body portion includes a radial, outwardly extending finger grip 134, such that the plunger head may be reciprocated through the tubular body portion 112 by gripping the radial finger grip 134 and the plunger head 118 is driven through the interior of the tubular body portion by engaging the push button 132 with the thumb.
      <br/>
      However, details of the design of various syringes are well known in the art and the transferset of this invention is not limited for use with any particular syringe design.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Prior to use of the vial and transferset of this invention by a healthcare worker, for example, the cover portion of the cap 50 must first be removed as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished with the disclosed embodiment of the transferset 20 simply by twisting the distal end portion of the cap 50 as shown by arrow A in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      This twisting motion breaks the frangible connection 84 formed by the radial groove 82.
      <br/>
      The cover portion then comprises the distal portion of the tubular portion 76 and the closed distal end portion 80 as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The cover portion of the cap 50 is thus removed from the transferset 20 exposing the distal end 67 of the piercing member 48 and the tubular transfer member 46 as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      As described above, the distal tubular portion 102 of the collar includes a rounded bead 104 which protects the fingers of the healthcare worker during removal of the cover portion of the cap 50 which will now be more fully understood from FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The transferset 20 with the cover portion of the cap 50 removed is now ready for receipt of an IV set or a conventional syringe 110 as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      First, the syringe 110 is coaxially aligned with the axis of the tubular transfer member 46.
      <br/>
      As shown, the diameter of the barrel portion 68 of the piercing member 48 is equal to or greater than the diameter of the nozzle portion 114 of the syringe, such that the nozzle portion 114 of the syringe will engage the distal end 67 of the piercing member 48.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The syringe 110 is then secured to the tubular transfer member 46 and the piercing portion 70 of the piercing member 48 is driven through the central portion 42 of the resilient stopper 34 as shown in FIGS. 5 and 6.
      <br/>
      As the tubular nozzle portion 114 of the syringe 110 is driven into the open distal end 64 of the tubular transfer member 46, the free end of the nozzle portion 114 is driven against the distal 67 of the piercing member 48, which drives the piercing end 72 through the central portion 42 of the stopper 34 as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The reduced diameter piercing portion 70 of the piercing member 48 is then driven through the central portion 42 of the stopper by threading the male thread of the Luer lock 60 at the distal end of the tubular transfer member 46 into the female thread 130 of the Luer lock on the extension or collar 129 of the syringe as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      The threading of the syringe on the distal end of the tubular transfer member 46 drives the tubular nozzle portion 114 of the syringe 110 into the internal surface 64 of the tubular transfer member 46 and the free end of the tubular nozzle portion against the distal end 67 of the barrel portion 68 of the piercing member 48, which drives the piercing portion 70 of the piercing member through the central portion 42 of the stopper 34, establishing fluid communication through the external channel 74 and the interior 32 of the vial 22 as discussed more fully hereinbelow.
      <br/>
      As set forth above, the piercing of the center portion 42 of the stopper 34 by the piercing member 48 is facilitated by the circular sealing lip 54 on the proximate end of the tubular transfer member 46, which stretches and prestresses the unsupported central portion 42 of the stopper which overlies the tubular portion 36.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In a typical application of the transferset 20 of this invention, wherein the vial 22 contains a drug or medicament in dry or powdered form which is reconstituted by a diluent or solvent solution in the interior 128 of the syringe, the liquid diluent or solvent may now be transferred to the interior of the vial 22 simply by depressing the plunger 116 of the vial 110 as shown by arrow B in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      The liquid in the interior 128 of the syringe is thus ejected through the tubular nozzle portion 114 into the external channel 74 of the piercing member 48 into the tubular portion 34 of the stopper and thus into the interior 32 of the vial 22.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 8, which is a cross-section through the rim of the vial as shown in FIG. 6, one configuration of the generally longitudinal channel 74 in the piercing member 48 is a V-shaped channel 74 which is relatively simple to manufacture.
      <br/>
      Further, the use of a V-shaped channel having an angle of about 15 (degree)  to 60 (degree)  does not materially weaken the piercing member and provides adequate communication between the interior 32 of the vial and the tubular transfer member 46 through the channel 74.
      <br/>
      A larger angle of about 45 (degree)  to 60 (degree)  may be preferred to limit manufacturing problems and avoid potential blockage of the groove.
      <br/>
      Further, the channel 74 may be of any convenient shape, including rectangular.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 8, the resilient elastomeric central rim portion 42 of the stopper will be deformed into and partially fill the channel 74 in the piercing member when the piercing portion 70 penetrates the stopper.
      <br/>
      The deformation and stretching of the central portion 42 of the stopper over the opening of the vial by the sealing lip 54 of the tubular transfer member however reduces the volume of elastomeric material which is deformed into the channel 74, thereby improving fluid communication through the external channel 74.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Generally, the liquid medicament is fully reconstituted by shaking the assembly as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      The liquid medicament 136 may then be reaspirated into the same or a different syringe simply by withdrawing the plunger 116 into the tubular body portion 112 in the opposite direction from arrow B in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      It is important to note from FIG. 7 that the liquid medicament 136 is transferred from the vial 122 through the external channel 74, then from the external channel into the tubular transfer member 46 to the syringe (not shown).
      <br/>
      This should be contrasted with a needle having a small internal lumen or bore, wherein the liquid medicament below the piercing end (72 of the piercing member 48) cannot be reaspirated because the liquid must be transferred through the lumen of the needle.
      <br/>
      It should also be noted that the sharp end 56 of the annular or circular sealing lip 54 seals the communication between the tubular transfer member and the external channel 74 of the piercing member 48.
      <br/>
      This embodiment of the tubular transferset 20 of this invention and method of assembly thus provides several important advantages over the prior art as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      FIGS. 11 to 15 illustrate an alternative embodiment of the vial transferset and method of this invention, wherein the fluid pressure in the syringe is utilized to drive the piercing member through the central portion of the stopper rather than mechanical force as described above in regard to FIGS. 1 to 10. The components of the transferset 220 have been numbered in the same sequence as the transferset 20 shown in FIGS. 1 to 10, except that the components of the transferset 220 are numbered in the 200 series for ease of description and reference to FIGS. 1 to 10 described above.
      <br/>
      The vial 22, stopper 34 and syringe 110 may, however, be identical to the same components described above and are therefore numbered the same.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      In the transferset 220 shown in FIGS. 11 to 15, the tubular transfer member 246 has an axial length which is greater than the axial length of the piercing member 248, such that the distal end 267 of the piercing member is recessed in the smaller diameter opening 264 of the tubular transfer member a distance equal to or greater than the length of the tubular nozzle 114 of the syringe 110.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished either by reducing the axial length of the piercing member 248 or increasing the length of the tubular transfer member 246 as shown in FIGS. 11 to 15. Thus, in this embodiment, when the male Luer lock connection 260 on the tubular transfer member 246 is threaded into the female threads of the Luer lock of the tubular extension 129, the tubular extension is received within the internal surface 264 of the tubular transfer member 246 without engaging the distal end 267 of the piercing member 248 as shown in FIG. 11. This somewhat simplifies the connection of the syringe 110 to the tubular transfer member 246 compared to the embodiment of the transferset 20 shown in FIGS. 1 to 10 because the healthcare worker is not required to pierce the vial by urging the tubular nozzle portion 114 of the syringe against the distal end 267 of the piercing member although the embodiment of the transferset 20 is relatively easy to assemble.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The piercing end 272 of the piercing member 248 is then driven through the center portion 42 of the stopper 34 by moving the head 118 of the plunger 116 of syringe 110 toward the nozzle 114 of the syringe, which drives the liquid 140 in the tubular body portion 112 of the syringe against the radial rib 275 of the piercing member 248.
      <br/>
      As best shown in FIG. 14, the radial rib 275 on the piercing member 248 of the transferset 220 shown in FIGS. 11 to 15 provides a fluid seal.
      <br/>
      That is, the radial sealing rim 275 extends into the external generally longitudinal channel 274 and the radial sealing rib 275 has an external diameter generally equal to or slightly greater than the internal diameter of the internal cylindrical surface 266 of the tubular transfer member 46.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the tubular transfer member includes a second enlarged bore 280 adjacent the proximate end having an internal diameter greater than the external diameter of the radial sealing rib 275.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the fluid pressure created by the plunger 118 of the syringe 110 drives the radial sealing rib 275 into the enlarged diameter portion 280, fluid is permitted to flow around the radial sealing rib 275 into the proximal portion of the channel 274 in the piercing member which has penetrated the central portion 42 of the stopper as shown in FIG. 15.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The preferred alternative embodiment of the transferset 320 shown in FIGS. 16 to 18 operates and is assembled in the same manner as the embodiment of the transferset 20 shown in FIGS. 1 to 10. Further, the components of the transferset 320 are generally the same, including a tubular transfer member 346, a piercing member 348, a generally cupshaped cap 350 and a collar member 352.
      <br/>
      Thus, the components of the transferset 320 are numbered in the same sequence as the components of the transferset 20 shown in FIGS. 1 to 10 except that the components of the embodiment of the transferset 320 shown in FIGS. 16 to 18 are numbered in the 300 series.
      <br/>
      Where appropriate, the features of the components are also numbered in the same sequence for ease of reference to the above description and to avoid duplication of the description of this embodiment.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, the tubular transfer member 346 includes an annular or circular sealing lip 354, a Luer lock connector 360 at its distal end, a first smaller internal diameter 364 and a larger proximate internal diameter 366 as described above.
      <br/>
      The following description of the components of the transferset 320 shown in FIGS. 16 to 18 will therefore be limited to the features which differ from the features of the transferset 20 shown in FIGS. 1 to 10.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      First, as best shown in FIG. 18, the tubular transfer member 346 includes an integral generally tubular connector portion 402, which in this embodiment, surrounds the proximate end of the tubular transfer member and is integrally joined to the remainder of the tubular transfer member at 404.
      <br/>
      The external surface of the connector portion 402 includes a radially projecting rounded rib 358 which is received in a groove 392 formed in the inner wall of the cap, providing a simplified snap-in interlock between the tubular transfer member 346 and the cap 350.
      <br/>
      The threaded Luer connector 360 on the tubular transfer member is also slightly modified; however, the Luer connector 360 is also conventional.
      <br/>
      The inner wall of the tubular portion 376 of the cap 350 also includes a plurality of sealing ribs 406 in this embodiment which engage the outer wall of the connector portion 402 of the tubular transfer member 346 which seal the connection between the cap and the tubular transfer member and prevent contamination of the transferset.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The piercing member 348 has also been modified in this embodiment.
      <br/>
      First, as best shown in FIG. 17, the piercing end 372 of the piercing member 348 is slightly rounded to prevent premature penetration of the planar rim portion 38 of the stopper 34 shown, for example, in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      That is, the slightly rounded ,piercing end 372 will deform and stretch the planar rim portion 38 of the stopper, but will not partially penetrate the rim portion as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The piercing end 372, however, is "relatively sharp" and will pierce the planar rim portion of the elastomeric stopper 34 when the piercing member 348 is driven into the stopper as described above.
      <br/>
      Further, the external channel 374 in the piercing member 348 terminates short of the piercing end as shown in FIG. 17, such that the channel 374 includes a rounded end wall 408 spaced slightly from the proximate end of the relatively sharp piercing end 372.
      <br/>
      Terminating the external channel 374 a few millimeters (e.g. 7 mm) short of the piercing end 372 strengthens the piercing end 372 for penetration of the planar rim portion 38 of the stopper.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the piercing member 348 is releasably retained in the tubular transfer member by an interlocking rib and groove as best shown in FIGS. 16 and 17. In the disclosed embodiment, the piercing member includes an arcuate groove 410 adjacent the radial rib 375 and the internal surface 364 of the tubular transfer member 346 includes an interlocking arcuate rib 412 as shown in FIG. 16 which releasably retains the piercing member 348 in the tubular transfer member 346.
      <br/>
      In the disclosed embodiment of the piercing member 348, the barrel portion includes two spaced flats 414 which receive the mold ejector pins (not shown) which make it easier to remove the piercing member from the mold, but the flats do not form a functional part of the invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, as described above, the transferset 320 shown in FIGS. 16 may be preassembled in bulk with the collar for distribution to pharmaceutical companies, for example, for attachment to a vial under sterile conditions.
      <br/>
      The barrel portion 368 of the tubular transfer member further includes spaced flats which receive ejector pins in a mold to simplify release of the piercing member 348 from the mold, but are not functional in the transferset assembly 320.
      <br/>
      Finally, in this embodiment, the distal end 367 of the piercing member 348 is rounded which also simplifies molding of the piercing member 348.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The components of the transferset 328 are assembled and secured to a vial 22 as described above.
      <br/>
      Upon assembly of the transferset 320 as shown in FIG. 16, the end 300 of the tubular portion 396 is crimped into the reduced diameter neck portion 28 of the vial as described above.
      <br/>
      The assembly of the transferset 320 on the vial drive the sealing lips 354 and 386 of the tubular transfer member into the planar radial rim portion 38 of the stopper, sealing the assembly.
      <br/>
      The cover portion of the cap 350 is then removed by twisting the distal end, breaking the frangible connection 384 as described.
      <br/>
      The transferset may then be utilized to transfer fluid to or from the vial by connecting a syringe 110 or IV set (not shown) to the Luer lock connector 360 as described above.
      <br/>
      As set forth above, the operation of the transferset 320 in transferring fluid to or from a vial is the same as described above in regard to FIGS. 1 to 10.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      As will be understood by those skilled in the art, various modifications may be made to the vial transferset and method of this invention within the purview of the appended claims.
      <br/>
      For example, the tubular transfer member 46, 246 and 346 may be polygonal, in which case, the barrel portion 68, 268 and 368 of the piercing member 48, 248 and 348 may be similarly polygonal and the tubular portion 76, 276 and 376 of the cap may either by cylindrical or polygonal.
      <br/>
      Further, the collar 52, 252 and 352 may be formed of any suitable malleable material or may also be formed of a suitable plastic although in the disclosed embodiment the collar may be formed of aluminum.
      <br/>
      The piercing member and tubular transfer member may be formed of various materials including, for example, a medical grade polycarbonate having the appropriate strength and suitable for sterilization.
      <br/>
      The cap 50, 250 and 350 may also be formed of a medical grade polycarbonate.
      <br/>
      Further, as set forth above, the external generally longitudinal channel 74, 274 and 374 in the piercing member 48, 248 and 348 respectively, may be of various configuration including, for example, a spiral or a discontinuous longitudinal groove.
      <br/>
      Having described the vial transferset and method of this invention, it is now claimed as set forth below.
