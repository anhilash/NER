      An apparatus for the insertion of weft threads contains a stationary unit having an arrangement with a plurality of passages, a plurality of nozzles for the supplying of weft threads and a unit which rotates with the weaving rotor with a plurality of injector nozzles which are intended to successively draw off the weft threads which are supplied to the passages and to feed them into the shed.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to of weft threads in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 and to a series shed weaving machine with an apparatus.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      An apparatus is described in EP-A-0 433 216 for the distribution of the weft threads from a thread supply device to a plurality of insertion passages of a weaving rotor of a series shed weaving machine which contains a stationary part, and a part which rotates with the weaving rotor which have a common separation and sealing surface in a rotationally symmetrical surface and via which the transfer of the weft threads takes place.
      <br/>
      In the stationary part passages are formed in a known arrangement and nozzles are provided for each passage in order to draw off the weft threads from a device which supplies the weft threads and to introduce them into the respective passage.
      <br/>
      In the part which rotates with the weaving rotor, acceptor passages are formed in a known arrangement and shoot-in tubes are provided in order to shoot the weft threads which are supplied by the nozzles into the weft passages which are formed at the weaving rotor.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The disadvantages of this apparatus are essentially to be seen wherein the gap between the stationary part and the part which rotates with the weaving rotor is made very narrow in order to ensure the forwarding of the weft threads to the weaving rotor, in that the nozzle which is associated with each passage must drive the start of the weft thread through the passage up to the relay nozzles in the weaving rotor; and wherein as a result of the constitution of the yarn, thread parts, e.g. fibrils can penetrate into the gap between the stationary part and the part which rotates with the weaving rotor.
      <br/>
      A substantial restriction of the types of yarn which can be woven on the weaving machine results from this.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">The object of the invention is to improve an apparatus of this kind.</p>
    <p num="7">Because the weft threads are prepared in a stationary unit with supply nozzles and are shot into the weft passages by means of a unit with injector nozzles which rotates with the weaving rotor, there results the advantage that different yarn sorts, in particular also filament yarns, can be shot into the weft passage in a disturbance-free manner.</p>
    <p num="8">The weaving machine has the advantage that as a result of a discontinuous supply of the weft threads there exists the possibility of selecting the available weft yarn freely and in accordance with a predetermined program for the weft insertion.</p>

      The apparatus 2 comprises a stationary unit 4 for the supplying of the weft threads, a unit 5 for feeding in the weft threads which rotates synchronously with the weaving rotor 1 about the axis of rotation 6 in the direction of the arrow A, and a rotary slide valve 7 for the supplying of the air.
      <br/>
      The unit 4 for the supplying of the weft threads has a holder 8 for an arrangement 11 of passages.
      <br/>
      The unit 5 for the feeding in of the weft threads has twelve injector nozzles 12 which are arranged on a cylindrical carrier part 13.
      <br/>
      The carrier part contains a first ring-shaped section 14 for the nozzle bodies and a second ring-shaped section 15 for the nozzle mouths.
      <br/>
      It is pointed out that the nozzles can be arranged in a common section and that the number of nozzles can vary.

    <p num="12">
      Reference is made to FIGS. 2 to 4.
      <br/>
      As FIG. 2 shows (in a folded out illustration), the apparatus contains the stationary unit 4 for the supplying of the weft threads and a unit 5 for feeding in the weft threads which rotates synchronously with the weaving rotor 1.
      <br/>
      The unit 4 for the supplying of the weft threads 3 contains a holder 21 and an arrangement 22 which is mounted on the holder.
      <br/>
      The unit 5 for the feeding in of the weft threads 3 comprises a cylindrical carrier part 23 and twelve injector nozzles 12, the inlet and outlet of which lie on the same pitch circle 24.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      As FIG. 3 shows, the arrangement 22 comprises four units 25 which form passages 26 and are arranged in the manner of a fan.
      <br/>
      A component 27 consists of a first section 28 with the units 25 and a second section 29 which is connected to the units and which has an opening 30.
      <br/>
      A nozzle 31 for the supplying of a weft thread is associated with each passage 26.
      <br/>
      Each passage 26 has a cross-section which continuously contracts in the direction of the axis of rotation 6 so that a gap 32 for the drawing out of the weft thread is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The injector nozzles 12 are arranged to lie at equal distances on a pitch circle 41 in such a manner that the inlet of the injector nozzle and the opening 30 of the section 29 are directed towards one another during the takeover of a weft thread 3.
      <br/>
      The inlet of the injector nozzle is advantageously expanded in the shape of a funnel in order to ensure the acceptance of the weft thread.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 4 shows the component 27 in accordance with FIG. 3 in an extended illustration.
      <br/>
      In order to reduce the stressing of the weft threads during the drawing out from the passage 26 and the insertion into the shed it can be advantageous to design the depth of the passage 26 differently in accordance with the illustration.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Reference is made to FIGS. 6 and 7.
      <br/>
      These figures show another embodiment of the arrangement with four units 42 which form two passages 43 each and are arranged in the manner of a fan.
      <br/>
      The arrangement is designed as a component 44 and consists of a first section 45 with the units 42 and a second section 46 which is connected to the units and has an opening 47.
      <br/>
      A nozzle 48 for the supplying of a weft thread is associated with each passage 43.
      <br/>
      The two passages 43 of each unit are separated by an intermediate wall 49 and form a common gap 50 in order to draw out a weft thread.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, an auxiliary nozzle 51 is provided which is arranged in the second section 46 of the component 44 in such a manner that the opening of the auxiliary nozzle is directed towards the opening 47.

    <p num="17">
      FIG. 8 shows a unit 61 with four passages 43.
      <br/>
      It is pointed out that the number of the passages 43 can vary.
    </p>
    <p num="18">FIG. 9 shows eight units 62 which in each case form a passage 63, with each passage consisting of a transport passage 64 and a draw-out passage 65.</p>
