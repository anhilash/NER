      That portion of any bony anchor which protrudes from the bone can have placed on it a head to which a connector assembly is attached.
      <br/>
      The free end of this connector assembly attaches to a bar and rigidly holds the bar in place.
      <br/>
      On the bar, a variety of attachments are placed thereby extending the influence of the bony anchor to other, more ideal locations from which to apply forces to move teeth in all directions.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates generally to orthodontic treatment techniques and appliances and is particularly concerned with a device which can be attached to a fixed subperiosteal or intrabony anchor and from which forces can be generated to move teeth and correct malocclusions.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Discussion of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      The use of fixed, immovable bony anchors as rigid objects from which to exert forces to move teeth has been considered in orthodontics for more than twenty years.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Sherman, A. J., "Bone reaction to orthodontic forces on vitreous carbon dental implants," American Journal of Orthodontics, vol. 74, p. 79, 1978, and Smith, J. R., "Bone dynamics associated with the controlled loading of bioglass-coated aluminum oxide endosteal implants," American Journal of Orthodontics, vol. 76, p. 618, 1979. These early studies used animal models. and it was not until 1983 that their use was demonstrated in clinical orthodontics.

      All of the above mentioned anchor systems utilize either endosseous or subperiosteal placement and afford rigid, immovable objects from which teeth can be moved forward, backward, upward, downward and sideways.
      <br/>
      However, the surgical placement of these anchors in certain areas of the mouth is frequently very difficult because of limited access, thinness of the overlying soft tissue, irritations caused during routine oral functions, and the presence of nearby roots, nerves and blood vessels.
      <br/>
      Additionally. the means of attaching to these anchors is technically difficult and complicated mechanical objects are required to facilitate tooth movement and orthodontic corrections.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      It is technically difficult to work in the back and roof of the mouth but the overlying tissue is thick.
      <br/>
      It is easy to work on the sides of the mouth opposite the upper teeth, but the overlying tissue is thin and irritation from the anchors and the presence of the roots of the teeth limit use in these areas.
      <br/>
      Right at the midline of the maxilla and mandible surgical access, tissue thickness and minimal irritation are present.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      This invention can be adapted to any bony anchor system.
      <br/>
      Only a single anchor is needed and said anchor is placed in the front of the mouth and between the roots of the maxillary or mandibular central incisors.
      <br/>
      Onto a modified anchor head, an attachment is placed which stabilizes a rigid, heavy buccal wire.
      <br/>
      This wire in effect extends the influence of the anchor curvilinearly.
      <br/>
      Various attachments can be placed on this wire and from these attachments forces can be generated to move teeth.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="11">
      Referring now more particularly to FIG. 1., the Bony Anchor Extender (BAE) 1, is attached to a bony anchor 2 by a connector assembly 3.
      <br/>
      As the BAE extends distally it terminates as a free end 4.
      <br/>
      At any point along the BAE, attachments 5 can be placed and secured.
      <br/>
      From these attachments three dimensional movement of teeth or a tooth can be accomplished.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, an intrusive force is generated on the maxillary molar and to a lesser extent other posterior teeth by a wire shown in resting 6 and activated 7 (shown in dotted lines) states.
      <br/>
      Note that there is no equal and opposite effect on the anterior teeth.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In FIG. 2. the right molar is mesialized by attachment 8 at the distal of the BAE.
      <br/>
      A closed coil spring 9 hooks onto a vertically extending wire 10 which encourages translational movement to the first molar.
      <br/>
      A vertical attachment 11 and open coil spring 12 can selectively extrude one or more teeth while the elastic thread 13 intrudes the maxillary centrals.
      <br/>
      Stops 14 on the BAE and on each side of the connector stabilize the connector.
      <br/>
      The left molar is distalized by open coil spring 15 encased in a cylinder 16 which is attached to the BAE 17.
      <br/>
      A wire extension 18 attached to the molar is pressed upon by sliding plunger 19 of the distalizing cylinder/spring assembly 15, 16, 19.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      FIG. 3 is an enlargement of FIG. 1 to better illustrate connector assembly 3 which consists of three components, wire midportion 20, the attachment 21 to the bony anchor head 22. and the attachment to the BAE 23.
      <br/>
      Note in this illustration that the midportion 20 fits into the attachment to the BAE 23 as illustrated at 24.
      <br/>
      The extended cylinder of the attachment 25, can be pressed firmly around the midportion 20 that fits into the BAE attachment 23.
      <br/>
      Then the entire BAE and attachment can be removed and either spot welded, soldered or stabilized in other ways so as to obtain a firm three dimensional configuration which can then be reinserted onto bony anchor head 22 and fixed by either a ligature wire or drop pin as illustrated in FIG. 6.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      FIG. 4 is a frontal view of the connector assembly.
      <br/>
      The attachment to the bony anchor 21, the midportion 20 and the attachment to the BAE 23 are clearly visible.
      <br/>
      The way the connector fits into the vertical cylinder 25 of the BAE attachment 23 can be seen.
      <br/>
      Stops 26 on each side of BAE attachment 23 help stabilize the attachment assembly 3 onto BAE 1.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In FIGS. 5a-5f a variety of heads are illustrated which can either be placed on any bony anchor or be made an integral part thereof.
      <br/>
      More specifically, an angular head is shown in FIG. 5a, a solid wedge with flush ends is shown in FIG. 5b an enclosed wedge with rounded ends is shown in FIG. 5c, an open rectangular box is shown in FIG. 5d, a spherical head is shown in FIG. 5e, and an octagonal head is shown in FIG. 5f.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The connector assemblies are attachable to the bony anchor heads in FIGS. 5a-5e by ligature wire 27, as shown in FIG. 5a, or by drop pin 28, as shown in FIGS. 6a and 6b.</p>
    <p num="17">
      FIG. 7 illustrates a means of attaching the BAE to the bony anchor.
      <br/>
      A hollow T shaped crimpable cylinder 29 is placed onto BAE 1 and positioned by rotation and lateral movement to just that location where the midportion of the connector 20 can fit inside the vertical cylinder 25.
      <br/>
      Crimpable vertical cylinder 25 is then crimped along with the crimping of the other members of the T thereby securing the midportion in place.
      <br/>
      Thereafter BAE 1 and the connector assembly are removed from the mouth and these crimped portions of the hollow T shaped portion 29 are welded, soldered or secured in place by other means.
    </p>
    <p num="18">FIG. 8 is another means of making the connector attachment in which a screw clamp 30 is substituted for the crimpable aspects of hollow fitting 29 on the BAE.</p>
    <p num="19">FIGS. 9a and 9b show another embodiment of the BAE in which center portion 31 is generally rectangular and cap 32 envelopes portion 31 at the BAE end of the attachment mechanism.</p>
    <p num="20">
      In FIGS. 10a-10e, a number of designs of the attachment which is placed on the BAE are depicted.
      <br/>
      Specifically shown is the crimpable nature of portion 33 which goes over the BAE and piggyback attachments 34 which are connected to the crimpable portion 33.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 10b and 10e show a piggyback tube or cylinder which is stabilized by means of locking screw 35 and clamp 36.
