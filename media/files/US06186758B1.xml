      <br/>
      A compressor in accordance with the present invention includes a male rotor which is axially aligned with and in communication with two female rotors.
      <br/>
      The compressor includes a housing and a thrust balance configuration.
      <br/>
      The thrust balance configuration includes a thrust balance disc mounted to a male rotor shaft in a discharge housing of the compressor.
      <br/>
      The thrust balance disc is exposed to fluid from the compressor at high pressure.
      <br/>
      The outside diameter of the thrust balance is sized to provide sufficient area to react thrust loads produced by the first rotor.
      <br/>
      The thrust balance configuration serves to balance the thrust loads imparted on the male rotor and allows for full axial discharge porting.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to helical screw type compressors.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention relates to a multi-screw compressor having, e.g., a male rotor and at least two female rotors.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Helical type compressors are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      One such helical compressor employs one male rotor axially aligned with and in communication with one female rotor.
      <br/>
      The pitch diameter of the female rotor is greater than the pitch diameter of the male rotor.
      <br/>
      Typically, the male rotor is the drive rotor, however compressors have been built with the female rotor being the drive rotor.
      <br/>
      The combination of one male rotor and one female rotor in a compressor is commonly referred to as a twin screw or rotor, such is well know in the art and has been in commercial use for decades.
      <br/>
      An example of one such twin rotor commonly employed with compressors in the HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) industry is shown in FIG. 1 herein, labeled prior art.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 1 herein, a cross sectional view of a male rotor 10 which drives an axially aligned female rotor 12 is shown.
      <br/>
      Male rotor 10 is driven by a motor, not shown, as is well known.
      <br/>
      Male rotor 10 has four lobes 14-17 with a 300 (degree)  wrap and female rotor 12 has six flutes 18-23 with a 200 (degree)  wrap.
      <br/>
      The resulting gap between the male and female rotors requires oil to be introduced into the compression area for sealing, however, the oil also provides cooling and lubricating, as is well known.
      <br/>
      However, the introduction of this oil requires the use of an oil separation device, to separate the oil from the refrigerant being compressed in HVAC compressors.
      <br/>
      The primary benefit of the twin rotor configuration is the low interface velocity between the male and female rotors during operation.
      <br/>
      However, the twin rotor configuration is not balanced and therefore incurs large radial bearing loads and thrust loads.
      <br/>
      The obvious solution to alleviating the bearing load problem would be to install sufficiently sized bearings.
      <br/>
      This is not a feasible solution, since the relative diameters of the rotors in practice result in the rotors being too close together to allow installation of sufficiently sized bearings.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The prior art has addressed this problem, with the introduction of compressors employing `so-called` single screw technology.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3 herein, labeled prior art, a drive rotor 24 with two opposing axially perpendicular gate rotors 26 and 28 is shown.
      <br/>
      Rotor 24 is driven by a motor, not shown, as is well known.
      <br/>
      Rotor 24 has six grooves 30 and each gate rotor 26, 28 has eleven teeth 32, 34, respectively, which intermesh with grooves 30.
      <br/>
      The gate rotors 26 and 28 are generally comprised of a composite material which allows positioning of the gate rotor at a small clearance from the drive rotor.

      This clearance is small enough that the liquid refrigerant itself provides sufficient sealing, the liquid refrigerant also provides cooling and lubrication.
      <br/>
      The rearward positioning of gate rotors 26 and 28 and the positioning on opposing sides of drive rotor 24, (1) allows equalizing suction of pressure at both ends of rotor 24 thereby virtually eliminating the thrust loads encountered with the above described twin screw system and (2) balances the radial loading on rotor 24 thereby minimizing radial bearing loads.
      <br/>
      However, the interface velocity between the gate rotors and the drive rotor are very high.

    <p num="8">
      The above-discussed and other drawbacks and deficiencies of the prior art are overcome or alleviated by the multi-rotor compressor of the present invention.

      The thrust balance configuration is sized to sufficiently balance the thrust loads imparted on the male rotor and allows for full axial discharge porting as the outside diameter of the thrust balance device is generally about or less than the root diameter of the male rotor, as shown by FIGS. 4 and 5A-5C.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="14">
      Referring to FIG. 4, a cross sectional view of a hermetically sealed motor/compressor system in accordance with the present invention is generally shown at 200.
      <br/>
      A male rotor 42 is axially aligned with and in communication with female rotors (not shown).
      <br/>
      Male rotor 42 is driven by a hermetically sealed motor 92.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      As demonstrated in the prior art, the positioning of the female rotors on opposing sides of male rotor 42 balances the radial loading on male rotor 42 thereby minimizing radial bearing loads.
      <br/>
      Also, due to larger diameter male drive rotor as compared to the male drive rotor in the prior art twin screw compressors and therefore the additional distance between the rotors, any radial bearing stress can be further minimized with sufficiently sized bearings.
      <br/>
      It will also be appreciated, that interface velocity between the male and female rotors during operation is very low, whereby the extensive damage suffered by the prior art single screw compressors when lubrication is lost, due to the high interface velocities of the rotors, is reduced.
      <br/>
      The low interface velocity results in minimal sliding action at the pitch band interface of the rotors.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      A bearing 201 is mounted on shaft 94 near the discharge end of compressor 90 to react any remaining radial bearing loads imparted to the shaft.
      <br/>
      Bearing 201 is shown as a double row angular contact ball type.
      <br/>
      Compressor 90 further comprises a housing having a discharge housing portion 202, a bearing housing portion 203, and end cap 204.
      <br/>
      Discharge housing portion 202 of compressor 90 comprises porting which communicates with the radial and axial port areas of the rotors, as is well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Also disposed within discharge housing portion 202 is thrust balance disc 205 mounted to shaft 94.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Refrigerant at high pressure (represented by arrow 207) is introduced into the discharge housing 202 through a port (not shown).
      <br/>
      With reference to FIG. 5A high pressure refrigerant 207 from port 208 acts on face 209 of thrust balance disc 205 counteract the imbalance force created by the large male rotor as described herein above.
      <br/>
      Thrust balance disc 205 is fixed axially onto shaft 94, or alternatively an integral portion of male rotor 42, by lock ring 210 threaded onto shaft 94 as is well known in the industry.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that in order to properly balance the thrust in compressor 90 the diameter of the balance disc 205 is generally represented by dimension "B" in FIG. 5A. It will also be appreciated that any thrust load imbalance remaining will be reacted by double row angular contact bearing 201.
      <br/>
      In operation of compressor 90 the condensing pressure starts low and builds as does the liquid line pressure of refrigerant 207 introduced at port 202.
      <br/>
      Balance piston 205 eliminates the need for the discharge side plate of the prior art during normal operation and allows for full axial area discharge.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Balance disc 205, which rotates with male rotor 42 and shaft 94, further comprises a labyrinth seal 211 which provides a small clearance between the balance disc and wall 212 of discharge housing 100.
      <br/>
      The small clearance allows refrigerant 207 to leak past balance disc 205.
      <br/>
      As the refrigerant leaks past labyrinth 211 it expands to lower pressure represented by arrows 213 to provide cooling and lubrication to bearing 201 and is exhausted through passage 214 and reintroduced into the compressor 90 at a low pressure port (not shown).
      <br/>
      Similarly labyrinth seal 215 provides a dynamic seal between the male rotor 42 and wall 216 to maintain high pressure to react the axial loads between reaction face 209 and wall 216 of the discharge housing 202.
      <br/>
      During operation, bearing 201 and passage 214 are maintained at a relatively low pressure, compared to high pressure refrigerant 207, providing a pressure differential which allows refrigerant to flow from port 208 past labyrinth seal 211 through bearing 201 and into passage 214.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a pressure differential exists between port 208 and the low pressure area 217 of male rotor 42 which allows high pressure refrigerant 207 to leak past labyrinth 215 and refrigerant 213 to enter low pressure area 217 of compressor 90.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that bearing 201 is of a class of bearings requiring little lubrication such as, for example, hybrid ceramic bearings.
      <br/>
      Prior art bearings require a higher level of lubrication than is generally considered practical for use with the present invention.
      <br/>
      Bearing 201 is disposed within separate bearing housing 203, which allows installation of disc 205, and held in place by bearing lock nut 218 and spring washer 219 as is well known in the industry.
      <br/>
      End plate 204 biases the spring washer 219 and seals passage 214 from the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Now with reference to FIG. 5B, there is shown an alternative embodiment of a thrust balance device in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this particular embodiment thrust balance disc 220 functions similar to that described herein above in that high pressure refrigerant 207 enters from port 208 to react against balance disc 220 and annular disc 221 to react the axial loads produced by male rotor 42.
      <br/>
      A portion of high pressure refrigerant 207 leaks past labyrinth seal 222 and into passage 214 while the remainder of high pressure refrigerant 207 leaks past labyrinth seal 223 expands into low pressure, cooler, refrigerant 213 and cools and lubricates bearing 201 and continues on to flow into low pressure area 217 of compressor 90.
      <br/>
      An advantage to this particular embodiment over that shown in FIG. 5A is the reduction in parts and assembly steps as there is an integral discharge/bearing housing 224 and thrust balance disc 220 incorporates several features.
      <br/>
      For instance both labyrinth seals 222, 223 are disposed on the disc and the disc also retains the inner race of bearing 201.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment shown disc 220 is mounted to shaft 94 by bolt 225.
      <br/>
      It is contemplated that there may be a plurality of bolts attaching disc 220 to shaft 94 as well as being directly threadably engaged onto an externally threaded portion of shaft 94 (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Referring to FIG. 5C there is shown another embodiment of a thrust balance device in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      This particular embodiment is similar to that described herein above and shown in FIG. 5B with the biggest difference being that the bearing 201 is flooded with high pressure refrigerant 207 instead of expanded low pressure refrigerant 213.
      <br/>
      In this particular configuration high pressure refrigerant 207 acts between thrust disc 226 and the entire bearing cavity ending at the labyrinth teeth adjacent wall 227 of discharge/bearing housing 224 to react the axial loads imparted to the bearing 201 from the large male rotor 42.
      <br/>
      In addition the outer race of bearing 201 is mounted within discharge/bearing housing 224 by spanner type bearing block 228 as is well known in the industry.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Although the present invention is shown in relation to a hermetically sealed motor/compressor configuration with refrigerant as the operating fluid it is only by way of example.
      <br/>
      It is contemplated that the present invention may also, by way of example, comprise a discharge side thrust balance device for an open type air multi-rotor compressor driven by an externally mounted motor or an internally mounted motor (not shown).
      <br/>
      To balance the thrust load, in an open type air compressor, water is introduced through ports reacts against a thrust balance disc similar to that described herein above.
      <br/>
      The compressor is sealed, cooled and lubricated by water and should be noted that the double row angular contact bearing is maintained at high pressure and filled with water.
      <br/>
      The discharge side plate of the prior art is no longer needed and axial discharge of the male rotor is thereby permitted.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Further, while the above described embodiment has been described with only two female rotors, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more female rotors may be employed with a single drive male rotor.
      <br/>
      The female rotors are distributed evenly about the male rotor to balance radial forces against the male rotor as hereinbefore described.
      <br/>
      In addition, while the embodiment shown in FIG. 4 is directed toward a liquid refrigerant type compressor and while the embodiment shown in FIG. 5 is directed toward an air type compressor, it is within the scope of the present invention that either embodiment is suitable for either application and is also applicable in other helical type compressors, e.g., compressors with working fluids such as helium, air and ammonia.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the multi-rotor compressor of the present invention may be extremely well suited for oil-less air compression.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      While preferred embodiments have been shown and described, various modifications and substitutions may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is to be understood that the present invention has been described by way of illustrations and not limitation.
