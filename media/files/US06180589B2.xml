    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to novel polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymers which are effective sequestering agents.
      <br/>
      The polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer when used in a cleaning composition enhances or "builds" the cleaning efficiency of a surfactant by inactivating hardness ions.
      <br/>
      The copolymers also assist in cleaning by dispersing and suspending soils to prevent the redeposition of soils onto cleaned articles.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The role of sequestering agents in softening water by complexing the "hardness" cations in water supplies is well-known.
      <br/>
      Sequestering agents are recognized aids in detergent processes because they form a soluble complex with calcium and magnesium ions which can react with soaps and other anionic surfactants and otherwise adversely affect detergency.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Polyphosphates such as tripolyphosphates and pyrophosphates are widely used as ingredients in detergent compositions in part because of their property of sequestering hardness ions.
      <br/>
      Such phosphorus-containing compounds as well as nitrogen-containing compounds, e.g., nitrilotriacetates, are highly effective.
      <br/>
      However, the effect of the phosphorus content and the nitrogen content of these sequestering agents upon eutrophication of lakes and streams has been questioned and the use of phosphates in detergent compositions has been subject to government scrutiny, regulation or prohibition.
    </p>
    <p num="4">These circumstances have developed a need for highly effective and efficient phosphorus-free and nitrogen-free sequestering agents and detergency builders.</p>

    <p num="8">In the above structure of U.S. Pat. No. 4,228,300, M is alkali metal or ammonium, R1 and R2 are hydrogen, methyl or ethyl and R3 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or COOM.</p>
    <p num="9">U.S. Pat. No. 3,769,223, describes 1-oxacyclopropane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (i.e., epoxysuccinic acid) and its soluble salts as detergent builders.</p>

    <p num="11">
      In the above structure of U.S. Pat. No. 3,776,850, R is hydrogen or other specified radicals and n is from 2 to about 40, preferably from 2 to about 6.
      <br/>
      The polymers are prepared by polymerization of the diethyl ester of 1-oxacyclopropane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (i.e., epoxysuccinic acid) in the presence of a boron trifluoride catalyst followed by saponification.
      <br/>
      Detergent compositions are exemplified in which n is said to have an average value of approximately 3 or 4.

    <p num="15">According to another aspect the invention also provides a cleaning composition comprising from about 0.5 to about 98 weight percent, based on the weight of the cleaning composition, of the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer.</p>
    <p num="16">
      In a cleaning composition, the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer enhances or "builds" the cleaning efficiency of a surfactant by inactivating hardness ions such as calcium and magnesium, and other metal ions such as iron.
      <br/>
      The polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymers soften water by sequestration.
      <br/>
      In addition, the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymers assist in cleaning by dispersing and suspending soils to prevent the redeposition of soils onto cleaned articles.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">The polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymers have the structure  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="18">
      wherein M+ is a cation wherein M is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, ammonia, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, zinc, copper, organic amines, amino acids, and amino saccharides.
      <br/>
      Preferably the cation is independently hydrogen or sodium.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In the above structure for the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer, R2 and R3 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a substituted alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      When R2 and R3 are hydrogen, the monomer used to prepare the repeating unit (a) is maleic acid.
      <br/>
      However, methylmaleic acid (citraconic acid) and other substituted cisbutenedioic acids can be substituted for maleic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In the above structure for the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer, R1 is the residue of an ethylenically unsaturated comonomer having at least one functional group which is selected from the group consisting of carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid and phosphonic acid.
      <br/>
      Suitable ethylenically unsaturated comonomers having a carboxylic acid functional group are acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, ethacrylic acid, alpha-chloro-acrylic acid, alpha cyano acrylic acid, crotonic acid, alpha phenyl acrylic acid, beta acryloxy propionic acid, sorbic acid, angelic acid, cinnamic acid, glutaconic acid, 2-acrylamido glycolic acid, and tricarboxyethylene.
      <br/>
      A preferred ethylenically unsaturated comonomer having carboxylic acid functional groups is itaconic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Suitable ethylenically unsaturated comonomers having a sulfonic acid or phosphonic acid functional group are vinyl sulfonic acid, sodium methallyl sulfonate, 2-acrylamido 2 methyl propane sulfonic acid, allyloxybenzene sulfonic acid, and vinyl phosphonic acid.
      <br/>
      Preferred ethylenically unsaturated comonomers having a sulfonic acid or phosphonic acid functional group are vinyl sulfonic acid and vinyl phosphonic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Thus, the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer is prepared from (a) and (b) repeating units.
      <br/>
      The (a) repeat units are derived from either maleic acid, methylmaleic acid, or other substituted cisbutenedioic acids.
      <br/>
      The (b) repeat units are derived from an ethylenically unsaturated comonomer having at least one functional group which is selected from the group consisting of carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid and phosphonic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In the above structure for the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer, n is from about 2 to about 100.
      <br/>
      Preferably n is from about 2 to about 20, more preferably from 2 to 10.
      <br/>
      The letters x1 and x2 are independently 0 or 1.
      <br/>
      The letter a is from 0 to 99 mole percent, preferably 20 to 99 mole percent.
      <br/>
      The letter b is from 1 to 100 mole percent, preferably 1 to 80 mole percent, provided that (a+b) is 100 mole percent.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      A preferred process for preparing the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymers involves mixing the monomer(s) responsible for repeating unit (a) and comonomer(s) responsible for repeating unit (b) together with water to form a mixture.
      <br/>
      The monomer(s) and comonomer(s) in the mixture are neutralized or partially neutralized using a base.
      <br/>
      A preferred base is sodium hydroxide.
      <br/>
      Preferably, at least 60% of the total acid groups are neutralized.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The next step involves epoxidation of the ethylenically unsaturated double bonds present in the monomer(s) and comonomer(s) to form a mixture of epoxides.
      <br/>
      Methods for epoxidation are well known in the art, such as described by G. B. Payne and P. H. Williams in the Journal of Organic Chemistry, vol. 24, p. 54 (1959) which is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      For example, a combination of an oxidizer such as hydrogen peroxide and a catalyst such as sodium tungstate may be used.
      <br/>
      It is within the scope of the invention that not all of the ethylenically unsaturated double bonds present in the monomer(s) and comonomer(s) are epoxidized.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the neutralization step or partial neutralization may be carried out after forming the epoxides.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The epoxides are polymerized by means of an anionic polymerization process to form the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer product.
      <br/>
      Any monomer(s) and/or comonomer(s) which have not been epoxidized may be polymerized such that either x1, x2, or both are equal to 0 in the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer product.
      <br/>
      Preferably, x1 and x2 are equal to 1 in the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer.
      <br/>
      The polymerization is conducted in the presence of calcium hydroxide or other alkaline calcium salts.
      <br/>
      A description of a method for polymerizing an epoxide derived from maleic acid is included in U.S. Pat. No. 4,654,159 which is incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer product containing sodium and calcium salts can be used in the form of an aqueous solution.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the sodium or calcium salts may be replaced by means of ion exchange by an alkali metal, such as sodium, or by ammonium, substituted ammonium, or hydrogen.
      <br/>
      Optional removal of low molecular weight components (n=1) may be carried out using a suitable process such as vacuum distillation.
    </p>
    <p num="28">In one embodiment of the invention, the process can be represented as follows:  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="29">wherein CH2 CHR4 is an ethylenically unsaturated comonomer containing carboxylic acid, phosphonic acid, sulfonic acid group or a combination thereof.</p>
    <p num="30">The concentration of the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer in a cleaning composition is from about 0.5 to about 98 weight percent, based on the weight of the cleaning composition, Preferably the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymers are present in an amount of from about 1 to about 20 weight percent, more preferably 1 to 10 weight percent, based on the weight of the cleaning composition.</p>
    <p num="31">
      The polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer may be used in any cleaning composition.

      The cleaning composition may be a solid or liquid composition.
      <br/>
      If the cleaning composition is solid, the cleaning composition may be in any of the usual physical forms, such as for example, powders, beads, flakes, bars, tablets, noodles, pastes, and slurries.
      <br/>
      If the cleaning composition is liquid, the cleaning composition preferably disperses or solubilizes the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer.
      <br/>
      The cleaning composition may be aqueous or nonaqueous.
      <br/>
      For example, the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer may be dissolved or dispersed in water, in one or more solvents or inert diluents.
      <br/>
      Preferably the cleaning composition is aqueous.
    </p>

      <br/>
      Another modification consists of reacting the free OH groups of the polyalkylene oxides with isocyanates.
      <br/>
      The nonionic surfactants also include C4 to C18 alkyl glucosides as well as the alkoxylated products obtainable therefrom by alkoxylation, particularly those obtainable by reaction of alkyl glucosides with ethylene oxide.

      <br/>
      Typical cationic surfactants include, for example, amine compounds, oxygen containing amines, and quaternary amine salts.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Amphoteric surfactants contain both acidic and basic hydrophilic groups.
      <br/>
      Amphoteric surfactants are preferably derivatives of secondary and tertiary amines, derivatives of quaternary ammonium, quaternary phosphonium or tertiary sulfonium compounds.

      Glycols and glycol ethers that are useful as solvents include, for example, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and oligomers of ethylene or propylene glycol.
    </p>
    <p num="42">Solid cleaning compositions containing the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer preferably contain up to 60 weight percent of one or more solid inert diluents such as sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, sodium borate, or selected polymers such as polyethylene glycol or propylene glycol.</p>
    <p num="43">
      The cleaning composition may contain 0 to about 50 weight percent of one or more buffering agents.
      <br/>
      Buffering agents include, for example, one or more alkali metal salts such as silicates, carbonates, or sulfates.
      <br/>
      Buffering agents also include, for example, organic alkalis such as triethanolamine, monoethanolamine, and triisopropanolamine.
    </p>
    <p num="44">Other additives which optionally may be included in the cleaning compositions especially for detergent compositions are bleaching agents, used in an amount of up to about 30 weight percent, corrosion inhibitors such as silicates used in an amount of up to about 25 weight percent, dye deposition inhibiting agents used in an amount up to about 20 weight percent, and graying inhibitors used in an amount of up to about 5 weight percent.</p>
    <p num="45">
      Suitable bleaching agents are, for example, perborates, percarbonates, or chlorine-generating substances such as chloroisocyanurates.
      <br/>
      Suitable silicates used as corrosion inhibitors are, for example, sodium silicate, sodium disilicate, and sodium metasilicate.
      <br/>
      Suitable dye deposition inhibiting agents are, for example, polyvinyl pyrrolidone.
      <br/>
      Examples of graying inhibitors are, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, and graft copolymers of vinyl acetate and polyalkylene oxides having a molecular weight of 1,000 to 15,000.

    <p num="46">
      In a cleaning composition, the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymer enhances or "builds" the cleaning efficiency of a surfactant by inactivating hardness ions such as calcium and magnesium, and other metal ions such as iron.
      <br/>
      The polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymers soften water by sequestration.
      <br/>
      In addition, the polyether hydroxycarboxylate copolymers assist in cleaning by dispersing and suspending soils to prevent the redeposition of soils onto cleaned substrates.
