      The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for separating high molecular weight molecules from low molecular weight molecules.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the invention relates to the use of microdialysis for removal of the salt (low molecular weight molecules) from a nucleotide sample (high molecular weight molecules) for ESI-MS analysis.
      <br/>
      The dialysis or separation performance of the present invention is improved by (1) increasing dialysis temperature thereby increasing desalting efficiency and improving spectrum quality; (2) adding piperidine and imidazole to the dialysis buffer solution and reducing charge states and further increasing detection sensitivity for DNA; (3) using low concentrations (0-2.5 mM NH4OAc) of dialysis buffer and shifting the DNA negative ions to higher charge states, producing a nearly 10-fold increase in detection sensitivity and a slightly decreased desalting efficiency, (4) conducting a two-stage separation or (5) any combination of (1), (2), (3) and (4).

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for separating biomolecules and other high molecular weight compounds from low molecular weight molecules.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the invention relates to the use of microdialysis for separation and removal of the salt (low molecular weight molecules) from biomolecules in a biological sample for subsequent analysis.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term biomolecule includes but is not limited to carbohydrates, glycoproteins, peptides, nucleotides oligonucleotides, oligonucleotide duplexes, quadruplexes, and DNA-protein complexes, DNA segment, proteins, synthetic polymers biopolymers and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term low molecular weight molecule includes salts as well as other molecules with a molecular weight less than a thousand daltons, for example ionic species as well as multi-element compounds.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      The use of electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) has increased for characterizing biomolecules, for example proteins and oligonucleotides as well as other high molecular weight compounds.
      <br/>
      Collisional induced dissociation methods have provided information on amino acid and nucleotide sequence and sites of damage or modification.
      <br/>
      ESI-MS has been more recently used for analysis of non-covalent complexes including oligonucleotide duplexes, quadruplexes, and DNA-protein complexes, and probing the higher order structure of proteins.
      <br/>
      However, biological samples prepared under physiological conditions typically contain significant concentrations of salts (e.g., sodium chloride) as well as other non-volatile reagents added to stabilize samples or to maintain their enzymatic activity.
      <br/>
      The presence of small to moderate amounts of sodium salts, for example, affects electrospray stability due to changes in solution conductivity, and may significantly reduce the detected analyte ion abundance due to both suppression of ionization and the formation of multiple species having sodium adducts.
      <br/>
      Low signal-to-noise ratios of the mass spectra and poor reproducibility due to excessive adduction can result in inaccurate mass assignments and, in severe cases, even preclude spectrum interpretation.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Sodium adduct formation is attributed primarily to electrostatic interactions of sodium ions with negatively charged sites on the high molecular weight molecules, e.g. phosphate groups on the polynucleotide backbone in DNA.
      <br/>
      Large DNA molecules have a proportionally higher affinity for sodium ion because of the extended polynucleotide backbone.
      <br/>
      Therefore, removal of sodium ion from large DNA molecules to the levels required to produce high quality spectra is more difficult than for small oligonucleotides.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Various methods have been used to reduce cation adduction and other types of problematic contamination due to low MW species.
      <br/>
      A common approach is the multiple buffer exchange method using a membrane cartridges.
      <br/>
      The salt-containing sample is repeatedly diluted with ammonium acetate buffer and concentrated by centrifugation, resulting in a decreased salt concentration.
      <br/>
      This process, although simple in nature, typically requires several hours and often results in significant sample losses, which greatly limits its analytical capability for limited sample sizes.
      <br/>
      The desalting efficiency of this technique is very low for DNA samples due to the high affinity of DNA molecules for sodium, and significant cation adduct ions are still present even after more than five cycles of buffer exchange.

    <p num="7">
      Although on-line LC/MS can tolerate small to moderate amounts of salt, and desalting columns are commercially available, they are not suitable for many ESI-MS experiments where samples may precipitate on the column, interact with the solvent, or when very high salt concentrations are present.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The present invention is a new and efficient apparatus and method for the rapid separation of low molecular weight molecules from high molecular weight molecules in samples that include biomolecules and/or other high molecular weight compounds.
      <br/>
      While the present invention is particularly useful for desalting of oligonucleotides for ESI-MS studies, it is broadly applicable to desalting of other large molecular weight molecules such as carbohydrates, glycoproteins, peptides, nucleotides oligonucleotides, oligonucleotide duplexes, quadruplexes, and DNA-protein complexes, DNA segment, proteins, synthetic polymers, natural products and combinations thereof; and for all other mass spectrometric techniques, as well as any other technique in which sample desalting is desirable.
      <br/>
      Analytical techniques, for example ESI-MS have sample flow rates ranging from a few nanoliters per minute to milliliters per minute, and for ESI-MS specifically, sensitivity increases with decreasing flow rate.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the present invention, useful across the flow rate range, has been specifically demonstrated at low flow rates from about 2 mL/min to about 100 nL/min.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The present invention uses a capillary size dialysis fiber to increase sample surface to volume ratio and a counter-current dialysis buffer flow to increase buffer exchange rate.
      <br/>
      It has demonstrated essentially complete salt removal in &lt;5 minutes at sodium chloride concentrations of as high as 250 mM, compared to several hours for conventional dialysis.
      <br/>
      Thus, there is a surprising 2500 *  improvement in separation/desalting time for only a 50 *  reduction in dialysis tube diameter.
      <br/>
      The advantages of separating the low molecular weight molecules (salt) include (1) an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio of a factor of more than 40 times for ESI-MS analysis compared to that obtained without low molecular weight molecule separation, and (2) greater accuracy in molecular weight measurements.
      <br/>
      It will be apparent to those of skill in the art of large molecule analysis, that the present invention is not limited to the biomolecules of variable size and sequence demonstrated herein, but is useful for other biological samples, synthetic polymers, and natural products as well.
      <br/>
      The fast dialysis rate combined with the pH neutral dialysis buffer also enables the preservation of non-covalent associations.
      <br/>
      The present invention specifically and especially has greatly improved the routine application of ESI-MS in DNA analysis, and has also be demonstrated use for samples that display limited stability after desalting.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Initial results for oligonucleotides and proteins of various sizes have indicated broad applicability of this method.
      <br/>
      Detection of subpicomole samples of a 34-mer oligonucleotide and apomyoglobin having high salt concentrations was also achieved.
      <br/>
      Desalting was completed in one to four minutes for the samples with up to 250 mM of NaCl for DNA and 1.3 M for proteins, which conventionally required several hours using alternative off-line desalting schemes.
      <br/>
      Although a low sample infusion rate of 2-5 ml/min was required for these initial studies, the micro-source electrospray was stable.
      <br/>
      Lower sample infusion rate and lower detection limits are achievable with further development of the method, including the use of dialysis tubes having smaller diameters.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Alternatively sample "plugs" may be used to achieve dialysis of very small samples.</p>
    <p num="19">While the present results obtained at neutral pH conditions preserve the native conformation of the high molecular weight molecules and their noncovalent complexes with ligands, lower pH buffer may also be used to denature (unfold) some large proteins and to increase the efficiency of desalting if a native structure is not required.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The apparatus and method of the present invention may be used online or off-line with respect to any subsequent analytical method or instrumentation.
      <br/>
      When used on-line, on-line coupling of microdialysis with, for example, ESI-MS is facile due to the liquid interface.
      <br/>
      When used off-line, the present invention demonstrated a similar increase in desalting efficiency, compared with conventional centrifugation or other off-line batch-mode dialysis methods.
      <br/>
      The effectiveness of the desalting is ascribed to both the small diameter of dialysis tube used, and the fact that the protein sample solution is much more effectively exposed to the dialysis buffer which is continuously refreshed by the counter flow.
      <br/>
      A more than 10-fold decrease in sample consumption was achieved using the off-line mode vs. on-line mode which resulted in a similar quality spectrum.
      <br/>
      The sample flow rate in an off-line mode may be decreased to permit longer dialysis time for desalting of samples with complicated matrices, without the flow rate limitations encountered in the online mode.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Whether on-line or off-line, the dialysis or separation performance may be improved by (1) increasing dialysis temperature thereby increasing desalting efficiency and improving spectrum quality; (2) adding piperidine and imidazole to the dialysis buffer solution and reducing charge states and further increasing detection sensitivity for DNA; (3) using low concentrations (0-2.5 mM NH4OAc) of dialysis buffer and shifting the DNA negative ions to higher charge states, producing a nearly 10-fold increase in detection sensitivity and a slightly decreased desalting efficiency, (4) performing a two-stage separation or (5) any combination of (1), (2), (3), and (4).
      <br/>
      These performance improvements extend the applicability of the present invention especially for biomolecular analyses (and other analyses) requiring rapid and complete desalting.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The present invention has several advantages over the present state of the art in separating low molecular weight molecules from high molecular weight molecules for analysis.
      <br/>
      The advantages include (1) faster separation (e.g. desalting) speed, (2) greater separation (e.g. desalting) efficiency, (3) smaller sample volume requirement, (4) preservation of native DNA and peptide conformation when a pH neutral dialysis buffer is used, (5) capability dialysis on-line or in-line with an analytical instrument, and (6) reduced buffer consumption, in some cases more than an order of magnitude less buffer than present desalting methods.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      According to a second aspect of the present invention, the dialysis may be further improved by a sample separator placed upstream of the microdialysis unit.
      <br/>
      The "raw" sample is received into the sample separator and flows through or past a sample separation membrane.
      <br/>
      The "separated" sample is the fraction that passes through to the opposite side of the separation membrane.
      <br/>
      The "separated" sample is passed to the microdialysis unit for salt removal.
      <br/>
      If the sample separation membrane in the sample separator has an effective cut-off molecular weight greater than that of the dialysis fiber in the microdialysis unit, then this arrangement has the effect of selecting an intermediate molecular weight fraction that can pass through both stages.
    </p>
    <p num="24">It is an object of the present invention to provide a microdialysis unit for separating low molecular weight molecules from high molecular weight molecules at a faster rate than present separation devices.</p>
    <p num="25">
      It is a further object of the present invention to provide a combined sample separator/microdialysis unit for obtaining substantially "clean" analytical separations for a molecular weight "fraction".
      <br/>
      Substantially "clean" means that the target compound is discernable on a mass spectrum.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The subject matter of the present invention is particularly pointed out and distinctly claimed in the concluding portion of this specification.
      <br/>
      However, both the organization and method of operation, together with further advantages and objects thereof, may best be understood by reference to the following description taken in connection with accompanying drawings wherein like reference characters refer to like elements.

      The inlet end 120 may be a 200 mm o.d., 100 mm i.d. fused silica tubing.
      <br/>
      The outlet end 122 is coupled to the micro-electrospray source 119 (50 mm i.d) through a zero dead volume fitting system (Valco, Houston, Tex.) 124. The zero dead volume fitting 124 is connected to the non-porous outlet 112 which may include a connecting tube 125 of 200 mm o.d., 100 mm i.d. fused silica tubing.
      <br/>
      The sample solution is infused at a flow rate of 2-5 mL/min and the dialysis buffer (10 mM NH4 OAc) is pumped by an Applied Biosystems Solvent Delivery Module 140B (Foster City, Calif.) at a flow rate of 300 ml/min.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the dialysis buffer may be introduced solely by gravity (i.e. vertical displacement of the buffer reservoir over the buffer outlet by .about.30 cm).
      <br/>
      Although the buffer flow rate might change slightly during the dialysis process, the dialysis efficiency is not affected by variation in buffer flow rate.

      This eliminates the requirement for a solvent/buffer pump.

      <br/>
      The sample consumption, however, is substantially reduced (&gt;90%) by injecting only a small sample plug followed by pumping the dialysis buffer into the microdialysis system.

      For microdialysis at elevated temperature (e.g. 50 (degree)  C.) or subambient temperature (0-4 (degree)  C., for thermal sensitive samples or samples having limited stability after desalting), the microdialysis unit 100 may be placed inside a water bath, the temperature of which is controlled by either an external stirrer heating 15 device or a cooling device controlling temperature to +0.5 (degree)  C. The water bath is preferably stirred to ensure a homogeneous temperature inside.
      <br/>
      Any thermostatted or controlled heater would suffice to maintain the microdialysis unit 100 at an elevated temperature.

      The elevated temperature may range from a degree above room temperature to any temperature below a sample degrading temperature, or a dialysis tube degrading temperature, whichever is lower.

      In FIG. 1b, a two-stage apparatus is shown.
      <br/>
      The microdialysis unit 100 is placed downstream of a sample separator 200.
      <br/>
      The sample separator 200 receives "raw" sample through a raw sample inlet 202 that flows over a separation membrane 204.
      <br/>
      Compounds having a molecular weight below the effective cut-off of the first stage membrane separator can pass through to the opposite side 206 of the separation membrane 204 and be passed to the inlet 120.
      <br/>
      Samples are injected from one side 202 of the membrane 204.
      <br/>
      A portion of sample diffuses through the membrane 204 and enteres the second stage microdialysis unit 100.
      <br/>
      The remaining sample flows directly from outlet 214 and can be recovered and further processed if desired.
      <br/>
      This partial flow provides a channel for sweeping out cellular residues and results in significantly reduced membrane clogging.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, outlet 214 may be completely sealed if the lifetime of the membrane is not of concern.
      <br/>
      The sample flow rate entering the second stage microdialysis unit 100 can be adjusted by controlling (i.e., restricting) the flow rate at the outlet 214 through use of fused silica tubing of various length and inner diameter, similar to flow splitting in HPLC as described in Chervet, J. P.; Meijvogel, C. J.; Ursen, M.; Salmann, J. P. LC-GC, 1992, 10, 140-148.
      <br/>
      With a dead volume in the tubing of about 80  MU L, sample preparation requires about 20 minutes.

      Reduction of dead volume (shortening or eliminating the tubing) would reduce sample preparation time to less than 5 minutes.

      Operation of the two-stage or dual-microdialysis system begins with injecting a sample, for example a complex biological sample (e.g., a crude cell lysate) into the first stage sample separator for the removal of high MW contaminants including cell debris; the dialysate which contains only medium MW target compounds and low MW contaminants will be directly injected on-line into the second stage of the microdialysis unit for the removal of low MW contaminants.
      <br/>
      A clean fraction of sample consisting of only medium MW target species is produced that can be directly analyzed by micro-ESI-MS.
      <br/>
      The molecular weight range of interest can be controlled by selection of appropriate MWCO membranes in both stages.
      <br/>
      The functional MWCO will be affected by many factors such as sample flow rate, complexity of sample and length of usage of the membrane, and should be determined experimentally.

      Separating the sample prior to desalting dialysis has the advantage(s) of allowing a second molecular weight separation step allowing a MW fraction to be produced.

      For complex samples, such as raw biological cell that have been mechanically lysed, this allows high MW cellular "rubble" and large insoluble proteins to be removed prior to use.

      All samples were studied using both direct infusion and the on-line microdialysis with ESI-MS.
      <br/>
      For DNA conformation studies (see Results and Discussion), oligonucleotides -1 and -2 were further diluted to a final concentration of 6 mM in 10 mM NH4 OAc and 250 mM NaCl.

      The concentration of the dialysis buffer was varied to examine the effects of buffer concentration on both DNA duplex formation and desalting efficiency.

    <p num="48">Although the MWCO of the dialysis tubing was claimed as 13,000 (with a retention of 90%), it was expected that the sample loss would be minimal due to the short residence time of the sample in the microdialysis tube.</p>

      As shown in FIG. 2a, direct infusion of oligonucleotides -1 and -2 in 10 mM NH4 OAc produced an uninterpretable spectrum due to sodium adduction even though the concentration of sodium was expected to be low.

      Only one charge state was distinctly observed for each species (FIG. 2a(I)) and the signal to noise ratio was poor.

      <br/>
      The sodium adduct peaks were not observed, and a more than 5 fold increase in signal to noise ratio was obtained compared to direct infusion.

      A systematic change in the flow rate of the dialysis buffer from 100 ml/min to 600 ml/min did not significantly alter the desalting efficiency.

      For the purpose of reducing solvent consumption and maintaining a stable dialysis buffer flow, a flow rate of 300 ml/min was used for all subsequent studies.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The sample solution flow rate was found to be important for desalting efficiency.
      <br/>
      When the sample flow rate was increased to 10 ml/min, desalting was incomplete and significant sodium adduct peaks were observed.
      <br/>
      This can be attributed to the decreased dialysis time experienced by the sample.
      <br/>
      Although a low sample flow rate would result in longer dialysis times, and therefore higher desalting efficiency, a minimum sample flow rate was found necessary to produce a stable ESI current.
      <br/>
      Since the solvent was free to cross the dialysis membrane, the effective "splitting effect" (e.g., the apparent diversion of solvent and other low molecular weight species across the microdialysis membrane) dictated that the minimum sample flow rate for a stable electrospray was higher than by direct infusion.

      For the experimental arrangement used in this work, 2 ml/min was found to be the minimum sample flow rate producing a stable electrospray.

      Even at a 250 mM NaCl concentration, a useful spectrum was readily obtained (FIG. 5c).

      Preservation of the duplex conformation of DNA during on-line microdialysis.

      <br/>
      At an inlet capillary temperature of 140 EC, peaks corresponding to the double-stranded DNA were barely discernible in the spectrum, as shown in FIG. 2a, due to dissociation in the ESI-MS interface.

      When the inlet capillary temperature is reduced, peaks due to the intact duplex are expected, if present in solution.

      Under these conditions, similar poor results were also obtained for other proteins, including ubiquitin, carbonic anhydrase and albumin.

      Although the specified molecular weight cut-off for the dialysis tube was 13,000 Da, the effective mass limit for our device as used was much lower.

      Experimental conditions, including buffer concentration and flow rate, were the same as those for apomyoglobin.

      The success for analysis of these small molecules was probably due to the limited dialysis time and the relatively slow kinetics (compared with ammonium acetate) for diffusion out of the dialysis tube.

      A typical ESI spectrum of horse serum albumin is shown in FIG. 8a, which gives a molecular weight of 65,645+200 Da.

      The sample was dissolved in 10 mM ammonium acetate to a concentration of 8 mM.
      <br/>
      Upon the addition of 250 mM NaCl, no peaks corresponding to the various charge states of the protein could be identified in the ESI mass spectrum (FIG. 8b).

      When the same sample was electrosprayed using the on-line desalting method at a sample infusion rate of .about.5 ml/min (corresponding to .about.1.5 minutes of desalting), charge state distribution was clearly resolved, as shown in FIG. 8c. Interestingly, deconvolution of the spectrum yielded a molecular weight of 66,420+500 Da, which is higher than obtained for the pure sample.
      <br/>
      This mass difference likely arises from incomplete desalting for this protein.
      <br/>
      This was confirmed by a molecular weight of 65,640+200 Da obtained from FIG. 8d when the sample infusion rate was reduced to 2 ml/min (i.e., by providing a longer desalting time of .about.3.5 minutes).
      <br/>
      These results show that the effectiveness of desalting is also dependent upon the nature of the salt interaction with the biopolymers and their intrinsic exchange rates in solution.
      <br/>
      In the case of the albumin, some of the sodium ions may occupy internal sites of the protein that would presumably be exchanged at inherently slower rates, in a similar fashion as in H/D exchange with D20.

      First, the total analysis time for obtaining a good quality spectrum in on-line microdialysis is .about.5 minutes.
      <br/>
      Thus, the desalting speed of microdialysis is comparable to organic bases addition method and over an order of magnitude faster than multiple buffer exchange and precipitation techniques.
      <br/>
      Second, the salt concentration tolerance in on-line microdialysis (1.3 M NaCl for proteins and 0.5 M NaCl for oligonucleotides using the current microdialysis design) is at least an order of magnitude higher than the other methods.
      <br/>
      For multiple buffer exchanges, a higher salt concentration may be compensated by additional dilution and concentration cycles, but longer desalting time and more sample losses are unavoidable.
      <br/>
      Third, the sample volume requirement for on-line microdialysis (.about.15-20 mL) is comparable to that of organic bases addition method, but much smaller than that for multiple buffer exchange and precipitation methods.

      The following samples were prepared: 1) 10 mM apomyoglobin in 10 mM NH4 OAc and 1.5 M NaCl; 2) 3 mM 17-mer oligonucleotides in 10 mM NH4 OAc and 150 mM NaCl; and 3) 60 mM d(pT)18 in 10 mM NH4 OAc and 100 mM NaCl.
      <br/>
      The oligonucleotide samples containing organic bases were prepared using the above oligonucleotide samples and stock solutions of 100 mM piperidine and 100 mM imidazole with a final concentration of 25 mM of each base.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      The on-line microdialysis system was the same as in Examples 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      For on-line microdialysis performed at elevated temperature, the microdialysis unit was placed in a stirred bath heater (1.7-L) controlled to a temperature of 50 (degree)  C.+0.5 (degree)  C. For off-line microdialysis, the micro-electrospray source was replaced with a microcentrifuge tube for sample collection.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      While on-line microdialysis has been shown to be rapid and effective, a major limitation with the on-line approach is the relatively high sample flow rate requirement.
      <br/>
      A minimum sample flow rate of .about.2 mL/min was required to obtain a stable ESI current due to the solvent diversion across the dialysis membrane as discussed previously.
      <br/>
      This flow rate is about 10 times and 100 times higher than that used for microspray (0.1-0.3 mL/min) and "nanospray" (20-40 nL/min), respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      In order to circumvent this limitation, we modified the on-line system to off-line sample cleanup by replacing the micro-electrosprayer with a microcentrifuge tube for sample collection.
      <br/>
      This design will preserve the fast and efficient desalting offered by microdialysis, as well as allow the analysis of the dialyzed sample by micro-electrospray or nano-electrospray, greatly reducing the sample consumption.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 10a and 10b is compared to the mass spectra of the same d(pT)18 sample as shown in FIG. 9c after on-line and off-line microdialysis.
      <br/>
      As expected, no significant difference was found between the two spectra.
      <br/>
      Note that, however, the sample consumed in FIG. 10a was 360 pmoles, while that in FIG. 10b was only 36 pmoles.
      <br/>
      Based on the signal intensities in FIGS. 10a and 10b, it can be concluded that a 14-fold decrease in sample consumption was achieved by using off-line microdialysis followed with microspray ESI-MS analysis for obtaining a similar quality spectrum.
      <br/>
      It is important to note that we did not attempt to determine detection limits in this comparison, and it is obvious that useful spectra are obtainable from much smaller sample sizes than used here.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      Another advantage of off-line scheme, as we have experienced in recent studies, is that much lower sample flow rates (0.3 mL/min to 1.0 mL/min) can be used if longer dialysis time is needed for desalting of samples with complicated matrices (a typical example of such a matrix contains: 0.1 M Tris/HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 10% glycerol and 1-2 mM of DTT and other preservatives often added to biological samples).
      <br/>
      Although lower sample flow rates did not generate a stable ESI current in the on-line mode with our present ESI source, samples can be cleaned up using the dialysis system.
      <br/>
      Indeed, nearly quantitative recoveries have been achieved when 10 mL of 30 mM apomyoglobin was dialyzed at a sample flow rate of 0.5 mL/min (using a BCA protein assay method).
      <br/>
      Currently, ESI-MS analysis of .about.10 mL of protein or DNA sample in complicated matrix resorting to off-line microdialysis desalting has been routinely successful in our laboratory.
      <br/>
      Research involving small sample volumes had been extremely difficult, if not impossible, before the introduction of microdialysis.
      <br/>
      We anticipate that, complementary to the on-line microdialysis scheme, the flexibility of off-line approach will further extend the applicability of microdialysis in ESI-MS and other related studies involving biopolymers.

      Higher temperature greatly increases the dialysis efficiency and improves the spectrum quality.
      <br/>
      Since dialysis is a diffusion-controlled process, an increase in dialysis temperature is expected to further increase the diffusion rates of salt components (relative to large biopolymers), resulting in a higher dialysis efficiency.
      <br/>
      An additional advantage of higher temperatures is that small ions more closely associated with biopolymers in solution (i.e., "condensed" counter ions) will also be less strongly associated, allowing more rapid exchange and removal.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 11a and 11b compares the mass spectra of 10 mM apomyoglobin in 1.5 M NaCl after on-line microdialysis at room temperature (FIG. 11a) and at 50 EC (FIG. 11b).
      <br/>
      At room temperature, even with the efficient desalting provided by microdialysis, the spectrum showed only a few charge states with low sensitivity, and significant sodium adduction was evident (FIG. 11a).
      <br/>
      When the microdialysis was performed at 50 EC, the spectrum quality was greatly improved (FIG. 11b).
      <br/>
      Multiple (and higher) charge states were observed with high abundance and sodium adduction was minimal (FIG. 11b).
      <br/>
      An accurate molecular weight was determined despite the presence of some residual sodium adduction, with at least a 5-fold increase in S/N.
      <br/>
      When the highest tolerable NaCl concentration (which we arbitrarily define as that producing a spectrum with the most intense peaks arise from intact molecular ions) was used to assess the dialysis efficiency, this concentration was increased from 1.3 M at room temperature to 2 M at 50 EC.
      <br/>
      When the NaCl concentration was further increased to 2.67 M, a similar spectrum to that in FIG. 11b was obtained with the major molecular ions corresponding to intact molecule with only one sodium attached (data not shown), and an accurate molecular weight was still readily determined.
      <br/>
      This indicated that a higher dialysis temperature should be advantageous for addressing more complex and impure samples providing that the biopolymers are stable (e.g., do not aggregate, etc.) at the elevated temperature. (Note that the suggested maximum operating temperature for the microdialysis fiber is 60 (degree)  C.).

      Addition of organic bases in dialysis buffer reduces charge states and further increases detection sensitivity for oligonucleotides samples.
      <br/>
      A large number of inorganic or organic additives (or modifiers) have been widely used in ESI-MS for sensitivity enhancement.
      <br/>
      While essentially an infinite number of composition and concentration of additives could be investigated, several have been shown to be effective in most cases studied.
      <br/>
      In particular, Greig and Griffey, and Muddiman et al reported that the addition of piperidine and imidazole in DNA samples has been shown to significantly suppress sodium adduct ions and improve S/N.20,21 Muddiman et al have also studied the charge state reduction of oligonucleotide negative ions by imidazole for sensitivity enhancement.
      <br/>
      As a model system to investigate the potential advantages of combining additives with microdialysis, piperidine and imidazole were added to the dialysis buffer (i.e. 10 mM NH4OAc and 25 mM of each base) for DNA sample desalting.
      <br/>
      A sample consisting of two complimentary 17-mer oligonucleotides (see Materials for sequences) were analyzed by on-line microdialysis.
      <br/>
      A low inlet capillary temperature (120 EC) was used to facilitate the detection of double-stranded (duplex) oligonucleotides.
      <br/>
      FIG. 12a shows the mass spectrum obtained using 10 mM NH4OAc as the dialysis buffer.
      <br/>
      Charge states corresponding to both the individual strands and the duplex form were observed.
      <br/>
      Within the S/N limit of this data, no sodium adduction was apparent.
      <br/>
      After addition of piperidine and imidazole into the dialysis buffer, a much simpler spectrum was obtained (FIG. 12b).
      <br/>
      Interestingly, only one charge state was observed for both the individual strands and the duplex form along with a shift to higher m/z (lower charging).
      <br/>
      A 5-fold increase in S/N compared to the signal in FIG. 12a was also achieved.
      <br/>
      These results demonstrated a further increase in sensitivity due to the addition of piperidine and imidazole in the dialysis buffer.
      <br/>
      It is expected, therefore, other additives can also be incorporated in the dialysis buffer to improve ESI-MS analysis for specific analytes.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      Use of low concentration (0-2.5 mM NH4OAc) dialysis buffer shifts the DNA negative ions to higher charge states, and results in a 10-fold increased in detection sensitivity and a slightly decreased desalting efficiency.
      <br/>
      Previous experience has indicated that DNA samples, when dissolved in &lt;5 mM NH4 OAc and analyzed by ESI-MS, produced molecular negative ions with higher charge states and more sodium adduction than samples dissolved in &gt;10 mM NH4 OAc.
      <br/>
      Since the sodium adduction arose from the salt contamination, the use of microdialysis is expected to eliminate or significantly reduce sodium adduction.
      <br/>
      The shift of molecular ions to higher charge states suggests that low concentrations of buffer should favor DNA analysis: the lower m/z values will extend the size of DNA molecules amenable to MS, and an increase in sensitivity is expected due to the more efficient detection of mass spectrometers for ions at lower m/z values.
      <br/>
      While earlier studies of oligonucleotides were hindered by the extensive sodium adduction, we sought to explore the advantages of low buffer concentrations by the use of microdialysis.
      <br/>
      A sample containing 60 mM d(pT)18 in 10 mM NH4 OAc and 100 mM NaCl was dialyzed against different concentrations of buffer and analyzed on-line by ESI-MS.
      <br/>
      FIGS-. 13a, 13b, and 13c compare the mass spectra of this sample after on-line microdialysis using three different dialysis buffers: H2 O, 2.5 mM NH4 OAc and 10 mM NH4 OAc.
      <br/>
      When pure H2 O was used as dialysis buffer, desalting was incomplete, as indicated by the sodium adduct peaks (FIG. 13a).
      <br/>
      The main charge states were 7-, 8- and 9-. When the dialysis buffer was changed to 2.5 mM NH4OAc, greatly improved desalting was achieved with negligible sodium adduction.
      <br/>
      The observed charge states shifted slightly towards lower values and sensitivity was nearly unchanged (FIG. 13b).
      <br/>
      A further increase of dialysis buffer concentration to 10 mM more effectively removed the residual sodium adducts (FIG. 13c), however, a nearly 10-fold decrease in sensitivity compared to using 2.5 mM NH4 OAc as dialysis buffer was observed.
      <br/>
      The charge states shifted to lower values significantly, and the decreased sensitivity is likely associated with the decreased transmission efficiency of the mass spectrometer at higher m/z.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      It is apparent that despite the high desalting efficiency of microdialysis, the strongly associated sodium ions are not rapidly removed by dialyzing against pure H2 O. Cation exchange with NH4 + at relatively higher buffer concentrations is required for effective sodium removal.
      <br/>
      The ion-pairing between sodium ion and the phosphate group in the oligonucleotide might account for the charge state shift.
      <br/>
      At high salt concentrations, a greater number of phosphate groups are ion-paired by sodium ions in solution and upon transfer into the gas phase.
      <br/>
      When the salt concentration decreases, more phosphate groups will be left "unprotected" and become charge carrying sites.
      <br/>
      Therefore, higher charge states are expected for low buffer concentrations.
      <br/>
      The sensitivity enhancement at lower buffer concentrations could be partially due to the more efficient MS detection for lower m/z ions, as mentioned earlier.
      <br/>
      Another reason may be attributed to the smaller number of charge carrying buffer species in solution when the buffer concentration is low, and consequently an increase in transfer efficiency of sample ion from solution to the gas phase.
      <br/>
      These results suggest that low dialysis buffer concentrations (.about.2.5 mM NH4 OAc) should be used in microdialysis of DNA samples for studies where higher buffer concentrations are not required, such as for single-stranded DNA.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      Based on these experiments, we found that off-line microdialysis using 2.5 mM NH4 OAc as dialysis buffer followed by the addition of piperidine and imidazole (25 mM final concentration of each base) provided the best combination thus far for the extremely challenging DNA sample cleanup problem for ESI-MS.
      <br/>
      While the purpose of using low buffer concentrations was to increase sensitivity and extend oligonucleotide size amenable to MS, we observed the "melting" (i.e., loss) of duplex conformation in solution during microdialysis of PCR products using 2.5 mM NH4 OAc as dialysis buffer.
      <br/>
      This observation was qualitatively consistent with the correlation of DNA melting with solution salt concentrations.
      <br/>
      Since the salt concentration in the DNA samples after microdialysis was only 2.5 mM NH4 OAc, the PCR products we studied should have melting temperatures lower than room temperature after microdialysis.
      <br/>
      When the double-stranded DNA conformation is essential (e.g., in studies of non-covalent complexes with duplex DNA), higher dialysis buffer concentrations (&gt;10 mM NH4 OAc) should be used.

      Dual-microdialysis of a protein mixture A protein mixture consisting of 30  MU M (2 mg/mL BSA), 4.0  MU M (0.05 mg/mL) cytochrome c, 2.3  MU M (0.02 mg/mL) ubiquitin and 9.4  MU M (0.01 mg/mL) bradykinin in 0.5 M NaCl was used to evaluate the performance of the dual-microdialysis system.
      <br/>
      Owing to the very high salt concentration and large excess of BSA, one would expect no useful ESI-MS spectra from this solution without prior removal of the excess BSA and NaCl.

      As shown in FIG. 14A, direct infusion of the protein mixture produced no analytically useful peaks due to the high concentration of NaCl.

      Dual-microdialysis of a crude cell lysate.
      <br/>
      The rapid identification of microorganisms currently presents a major analytical challenge, demanding high sensitivity, speed and the ability to distinguish closely related species.
      <br/>
      The most promising, rapid, flexible and broadly applicable technology for these applications is mass spectrometry, but success in applying this technology is crucially dependent upon the "front-end" processing that is required to deliver a tractable sample to the mass analyzer.
      <br/>
      In order to demonstrate the potential application of dual-microdialysis as a "front-end" sample preparation approach for microorganism identification, we have conducted an initial evaluation of its applicability for direct ESI-MS analysis of a crude whole cell lysate.

      Although cell debris and high concentration of urea were initially present, a clean spectrum was obtained from the cell lysate after passing through the dual-microdialysis as shown in FIG. 15A. Due to the complex nature of the sample, the spectrum is filled with numerous peaks.

      Direct MS/MS "fingerprinting" of cellular components after dual-microdialysis The ability to directly obtain mass spectra from cellular components provides the basis for further structural characterization using tandem mass spectrometry.
      <br/>
      Information from MS/MS results of selected cellular components is potentially important for the characterization of target cellular compounds or identification of biomarkers indicative of specific microorganisms.
      <br/>
      As a first step towards such studies, MS/MS was performed on selected ions in the spectrum obtained from the same cell lysate.
      <br/>
      FIG. 16A shows a full scan spectrum.
      <br/>
      FIG. 16B shows the results of isolation of m/z 1355 ion (labeled 2 in FIGS. 16B-16C) and its collisional induced dissociation (CID) spectrum at a 35% relative collisional energy.
      <br/>
      Abundant fragment ions were obtained which provide important "fingerprint" information for the selected m/z values(s).
      <br/>
      The insets show expanded views of several peaks in the CID spectrum, demonstrating the partially resolved isotopic envelopes and confirming that these peaks are from sample ions.
      <br/>
      The ability to resolve the isotopic envelope provides unambiguous assignment of charge states and greatly simplifies, or in many cases enables, interpretation of complex MS/MS data.
      <br/>
      Even for a peak with relatively low intensity in the spectrum, m/z 1866 (labeled "*" in FIG. 14a), significant fragment ions were also observed, as shown in FIG. 16D-16F. Similarly, the inset shows that these peaks originate from the analyte.
      <br/>
      Based on the S/N of the product ions produced by a single dissociation step (i.e. MS/MS), it is apparent that multi-stage MSn (n&gt;2) could also be performed to gain further structural information on selected fragment ions.

      FIGS. 17A-17C illustrate the identification of bradykinin from the cell lysate by MS/MS after ion isolation and dissociation in the m/z range of the singly charged molecular ion.

      FIGS. 17A-17B is the full scan MS spectrum showing the presence of (M+H)+ ion of bradykinin (m/z 1061) which was not observed before doping (the effective signal intensity for bradykinin was much lower that suggested by the 100 nM concentration since the 2+ charge state is much more intense than the 1+ charge state under the present conditions).
      <br/>
      After isolation of this ion in the trap 35% relative collisional energy was applied for collision induced dissociation.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 17C, abundant fragment ions were observed, many of which are consistent with the known amino acid sequence of bradykinin (as labeled).

    <claim num="1">
      <claim-text>We claim:</claim-text>
      <claim-text>1.</claim-text>
      <claim-text>A microdialysis unit for rapidly purifying a biomolecular sample of small volume by removing substantially all low molecular weight molecules and retaining substantially all intermediate molecular weight biomolecules, the microdialysis unit comprising:</claim-text>
      <claim-text>(a) a first stage sample separator having a sample separator having a sample inlet, a separation membrane and a separated sample outlet that is connected to (b) a capillary assembly having at least one dialysis tube having opposite ends of a sample inlet and sample outlet attached to a non-porous inlet and outlet; (c) a shell surrounding said capillary assembly and forming an annular space therebetween, said non-porous inlet and outlet extending through said shell and extending through said shell and extending beyond said shell, said shell further having a buffer inlet and a buffer outlet;</claim-text>
      <claim-text>and (d) a buffer that flows through said buffer inlet into said annular space and out said buffer outlet, said buffer inlet and buffer outlet arranged so that said buffer flows in a counterflow relationship to said biomolecular sample, wherein (e) said biomolecular sample is flowed through said first stage sample separator and into said capillary assembly while said buffer is flowed through said shell so that said low molecular weight molecules pass from said biomolecular sample through said dialysis tube and into said buffer, while said biomolecules are retained and passed to said sample outlet.</claim-text>
    </claim>
    <claim num="2">
      <claim-text>2. The microdialysis unit as recited in claim 1, wherein said dialysis tube has a molecular weight cutoff greater than a second molecular weight cutoff of said separation membrane.</claim-text>
