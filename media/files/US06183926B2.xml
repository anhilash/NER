      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a toner and a two-component developer used in the fields of electrophotography and the electrostatic recording, and to an image formation method using the above-mentioned toner and two-component developer, more particularly to a high speed image formation method in which an organic photoconductor belt is used as a latent image bearing member, and a cleaning brush is used as the cleaning means.
      <br/>
      In addition, the present invention also relates to a toner cartridge holding the above-mentioned toner and an image formation apparatus using the above-mentioned toner.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Discussion of Background</p>
    <p num="4">In the electrophotographic process, a latent electrostatic image is formed on a photoconductor comprising a photoconductive material, using various means, and the thus formed latent electrostatic image is developed with a toner to a visible toner image, and the developed toner image is then transferred to a sheet of paper when necessary, and fixed thereon with the application of heat and/or pressure thereto, or using a vapor of a solvent, whereby a hard copy can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="5">As disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 61-147261, the method of developing the latent electrostatic image is roughly classified into a two-component development system using a toner and a carrier, and a mono-component development system using a toner alone.</p>
    <p num="6">
      In the two-component development system, the toner is mixed and stirred with the carrier so that the toner may become triboelectrically charged to a polarity opposite to that of the carrier.
      <br/>
      When the toner acquires electrical charges of a polarity opposite to that of the electrostatic image, the toner is deposited on the latent electrostatic image, thereby developing the latent electrostatic image into a visible image.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      There are known many development methods depending upon the kind of carrier, for example, magnetic-brush development using iron powder as the carrier; cascade development using a beaded material as the carrier; and fur-brush development using brush fibers.
      <br/>
      The toner for use in the above-mentioned various development techniques comprises toner particles, each toner particle comprising a binder resin such as a natural resin or synthetic resin, and a coloring agent such as carbon black dispersed in the binder resin.
    </p>
    <p num="8">For instance, to obtain toner particles, a mixture prepared by dispersing a coloring agent in a binder resin such as polystyrene is pulverized until the particle size reaches about 1 to 30  MU m. Further, a magnetic toner can be prepared by adding a magnetic material such as magnetite to the components such as the binder resin and the coloring agent.</p>
    <p num="9">
      On the market of the copying and printing apparatus, there is an increasing demand for not only high speed image formation and high quality image formation, but also reduction in size of the apparatus and improvement of durability of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      In response to such recent demands, the toner, photoconductor, and charge imparting material have been actively developed.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      As the means for cleaning the toner particles remaining on the latent image bearing member after image transfer, a blade or fur brush is commonly employed in direct contact with the latent image bearing member.
      <br/>
      In such an electrophotographic process, the surface of the latent image bearing member, for example, a charge transport layer (CTL) of the photoconductor, is necessarily abraded because the above-mentioned cleaning member and development member are brought into direct contact with the surface of the latent image bearing member.
      <br/>
      In particular, the photoconductor of the high-speed copying or printing apparatus is required to have such abrasion resistance that can endure large quantities of copies or printings.
      <br/>
      For the above-mentioned reason, the combination of an organic photoconductor in the form of a flexible belt which has a large available surface area, and a cleaning brush capable of performing relatively moderate cleaning for the photoconductor has become the mainstream in the high-speed copying or printing apparatus.
      <br/>
      However, even though such combination is adopted, it is not adequate to the high-speed copying or printing apparatus designed to make an enormous volume of copies or printings, for example, more than one million.
      <br/>
      Namely, still more improved durability is desired with respect to the photoconductor.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In the aspect of the quality of hard copy image, the improvement of preciseness and resolution is strongly desired in recent years.
      <br/>
      However, the conventional developer has the drawback that since toner particles are selectively subjected to development during making of large quantities of copies and printings for an extended period of time, the particle size distribution of toner particles changes with time in the developer, thereby lowering the resolution of the obtained image.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      To obtain a toner image with high preciseness and high resolution, various developers are proposed, as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications 1-112253, 2-284158 and 7-295283.
      <br/>
      Each of the above-mentioned developers comprise toner particles with small average particle diameter, and the content of the toner particles with a particle diameter of 5  MU m or less, and the particle size distribution are particularly specified.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The toner particles with a particle diameter of 5  MU m or less are indispensable for the formation of a toner image with high preciseness and high resolution.
      <br/>
      It is considered that a latent image can be faithfully and exactly reproduced to obtain a sharp toner image with excellent reproducibility when the toner particles with a particle diameter of 5  MU m or less are constantly supplied to the latent image formed on the photoconductor in the development step.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the toner particles with a particle diameter of 5  MU m or less produce the problem of decrease of the image density.
      <br/>
      The reason for the decrease in image density is that the intensity of the electric field in the edge portion of a latent image is stronger than that in the center portion thereof, so that the toner deposition amount in the center portion of the latent image becomes less than that in the edge portion when the above-mentioned fine toner particles are employed.
      <br/>
      However, it is supposed that this problem can be solved by particularly specifying the content ratio by number of toner particles with a particle diameter of more than 5  MU m (which will be hereinafter referred to as intermediate toner particles).
    </p>
    <p num="14">The fine toner particles with a particle diameter of 5  MU m or less are advantageous for practical use, as previously mentioned, but there exists an optimum content ratio of the above-mentioned fine toner particles.</p>
    <p num="15">
      For instance, in FIG. 1, a toner comprises 17% by number of toner particles with a particle diameter of 5  MU m or less.
      <br/>
      In this case, the content of the toner particles with a particle diameter of 5  MU m or less is only 3 wt % of the total weight of the toner particles as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In light of such a small percentage by weight of the fine toner particles, it is doubtful that those fine toner particles can be selectively deposited to the edge portion of a latent image, and the intermediate toner particles can be selectively deposited to the center portion thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In contrast to the above, in FIG. 3, the content ratio by number of toner particles with a particle diameter of 5  MU m less is as much as 60%.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 is a chart showing the particle size distribution by weight of the same toner shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In this case, there is a risk of toner particles being excessively charged under the circumstances of low temperature.
      <br/>
      The toner particles thus excessively charged are tightly attached to the surface of carrier particles and the surface of the photoconductor.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the decrease in image density and the fogging are observed in the obtained toner images.
      <br/>
      In this case, the surface of the photoconductor cannot be perfectly cleaned, and a filming phenomenon takes place on the surface of the photoconductor.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      To solve the above-mentioned problem, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 4-1773 discloses a toner comprising toner particles with a particle size of 12.7 to 16.0  MU m in an amount of 0.1 to 5.0 wt % of the total weight of the toner particles in order to improve the fluidity of toner.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, it is certain that the obtained fluidity of the above-mentioned toner is inferior to that of the toner comprising 1 to 15% by number of toner particles with a particle size of 5  MU m or less.
      <br/>
      Further, in the case where the content ratio of the large toner particles with a particle size of 12.7  MU m or more is increased as disclosed in the above-mentioned application, the image quality of the obtained toner image tends to become uneven.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The fluidity of toner can also be improved by increasing the amount of a fluidity imparting agent.
      <br/>
      However, the fluidity of toner varies depending upon the contact conditions of the fluidity imparting agent with the surface portions of the toner particles.
      <br/>
      To be more specific, in the toner containing as much as 60% by number of the toner particles with a particle size of 5  MU m or less, the amount of fluidity imparting agent is required to increase 1.5 to 2.0 times the amount thereof necessary for the toner containing 17% by number of the toner particles with a particle size of 5  MU m or less in order to obtain substantially the same fluidity.
      <br/>
      The contamination of the photoconductor and the filming phenomenon on the surface of the photoconductor, and the deterioration of image fixing performance are unavoidable when such a large quantity of fluidity imparting agent is added to the toner particles.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications 4-124682 and 10-91000, the number of toner particles with a particle size of 5  MU m or less is specifically restricted.
      <br/>
      Although the effects are mentioned in the aforementioned applications when such restriction is established in the preparation of a mono-component developer, there is no description about the particle size distribution of the majority of toner particles dominantly determining the image quality.
      <br/>
      As a result, a toner image with high resolution cannot be obtained.
    </p>

    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="36">
      The toner of the present invention, which shows such a particle size distribution as in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, exhibits excellent fluidity even though the amount of a fluidity imparting agent, such as finely-divided inorganic particles which have been treated to be hydrophobic is small.
      <br/>
      By using this toner, contamination of the photoconductor and the filming phenomenon on the photoconductor can be minimized, so that toner images with high resolution and high preciseness can be constantly produced when large quantities of papers are subjected to continuous copying or printing operation.
      <br/>
      Further, the quality of the obtained toner image is remarkably stable without producing the problems of the defective cleaning and the filming phenomenon even though recyclable sheets are employed.
    </p>
    <p num="37">The reason why the above-mentioned advantages can be obtained by the toner of the present invention has not been clarified, but supposed to be as follows:</p>
    <p num="38">One of the features of the toner according to the present invention is that the toner contains 1 to 15%, preferably 1 to 12%, and more preferably 3 to 12%, by number of toner particles with a particle diameter of 5  MU m or less.</p>
    <p num="39">
      When the toner contains 15% or less by number of the fine toner particles with a particle diameter of 5  MU m or less, the average particle diameter of the toner particles is relatively decreased.
      <br/>
      A small average particle diameter of tone- particles is advantageous in the formation of a toner image with high preciseness and high resolution.
      <br/>
      However, fine toner particles with a particle diameter of 5  MU m or less are difficult to control the charge quantity, and likely to lower the fluidity of toner particles and contaminate the carrier.
      <br/>
      Further, those fire toner particles tend to cause the defective cleaning problem and toner filming phenomenon on the surface of the photoconductor, and tend to easily scatter to stain the inside of the image formation apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In the case where inorganic oxide powders are added to those fine toner particles for improving the fluidity, large quantities of inorganic oxide powders are needed.
      <br/>
      This is because the smaller the particle size of toner particles, the larger the entire surface area of the toner particles.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the surfaces of the fine toner particles cannot be uniformly brought into contact with the inorganic oxide powders until a large amount of inorganic oxide powders are added.
      <br/>
      It has been confirmed that the above-mentioned problems of contamination of the photoconductor, filming phenomenon, and poor image fixing performance are worsened by the addition of large quantities of fluidity imparting agent.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Namely, the increase in the content of fine toner particles with a particle diameter of 5  MU m or less cannot solve the above-mentioned problems although those particles have a good effect on the improvement of the resolution in the obtained toner images.
      <br/>
      Therefore, excessive increase of those fine toner particles is considered to be disadvantageous in light of the long-term service of the toner as a two-component developer.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the proper fluidity of toner particles can be ensured with the addition of a small amount of the fluidity imparting agent such as inorganic oxide powders because the number of toner particles with a particle diameter of 5  MU m or less is controlled to 1 to 15% of the entire number of toner particles.
      <br/>
      The contamination of the photoconductor and the occurrence of filming phenomenon can be thus prevented in practice, and the image fixing performance is improved.
      <br/>
      When the weight average particle size of the toner particles is in the range of 6.0 to 11.5  MU m, it is difficult to control the content of the fine toner particles with a particle diameter of 5  MU m or less to 0% from the viewpoint of productivity.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the content of the fine toner particles with a particle diameter of 5  MU m or less is controlled to 1% or more, preferably 3% or more in the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="42">The second feature of the toner according to the present invention is that the number-average particle size D25 and the number-average particle size D75 are in a relationship of 0.60 &lt;= D25/D75 &lt;= 0.85, more preferably 0.70 &lt;= D25/D75 &lt;= 0.85. The number-average particle size D25 is a particle size obtained when the cumulative number of the toner particles reaches 25% at the measurement of a cumulative toner particle distribution by number thereof, and the number-average particle size D75 is a particle size obtained when the cumulative number of the toner particles reaches 75% at the measurement of the cumulative toner particle distribution by number thereof.</p>
    <p num="43">
      As the value of D25/D75 is closer to 1, the particle size distribution of toner particles becomes sharper within the range from 25 to 75% in the cumulative particle size distribution by number.
      <br/>
      When the particle size distribution of the toner particles within the above-mentioned range, which toner particles substantially constitute most of the toner images, is sharp, the properties of each of toner particles within the above-mentioned range can be made uniform.
      <br/>
      Owing to the uniform behavior of each toner particle in the development unit, toner images with high preciseness and high resolution can be constantly produced with minimum selective consumption of toner particles and minimum variance of charge quantity of the toner.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      When the aforementioned relationship is represented by D25/D75&lt;0.60, the particle size distribution becomes broad, so that the behavior of each of the toner particles becomes non-uniform.
      <br/>
      As a result, the toner particles are selectively consumed, and some toner particles provided with different charge quantities will impair the quality of the toner images.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the D25 and the D75 are in a relationship of D25/D75&gt;0.85, the particle size distribution becomes sharp, thereby making it possible to form a toner image with remarkably high resolution.
      <br/>
      However, when such toner particles are prepared by the conventional method including dry type pulverizing and classification steps, the productivity is extremely low.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Furthermore, in the present invention, the content of toner particles whose particle diameter is twice or more the weight-average particle size is controlled to 5 wt % or less, preferably 3 wt % or less, of the total weight of the toner particles.
      <br/>
      By decreasing the content of the above-mentioned toner particles, the results become more preferable.
      <br/>
      When the toner contains the above-mentioned toner particles in an amount of more than 5 wt %, the reproducibility of a thin line image tends to decrease.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The weight-average particle size of the toner of the present invention is in the range of 6.0 to 11.5  MU m, preferably in the range of 6.0 to 9.5  MU m. When the weight-average particle size is less than 6.0  MU m, there easily occur the problems that the inside of the image forming apparatus is contaminated due to scattering of toner particles during the long-term service, the image density decreases under the circumstances of low humidity, and the cleaning of the photoconductor is defective.
      <br/>
      When the weight-average particle size exceeds 11.5  MU m, the resolution of a minute spot with a diameter of 100  MU m or less is not sufficient, and the toner particles are scattering in the non-image area (background area), thereby lowering the image quality.
    </p>
    <p num="47">The toner of the present invention can exhibit the excellent performance as previously mentioned when used as a magnetic toner or a non-magnetic toner, and further, used as a mono-component developer or a two-component developer.</p>
    <p num="48">
      The two-component developer according to the present invention comprises the above-mentioned toner and a carrier comprising magnetic carrier particles.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that the average particle size of the magnetic carrier particles be in the range of 35 to 100  MU m, and more preferably in the range of 45 to 75  MU m. When the weight-average particle size of the magnetic carrier particles is within the above-mentioned range, the charge quantity of toner can be made more uniform under the conditions that the concentration of toner in the developer is controlled to 2 to 10 wt % in a developer unit.
      <br/>
      To be more specific, when the weight-average particle size of the carrier particles is 35  MU m or more, the carrier particles can be prevented from being attracted to the photoconductor, and can be stirred with the toner particles efficiently to provide the toner with uniform charge quantity.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the weight-average particle size of the carrier particles is 100  MU m or less, the carrier particles can charge the toner particles sufficiently, so that uniform charge quantity of toner can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="49">The developer of the present invention can not only solve the conventional problems, but also meet the strict requirements of the currently employed high-speed image formation apparatus, that is, the elevation of image quality, the reduction of image fixing temperature, and the improvement of durability of the employed photoconductor.</p>
    <p num="50">
      The weight-average particle size of the carrier particles can be measured by the conventional sieving method.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, 200 to 400 carrier particles are selected by random sampling from a microphotographic image taken by an optical microscope, and subjected to image processing analysis to obtain the weight-average particle size of those particles.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Although various methods are available, the particle size distribution of the toner particles is measured using a commercially available measuring apparatus "Coulter Counter Model TA II" (Trademark), made by Coulter Electronics Limited in the present invention.
      <br/>
      The particle size distributions by number and by weight are output Using the measuring apparatus of "Coulter Counter Model TA II", and analyzed using a personal computer "PC9801", made by NEC Corporation, that is connected to the "Coulter Counter Model TA II".
      <br/>
      As an electrolyte, a 1% aqueous solution of sodium chloride is prepared using a first class grade chemical of NaCl.
      <br/>
      To 10 to 15 ml of the above prepared electrolyte, 0.1 to 5 ml of a surfactant, preferably alkylbenzene sulfonate, serving as a dispersant is added, and thereafter, a sample (toner particles) in an amount of 2 to 20 mg is added.
      <br/>
      The mixture thus prepared is subjected to ultrasonic dispersion process for about 1 to 3 minutes.
      <br/>
      The dispersion thus prepared is added to 100 to 200 ml of a 1% aqueous solution of sodium chloride separately prepared in a beaker to obtain a predetermined concentration of the sample dispersion.

      Then, by means of the "Coulter Counter Model TA II" provided with an aperture of 100  MU m, the particle distribution of toner particles with a particle size ranging from 2 to 40  MU m is measured using 50,000 particles.
      <br/>
      The distributions of those particles by weight and by number are calculated.
      <br/>
      From the particle distribution by weight, the weight-average particle size is obtained.

    <p num="52">
      To prepare a two-component developer of the present invention, it is desirable to add finely-divided inorganic particles as a fluidity imparting agent to the toner.
      <br/>
      In the toner having such particle size distribution as specified in the present invention, the specific surface area of the toner is smaller than that of the conventional toner.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the toner of the present invention is mixed with a magnetic carrier to prepare a two-component developer, the possibility of bringing the toner particles in contact with the carrier particles is decreased as compared with the case of the conventional two-component developer.
      <br/>
      As a result, the carrier particles can be prevented from being contaminated with the toner, and the toner particles can be prevented from being abraded and crushed.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Further, with the decrease in the specific surface area of the toner, the amount of finely-divided inorganic particles added to the toner as the fluidity imparting agent can be decreased.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is possible to minimize the contamination of the photoconductor with the finely-divided inorganic particles, the filming phenomenon, and defective image fixing.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the life of the developer and that of the photoconductor can be extended.
    </p>
    <p num="54">The toner particles with a number-average particle size ranging from D25 to D75, which play a significant role, can exhibit their function more effectively when used in combination with a small amount of the finely-divided inorganic particles, thereby steadily providing high quality toner image for an extended period of time.</p>
    <p num="55">
      As the finely-divided inorganic particles serving as the fluidity imparting agent for use in the present invention, oxides and composite oxides comprising Si, Ti, Al, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, In, Ga, Ni, Mn, W, Fe, Co, Zn, Cr, Mo, Cu, Ag, V, and Zr are useful.
      <br/>
      Of the above-mentioned inorganic powders, finely-divided particles of silicon dioxide (silica), titanium dioxide (titania) and aluminum oxide (alumina) are particularly preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Further, the above-mentioned inorganic powders may be surface-treated to make those powders hydrophobic.
      <br/>
      Examples of the surface treatment agent for making the inorganic powders hydrophobic are as follows: dimethyldichlorosilane, trimehtylchlorosilane, methyltrichlorosilane, allyldimethyldichlorosilane, allylphenyldichlorosilane, benzyldimethylchlorosilane, bromomethyldimethylchlorosilane,  ALPHA -chloroethyltrichlorosilane, p-chloroethyltrichlorosilane, chloromethyldimethylchlorosilane, chloromethyltrichlorosilane, p-chlorophenyltrichlorosilane, 3-chloropropyltrichlorosilane, 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, vinylmethoxysilane, vinyl-tris( BETA -methoxyethoxy)silane,  GAMMA -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltriacetoxysilane, divinyldichlorosilane, dimethylvinylchlorosilane, octyl-trichlorosilane, decyl-trichlorosilane, nonyltrichlorosilane, (4-t-propylphenyl)-trichlorosilane, (4-t-butylphenyl)-trichlorosilane, dipentyl-dichlorosilane, dihexyl-dichlorosilane, dioctyl-dichlorosilane, dinonyl-dichlorosilane, didecyl-dichlorosilane, didodecyl-dichlorosilane, dihexadecyl-dichlorosilane, (4-t-butylphenyl)-octyl-dichlorosilane, didecenyl-dichlorosilane, dinonenyl-dichlorosilane, di-2-ethylhexyl-dichlorosilane, di-3,3-dimethylpentyl-dichlorosilane, trihexyl-chlorosilane, trioctyl-chlorosilane, tridecyl-chlorosilane, dioctyl-methyl-chlorosilane, octyl-dimethyl-chlorosilane, (4-t-propylphenyl)-diethyl-chlorosilane, octyltrimethoxysilane, hexamethyldisilazane, hexaethyldisilazane, diethyltetramethyldisilazane, hexaphenyldisilazane, and hexatolyldisilazane.
      <br/>
      In addition, a titanate based coupling agent and an aluminum based coupling agent can also be employed.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      It is preferable that the amount of inorganic powders be in the range of 0.1 to 2 wt % of the entire weight of the toner.
      <br/>
      When the amount of inorganic powders is less than 0.1 wt %, aggregation of toner particles cannot be effectively prevented.
      <br/>
      When the amount of inorganic powders exceeds 2 wt %, the toner particles tend to scatter between thin line images, the inside of the image forming apparatus tends to be stained with toner particles, and the photoconductor is easily damaged or abraded.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, even though the amount of inorganic powders is small, the predetermined fluidity of toner can be ensured.
      <br/>
      As a result, high quality images with high resolution can be constantly produced when large quantities of copies are made for a long period of time.
      <br/>
      The present invention is obviously effective as compared with the case where the amount of toner particles with a particle diameter of 5  MU m or less is increased and a large quantity of inorganic powders is added.

      Each solid image was rubbed with a needle with the application of a load of 50 g thereto, and thereafter the remaining scratch was visually observed.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      The image fixing performance was evaluated on the scale from 1 to 5.
      <br/>
      The greater the scale value, the better the image fixing performance.
      <br/>
      The scale value of less than 3 is regarded as unacceptable for practical use.
      <br/>
      This is because such a remaining image sample is easily peeled off when rubbed with an eraser.

    <p num="108">Using a standard resolving power test chart (S-3), the reproduced thin line image was observed using a test glass.</p>
    <p num="109">
      The resolution of image was evaluated on the scale from 1 to 5.

      At the scale 5, a thin line image is very faithfully reproduced.
      <br/>
      The scale 3 or less is regarded as unacceptable for practical use because of the poor resolving power.
