      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      This invention pertains generally to dietary food supplements.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the invention concerns an herbal dietary food product which promotes healthy hair growth on one's scalp.
    </p>
    <p num="3">II. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The use of herbal extracts for health benefits have been known for thousands of years in East Asian countries such as China, Korea, and Japan.
      <br/>
      The utilization of herbal extracts as dietary supplements for promoting various sorts of health benefits have been gaining wide acceptance in western countries.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Several patents have been issued in the United States which utilize herbal extracts for health benefits.
      <br/>
      One such patent is U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,059 issued to Garza which teaches an herbal composition beneficial for the treatment of hemorrhoid.
      <br/>
      Another patent is U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,207 issued to Bewicke which teaches a dietary supplement containing herbal extracts that serves as a general relaxant.
      <br/>
      None of the prior art teaches an herbal dietary supplement which promotes healthy hair growth on an individual's scalp.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Thus, it is a primary objective of the present invention to provide an orally ingestable composition which promotes healthy hair growth on the scalp of an individual's head.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      This invention provides a dietary supplement consisting of herbal extracts which promotes healthy hair growth on an individual's scalp.
      <br/>
      The dietary supplement comprises extracts from herbal plants which can be grouped into three categories according to their common functions.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
