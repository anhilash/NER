    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a method of controlling pests and more particularly to a method of preparing and applying a pesticide which affects octopamine receptor sites in insects, arachnids and larvae.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Many chemicals and mixtures have been studied for pesticidal activity for many years with a goal of obtaining a product which is selective for invertebrates such as insects, arachnids and larvae thereof and has little or no toxicity to vertebrates such as mammals, fish, fowl and other species and does not otherwise persist in and damage the environment.
      <br/>
      Most products of which the applicants are aware and which have sufficient pesticidal activity to be of commercial significance, also have toxic or deleterious effects on mammals, fish, fowl or other species which are not the target of the product.
      <br/>
      For example, organophosphorus compounds and carbamates inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase in insects as well as in all classes of animals.
      <br/>
      Chlordimeform and related formamidines are known to act on octopamine receptors of insects but have been removed from the market because of cardiotoxic potential in vertebrates and carcinogenicity in animals and a varied effect on different insects.
      <br/>
      Also, very high doses are required to be toxic for certain insect species.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      It is postulated that amidine compounds affect the octopamine sensitive adenylate cyclase present in insects �Nathanson et al, Mol.
      <br/>
      Parmacol 20:68-75 (1981) and Nathanson, Mol.
      <br/>
      Parmacol 28: 254-268 (1985)�. Another study was conducted on octopamine uptake and metabolism in the insect nervous system �Wierenga et al, J Neurochem 54, 479-489 (1990)�. These studies were directed at nitrogen containing compounds which mimic the octopamine structure.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Insecticides such as trioxabicyclooctanes, dithianes, silatranes, lindane, toxaphen, cyclodienes and picrotoxin act on the GABA (gamma amino butyric acid) receptor.
      <br/>
      However, these products also affect mammals, birds, fish and other species.
    </p>
    <p num="6">There is a need for a pesticide which targets only insects, arachnids and their larvae and does not produce unwanted and harmful affects on other species.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a method of preparing and applying a pesticide which kills invertebrates, especially insects, arachnids and their larvae and has no harmful effects on other species including mammals, fish and fowl.</p>
    <p num="8">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method of preparing and applying a pesticide which exerts its pesticidal properties through the octopamine receptor site in insects, arachnids and their larvae and other invertebrates.</p>
    <p num="9">It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method of preparing and applying a pesticide at relatively low concentrations which will be effective over a comparatively long period of time such as at least 24 hours.</p>
    <p num="10">
      In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, there is disclosed a method of killing insects and arachnids and larvae thereof.
      <br/>
      The steps include preparing a mixture of a carrier with an affector agent which interferes with the neurotransmitters of the octopamine receptor site in insects, arachnids and their larvae and applying the mixture to insects, arachnids, larvae and their habitat.
      <br/>
      The affector agent interacts with octopamine receptor sites in the insects, arachnids and larvae and interferes with neurotransmission in the invertebrate but does not affect mammals, fish and fowl.
      <br/>
      The agent is a chemical having the structure of a six member carbon ring, the carbon ring having substituted thereon at least one oxygenated functional group.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      There is further disclosed a method of killing insects and arachnids and larvae thereof.
      <br/>
      A blend of cinnamic alcohol, eugenol and alpha terpineol is prepared.
      <br/>
      The blend is mixed with a carrier to produce a uniform mixture.
      <br/>
      The mixture is applied to insects and arachnids and larvae and their habitat.
      <br/>
      The blend interacts with octopamine receptor sites in the invertebrate and interferes with neurotransmission in the invertebrate but does not affect mammals, fish and fowl.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In another aspect, there is disclosed a pesticide which has an affector agent having a six member carbon ring.
      <br/>
      The carbon ring has substituted thereon at least one oxygenated functional group.
      <br/>
      The affector agent affects the octopamine receptor site in invertebrates including insects, arachnids and their larvae.
      <br/>
      The affector agent is intimately mixed with a carrier.
      <br/>
      Exposure of insects, arachnids and their larvae to the affector agent produces a disruption of the octopamine receptor site in the invertebrates to interfere with neurotransmission in the invertebrate and the death of the exposed invertebrate.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Further disclosed is a method of killing insects, arachnids, and larvae.
      <br/>
      A mixture is prepared of a chemical derived from a plant essential oil with a carrier.
      <br/>
      The chemical has at least one oxygenated functional group therein.
      <br/>
      The chemical has octopamine receptor site inhibitory activity.
      <br/>
      The mixture is applied to insects, arachnids, larvae and their habitat.
      <br/>
      The chemical interacts with an octopamine receptor site in the insects, arachnids and larvae and interferes with neurotransmission in the insects, arachnids and larvae thereof but does not affect mammals, fish and fowl.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In another aspect there is disclosed a method of controlling insects, arachnids and their larvae.
      <br/>
      An emulsion is prepared of an affector agent which disrupts neurotransmission at the octopamine receptor site in insects, arachnids and their larvae.
      <br/>
      The mixture is applied to insects, arachnids, larvae and their habitat.
      <br/>
      The agent interacts with octopamine receptor sites in the insects, arachnids and larvae and deters the feeding of the insects, arachnids and larvae but does not affect mammals, fish and fowl.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In yet another aspect there is disclosed a method of controlling insects, arachnids and larvae.
      <br/>
      An affector agent mixed with a carrier is applied to larvae of the insects and arachnids and their habitat.
      <br/>
      The affector agent retards the growth of the larvae.
      <br/>
      The affector agent interacts with octopamine receptor sites in the larvae of the insects and arachnids and interferes with neurotransmission in the larvae but does not affect mammals, fish and fowl.
      <br/>
      The affector agent is a naturally occurring organic chemical having at least six (6) carbon atoms.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In addition, there is disclosed a method of killing insects, arachnids and larvae thereof.
      <br/>
      A mixture is prepared of a carrier and a naturally occurring organic chemical having at least six carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      The chemical has octopamine receptor site inhibitory activity.
      <br/>
      The mixture is applied to insects and arachnids and larvae thereof and their habitat.
      <br/>
      The chemical interacts with an octopamine receptor site in the insects and arachnids and larvae thereof and interferes with neurotransmission in the insects, arachnids and larvae thereof but does not affect mammals, fish and fowl.

    <p num="24">The present invention is not limited to the chemicals listed herein.</p>
    <p num="25">
      All of the chemicals of the present invention are naturally occurring organic chemicals which are devoid of halogens.
      <br/>
      Further, several of the chemicals of the present invention are considered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be safe for humans and exempted from registration.
      <br/>
      Thus, these chemicals do not require prior approval or registration with the EPA.
      <br/>
      Some of these chemicals have been added to prior art insecticides as attractants and repellents.
      <br/>
      However, there have been no reports of these chemicals having toxic pesticidal activity at the concentrations disclosed in the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      All of the chemicals of the present invention act as agonists or antagonists on the octopamine receptor site in insects, arachnids and their larvae and, consequently, produce physiological effects in exposed invertebrates.
      <br/>
      The chemicals of the present invention are considered to be affector agents.
      <br/>
      Exposure to reduced concentrations of the chemicals or exposure for brief times affect the feeding habits of the exposed insects, arachnids and larvae.
      <br/>
      This is important in those invertebrates which feed on vegetation, since there is reduced damage to plants by invertebrates which have received sublethal concentrations of the chemicals of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Also, the insects, arachnids or larvae which survive exposure to the chemicals of the present invention are shown to be stunted in growth.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Alpha-terpineol, eugenol and cinnamic alcohol were dissolved in acetone and designated as sample 3B.
      <br/>
      The range of weight percentages of the components of the blend are alpha-terpineol 10%-50%, eugenol 10%-50% and cinnamic alcohol 20%-35%.
      <br/>
      The preferred blend has equal parts by weight of each of the components.
      <br/>
      Male and female American cockroaches were injected with 3B into the abdomen.
      <br/>
      Overt signs of toxicity were observed at 1 mg/roach in 2  MU l of acetone.
      <br/>
      At lower doses no symptoms were observed.
      <br/>
      By this approach, 2 out of 6 died within 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      For those surviving, some showed locomotive difficulties.
      <br/>
      No hyperactivity was observed, even in those that died quickly.
      <br/>
      In some cases, (2/6) treated insects died after 2 to 3 days.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      None of the American cockroaches died when they were treated through topical application prior to 24 hours.
      <br/>
      A 40% (4/10) mortality was observed 24 hours after treatment and this effect was time dependent.
      <br/>
      After 72 hours, 100% died.

    <p num="31">
      3B was applied to different areas of the insect.
      <br/>
      When given to the ventral sternum region (at the base of the hind legs) of the American cockroach, 3B was most toxic at 125  MU g/insect.
      <br/>
      In that case, overt toxic signs were observed within 10 minutes.

    <p num="33">
      In the latter case of injection of a lethal dose the hind legs appeared to be paralyzed and the fore and mid legs moved rapidly, although there was no overt hyperexcitation.
      <br/>
      This phenomenon of quick death was also observed in German cockroaches that were treated through topical application (3B is more toxic to German than to American cockroaches).
      <br/>
      At 125  MU g/insect, 80% (8/10) of German cockroaches were knocked down in 2 to 3 hours and died within 24 hours (dose was 125  MU g 3B per insect with 0.4  MU l acetone).
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The above data support the observation that site of application gives varying degrees of toxicity.
      <br/>
      For further confirmation, 1 mg 3B in 20 ml acetone was applied to small jars and all surfaces were covered.
      <br/>
      One hour after the acetone had completely evaporated, 5 American cockroaches were introduced to each jar.
      <br/>
      Control jars were treated exactly as above but with 20 ml acetone only.
      <br/>
      All cockroaches died within 10 to 30 minutes in the jars containing 3B.
      <br/>
      None died in the control jars.
      <br/>
      Some insects (3/5) showed hyperactivity within 1 to 3 minutes after exposure.

      At 8 minutes, hind leg paralysis was observed.
      <br/>
      These "walk across" data are consistent with the previous study in which a rapid death was observed when 3B was given to the ventral sternum region rather than the abdomen.
      <br/>
      The fact that the toxicants might penetrate faster through the legs (no chitin layer as in the body) support the notion that the permeability/penetration of 3B plays a key role in its toxicity (Table 3).

      Based on these data, the same treated jars were used for a residual study.

      In this experiment, American cockroaches were transferred to the treated and control jars at different times from the point in time at which acetone evaporated, i.e., 24, 48, 96, 72 hours and 7 days.
      <br/>
      Interestingly, all insects died after being exposed to treated jars, even 7 days after 3B application.
      <br/>
      However, it took longer for the roaches to die in proportion to the length of time from initial 3B application to the jar.
      <br/>
      Some toxic signs were observed in all cases after exposure.
      <br/>
      Further, when the same experiment was repeated with German cockroaches, greater toxic effects and more rapid effects were observed.

      It appears that some degradation occurs in toxic effects with time (Table 4).

      <br/>
      GABA receptor-chloride channel study: This site of action is known to be one of the major action sites for a number of insecticides.
      <br/>
      When the action of 3B was tested, 3H-EBOB (�3 H�n-propyl bicyclo ortho benzoate) and 35S-TBPS (bicyclo phosphorous esters) were used.
      <br/>
      The former ligand was used based on the findings that EBOB has been shown to be both a highly toxic and high affinity radioligand for the GABA-receptor convulsant binding site in insects.
      <br/>
      It also shows identical or overlapping binding sites with seven classes of insecticides: trioxabicyclooctanes, dithianes, silatranes, lindane, toxaphen, cyclodienes and picrotoxinin.
      <br/>
      The TBPS has been hindered by poor toxicological relevance and binding affinity in insects.
      <br/>
      Both radioligands were used in this study for comparison.
      <br/>
      As shown in Table 6, 3B induced no antagonistic action on the binding affinity of 3H-EBOB or 35S-TBPS at concentrations of 3B ranging from 10  MU M to 10 NM.
      <br/>
      Only at 100  MU M was a significant effect seen.
      <br/>
      However, at such a high concentration (100  MU M), the specificity for the site of action is unlikely.
      <br/>
      In contrast, heptachlbrepoxide alone and a mixture of Endosulfan I (60%) and Endosulfan II (40%) as a positive standard were highly active even at 10 Nm.
      <br/>
      These data indicate that this assay system works poorly with 3B, and that the lack of its action is due to its inaccessibility to the GABA receptor site.
      <br/>
      The fact that the cyclodiene resistant London strain showed cross-resistance to 3B supports the above data and rules out GABA receptor as the target or site of action for 3B.

      2. Octopamine receptor/biogenic amine binding site: Biogenic amines are known to carry out a number of physiological functions through their specific receptors in insects.
      <br/>
      The octopamine receptor is the most dominant biogenic amine receptor in insects.
      <br/>
      Certain acaricides, such as chlordimeform, are known to act on octopamine receptors, causing a variety of symptoms, including behavioral changes.
      <br/>
      When 3B was incubated directly with a homogenate of the nerve cord of American cockroaches, a significant increase in cylical AMP (Camp) was found at a dosage of 1  MU M. The chemical octopamine was used as a positive control and induced a significant increase in Camp at 1  MU M. Additional evidence that octopamine is the main site of action of 3B is that in co-treatment of 3B and octopamine, 3B abolished the octopamine-induced increase in cAMP.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      To confirm that 3B is an octopamine receptor toxicant, two important biomarkers were measured: heart beats/30 seconds and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity.
      <br/>
      These two are considered particularly important in identifying octopamine receptor activity as the cockroach heart has been shown to have a high concentration of octopamine receptors.
      <br/>
      When a 200  MU g/insect concentration of 3B was applied to the sternum region of the alive and intact American cockroach, a significant increase was seen in heart beats/30 seconds and this was accompanied with an increase in cAMP.
      <br/>
      As before, higher concentrations of 3B resulted in a decrease in heart beats (Table 7).

      <br/>
      Possible role of �Ca2+ �: Because of the locomotive difficulties noticed among cockroaches treated with 3B at the ventral sternum region, it was postulated that increases in intramuscular levels of Ca2+ could be involved in the contractions of hind legs.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, mammalian cell line PC12 rat chromaffin adrenal cells was used.
      <br/>
      This cell line is known to mimic neuronal cells, particularly catecholaminergic neurons and has been used as a model for Ca2+ induced presynaptic transmitter release phenomena.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1 when 3B was added at 100  MU M to these cells (at A), there was no change in intracellular free Ca2+. �Ca2+ � concentration inside PC12 cells was found using spectrofluorometric measurements with Fura 2/AM (a cell penetrating fluorescence probe for free Ca2+).
      <br/>
      A standard positive control, thapsigargin clearly increased the �Ca2+ �i (at B) even at 500 Nm.
      <br/>
      Also, 10  MU M ionomycin, a Ca2+ -ionophore (at C) produced the expected increase of Ca2+ entry.
      <br/>
      These results showed that 3B shows no ability to regulate any type of calcium homeostasis in mammalian cells.

      Thus, no change was produced in the neurotransmission system of a mammal.
      <br/>
      These data confirm the lack of neurotoxicity of these essential oils in mammals.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      4. Mitochondrial/respiratory poison: Another possible mode of action is that of mitochondrial or respiratory poisoning.
      <br/>
      It has been observed that all mitochondrial poisons induce hyperactivity at some point in their action.
      <br/>
      However, when American cockroaches were treated with a topical application of 3B, no hyperactivity or hyper excitation was observed at any stage of poisoning at all concentrations used.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when American cockroaches were exposed to pre-coated jars with 1 mg of a 60% solution of 3B, the insects showed hyper excitation.
      <br/>
      These data suggest that the mode of entry is a determining factor in the mode of action of these essential oils.
      <br/>
      These observations support the idea that 3B is not a type of poison that attacks the Nag channel as a main target.
      <br/>
      The fact that the Kdr-resistant strain (with a mutated Na+ channel making it insensitive to DDT and pyrethroids) did not show cross-resistance to 3B also supports this diagnosis.
    </p>
    <p num="54">Under the above circumstances, where all of the known major sites of action for insecticides were found to be insensitive to 3B, except the antagonistic effect on the octopamine receptor, the possibility was considered that the mode of action of this group of chemicals is totally novel.</p>
    <p num="55">
      It was noted that the toxicity of 3B varies according to the site of application, at least in the case of the American cockroach.
      <br/>
      Such an observation indicates that 3B is likely to be not so systemic in action, and if one site produces a high toxicity, its target is likely to be located very close to that site of application.
      <br/>
      In view of the locomotive difficulty observed in American cockroaches treated at the central sternum, it was reasoned that the thoracic ganglia could be affected.
      <br/>
      When 3B (250 mg. in 0.4  MU l acetone) was injected into the thorax of an alive cockroach and its hind leg contractions were induced by an external electrical stimulus applied to the outside of the body, the ability of the leg muscles to respond to stimuli totally disappeared within one minute (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      When 3-B was applied to the leg in isolation by directly giving electrical stimuli, no effect of 3B was found (FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      These data suggest that the effect of 3B is on the nervous system and not on the muscles.
      <br/>
      Control tests using acetone (0.4  MU l) without any 3-B showed no effects (FIGS. 4 and 5).
      <br/>
      This possibility was further tested using the 6th abdominal ganglion and studying transmission of signals from the mechanoreceptors of the cerci generated by air puffing.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, the abdominal cavity was opened, exposing the entire abdominal nerve cord.
      <br/>
      A suspension solution of 3B in 200  MU l insect saline was directly applied to the entire abdominal nerve cord.
      <br/>
      The results were drastic, producing complete blockage of transmission at 250-500 PPM within 5 minutes from the time of application (FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      Even at 10 PPM the blocking effect of 3B was apparent, producing visible effects in 15 minutes.
      <br/>
      These results clearly indicate that 3B is a nonsystemic nerve blocker.
    </p>

      A further study was conducted on the cockroach to determine the effect of other chemicals of the present invention on the heart rate of the insects.
      <br/>
      The experiment conditions were as previously described in applying 300  MU g of the respective chemical to the entire abdominal nerve cord.
      <br/>
      Each insect group was comprised of three individuals.
      <br/>
      All heart rates were observed and counts were recorded three times for each individual, i.e., nine counts before introduction of the chemical, and nine counts 30 minutes after application of approximately 300  MU g of chemical.
      <br/>
      The data from these heart beat tests agreed with the previously described "walk-across" test.
      <br/>
      The following chemicals showed measurable change in heart rate thirty (30) minutes after application of the chemical: terpineol, eugenol, phenyl ethyl alcohol, benzyl acetate and benzyl alcohol.

    <p num="57">Also the following mixtures showed measurable change in heart rate: terpineol with eugenol, terpineol with phenyl ethyl alcohol and eugenol with phenyl ethyl alcohol.</p>
    <p num="58">The toxicity of the individual chemicals was also determined by topical application to early 4th instar Asian armyworms (Spodoptera litura) (15-20 mg live wt) and measurement after 24 hours (Table 9).</p>

      In establishing the LD50 dose, it was noted that all larvae treated with pulegone, even at the lowest doses tested, were almost immediately paralyzed.
      <br/>
      However, at lower doses, many or most of these larvae overcame this effect, whereas at higher doses larvae succumbed.
      <br/>
      To determine if the observed sublethal toxicity resulted in any long-term effect, subsequent growth of larvae treated at the three lowest doses (20, 31 and 49  MU g per larvae) was monitored and compared this to growth of control (untreated larvae) at 72 and 100 hours after treatment (Table 10).

      The results indicate that subsequent larval growth of survivors of the highest dose is dramatically retarded.
      <br/>
      More importantly, the effect is also seen (and significantly so) at the two lowest doses, which themselves produced almost no mortality.
      <br/>
      Therefore, exposure to even sublethal doses can have significant consequences for larvae.

      The mixtures were tested by placing ten (10) common fire ants within respective Petri dishes which were then covered.
      <br/>
      The time for irreversible knockdown (KD) to occur (KT) was determined from periodic irregular observations.
      <br/>
      The insects were considered KD when they were on their back, or could be turned onto their back and could not right themselves within at least two (2) minutes.
      <br/>
      KT-50 and KT-90 (time for 50% and 90% KD respectively) were calculated by interpolation of KD between times when data was collected.
      <br/>
      The 10% mixture (Table 12a) had a KT 50% of 5 min. 50 sec. and a KT 90% of 6 min 40 sec.

      For the 7% mixture (Table 12b) KT 50% was 3 min. 40 sec. and KT 90% was 4 min. 40 sec. The 5% mixture (Table 12c) had KT 50% of 2 min. 33 sec. and KT 90% of 3 min. 45 sec.

      The above data are examples which clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the mixture of chemicals over concentrations ranging from 5%-10% by weight of the active ingredients.

      Concentrations as low as 0.1% by weight have also been shown to be effective for some individual chemicals and for various mixtures of chemicals.

      The diluted emulsifiable concentrate 3B formulation shows good efficacy against both ages of armyworms, and even better efficacy against spider mites.

      Also of importance, it was observed that sublethal concentrations clearly deter feeding and therefore plant damage.
